When would an attorney even get involved? As far as anyone knows, Skeeter would have just vanished without a trace and no one would have any idea where she could have gone. As long as Hermione doesn't blab, no one would ever know if she decided to keep her in a terrarium for the rest of her life. Or, as you say, squish her. Or do any number of horrible horrible things!

I bet Skeeter still has nightmares about it.
