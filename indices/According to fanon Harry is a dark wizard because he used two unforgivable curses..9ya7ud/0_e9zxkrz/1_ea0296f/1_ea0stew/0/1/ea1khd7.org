Lol. It's just weird though. Hermione alone does things in the series that far out does her trapping Skeeter in a glass jar for half a day. Her leading Umbridge into a centaur ambush would, realistically, result in Umbridge being maimed, raped and/or killed, and Hermione would know this (they had already been warned, even). But people on this sub always mention the skeeter thing, so I'm wondering if this is like a trope in Hermione bashing stories or something, lol.
