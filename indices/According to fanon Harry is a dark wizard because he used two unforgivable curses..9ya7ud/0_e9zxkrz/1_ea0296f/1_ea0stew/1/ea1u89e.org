It's just that imprisoning journalists triggers my "third world dictator" alarms. Freedom of the press is pretty sacred where I live, even if you decide to make drawings of The Prophet. It's not that Skeeter shouldn't be imprisoned, or that the punishment Hermione gives her isn't deserved. I only feel uneasy because Skeeter is a journalist. An unprofessional, slanderous bitch but a reporter by title!

Not that Skeeter would see her just punishment for her slander in the HP setting. The British magical government is apparently only interested in cauldron bottoms, underage magic users and Sirius Black, which they will pursue with /uncharacteristic ferocity/
