I always took it as Harry getting revenge for the shit the Carrows did to the students over the year. I can also kind of understand McGonagall's inaction and general acceptance of Harry's actions. She'd have been forced to do nothing while the two, along with certain students, tortured and and kidnapped her students, so when she got the chance who knows how she'd react. I mean, Mrs Weasley killed Bellatrix when she nearly killed her daughter. McGonagall meanwhile let Harry torture the women that tortured her students. You can't really defend it , but I can understand why they did it.
