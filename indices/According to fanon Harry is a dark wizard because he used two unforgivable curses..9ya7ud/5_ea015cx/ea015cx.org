According to canon prior to the seventh book too.

I'm not really sure how anyone can justify using torture techniques prohibited by whatever passes for the magical equivalent of the Geneva Convention and (ordinarily) punishable exclusively by spending the rest of your life with demonic entities who force you to relive your worst memories and the pain that comes with them, in retribution for a minor slight.

Nor can I see how anyone could justify using mind control techniques similarly prohibited by the magical equivalent of the Geneva Convention just a few words later---and worse, /fightable/ mind control techniques---for the purpose of picking up wands, which could be accomplished just as easily by stunning them and summoning the wands.

I don't deny that there are dark!Harry fics which make some characters who are main characters in canon 1-dimensional. Nor am I going to delve into the ethics or morality or lack thereof of the Gringotts escapade, or uses of Unforgivables in other situations. But Harry and McGonagall's actions in the scene with Alecto Carrow are indefensible in my opinion.
