Let's look at that scene with Amycus Carrow:

  "It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price."

  And he spat in her face.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, "You shouldn't have done that."

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, "Crucio!"

  The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. "I see what Bellatrix meant," said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, "you need to really mean it."

  "Potter!" whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. "Potter -- you're here! What--? How--?" She struggled to pull herself together. "Potter, that was foolish!"

  "He spat at you," said Harry.

I think Harry /was/ going dark, and was basically free falling from the moment he cast the Imperius curse. That confrontation wasn't about being practical with dark magic or about the "ends justify the means". That was Harry torturing a person because he wanted to hurt them as much as he could. In a way, that contributes to the fanon that using unforgivables makes you dark.
