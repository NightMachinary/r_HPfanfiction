forgot to add

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] this one is an old one and is dark but not edgy more gritty

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729845/1/Adversity-Breeds-Excellence][Adversity Breeds Excellence]] this one harry/fluer/tonks but it is well written and even if the pairing isn't something you enjoy i would recommend it for the magic anyway
