Eh, I first came across that one, long ago, while sifting through unbelievable long list of OP AF Harry and/or Lord so and so Harry and/or time traveling Harry /Fleur fics and it stood out to me due to Fleur being OP for a change. And seeing it -after very long time- updated thought I suggest it. Anyways hope others wont disappoint.
