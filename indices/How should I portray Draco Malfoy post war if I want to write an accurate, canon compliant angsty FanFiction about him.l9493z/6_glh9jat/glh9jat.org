I think at first he is still quite resentful towards the victors because it would be quite soul-crushing to see that after centuries of prestige, the name Malfoy would fall in complete disgrace at the hands of those he was taught to hate. On the other hand he'd have a resentment towards his parents, particularly his father, for destroying the family prestige, for forcing him in the position to become a Death Eater and for not making good on his promise that the Malfoys would be at the top in Voldemort's world. He would mostly keep it in him because he's too proud to acknowledge what a failure Voldemort's campaign was. He also needs his family for moral support when he is hated both by the society for being a former Death Eater and by his former peers for getting off lightly despite Lucius being one of Voldemort's top lieutenants for many years. Gradually this resentment would towards himself and gradually acknowledge that he deserves the ostracization of the society. He would probably have a brief battle with alcoholism or substance abuse. However I'd say he remain quite stoic outwards with occasional snide remarks when someone is particularly mean to him. Not because he is so powerful, but because he is too proud to reveal and even acknowledge to himself his internal conflicts.
