This is an interesting question to be sure.

At the heart of it, I think you should look at his actions in /Deathly Hallows./

He doesn't turn Harry, Ron and Hermione in, even though it's hardly a stretch to say that his attempt to deny who they are isn't convincing.

He knows who they are. His body language and hesitancy to confirm this is still as good as fingering them. But he still doesn't say "This is Harry Potter."

And then in the Battle of the Room of Requirement, Draco only tried to capture. He didn't shoot to kill. And Harry and Ron and Hermione saved his life from the fiendfyre.

You could pull the nightmare angle--have him be haunted by nightmares of fiendfyre and that night in Malfoy Manor. Draco be haunted by the idea that had things been just a little different, Harry would have died and Voldemort would rule.
