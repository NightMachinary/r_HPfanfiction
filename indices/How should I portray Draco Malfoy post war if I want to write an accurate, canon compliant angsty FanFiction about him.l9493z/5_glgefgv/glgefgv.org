Not sure how helpful this will be, but these are some of the things I like to see when I read Draco (Drarry shipper):

His post-war angst should manifest in a completely different way than his other angsty demonstrations throughout the series, and should be written with this in mind. The things he drew confidence in as a child are completely ripped away from him, and with it, a significant loss in confidence. He still walks with a straight back, but speaks when spoken to, and never more than a few sentences, especially in those first few years following the war. He's very much driven by his emotions, but I think after the war he becomes more introspective. I think the key thing to nail with Draco is his relationship with himself, and how it evolves as he navigates this new world where he's at the bottom of barrel. Also lots of existential discussion of morality and nuture vs. nature with Draco-centric fics, and they tend to be so interesting to read!! Like Harry, he has a tendency to obsess, and I think giving him something to focus his post-war anxiety and confusion into is a must. Love a good down-and-out but driven Draco!!

As for his Golden Trio relationship, I think outwardly he's respectfully distant towards them, but is internally very embarrassed whenever he has to be around them. I feel as though neither side has the same level of aggression left towards the other, but this is a pretty boring and mature relationship to write lol so I guess their relationship depends on the direction you want to take the fic!
