I would look at people who grew up in similar ways and how they transformed. Obviously, we don't have any direct corollaries, but you might consider looking at:

- Megan Phelps-Roper (grew up in Westboro Baptist Church and left as an adult)
- Prussian Blue: band name for twin sisters. It's agenda was promoting white nationalism and Neo-Nazism. Their mother created this group when they were just 11 years old and they became pretty well known (in the wrong circles). They stopped touring when they were 14 and renounced their childhood beliefs when they were 19.
- Three of the founders of Life After Hate were heavily involved in hate groups in their teens. Now, they work to keep others from falling down the same path of violence and hate.
- Daryl Davis is a Black man who goes to KKK rallies. He talks a lot about the kinds of people he meets there and the work he does to deradicalize them.

Obviously, you're writing fiction, but you can take inspiration from real life people who have made similar transformations.
