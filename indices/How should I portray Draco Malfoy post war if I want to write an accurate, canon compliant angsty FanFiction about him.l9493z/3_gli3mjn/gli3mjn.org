I think there are three general directions that Draco could develop. The first one is he, having been raised on stories of the 'glory days' under Voldemort, is utterly appalled at being a part of it first hand. Talking about 'putting the mudbloods in their place' is one thing, but actual torture and murder of people that you may have known for years just because of their birth is quite another. Then there is that fact that Voldemort and many of his followers like Bellatrix were sadistic and cruel even to the 'loyal', and the final straw was being forced to murder Dumbledore, a man he respected if not always agreed with, or have his entire family murdered. This is the most sympathetic version, when he goes through the war hating himself for all that he does, but having no choice in the matter. In your fic it could manifest as severe trauma and guilt from the get-go, and also being shunned by many of the former Death Eaters or sympathisers for being 'cowardly' or 'weak' during the war.

The second way is having him have an epiphany afterwards. With Voldemort's defeat, everyone who was singing his praises either changes their tune or goes quiet. Now out of the echo chamber of his parents' social circle and Slytherin house he begins to re-examine everything and does a lot of serious soul searching. In this you can describe the process of him changing his world view, and I like the idea in another comment of researching people recovering from real-life cults.

Finally there is the unrepentant Draco. He genuinely sees nothing wrong with Voldemort's ideology. Just because he was eventually killed didn't invalidate his worldview. In this you have Draco trying to fit in to a world that he doesn't understand, and he may or may not be plotting to resurrect the cause again.
