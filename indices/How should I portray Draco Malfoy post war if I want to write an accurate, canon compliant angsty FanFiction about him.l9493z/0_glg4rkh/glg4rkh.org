Draco is a guy who has been taught since he could walk how a "proper" pureblood of prestige should behave in wizarding society. He should be solemn with a quiet shame to him, but never openly and desperately repentant. Aloof and distant but never rude, especially to the trio. Making strides to become better, but always keeping the Malfoy pride and working to restore his name to good standing.

Draco is not someone who should have an epiphany of inner goodness sprouting out 2 weeks after the war, or come begging for redemption at the feet of the heroes. It's gotta be the work of a lifetime, bit by bit, and 99% of named characters shouldnt even bear witness to it.
