Well yeah, I think post war Draco stories lend themselves to heavy introspection and soul searching style storytelling more so than interactions with a whole lot of people who probably don't want to be around him at all. At best such things could work with former death eater classmates/families and during the high society gatherings he would most certainly still attend.
