Agree with this, should be angry/ashamed/resentful...as opposed to prewar when he was a bully just for the sake of it. I see him ignoring the golden trio and only speaking to them when he has to-but I guess that wouldn't be the most interesting story. I see him grudgingly respect Harry, ignore Hermione, and feel like Ron would be more likely to provoke him...he was always especially vicious to Ron.
