I think there are really two important post-canon points to note: first, that Draco remains affectionate towards his father while also realizing Lucius' faults (a delicate balance to depict in and of itself) and also the fact that he marries a pureblood girl whose family is a member of the Sacred 28, but who doesn't believe in the traditions of blood purity.

So he's a little reformed, but not. Not at the expense of sacrificing the relationships and status he's always had.

As for his relation with the Golden Trio... I don't think he has one, nor should he. He has money and connections that those three could never fathom, he has enough going on that he never has to speak to Harry, Ron, or Hermione until their children's lives overlap if he doesn't want to. And why would he want to?
