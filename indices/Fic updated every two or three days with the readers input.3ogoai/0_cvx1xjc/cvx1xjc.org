Not a fan of this method, to be honest. For you to be able to churn out a chapter every 2-3 days of readable quality would restrict you to an upper limit of 3000 words (unless you're one of those rare writing machine authors). More realistically, 1-2k words.

Now I suppose you could run this as a sort of "Quest" type story that's popular over at SV/SB, but even then, you'd need more time than 2-3 days if you wanted to make it decent. The fact that you need to take into account other people's input in that short amount of time only makes this harder for you, time-wise.
