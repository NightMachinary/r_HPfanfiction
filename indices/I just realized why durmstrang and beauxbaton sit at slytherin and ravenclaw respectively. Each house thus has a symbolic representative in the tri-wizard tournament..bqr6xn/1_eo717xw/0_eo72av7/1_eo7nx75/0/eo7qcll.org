Ah, I had the movie placement in mind so Gryffindor and Slytherin at both ends and Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff in the middle. Since the book placement is different, I would guess the best bet to find it would be in the chapter where Harry enter the Great Hall for the first time, So PS (chapter "The Sorting"), I will check it at the first occasion.
