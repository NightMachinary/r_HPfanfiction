I am a little surprised by their sitting though. Considering how fast some of them were to complain about the cold, you would think they would have preferred to sit at the table nearest to the fire (Gryffindor if I remember well) rather than a middle one.

And as far as I'm concerned, the decision of their teacher could be something really well thought like "neutral, studious house", but also something completely random like "they are the blue house, we are blue, sit there".
