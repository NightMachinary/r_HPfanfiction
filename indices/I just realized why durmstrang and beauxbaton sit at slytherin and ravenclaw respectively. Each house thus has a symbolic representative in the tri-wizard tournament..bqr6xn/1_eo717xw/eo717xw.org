Eh, probably.

Most likely Karkaroff told his students to sit with the Slytherins because they were the "right sort" i.e. purebloods. Even in hiding I highly doubt Karkaroff ever stopped believing the pureblood supremacy crap.

As for Maxime? She most likely told her students to sit with the Ravenclaws because they were the smart house, politically neutral for the most part and the ones most likely to give her students respect and some of them might even know French.
