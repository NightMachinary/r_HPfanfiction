The flying thing is consistent with Hermione's character.

Flying lessons started out as a class, and Hermione is stated to always try for top spot in a class and (at least third year) taking all electives.

How do you do well in a class? Practice. Yet if Hermione was practicing flying, it would have seemed to be something that would have been commented on in the books.

So either:

1) it was just a first year class, that Hermione put her effort into until it ended. Later, she is aware that her skill level is way lower than her two quidditch playing friends. *This seems most compliant*

2a) it is a class and she still tries for top spot. It would be strange that it is never mentioned nor her practicing/homework.

2b) it is a class that she does not excell at. But that too would seem like something that would be commented on in the book, that there is s class Hermione is not on top in

3) it is a class she does not take. Except we knows she takes everything third year and again, strange that Hermione avoiding a particular class would never be brought up.
