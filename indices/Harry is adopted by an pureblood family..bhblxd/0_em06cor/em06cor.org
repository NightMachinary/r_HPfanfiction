All the unique Harry raised by someone else stories:

Linkffn(Luna's Hubby): Harry raised by the Lovegoods. Ravenclaw. A really sweet story.

Linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate): Harry raised by Lockhart. Quite funny. Slytherin.

Linkffn(The Daring Win): Harry raised by Umbridge. (Does she count? She's halfblood but more rich pureblood mentality than the Lovegoods.) Just how did the author manage to make her likeable?

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7): Harry raised by Sirius, but with a few weeks living at Malfoy Manor. Both Draco and Harry in Gryffindor.

Linkffn(Harry McGonagall): Harry raised by the McGonagalls.

Linkffn(Quoth the Raven, Nevermore): Harry raised in the Tower of London under the protection of the Queen.

Linkffn(The Perils of Innocence): Harry raised in a clinic for children with issues and learns to control his magic before going to Hogwarts.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina): Harry raised by the Blacks, including Sirius, Marius and Regulus.

Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them): Harry raised by.... literally nobody. He lives in the forest. He does end up befriending Draco and gets sorted in Slytherin, although he prefers the forbidden forest to the Slytherin dorms.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage): Harry raised by Tony Stark. Comics not MCU.
