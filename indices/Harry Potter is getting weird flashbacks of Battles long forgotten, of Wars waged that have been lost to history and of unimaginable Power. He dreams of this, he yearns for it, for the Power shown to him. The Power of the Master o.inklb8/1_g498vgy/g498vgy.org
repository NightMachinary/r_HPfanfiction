"So, what will you do, /Peverell/? What will you do without your army, without your lieutenants and friends?"

The tall broad-shouldered man seemed to take great pleasure in mocking this Peverell fellow.

"You are surrounded," the man drawled.

Peverell looked up. Sighed. His expression hardened and he pulled out /the Wand/ out of his sleeve. It was the same one every time. Long and very unusual, brownish and radiating power like no other Wand ever could.

The man, though, seemed to not notice the fact that he had just been condemned to Death. He /laughed/.

"You are surrounded, Peverell, drop this charade!" he mocked.

Peverell's expression shifted into a malicious grin.

"All I am surounded by is fear, fear and dead men."

He pointed /the Wand/ to the sky, heavens themselves opening up and lightning torching up the evening sky.

The man who previously mocked Peverell now /stared/ at him with shock and not a small amount of fear.

All around, soldiers were falling like flies, lightning piercing through their magical and non-magical shields alike as if they did not exist, loud screams getting more numerous.

Peverell seemed to revel in all the chaos, all the destruction, all the /Death/. His expression was soft, loving even as he commanded devastating amounts of destructive magic as a conductor would their orchestra.

"HARRY!" a shrill, panicked voice penetrated his dream. Or was it a vision?

Harry groaned and sat up, still in a daze after the dream, and looked under his pillow.

The Wand of Destiny was indeed still there. Safe.
