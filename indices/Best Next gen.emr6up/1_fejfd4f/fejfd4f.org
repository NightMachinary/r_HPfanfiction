I love the TeaTime series by frombluetored, three stories, the last is a WIP. Set after CC, canon couples, lots of great OC's, although it does feature Scorbus, nothing graphic with them. And FloreatCastellum is currently posting a JSP centric story, Wood from the Trees. Both great writers in the Hinny fandom
