I doubt it. Voldemort doesn't actually care much about blood status, he just claims to so the purebloods will remain loyal to him. He /does/, genuinely, find Muggles despicable, but then, he finds /most/ people despicable anyway, so Muggles are only slightly worse. The rest is posing, plain and simple. At the end of the day, Voldemort would probably keep the Potion's existence a secret, keeping it around just in case but not letting on to the Death Eaters, because he'd rather not have a higher magical population who'd stand a better chance at overthrowing him.
