In my opinion he most certainly would not. Voldemort sees himself as "special" and better than other people. He hates everyone, really, even most of his followers. He only seized on the pureblood prejudice because those are the people who have money and power in the wizarding world. I don't know if he even hates muggles so much as he likes killing people, and muggles are easy to kill. He wouldn't want to give more people magic, because he likes being on top, he likes having people to terrorize.
