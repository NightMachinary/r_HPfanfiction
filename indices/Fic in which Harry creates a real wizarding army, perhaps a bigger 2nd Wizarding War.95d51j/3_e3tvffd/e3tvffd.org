Was just thinking about a similar idea - would love to read a fic where Harry, perhaps following Dumbledore's lead, creates a sort of army but more like just a force or movement in Hogwarts. Meaning the students, teachers, ghosts, etc, all come together. Some become soldiers, some become more civilian but all do what they can. Maybe in this scenario, Hogwarts is under siege in some way, Voldemort out in the open.
