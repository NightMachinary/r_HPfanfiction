  Nora x Mary Louise fic (Noralise). I got the idea of how Mare and Nora came to meet, and how Nora became a part of the Heretic family. This will be a three-part story focused on Nora's growth from siphoner, to vampire, to lover. Plus, a little help from family goes a long way. ;) First fic in this fandom, thank you for having me! Please read and review.
