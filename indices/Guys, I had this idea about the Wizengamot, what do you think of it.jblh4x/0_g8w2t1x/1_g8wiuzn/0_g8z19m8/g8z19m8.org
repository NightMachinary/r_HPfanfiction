That's mostly right, though I would argue that the Ministerial decrees come off as more executive actions that legislative. Edicts issued directly by the Minister, not written, debated and voted on by a legislature.

Arthur and Umbridge apparently both had a role in writing legislation (Umbridge was behind anti-werewolf legislation that made it hard for Lupin to get a job). Whether that meant drafting legislation for the Minister's approval, or to be voted on by a legislature, is unclear.
