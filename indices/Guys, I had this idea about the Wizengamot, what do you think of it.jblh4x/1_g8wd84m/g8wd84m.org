I don't really see how this system would work. I mean, who exactly is going to evaluate a wizard's "power", and on what basis? Magical skill, money, political clout, or something else entirely? Who sets the criteria in the first place?

Furthermore, what's stopping several powerful wizards with a dozen votes each from simply giving themselves more votes and preventing all others from having any say in how the government is run?

That said, if I had to suggest an alternative, I'd look into the idea of "vassal houses" - e.g., it's a somewhat common idea in fanfiction that the Crabbes and the Goyles are "sworn" to the Malfoys. So you could have it like this: every noble House gets one vote, but the Crabbes and the Goyles are always going to vote the same way the Malfoys do, effectively giving Lucius 3 votes instead of 1.

It's still a system based on "power" - since a powerful family is more likely to attract followers - but not directly so.

(Also, note that of Dumbledore's titles, only Chief Warlock is Wizengamot-related. Supreme Mugwump is the name of the head of ICW, and Grand Sorcerer is likely just a title for an extremely accomplished wizard - sort of a magical DSc)
