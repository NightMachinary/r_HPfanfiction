Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls) is a great fic that deals with Voldemort's immortality in an interesting, not quite horcrux way. It's also primarily gen with a really well done Snape and Harry mentorship. However, it is a sequel to a 6th year fic, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within) and you kind of need to read that first.
