[[https://dracotrilogy.livejournal.com/][The Draco Trilogy]] is a very famous series written pre-OotP (so the prophecy is not a thing not to mention Horcruxes) with a very unique take on defeating Voldemort. It does have a pretty heavy focus on romance, with a Dramione/Harmony love triangle but it's not just a romance fic and it's still very plot-centric.
