Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt). It's actually about the physical house, not the usual one talked about in fics (I forgot what to call it). There is slight Dumbledore bashing, but only Dumbledore and it doesn't really impact the story.

Edit: I forgot, it does mention horcruxes, but that's not how Harry beats Voldy.
