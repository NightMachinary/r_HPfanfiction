Barty was very talented. If after all that time Imperiused, he could still outfight Moody, throw off the curse, confund the goblet in the first place and flawlessly imitate a powerful and highly trained Auror with what seemed like very little effort. I'm pretty sure he could have easily outdone any student. Even as a student himself he got more OWLs than Hermione.
