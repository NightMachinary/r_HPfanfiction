Would Crouch ergo Harry be chosen over hogwarts students? Not certain, he has been kept under the imperius for a decade. And who knows what exact criteria the Goblet is looking for. For all we know it's actually just a random number generator. If the Goblet can only choose 1 student out of a pool of 1 student then the odds of Harry/Crouch being chosen are certainly a lot higher. Even if Crouch could be reasonably certain that Harry would get chosen from the hogwarts list, hes still going to make the odds as close to 100% as he can.
