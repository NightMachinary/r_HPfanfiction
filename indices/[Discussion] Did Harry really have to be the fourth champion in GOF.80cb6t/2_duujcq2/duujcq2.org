If I'm reading this right, your saying that since Crouch is more powerful than any Hogwarts student who entered their name, the goblet would select his entry as the best for Hogwarts, and since his entry has Harry's name on it, that would mean Harry's name comes out of the goblet.

I can't recall if this is backed up by canon, but I think the goblet judged Harry's entry by Harry's level of power, not the person who entered him because Harry /did write his name on his entry/, not Crouch. Crouch ripped Harry's name from a piece of homework Harry handed in during DADA. I think that's how the Goblet establishes the much maligned 'binding magical contract', because Harry did technically sign his name. The method by which the name gets into the goblet wouldn't effect the goblet's judgement of the entrant. I'm not sure what would have happened if Crouch had written Harry's name.

Because of all this, Harry would be judged less worthy than Cedric (and others), so Crouch needs to create the fourth school.
