That's a good point. For now, I guess as long as it's clear that Jacob's siblng through explicit statement or context, it'll work out. Their role could be filled by OCs, and would have been, but I think that using the gives some different subplot/depth opportunities. I am curious to see what the fandom name is going to be, though.
