Certain beasts exhibit being-level intelligence. I believe there are certain factors one needs to consider when determining which side of the line they fall under, first of which do they have a societal structure. Werewolves are only beastly on full moons, so they fall under beings I believe. Giants are beings because they have society, etc, albeit more primitive. Dragons, thunderbirds, and phoenixes are beasts because despite their intelligence, they behave as other animals do in a fashion, though as with most animals they can be trained or domesticated.
