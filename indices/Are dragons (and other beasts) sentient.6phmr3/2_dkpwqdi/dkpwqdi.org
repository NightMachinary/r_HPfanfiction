Well, there are two categories, beings and beasts. Currently, muggles, squibs, witches and wizards, giants, werewolves when not full moon, hags, vampires, dwarves, goblins, veela, pukwudgies, curupiro, yambo, ogre, house elves, and half breeds are Beings. Acromantulas and manticores and sphinx are beasts, because of their violent tendencies.

Centaurs, Merpeople, and Leprechauns refused Being status because they didn't want equality with hags and ogres. So they are beasts, by choice. Snobs.

Interestingly, poltergeist are not spirits, which ghosts and zombies are, but non-beings, same class as dementors and boggarts
