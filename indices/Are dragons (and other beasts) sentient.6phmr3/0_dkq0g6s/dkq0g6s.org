In my headcanon, no. I've read stories where dragons are sentient, but to me they're apex predators turned up to 11. I'd compare them to crocodiles. 10 tonne, 30-40+ foot long crocodiles with wings, the ability to breathe fire and a nastier attitude. Where crocodiles can go long periods without food because they're cold blooded, the dragons fire means they burn a lot more energy, so have to hunt much more often.

Most other named XXXXX creatures are deadly simply by being existing in your general vicinity (basilisks can kill with a glance, nundus have toxic breath, dementors weaken any ability to fight with their presence), or have high levels of intelligence (manticore) so are incredibly lethal to people. Dragons are in the same category by being vicious, highly effective killers
