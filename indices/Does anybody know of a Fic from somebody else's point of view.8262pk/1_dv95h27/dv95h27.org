[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur. The title is self explanatory, but I'll give a basic run down. This story starts right after Dudley said good bye to Harry and the Dursleys left Surrey. Everything about what happen during the war is from Dudley's perspective. He grows to be a character that I genuinely like. There is one major OC in the story, but that's the inevitable since this story is about Dudley. Overall, it is an excellent read. linkffn(11769405) Status: Complete

The last two also takes place during the Deathly Hallows, but are from Percy's perspective. In both stories Percy essentially does a sort of espionage type of work after he discovered how much Voldemort had taken over. However, the two fics are different versions of that prompt. I love both the stories anyways.
