linkao3(936052) The Spell Journal by copperbadge. The trio finds Sirius's spell journal while sorting his things -- it's a book of every spell they've ever tried at Hogwarts. The one that catches Harry's interest is a divination spell done at Halloween during their 7th year. The instructions are all there in the book and he convinces Hermione, Ron and Ginny to give it a try.
