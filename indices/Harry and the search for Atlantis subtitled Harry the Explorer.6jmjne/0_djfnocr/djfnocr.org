It's a one-shot, rather than the big long multi-chapter epic you seem to be looking for, but it might whet your appetite for more. For how short it is, there's a lot of good stuff going on here: adventure, romance, whimsy/humor, and some slight family angst. I don't know how you feel about Harry/Luna pairings, but if you like them, this is pretty sweet.
