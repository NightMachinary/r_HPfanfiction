I cant repeat it exactly but this is it.

The golden trio walks In to the common room looking glum.

Fred and George walk to them

Fred: What's gotchu so sad Hermione, Harry, Ronnikinns

Trio: Trelawney

George: Ah that old bat, she predict one of yours deaths

Trio looks around, Harry then answers

Harry: Me

Fred: Well don't worry about it, she predicted my death, two years ago, and as you can see I'm still here

George: Yeah, that Bitch
