I imagine this as sort of a cross between Heathers and John Tucker Must Die. Even so, there are two interesting ways to take that idea. Are they devout students wanting to kill him to get a better teacher? Or are they fangirls crushing madly on what they see as a broody, byronic man who ignores and belittles them at every turn?

I can see both being fun. And I really love the idea of Snape having a bunch of students sighing in his wake. :D

Ravenclaws - "He didn't even mark me down for misspelling cauldron! Does he not care? Can he not spell?"

Lovers - "Condolences about Lily? Who the hell is Lily?!?!"
