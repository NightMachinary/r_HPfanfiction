I would recommend Too young to die. Harry is a ruthless motherfucker who will do absolutely everything to achieve his goal. It has some Potters!bashing, but (i am saying it as a hater of any kind of bashing in fics) it is bearable and has a decent explanation. Oh, and there is hardly any voldemort. linkffn(too young to die)
