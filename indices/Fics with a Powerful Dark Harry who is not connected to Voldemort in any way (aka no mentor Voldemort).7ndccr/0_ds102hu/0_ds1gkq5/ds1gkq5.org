Too many to name, but basically every one of them he turns dark because of some sort of Voldemort influence. Either his scar horcrux takes over, or Voldemort mentors him, or he falls in love with Bella or a Fem!voldemort or something, or similar such fics. I was wondering if there were any fics where he went dark purely on his own for some reason basically.
