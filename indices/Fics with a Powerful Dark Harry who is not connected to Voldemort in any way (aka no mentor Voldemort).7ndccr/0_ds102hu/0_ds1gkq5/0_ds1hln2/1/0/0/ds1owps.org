I don't really disagree with any of those points actually. Your take is solid.

The only thing I would say is different in how I view things is that Dark Harry having a worthwhile goal is a bit vague. Worthwhile to who? To him? To the reader? You imply readers but at the same time, all readers are different. I agree that he shouldn't just be dark for darks sake, but the goal could be as simple as power over all things, or as complex as reshaping the wizarding world, its politics, and its views, building a power base with him at its head, and revitalizing houses he heads with the help of several strong women.

At the end of the day dark for me, while it can have many complex layers, can be distilled down to simply a Harry who is willing to do anything and everything, no matter how horrible it may be, in whatever quest he sets himself on.
