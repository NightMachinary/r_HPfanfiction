Yea I have read Sum of Their Parts, as it does seem to be recommended a lot. Also, read Ruthless.

I also JUST read contractual Invalidation a few weeks ago, and while I enjoyed it, its not quite what I was looking for.

As for Emperor, I have read it and agree with you that its one of the more impressive Harry based characters out there. I don't really know if I would call it "dark" simply because its so AU that it does not have quite the same meaning.

Reunion and Gothic are new to me though. I'll check them out. Thanks.
