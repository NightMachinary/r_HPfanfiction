I would recommend "The Sum of Their Parts", but I'm sure you already read that one.

I think he is quite mean and manipulative in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407). Maybe not evil, but he definitely didn't shy away from killing anymore.

The ending of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116), definitely throws a curveball, making him wonder his actual intention. Brennus is supposed to write a sequel that sheds more light on this Harry's true nature.

This is a time travel, but Harry and his girls are all prolific killers in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), is one great dark!Harry fic.

--------------

Finally, I need to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), again. This Harry is politically, strategically, and magically on a complete different level than canon Harry, and he could be one mean SOB.
