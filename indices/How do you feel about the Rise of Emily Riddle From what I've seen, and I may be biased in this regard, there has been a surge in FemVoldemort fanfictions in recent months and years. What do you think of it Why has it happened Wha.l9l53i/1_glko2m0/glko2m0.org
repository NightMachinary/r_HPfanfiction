In My mind, It sorta gives a reason to keep Emily Sane. I mean Canon Voldemort was basically nothing but a raging psychopath with very little cunning. Unless we look at Tom, it is hard to imagine Voldemort as ever being more than a brute. I like to think that thats due to him focusing on power more than anything else. Emily on the other hand would be needing her cunning to be anything in a male dominated world(Wizarding World/Not Magical). I mean at the time the muggle world was a place where women were seen not heard. And Canon wise. So was the Magical world. Aside from Umbridge and Bella. There were not many women to be of note. Narcissa was more or less a Damsel-in-Distress than a strong women. So I figure Purebloods thought women were meant to be supporting their husbands. Not themselves. So a Female Voldemort, Could not afford to sacrifice her cunning without losing her base. Unlike her male counterpart, who could and did rule through sheer brute force.
