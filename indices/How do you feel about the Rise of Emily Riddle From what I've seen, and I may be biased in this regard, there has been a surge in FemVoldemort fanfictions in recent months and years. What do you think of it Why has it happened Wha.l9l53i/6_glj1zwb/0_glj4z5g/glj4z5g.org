I never read a story of fem!Voldemort but I imagine her as either a manipulative femme fatale, as fairy tale evil witch or as visionary warrior who jump together in battle with her Death Eaters, kind of like Joan of Arc... none seem worse than Umbridge who is a politician through and through and everybody hates politicians.
