Random name. In LdS, I explained it as Merope dying sooner and not having time to insist upon a name, or caring much as it wasn't a boy. So one of the matrons at the orphanage, who was reading Bronte at the time, named her Emily. Her middle name, Mary, comes from them assuming the dying woman was struggling to say that rather than 'Merope' but they figured out Riddle. So Emily Mary Riddle.

The explanation was cut from the actual story as is was 1500 words of clunky filler that didn't fit anywhere. If anything I'd add it as a prologue now but I still don't think it fits.

As for others using it, I guess it caught on from there. Emily had the same 'feel' as Tom to me, although name rating wise it's not quite as common of a name. But I wanted something that felt similar enough. She was almost a Mary, Jane, and a Chloe. But Emily ended up winning.
