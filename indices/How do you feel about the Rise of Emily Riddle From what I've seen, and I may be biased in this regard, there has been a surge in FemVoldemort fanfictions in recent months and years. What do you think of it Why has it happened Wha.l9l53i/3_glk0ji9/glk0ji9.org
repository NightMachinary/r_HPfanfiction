I'm in favor of anything that makes Voldemort a more interesting (and less cartoonish) villain and while making Voldemort female doesn't inherently do that from what I've read in Limpieza De Sangre and Ashes of Chaos, the Voldemort in those fics are more interesting than in canon.

I also like having a few more female characters who are plot important, canon doesn't have all that many.
