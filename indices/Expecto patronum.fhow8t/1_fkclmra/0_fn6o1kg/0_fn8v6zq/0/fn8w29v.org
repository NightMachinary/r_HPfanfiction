It's canon. He used his patronus to summon Hagrid after Krum was stunned, granted they only said ghostly bird in that line. (JKR said she reference it as a bird since phoenix is the only bird Dumbledore was ever associated with) And I'm pretty sure Ron and Harry also mention it in the deathly hallows. But it's also on Pottermore.
