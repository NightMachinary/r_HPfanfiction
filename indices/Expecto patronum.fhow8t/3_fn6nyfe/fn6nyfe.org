I'm personally against Lavender's being a rabbit because Luna's is. Technically Tonk's patronus was a hare as well before she fell in love with lupin and it changed. Not sure what would fit Lavender best though, maybe a butterfly, dolphin, or some kind of small wildcat? Depends on how you're portraying her
