  The only way Harry can get free of those who wish to use him is to agree to an already made betrothal contract created by Dorea Black-Potter. Will this simple thing change the course of Harry's predestined - at least by Dumbledore - future? Will he remain neutral or will he turn dark after he learns everything Dumbledore's done? Will there be a wedding in future for Rabastan and Harry? Can they have a chance of happiness or will the two Slytherins by nature at least, only presume to use one another?
