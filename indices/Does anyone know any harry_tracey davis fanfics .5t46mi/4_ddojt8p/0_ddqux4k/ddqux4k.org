True, though each Slytherin girl, while essentially a blank slate, has had a somewhat general character built up around them. This is especially true for Daphne, because a lot of Harry/Daphne fics, especially older ones, have Daphne filling an "Ice Queen" archetype, though there are a fair number of fics that portray Slytherin girls completely differently. The other blank slate Slytherins, Astoria and Tracey, have some common faan personalities, but not as many as "Ice Queen" Daphne, so people sometimes request Harry with a different Slytherin girl in hopes of getting something other than the more common Daphne characterizations. A somewhat common personality I've seen is for Tracey to be a more bubbly, outgoing character in comparison to Daphne.
