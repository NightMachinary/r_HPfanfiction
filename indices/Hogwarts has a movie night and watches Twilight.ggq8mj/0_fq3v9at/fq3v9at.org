Imagine if it was like A Dramatic Reading linkffn(12324284)

Someone finds a DVD player and the DVD box set of Twilight. EVERYBODY keeps staring at Cedric (Cedric and Edward have the same actor) during the whole thing. The Weasley Twins invent a spell that coats him in glitter. He had beans on toast for breakfast and happened to fart, creating a cloud of glitter behind him.

Cedric is now known as Sparklefarts the Broody Vampire. Harry's (and Snape's) patronus attacks Cedric on sight now.
