Yes, AR definitely does /not/ look age-appropriate, even in the earliest films. His portrayal is masterful, but his age does kind of get in the way for me . . . wish they could have turned back the clock on him a little. If we could have seen a mid-thirties AR in the part, I think that it would have given the character an entirely different flavor . . .
