Harry and Luna in the forest with the thestrals is a really sweet scene. In the book he's just kind of confused by her, the movies did it much better.

I agree with you about the Draco throwing his wand to Harry thing, it would have been awesome if they left it in, but it works as you put it.

Also, Moody's appearance and accent in the movie is awesome, a lot of the casting I picture differently, but Moody is just /awesome/.
