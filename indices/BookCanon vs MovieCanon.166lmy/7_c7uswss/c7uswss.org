[film] Time Turners allowing the person to watch the past roll back. Also, that they don't take the Turning person back to where they were, as if to choose a different path.

[book] Polyjuice changes the voice as well, and isn't limited to an hour- that's just the average for a competently-made batch.

[film] Harry and Voldemort having an actual duel at the end of Deathly Hallows. This isn't really relevant for fanfiction, as most stories rewrite the end, but if someone's writing a post-series story, I prefer the meaningful duel. Also, Harry snapping the Elder wand.

[film] Ron and Hermione's relationship. Credit to Rupert Grint and the related directorial choices- Ron's a better friend to Harry and a more plausible companion for Hermione in the movies than the books. I particularly love the banter between Ron and Hermione during Prisoner of Azkaban.

[film] Hedwig dies taking a Killing Curse for Harry while in flight- not trapped in his cage.

[book] Snape has no direct involvement with Halloween 1981. None.
