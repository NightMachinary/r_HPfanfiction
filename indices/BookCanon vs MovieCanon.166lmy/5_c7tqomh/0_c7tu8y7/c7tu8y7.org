Funny, because I don't think about uniforms at all, just the robes and perhaps the scarves for outerwear. I went to a private prep school (ugh-good education, bad company) that did /not/ have uniforms, just a dress code (button up shirts and belts for guys, skirts a certain length for girls).

I tend to imagine that the students are dressed in their own clothes (though perhaps there is a uniform option that isn't required) under the robes, and that they are only required to wear the robes during regular class-hours, breakfast + classtime, but not on weekends. I have trouble thinking of the students roaming around and sitting in the grounds in all weather in what I picture as "academic" robes.

Heh. Thanks for bring up a detail I never considered.

Didn't the movies suddenly shift during PoA? I remember being surprised at Hermione's clothing, especially during the Slap Malfoy scene.
