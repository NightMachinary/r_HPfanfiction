  I tend to imagine that the students are dressed in their own clothes (though perhaps there is a uniform option that isn't required) under the robes, and that they are only required to wear the robes during regular class-hours, breakfast + classtime, but not on weekends. I have trouble thinking of the students roaming around and sitting in the grounds in all weather in what I picture as "academic" robes.

Same! Considering it's a bunch of teenagers, making them to stay in uniform every day would be impossible anyway.

  Didn't the movies suddenly shift during PoA? I remember being surprised at Hermione's clothing, especially during the Slap Malfoy scene.

The directors changed. They changed again the next year, and then finally settled on David Yates for OotP through DH2.

Each director had a different vision of how things should be, although most seem to have built on the image created by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. (PoA)
