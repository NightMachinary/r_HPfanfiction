Clothing. Specifically, Hogwarts uniforms. All I can picture is their prep school attire: with the grey jumpers, the black slacks/skirts, the colored House ties, and the light black outer robe that opens up. It's nice because virtually zero fics employ anything different.

How many times have I come across a sex scene where one character uses a House tie to bind another character's hands?

Answer: Thousands.
