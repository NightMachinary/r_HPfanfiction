Generally, I rate characters by experience/exposure to magic, intelligence, sanity and imagination.

That said, there is no accurate power scale you can actually use since it's a series about a teenager managing to gank the biggest & baddest villain in that 'verse's history and features six teenagers taking on a dozen of said big bad's finest foot soldiers without incurring a single fatality. That's not even taking into account the number of times the protagonist kills and/or escapes from monsters that are so good at what they do they regularly supplant wizards as the pinnacle of the magical food chain.

Yet he's still a teen and evidence suggests he's not alone in his monster murder capabilities.

Magic in that 'verse is about imagination. It's imagining something, wanting it and translating that from will to power. Power scaling relies on nothing more than seeing how easy/hard it is for the character to go from imagining something happening to making said something happen. The older, more intelligent, knowledgeable and imaginative the character, the easier it will be for them.

Voldemort was at the top because he was a genius that didn't let minor concerns such as fear for his own sanity get in the way of making what he wanted real.

The trio 20 years after the Final Battle will be much the same-Hermione's knowledge, Ron's early exposure to magic and Harry's imagination would make those three something truly powerful in the magical world. Hell, by that stage they would be able to take down a Dark Lord without having to break a sweat. Same thing with the other students too-imagination coupled with intelligence & capability equals massive power.
