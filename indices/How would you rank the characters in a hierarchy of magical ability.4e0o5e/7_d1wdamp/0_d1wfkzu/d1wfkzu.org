I'm not sure Voldemort counts as the same generation as Dumbledore and Grindelwald. He was born, what, 45 years later?

Either way, is there a particular reason you think the Founders are above Dumbledore and Grindelwald? I've always imagined that Dumbledore would stomp any of the Founders in a duel, for the advances in magic that have been made since their time if nothing else. Wizards born later in time have a significant advantage over those born earlier.

Even relative to their own time, however, the Founders seem to be held in similar regard to Dumbledore is in his own time.
