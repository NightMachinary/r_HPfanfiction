I don't think I put grindelwald, voldemort, or dumbledore in the first tier category. That's 3 prodigies in a generation. Where would that leave the Founders? Like, Rowena Ravenclaw enchanted shit inside of Hogwarts that are still around 1000 years later. Perhaps a tier 0, for the historically awesome wizards and witches (perhaps non-pottermore Merlin would be in there as well)
