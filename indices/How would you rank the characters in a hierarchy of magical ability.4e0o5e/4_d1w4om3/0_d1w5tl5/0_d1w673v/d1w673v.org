Fred and George's performance seems to be a lack of care about assessments rather than a lack of knowledge. Everything we know about magic in canon points towards knowledge having a direct impact on practical spellwork: Hermione is always able to cast spells before Harry, and cast more advanced spells, because of her deeper study of magical theory. Dumbledore and Tom Riddle are mentioned as being great wizards and great students in the same breath.

It therefore seems quite difficult to be a talented witch or wizard without studying in one form or another. Fred and George do, in fact, do a lot of study: they're always doing experiments, and they must have to do a significant amount of magical research to create the things they do. It's simply that they don't care about exams.
