As much as I dislike it when a fanfic worships Snape, like "omg Snape is the best potions master in the world", I have to admit that a 15 year old making corrections in a textbook and creating spells is behavior that tends to be seen in Super!Character fics.. and it's canon. If it wasn't for the unkempt greasy appearance, overall terrible irrational attitude, and creepy obsession with a girl from his teenaged years he wouldn't be a particularly balanced character.
