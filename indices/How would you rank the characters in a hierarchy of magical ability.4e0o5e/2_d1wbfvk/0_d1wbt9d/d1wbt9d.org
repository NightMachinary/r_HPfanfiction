Yeah, he's definitely "up there" in terms of magical ability is concerned. I wouldn't quite call him "super" though - he's not exactly in the same tier as Voldemort and Dumbledore. See, for example, that Snape and McGonagall were more or less evenly matched in a duel, whereas Voldemort duelled McGonagall, Slughorn and Kingsley simultaneously and was easily winning.
