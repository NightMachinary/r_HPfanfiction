Please note that I did not respond to Snape correcting his particular textbook but to a generalization about /any/ /student/ correcting /any/ /textbook/. Snape and his book are a special case you cannot generalise from.

Wizarding textbooks are like Texas textbooks. They are not chosen for their quality but for their promotion of a particular political or religious agenda.
