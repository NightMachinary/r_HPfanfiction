I would disagree there. These textbooks never tell the whole story. They present the concepts they teach in an abbreviated and simplified way. And clever student who read ahead can "improve" them. Though, whether those "improvements" are fit for the purpose and not just a pile of additional data that overwhelms anyone without an easy grasp on the presented concepts and ends up making things harder remains to be seen.
