With respect to James, we know he got straight Os without putting in any work (OotP memory), we know he became an animagus by his fifth year, an obscure and advanced piece of magic, and we know he created the Marauder's Map, a unique and advanced magical artefact, with the help of Sirius and Remus.

In contrast, we aren't aware of any particular magical accomplishments Lily may have made, other than her pre-Hogwarts controlled magic. All we have on her are generic descriptions and implications about her being intelligent and hard working. But the details are all absent.
