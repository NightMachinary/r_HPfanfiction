The marauders are hard to judge individually (apart from Peter), as their most creative and outstanding achievement is the creation of the Marauders Map, an item which is absolutely unique in canon (which is probably why no one came up with a spell to hide themselves from it).

We don't know who out of James, Sirius or Remus contributed most to it. All three of them easily fit into tier 3, but it's the creation of the map that puts them above it.
