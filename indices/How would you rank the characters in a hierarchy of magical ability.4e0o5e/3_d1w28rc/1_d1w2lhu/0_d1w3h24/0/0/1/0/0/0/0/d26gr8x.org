You are sooo off base here. She has no time to do all the Pottermore stuff? Is that really your reasoning for why it's not written by her? Where's this evidence that it's done by other people? You really think a writer, especially someone like JK who's universe is only getting bigger with the Fantastic Beasts movies coming out and has had years of world building is going to ALLOW any material about the world to be written by anyone else? Really?

I mean I've seen canon deniers before but to go so far as to say that the stuff isn't even written by her is insane.
