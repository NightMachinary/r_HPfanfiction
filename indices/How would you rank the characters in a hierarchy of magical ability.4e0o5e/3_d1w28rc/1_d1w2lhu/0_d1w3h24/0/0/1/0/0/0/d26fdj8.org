This isn't conspiracy bullshit. She literally doesn't have time to do all the Pottermore stuff, so a lot of it is written by other people, and then she presumably signs off on it. I still don't consider it entirely canon, though. For me, canon is the seven books, plus Fantastic Beasts, Quidditch Through The Ages, and Beedle.
