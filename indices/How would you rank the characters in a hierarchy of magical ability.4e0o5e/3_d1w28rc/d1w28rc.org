Lily Potter was amazing at Potions, not only chosen to be a member of the Slug Club, but good enough that when Harry copied Snape's book, Slughorn just thought Harry had inherited Lily's abilities. Lupin, who was the cleverest of his own group, called her out as a 'singularly gifted witch'.

I don't recall James ever being called out as genuinely brilliant---just all around clever, good at Quidditch, etc.
