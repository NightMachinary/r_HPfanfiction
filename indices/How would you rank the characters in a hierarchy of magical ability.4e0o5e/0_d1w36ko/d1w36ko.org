I'd agree with essentially your entire demarcations.

Except, I'm not sure Harry fits easily into a category. He is very good at Defense Against the Dark Arts type magic, and only competent in pretty much the rest of the Hogwarts curriculum, which would put him in the Skilled Specialists as you say. Except he also seems to display an instinctual grasp of really weird shit, the kind of stuff Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald were good at, just without the dedication to actually expand his knowledge to such levels. I'd probably put him in his own category of "Strange as all Hell." Not better than the people you have above him, not as good as the people you have above him, but not necessarily worse. Just on a different kind of scale, either orthogonal or parallel to the one here.
