Harry has a far better understanding of concepts such as the soul or the Deathly Hallows than Voldemort.

Just reread the final duel between Harry and Voldemort. Harry explains all those deep magical concepts to Voldemort which Voldemort fails to understand and which leads to his second and final downfall.

Voldemort is messing with things he does not comprehend. Voldemort is capable of some very powerful dark magic. However, his view of magic is very simplicistic. It all comes down to what he tells Harry in the first book: "There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it." That's why Voldemort fails.
