As [[/u/SchroedingersKneazle]] and [[/u/xljj42]] said, there is the Patronus, his understanding of the soul and the Deathly Hallows. There is also wand lore which is weird as all hell (which includes not only how Harry was actually master of the Elder Wand, but also the brother wand effect during the graveyard), the whole time travel "Past me saw future me cast it, so when present me became future me future/present me could cast it because past me saw it happen already," the whole sacrificial love thing and of course the magic inherent in certain acts.
