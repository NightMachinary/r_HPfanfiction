I wonder where Fred and George fit into this. It's mentioned that they were pretty weak academically, but at the same time, they do some really outstanding stuff for Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Especially in Charms, they would end up in the "pioneers" tier, and I imagine that they'd need some very good knowledge of Potions and Transfiguration as well. I imagine that they focused exclusively on these practical subjects, completely neglecting subjects such as Astronomy, Herbology or History of Magic.
