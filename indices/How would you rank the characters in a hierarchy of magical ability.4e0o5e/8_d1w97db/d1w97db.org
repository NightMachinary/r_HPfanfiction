I use two rankings: Competent and incompetent. But that's because my personal philosophy is that magic is chaos bound to a personal order and those who can assert great control over it are then touched by that chaos themselves, resulting in eccentricities such as Albus's. The incompetent are unable to effect great control, leading to people like Fudge.

Most stories that have rankings are, sadly, just wank. They show Harry as a prodigal super sorceror with Dumbledore binding his powers to hold him back while stealing all his gold and trying to keep the glory of killing Riddle for himself.

And the thing is, Rankings can be interesting. What makes one Magical a mage while another is just a wizard? Why is x a sorcerer while y is a magician?
