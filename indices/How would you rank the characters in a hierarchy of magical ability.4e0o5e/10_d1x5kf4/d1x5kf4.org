personally, I would not use your tier system. I would rank them much like Naruto and Smogon does.

In case you are unaware, in Smogon each pokemon in Uber, Ou, and NU is ranked S,A,B,C,or D. Each shinobi in the Naruto World is ranked the same upon entry into the international Bingo Book. S is the highest. They are the to quote a Kishimoto interview, "Army slayers"\\
S-class -Dumbledore, Grindlewald, Voldemort Snape* Bella* Flitwick* Mcgonagall*

A-class wizards would be those who are able to survive an S class wizard for around 3-10 minutes one on one. I would place Harry*, Marauders, Hermione into this area. These characters excel in one or two specific areas and with study can perform magic in the other fields. Harry fits here due to his physical capabilities, his DADA, and his understanding of obscure magics. Also of note is that while Hermione is extremely knowledgeable about spell theory, she was also one of the only ones injured when in the DoM. Harry was not. She also spent a lot of time studying.

B class. I would place those wizards who are capable enough with magic to be a threat to most people. These are your standard death-eater, your standard witch or wizard. They can cast most of the Hogwarts Curriculum, are capable of learning unique spells but unable to create their own.

C-class. These are the witches and wizards who are poor at most all magics. These are your Crabbe and Goyles, Umbridges. From a pure magic perspective, these are barely worth the wand they carry.

D-class. Non-magicals

it is important to note. that in a situation of extreme opportunity to quote Naruto fanon "even a genin can kill a kage" This means that it is entirely possible for a C-class wizard or witch to kill an S-class. all it takes are being in right place at the right time, and doing the right thing at that moment.

- I placed these here because the ranking system is not equal. Just because two people are S-class does not mean that they are equal in any form. it is the same in Smogon. All those in the Uber tier are gifted the label S-class pokemon. yet you do not fight a Arceus with a Greninja unless you are fully prepared for that thing. The same holds true for Naruto S-class shinobi. Itachi admits when he and his partner (a fellow S-rank shinobi) should flee before Jiriaya of the Sannin, another S-rank shinobi, under the pretense that the pair could not hope to survive, that at best both of them would die killing him. Meaning, that there are levels within the classes.

** Harry with the elder wand was capable of dueling with Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts. It is also of note that the Master of Death may have abilities that would label him/her an S-class threat. It is not shown in canon if that is the case.
