I like what others have said about this, and the depression analogue makes a lot of sense, but I have never liked the fact that if the dementor gets close enough, quickly enough, then most people would be incapable of summoning a corporeal patronus in time. Take Harry in the third book, he had to save himself literally after the fact. If time magic hadn't been involved, he would be dead. And with depression, happiness isn't always enough. That's why I favor the idea that it is possible to make a patronus from neutral memories, memories of perseverance and determination. It won't drive the dementor away like a happy patronus, but it will hold it off until you can escape or find some other solution. Instead of white, it would be grey. It would even be possible to have a different patronus for your neutral memories, if the source of your determination is different than the source of your happiness.

This is drawn from Sirius talking about how he stayed sane in Azkaban. "I was innocent. It wasn't a happy memory, so they couldn't take it away." I feel like this could be extended into a situation where the dementor is right upon you, and you couldn't summon up the necessary happiness. But within everyone is a will to live, and they could draw upon that instead.
