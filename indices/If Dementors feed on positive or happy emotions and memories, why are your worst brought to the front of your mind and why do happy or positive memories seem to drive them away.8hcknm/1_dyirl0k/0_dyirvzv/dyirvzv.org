  Dementors feed on your happy memories so only the worst are left in there for you to experience.

Well, yes, that makes sense. But that explanation really only makes sense for prisoners who've spent a large amount of time around Dementors and have, thusly, had most of their positive memories eaten away.

In PoA and throughout the series we see that they /immediately/ bring negative or traumatizing memories to your mind. Which doesn't make sense if they're trying to feed on /positive/ ones.

Dear God, though, could you imagine if Dementors made you relive your positive memories as they slowly ate away at them? It's one thing to fight against feeling or reliving negative memories, but can you imagine how much more effective they'd be if they were sort of aphrodisiacal?

  I'm not sure for the second question but perhaps happy memories don't drive them away but instead they feed on them and go away with them. Something like that.

It seems to literally cause them discomfort. Patronuses (Patroni?) are described as driving Dementors away, not luring them away from a victim.
