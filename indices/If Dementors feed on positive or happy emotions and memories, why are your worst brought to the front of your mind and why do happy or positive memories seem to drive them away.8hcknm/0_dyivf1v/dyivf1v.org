It is said that they glory in despair. So, they feed happiness and positivity, but it's not that they want it. It's more like they want it out of the way because creating despair is the ultimate goal. That's their preferred environment. That's why they don't affect the happiest people more but instead the people who have serious trauma in their past. Note that they're not feeding in the sense that they're 'consuming' it. The happiness comes back. It seems more like a scary movie where some unseen force starts snuffing out the lights so that you're left in darkness. In the dark, you're left to imagine and expect the worst things.

If the main goal is despair, that also explains the Patronus. A Patronus is just pure emotion. They can't suck away happiness to get to despair because there is no despair. If there is no despair, there is no darkness and you can't turn off the light.
