To quote the relevant passage:

#+begin_quote
  "Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they *drain* peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be *sucked out of you*. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life."

  ---Remus Lupin's description of Dementors
#+end_quote

They sound more like vacuum cleaners sucking happiness away (and into a bottomless void of abyssal darkness) than creatures nourishing themselves on emotion. And that last line, maybe that's how they breed.
