I've been operating under the theory that Lupin is quoting the common but erroneous belief that they eat good memories, and that may be why Harry has better success teaching the DA how to cast the Patronus charm. He tossed away the 'what do Dementors want' question and focused on teaching the students how to bring about a protector made of positivity. After all, if you were faced with a demon who eats happy thoughts, would you want to offer up your best as a shield? That's like flinging steaks at hyenas, on the assumption that if you throw them hard enough, the hyenas might be traumatized by meat overload.

In my head-canon, Dementors drain away willpower and force the mind away from happy thoughts, as those are the ones that can be used to hurt them. This correlates to their meaning as a representation of depression.

Also, it's not like your memory of the awesome eighth birthday with the new bike and best cake actually disappears from your mind, never to be remembered again. The Dementors just make remembering that your world /isn't/ entirely a dystopic nightmare very difficult, so they can bathe in your angst.
