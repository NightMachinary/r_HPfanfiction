  Ranma didn't always like his dad. But Genma had one major advantage over his LAST dad: He wasn't an insane scientist from the Silver Millennium. Meet the Senshi, Ranma. I hope you're friends, because you're stuck with them. (Contains much Old Shame, newbie mistakes, and no IC-ness from anyone involved. You've been warned.) (Shut up, lots of stories have a decade plus hiatus.)
