linkffn(6574535) is great. I've recently read that one so you I can trust my memory when I say it's good.

linkffn(11080542) this is equally as good as the one above, but /very/ AU. It changes how Wizarding Society functions altogether.

linkffn(7525570) this is a Hermione/Ginny fic if you're into that. It was alright although it suffered from being overly long.

linkffn(11185533) Just a really cute story. Harry/Daphne. Very short.

linkffn(3867175) Another one I enjoyed. It's too far back in memory for me to insist that it's amazing but I recall it was very good.

linkffn(4200568) I think this is the first fic in H/Hr I ever read. I loved it when I started reading fanfiction. I don't know how well it holds up though.

linkffn(10034363) This is a neat one. Goes quite AU after Book 4, but it's an interesting ride.

linkffn(9766604) If you want powerful Harry this is a great choice. It's fairly well written too, but it can be a little self-indulgent with Harry's power. Still not nearly as bad as most PowerfulHarry! stories.
