  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535][Unlike a Sister by MADharmony]] is great. I've recently read that one so you I can trust my memory when I say it's good.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542][Patron by Starfox5]] this is equally as good as the one above, but very AU. It changes how Wizarding Society functions altogether.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570][Here and There by Jackdawess]] this is a Hermione/Ginny fic if you're into that. It was alright although it suffered from being overly long.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533][Uncle Harry by R-dude]] Just a really cute story. Harry/Daphne. Very short.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175][Notebooks and Letters by chem prof]] Another one I enjoyed. It's too far back in memory for me to insist that it's amazing but I recall it was very good.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568][The Harmony Bond by brigrove]] I think this is the first fic in H/Hr I ever read. I loved it when I started reading fanfiction. I don't know how well it holds up though.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10034363][HP and the World of Deceit by LGreymark]] This is a neat one. Goes quite AU after Book 4, but it's an interesting ride.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604][What We're Fighting For by James Spookie]] If you want powerful Harry this is a great choice. It's fairly well written too, but it can be a little self-indulgent with Harry's power. Still not nearly as bad as most PowerfulHarry! stories.
