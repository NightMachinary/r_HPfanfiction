Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian) Petunia is a squib that reconciled with Lily and regularly interacted with the magical world under a fulse identity, and secretly from her husband, until Harry gets dropped off and Dumbledore forcibly disconnects them until harry gets his letter. Vernon is on the fence about magic for a while but he eventually gets mostly over it; individual wizards are still weird, some are still freaks in his mind, and he thinks Dumbledore is trying to con them somehow.

Bit of a fix-it fic but its got a sense of pacing most of those don't have.
