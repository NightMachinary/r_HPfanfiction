Linkffn(8864658) or By Baker Street I Sat Down and Wept by Deco

This one has Petunia stepping up to the plate to be a better parent to both Dudley and Harry. There's a lot of world/magic development in this, it's very good but still ongoing (I'm only about 3/4 through of what's published, I tend to jump between stories a lot when I read).

Just a note, it is serveritus(which i've noticed some on this sub-reddit don't like) but it's written completely different from any other severitus fic I've ever seen.
