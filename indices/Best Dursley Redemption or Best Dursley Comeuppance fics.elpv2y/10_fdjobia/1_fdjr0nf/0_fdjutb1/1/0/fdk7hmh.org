It does, just wish everyone would tag their fics. Was reading a 'Harry and Hermione woke up in Vegas married to Loki and Thor' and just figured everyone was an adult, until after the characters had had sex and Hermione mentioned she was starting her 4th year at Hogwarts in the fall. Haven't noped out of anything so fast in a while. Am really glad the exlude tag system is much easier now though at least.
