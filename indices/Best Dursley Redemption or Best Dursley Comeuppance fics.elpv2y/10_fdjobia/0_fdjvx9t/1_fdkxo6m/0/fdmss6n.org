1. You can filter those out. I have [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=-filter_ids%3A23+-filter_ids%3A116+-filter_ids%3A10760+-filter_ids%3A2390&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][this]] as my bookmark and it works quite well.

2. AO3 is now a way bigger than it used to be and there are all kind of stories there. Yes, some are horrible, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][some]] of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102][the best ones]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862][I know about]] (OK, this one is on FFnet as well) are there too.
