Authors on AO3 are required to use the archive warning system. If a fic contains rape and is not tagged either Rape/Non-Con or Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings, you can and should report the fic.

You can also report fics for misleading ratings if they are rated G or T but they contain explicit smut.
