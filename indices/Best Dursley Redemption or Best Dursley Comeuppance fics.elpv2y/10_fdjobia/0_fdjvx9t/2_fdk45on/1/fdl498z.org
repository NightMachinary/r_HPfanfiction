Seriously? You'll accept rape in a story only if it fits your idea of where it is acceptable and where it's not? Otherwise it's just a "twisted fantasy"? Ao3 like any other such site is a place of expression and I don't believe it's fair to tell people what they can and cannot post. Just because it's not for you, doesn't mean that the story doesn't have an audience.

You said it yourself, that you don't mind kinks. It's not any different. Because people might just enjoy reading certain type of fiction(sexual or otherwise) but then have no interest in doing it in real life. It absolutely doesn't mean that ao3 is full of real life child molesters.

One can argue that the existence of a certain type of information in free access can give impressionable people ideas. But if you look at it that way, then you could ban almost anything. For example, I think that after the release of "13 reasons why" the number of suicides increased. Does that mean that it should be banned? People kill other people in movies/books/fanfiction all the time, is it any less immoral than rape? Most fics have a crucio used at least once, which is a torture curse, let's delete those fics as well.

Ao3 has an amazing(at it's core) tag system. Yes, it gets abused quite often and some fics get over tagged or undertagged. But it's main function is to tell you if the story has a concept that offends or triggers you or is simply not your kind of story.\\
So in contrast to you I respect ao3 for not "cleaning up their shit" like so many other sites do. They could implement a way to completely exclude certain tags(and not have us do it every time we search for something), so that some people can tailor the site to their own dislikes.

I understand, that my opinion is perhaps an unpopular one and I have no intention to attack you, but I also think that ao3 doesn't deserve the hate it gets and wanted to defend it.
