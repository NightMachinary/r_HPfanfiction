  That's some serious prejudice against ao3.

With good reason. When you have a tag like "underage sex" on your site you need to start thinking where you went wrong. I don't mind smut and/ or kinks (even if I don't understand some of them) as long as it's consenting adults doing it. But I absolutely refuse to read the wet dreams of some pedophile.

I suppose it could be used in a real story with tones like psychological thriller and horror. But then the author should focus more on the consequences and punishing the rapist than the act itself. Unfortunately, there are too many fics that just read like some sort of twisted fantasy that focuses only on the rape itself.

So yes, I am 100% prejudiced against AO3. If they clean up their shit they would get many more visitors.
