The Perfectly Normal series doesn't /redeem/ them, as such, but it makes them into reasonable, realistic human beings instead of one dimensional caricatures. They have a civil and relatively sane, if still cool, relationship with Harry. ffn(The Definition of Normal by BrilliantLady)

The ffn(Blood of the Phoenix) series actually redeems them, and the later fics include Harry meeting them for dinner occasionally.

Edit: Bloody bot. Here's links.
