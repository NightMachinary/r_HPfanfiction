I just finished this story recently and yeahhhh. Pretty mixed feelings. I was actually ok with super!Harry and I thought some of the traditions were interesting. But the later part seemed like the author wanted to fit everything in but not spend much time fleshing it out. Elves! Magical paintings! Overpowered everyone! Star wars!

I'm glad I'm not the only person that felt that way.
