When does this sub ever do "harmony good" circlejerks? I just searched harmony and harry/hermione in the search bar and the last "positive" mention of them was 3 months ago and even then it was a backhanded compliment. Otherwise, the only time it's mentioned is 1) people saying "LF Harmony with [insert requirement]" and 2) "Which ship/shippers do you hate?"
