I guess not a lot of people sort by New, huh? That might be why I haven't seen this as a problem - I don't ever sort by anything else, hot included. :D

I can see what you mean there then, though - the threads need momentum to get more upvotes and they don't get that momentum or that momentum stops since prompts get more upvoted on the hot sort and discussion threads don't make it there, meaning less people see them and thus less people comment and thus there's less discussion.

Do you really think removing or reducing the prompts would help, though? I mean, the prompts get a lot of interest, clearly, so would removing them make people any more likely to comment in discussions they don't comment in already? If they actually wanted to discuss stuff, surely they'd sort by New or actively go looking for discussion stuff, no?

Again, no criticism or disagreement here, I'm just curious and trying to understand. :)
