I gathered that much, but I'm asking if you think that removing or reorganising them would actually get you more discussion like you seem to want? Removing something that seems popular probably won't happen, judging by the mods, but reducing or changing them about to get other content more traction might happen.

And I probably do - I'm very new to reddit and I'm still learning the culture. :)
