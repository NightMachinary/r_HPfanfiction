I agree. I'd be fine with the prompts if they were thought out and serious but most prompts seem like the OPs just posted the first thing they thought of. Most of them are title only. Considering that most prompts don't even lead to a short drabble, to say the least of full length stories, I'd much rather have one large thread of prompts. Most of the prompts are low substance silly stuff too that's hard to get exited about.

Moderation leads to, well, moderation. Without prompts, there'd be more room for discussion posts on stories, topics, etc. I most enjoyed the architecture post and my own healing post recently.
