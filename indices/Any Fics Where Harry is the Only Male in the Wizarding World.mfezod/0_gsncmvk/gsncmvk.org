Been thinking over writing a premise similar to this, where only witches get to go to Hogwarts and be specially, competently trained and taught magic secrets - and all the wizards are just left to homeschool it or try and apprenticeship to a witch. Harry, being an exception due to the prophecy (it'd be publicly known in this AU), would attend Hogwarts as its only allowed wizard there. Might even make it like one of those popular crossdress novels about that girl who had to pretend to be a boy to get into a prestigious academy or whatever the hell, and have Harry use polyjuice or full body transfiguration to pretend to be a girl. Same thing, just with magic.
