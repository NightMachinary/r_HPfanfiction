I don't think it was particularly different from Slytherin at any other time --- a lot of kids going around pretending to be dark and brooding and important because that's how you get status in Slytherin, orchestrating tricks of the "hanging tripwires" variety and calling themselves masters of cunning, and endlessly bouncing jokes on how they pureblood Slytherins are so much better than everyone else off of each other.

The main difference was that War-era Slytherins /meant/ it more (since a lot of their Death Eater parents were acting in the same fashion at home, except for /real/), and so they were great recruits for Voldemort, and also much more likely to bully "non-standard" Slytherins (i.e. half-bloods, blood-traitors, or just people who don't dig the whole "dress in all black and green and act like a Dark Lord of the Sith" thing) and other Houses. Due to who their parents were, a lot of the War-era Slytherins had also been taught more serious curses and jinxes than other generations, so petty feuds had a tendency to go much, much too far (example: Severus vs Sirius).
