Actually, I envision that the house itself doesn't suffer overly much. I mean, if there's one house that would be, somewhat ironically, put under the heaviest surveillance in such times it would be the house of ambitious, power-hungry and independent revolutionaries since hey, that's pretty much what Slytherin is by that stage.

A fair assessment would be that the Slytherins were likely the least able to rock the boat under the Death Eaters because they would have received the harshest punishments for doing so, especially given what they were being asked to do.

So, with that in mind, the following may well have happened- the senior Slytherin contingent of 5th year and up would have been pressured to give evidence on what they knew and did during the occupation. Since imprisoning a large portion of the pureblood scions would have resulted in a renewed Death Eater uprising fairly quickly, they are then given a choice-either they go into voluntary exile or they spend the rest of their lives under constant scrutiny by the DMLE. Random house inspections, vault searches, an indefinite probationary status, travel restrictions and asset seizures would have been part of a long list of things they would have to agree on to avoid Azkaban after graduation. The Slytherins, being pretty smart, would have elected a select number of their peers to remain behind while the rest left to make their fortunes elsewhere, with the objective being to get the others out as soon as their new settlements are comfortably established outside Ministry Control. This is a process expected to take years and involves a complex series of transactions taking place between the exiles and the trapped for funds and resources.

The end result is an out of sight, out of mind approach. The Slytherins stay away from public life and let the sounds heal, occasionally stepping in to help out the people they had 'been forced to' torture in the past and generally buying themselves enough goodwill to keep people from probing too deeply into their plans. Those that end up being targeted for retaliation anyway join their fellows in exile and cede their project assets to the remainders.

And in the meantime, Slytherin is steadily occupied by an ever growing stream of muggleborn and half-bloods, who often join the exodus after graduation because being a muggleborn Slytherin? Talk about a double whammy of discrimination.

It takes decades for the house's image to recover (if it ever does).
