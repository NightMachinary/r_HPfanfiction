How do you envision the house after the Battle of Hogwarts?

Many Slytherins must be involved in voluntarily torturing their fellow students. Since the other three houses suffered many dead additionally in the Battle, the backlash against them must be immense.

If the Ministry doesn't cart off those torturers to Azkaban first, I expect the other three houses to organize vigilante hunting parties.

Revenge will happen if the legal authority fails.
