Honestly, it would have been very, very awkward. Though the Death Eaters most likely operated in nigh-total secrecy during the war(s), anyone actually in Slytherin at the time was virtually guaranteed to have at least one acquaintance or relative who was or aspired to be a Death Eater.

And the capper was that the other houses likely knew that too. Probably thought that Slytherin was the one and only source of Death Eaters Voldemort had to draw upon, a view that most likely went unchallenged all the way up to the end of the first war.

That left the Slytherins in a precarious position. Break ranks and you were labelled a traitor. Close ranks and you virtually confirmed your status as a future terrorist. Show any signs of curiosity towards the Dark Arts or make a badly timed remark and you were ostracized by the other houses as a precautionary measure-see what happened to Snape in the end.

To top it all off, you then had to deal with the reality that at least one of your year group was related to a Death Eater, if not all of them (yourself included). If that was the case, there would have been an ever-present paranoia in your group, a fear that someone's parents would be outed as Voldemort supporters and either jailed or summarily executed for their crimes. Those kids would be left especially vulnerable to retaliation from those inside and outside Slytherin who had lost parents to the Death Eaters in the form of either pranks or bullying.

The idea that tacit support from the half-bloods and muggleborns was what enabled the marauders to get away with as much as they did is not really that far-fetched when you consider just how many grieving children would have seen them as an instrument through which to lash out against the terrorists that had destroyed their lives.

It also handily explained just how Remus's condition went un-noticed for so long-with so many willing to cover them in exchange for continuing their pranking campaigns against the Slytherins, it would have been more surprising if they had been found out as animagi before the end of their school careers.

The war would have been an incredibly stressful time to be a Slytherin. Between a hostile school, the fear, the paranoia and the risk of ending up on the Dark Lord's radar without wanting or meaning to, I severely doubt that any of the Slytherins would have been able to enjoy themselves much in those hallowed halls. In fact, I would say that Slytherin house as a whole may have ended up radicalized by the very hostility they encountered as a result of the Death Eaters' actions, driving them into the arms of the very people who were responsible for creating their tenuous childhood situation in the first place and thus starting a vicious cycle that drove the house ever deeper into isolation over the decades that preceded and followed the end of the first war.

Whether or not that situation has actually changed remains to be seen. It may have, but that largely depends on just how much goodwill Severus Snape's accidental 'sacrifice' ended up generating after the second war was over (not much, according to my own gut feeling surrounding the situation).
