  always figure they display a strong sense of House unity when dealing with others

Yeah, same with any of the Houses when dealing with other Houses. Gryffindors would definitely side with their own over Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws, and those two will definitely side with their own over anyone else.

This is clear BS. This is usually written by ff authors who can't seem to get the idea that the wiz world is backwards out of their heads (in spite of numerous evidence to the contrary) and do their best to make it look even worse.

I think Slytherin was pretty much the same as any other house from book 1 upto book 4. In book 2, things might have gotten rather tense in the house, especially if the other three houses decided that the Heir of Slytherin had to be from House Slytherin and started cursing them in the hallways, but it doesn't come to that as far as we know.

After book 4, after Harry and Albus declare that Voldemort is back, things may have gotten tense in the house, or they may not have. The thing is, we're told that all Slytherins grow up to good little Dark wizards by two people who have the most bias in the series - Hagrid and Ron. That's clearly BS. What's more, the children of Death Eaters like Draco, Vincent, Gregory, Theodore are all 15 year olds. I'm going to err on the side of caution and suggest that none of their parents/relatives who were Death Eaters ever confided in their teenage sons about their business. Can't say much about Nott, but Malfoy is a complete braggart and the last thing Lucius wants is for his son to give up the secret by bragging - Voldemort was trying to remain inconspicuous about his return for as long as possible after all, and I imagine the Dark Lord would be most displeased if he were outed by a teenager's boasting of all things. The only thing the Slytherins do in book 5 is to capitalise on Umbridge and use her IS to hand out detentions and take House points like the new fashion.

At the end of Book 5, when the return is made public and acknowledged by the greater public, yes, things would have gotten quite tense. But...how much sway did Malfoy have at that point? His father, who was Malfoy's main source of power, since Lucius was close to the Minister and was a governor of the school, was arrested and thrown in Azkaban. Draco takes the Mark in book 6 (or sometime between book 5 and 6), but is tasked to kill Albus - he can't go bragging about that. In fact, Malfoy spends most of his sixth year too busy trying to repair the Cabinet to bother with his House or the school. I honestly can't remember anything about other Slytherins from book 6, other than the train scene, and even that just has just Draco, Pansy and Blaise involved. Harry was watching Malfoy like a hawk throughout book 6, and generally didn't pay the other Slytherins any attention.

In book 7, well the only thing we see is the Slytherins being told as a group to fuck off by McGonagall. They later join the battle on both sides - which means there was definitely a LOT of tension within the house, although all of it wasn't exactly based on blood purity.

There would have been roughly 4 groups of Slytherins in book 7

- Those who supported the regime wholeheartedly like Crabbe and Goyle,
- ones who did so only for the sake of appearances,
- ones who didn't care about it either way, and
- those who pretended to support the change.

The first group would have joined Voldemort's forces from the start of the battle, and the last group would have joined along with the villagers from Hogsmeade and other reinforcements.

Regarding house composition, I'd go off canon and say that there are next to no muggleborns in Slytherin house to begin with - the Sorting Hat is probably designed to avoid sorting muggleborns into Slytherin, since Salazar himself didn't want them in Hogwarts. Maybe a 70-30, or an 80-20 ratio of purebloods to halfbloods?
