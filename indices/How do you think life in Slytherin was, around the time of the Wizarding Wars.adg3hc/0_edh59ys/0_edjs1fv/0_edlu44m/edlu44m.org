Tom knew his middle name, Marvolo. The Sorting Hat may have well made the connection between Tom Marvolo Riddle and Marvolo Gaunt. If Tom knew his mother's name, Merope, it would have been an easy connection to make.

There's also obviously Tom's ability with Parseltongue, which is one of Salazar Slytherin's best known traits - there's no way Tom wouldn't be considered for Slytherin.
