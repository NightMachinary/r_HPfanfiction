Everyone was either sympathetic to Voldemort or at least pretending to be sympathetic to Voldemort in order to survive.

This is why Slytherin should have been disbanded at the end of the series and it made no sense why they kept it. Slytherin actively promoted bigotry ever since the time of its creation. Even the so called "good" Slytherins would have been better off in another house.

Rowling messed up by portraying Slytherin as so irredeemable and then not just disbanding it. It's actually cruel towards the kids themselves, since Slytherin will only make them even more bigoted because of all the negative influences.
