[[https://test.archiveofourown.org/series/13000][journals and ice cream]] is pretty entertaining; the first two stories are focused on Draco, the third on Ron, and the last on Lorcan Scamander. It's written entirely in epistolary format.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] is Ginny's and Riddle's conversations in his diary; great characterizations of both characters.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][Hermione, Queen of Witches]] goes up to GoF and some of OotP; Hermione has a journal that talks back to her.
