Tom Riddle/HP

A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magicand Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom Riddle pov. So not a lot of Dark!Harry that you see but I highly rec it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

A dark Harry fic with a twist. I absolutely love it. I wish there was a sequel. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6006037]])

This is one of the best Tomarry fics I ever read. Ending with a twist. Basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

Very interesting. Not reall Dark Harry though. Harry gets trapped in a memory inside Dumbledores pensieve. He changes timelines. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179]])

This is a Wolfstar not a Harry fic but I highly rec it anyways. The whole series is so well done. Angsty with a hopeful ending. Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

This is a WIP Linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)
