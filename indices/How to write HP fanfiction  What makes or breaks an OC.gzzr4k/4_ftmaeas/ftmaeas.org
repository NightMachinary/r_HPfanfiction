Hmmm.. okay, if you have time to read a loong fic, then there is this little known Harry/OC fanfic that portrays an amazing OC character (warning; has smut scenes) it's quite good too, even if you don't have the time now then I suggest you read it later.

linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power)

Now, how to write HP fanfiction, first, get your names of things, people and creatures checked and confirmed

For example: the Daily Prophet not Profet, Profit or Potato (yes I've seen that), Kreacher not Kreature, Buckbeak not Bukbiik, Bukbeak, Buckbiik or similar, among others are common mis-spellings

Second, leave no plot holes and get your HP facts checked (also, anything that is not the 7 books is not canon according to about 67% of the community) common plot holes are things like time turners, invisibility cloaks and Voldy being an idiot but that's pretty normal

Now, if you want a harem fic then by the gods never ever make that into a Lord Harry James Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Lovegood-Greengrass-Weasley-Emrys-Le Fay-Peverell-Ollivander-Naruto-God and some others with rings of ungodly power for each one

Basically avoid anything within linkffn(king of magic) and people should just chill

unusual pairings are of a large number in HP fanfic (Dobby/Hagrid, Harry/Hedwig, Hogwarts/Giant Squid, Hermione/Devil's snare, Hermione/Hagrid, Dobby/Hermione, Ron/Hedwig, Hermione/Giant Squid, Harry/Basilisk, and I feel like I'm missing atleast fifteen more)

but then there are the decent, but unusual pairings like Harry/Luna or Harry/Tracey or Harry/Hannah, which are in that order the most common to the rarest (that I've seen) of these three

Harem fics usually include Hermione, Daphne or Fleur (Daphne being the sister of Astoria Greengrass, Draco's wife) or even more than one of them, and then on the side there are girls like Susan Bones, Ginny Weasley or Luna Lovegood

I feel like I've missed something, but I can't remember

Eh whatever

Stay safe and have fun writing
