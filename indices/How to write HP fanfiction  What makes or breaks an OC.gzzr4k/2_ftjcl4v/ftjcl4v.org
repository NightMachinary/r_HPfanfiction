If you're interested, the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] subreddit is a also great place for questions like this. : ) They're super helpful with writing questions.

I like when OC's have their own quirks and such, like favorite snacks or a hoodie they've worn so many times that the zipper's broken and the cuffs are frayed, but they love it anyway because it matches their eyes and--somehow--it always smells like home.

It's little stuff like that that connects me to them, and makes them feel like more than just a plot device.

I can't think of anything that makes me immediately dislike an OC.
