This is all personal opinion and not really to be taken as truths. Despite how I write things to try to keep it as short as possible.

To me the two most important thing are : what is your story about, and why do you need an O.C. to tell it?

I have read way too many fanfiction that are trying to tell two stories at once (or more), and thus that don't know on what they need to focus. It quickly becomes confusing, and weak, and bad. Side plots and all are fine. And some themes or plots do mash well together. But it's rare, and need way more work than most people seems willing to put into fanfictions.

For an O.C. to work, it has to have at least some traits, knowledge, a position or qualities that no other characters have. If the O.C. bring nothing new, but is just a pale copy of an already existing character, then I'd wonder why I need to learn about a whole new character when X could do, say or be the exact same think.

The tragic backstory of your O.C. - if any - have to be realistic and have to have a somewhat realistic impact on them. If O.C. has multiple traumatic events that happened to them (which I wouldn't recommand doing, unless they are consequences of the first one), don't tell us all at once. Impart it slowly within the story. Also remember that most people are trying to hide them, and you won't notice that not everything fine until you get to know them better. It should feel that way with your O.C.

(Unless the story is about the traumatic event, of course, and how they deal with it).

Keep the name realistic. The simplier the better. They can be meaningful (like Remus Lupin, in the books), but stay on the idea that they shouldn't stand out too much. The HP universe is great for meaningfull name because you got a lot of wringling room with all the non-too-common name already existing in-universe. The idea is to not jar the reader to much out of the story. You don't want reader to think "what kind of name this is?????".

Give you O.C. real flaws. When I mean real flaws it's stuff that really are not good. Not those "It's good for job interviews flaws because deep down they are qualities" or "it's little quirky stuff that are fun but not really important" flaws that I keep reading in fanfictions. And it's better if those flaws do have real consequences on the story and characters, and O.C. needs to work on them.
