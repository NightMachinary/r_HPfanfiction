Harry Potter, Squatter is pretty good! I haven't read the last 5 chapters yet, but I really enjoy it! Granted, my knowledge of the Percy Jackson world is compromised solely from the movie (I am aware it is not very accurate), and other crossover fics so I can't judge the characters on that end. However I think the author does pretty well with the HP characterization.
