linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter by Enterprise1701-d) is bad, but popular.

linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is my favorite.

linkffn(Carpe Diem by seagate) is a surprisingly decent WBWL fic, but it's looking pretty abandoned.

linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum) is also pretty abandoned, and barely had any connection to HP canon before then, but it's decently enjoyable.
