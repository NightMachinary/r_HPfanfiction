Voldemort is a thing but he's never really a major threat. I think he appears like three times in the entire fic? And only his final action (in the last chapter of the fic except for the epilogue (which isn't out yet)) really felt like something close to an actual encounter.

The only other vaguely-angst-like thing I can think of is Umbridge, but she's dealt with pretty quickly too so I don't think it'd be a dealbreaker for you.

Overall the fic is just really pleasant in my opinion.
