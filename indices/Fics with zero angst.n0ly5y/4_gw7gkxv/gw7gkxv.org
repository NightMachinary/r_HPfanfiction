[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19444075][A Strong Connection]] a short Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint soulmate fic. The summary says it all *Summary:* “As you know, Mr. Wood, for a soulmark to appear a strong moment of connection must occur.” At that, Oliver blurted out laughing. “Sorry, I'm sorry, it's just, we bloody well did have a strong moment of connection! There was a moment where his elbow strongly connected with my head!" AKA, a Flintwood Soulmark Get-together fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is another Flintwood soulmate fic and frankly, I like this one even better than the one above. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.
