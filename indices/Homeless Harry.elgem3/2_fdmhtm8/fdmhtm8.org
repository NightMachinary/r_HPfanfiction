Ok I have a few.

linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter)

linkao3(To Catch A Thief)

linkffn(Crime and Punishment)

linkffn(Harry Potter: The Boy-Who-Is-Missing)

linkffn(Harry Stark and the Spirit of Iron)

Some of these are less “obvious abandonment” and more “Harry ran away,” but the principle remains. My favorites are by far the first two, and the bottom two are probably the least likely to totally fit your criteria, but I found them interesting anyways.
