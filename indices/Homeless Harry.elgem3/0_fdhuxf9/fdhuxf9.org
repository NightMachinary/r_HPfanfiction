I'm gonna piggy back on this and ask for a homeless Harry fic I can't remember. Details include him running away probably around 5-7, learning how to play cards and act from a troupe of seedy characters. I think the Weasleys spot him on the stage of a play he's acting in a park, introducing him to the wizarding world at that point.

Anyone?
