Thia has some different ones I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight) and there is one where Harry is a tournament expert. He goes to muggle uni but gets called in with Sirius to assess tasks. One of them was about cracking a puzzle box on a table that he knocked over. Another was a room filled with keys and locks but you only needed the key nearest the door. Can't recall the name of the fic.
