In my story "Patron", there are four tasks for the champions, all styled after one element, and tournament-style competitions (Duelling, Curse-Breaking, Quidditch) for the other students. The tasks are held in a vastly expanded magic arena, where, thanks to charms, the spectators can follow the action easily, and generally no more dangerous than a typical professional Quidditch match.
