There are no sex scenes. That's handled with "fade to black", as in movies. It's rated "M" because of violence - I like to err on the side of caution. (None of my stories on FFNet have graphic sex scenes.)

The teenagers do talk a lot about sex, though. But as the story reveals, that's like teenagers talking about their plans for their first Spring Break. Reality is far more tame.
