Heh. I've seen it used by other fans in discussions about Dumbledore - specifically his willingness to incorporate young children into the war against Voldemort, his decisions about Harry's life and training, the way he uses Snape, and the fact that he masterminds the opposition to the Death Eaters rather than soliciting help from potential allies. He's fairly ruthless, although that ruthlessness extends to himself as well.
