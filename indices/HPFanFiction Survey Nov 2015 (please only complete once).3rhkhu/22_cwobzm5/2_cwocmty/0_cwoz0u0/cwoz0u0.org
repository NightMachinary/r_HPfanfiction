Hmm. I don't think Harry's dumb, and I don't think Dumbledore's mad. They're certainly not written to be that way. I do think Dumbledore maintains a "realpolitik" perspective that means he's willing to sacrifice individuals for the sake of the community - without necessarily consulting said individuals on their willingness to be sacrificed. He also has a bad habit of appointing himself the one who knows best, even though he /knows/ he's capable of catastrophic mistakes.

Yes, he's a good man and a great wizard, but he plays things unnecessarily close to the vest, lies by omission, withholds information from people who would fare better if they knew the odds, and depends (by authorial default) far too much on coincidence and luck. I think he's manipulative and that he failed to put his faith in the experience and skills of other strong, intelligent magical folk, and that keeping them in the dark probably led to unnecessary deaths.

But I do love him. I think he's a fantastic character who's wise, often compassionate, witty, and complex. But that doesn't mean I'd want to trust him with my life.
