To be honest, I don't think the guy trusts himself. That would explain why he's not actually using his positions to force things to happen and instead simply has them because they were offered to him and he couldn't reject the offers without being impolite.

I mean, seriously, his choices led to the death of his sister, to him falling out of favour with his brother, to Grindewald having more time to do whatever nefarious things he'd been doing, to Tom not being stopped in time, to the Potters dying, and so on ... so yeah, a great man with a great many mistakes, I'd be really surprised if he wasn't doubting most if not all of the decisions he was making.
