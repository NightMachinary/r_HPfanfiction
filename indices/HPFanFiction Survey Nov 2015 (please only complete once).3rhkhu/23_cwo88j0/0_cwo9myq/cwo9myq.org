  Why is which country you identify with not only different from the resdential one, but mandatory?
#+end_quote

Because many people identify with a different nationality than their country of residence - as evidenced by the fairly significant difference between the two. If it's the same for you, just put it as the same country. Don't see what the problem is.

  Why can I not homeschool my kids in magic?
#+end_quote

A) This was in "fun stuff" and is not a serious question.

B) It wasn't the intent to list all possible modes of education, just the three we're familiar with from canon.

C) The point of a survey is to group people into broad categories so as to produce general conclusions. A survey that was so fine grained as to allow each person to give individually specific answers would be pointless.

  I believe HP about the return of the Dark Lord, but Dumbledore is a mad old fool.

See A and C above.

  I'm a liberalist/anarchist; there's certainly a category for that somewhere, but it's not one of the options you listed.
#+end_quote

See C above. If I started listing every possible political ideology and variation thereof the question would just be a mess. You're meant to pick the answer which is closest to your position, because when you're aiming at a large number of people it's impossible to provide an answer that everyone is going to look at and think "Yup, that's me!".
