There's all sorts of +BAD+ Unanswerable questions in your survey. Why is which country you identify with not only different from the resdential one, but mandatory? Why can I not homeschool my kids in magic? I believe HP about the return of the Dark Lord, but Dumbledore is a mad old fool. Politics- I'm a liberalist/anarchist; there's certainly a category for that somewhere, but it's not one of the options you listed.

that said, i filled it all out, and you have good questions too. and some i wouldn't have expected to be asked, whether that's good or not. funtimes!
