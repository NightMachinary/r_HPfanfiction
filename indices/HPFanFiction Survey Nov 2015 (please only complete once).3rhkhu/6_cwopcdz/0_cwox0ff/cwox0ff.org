Hermione, as a character, annoys me, and lowers the amount of pleasure I derive from reading the story. Voldemort doesn't. It's the simple difference between in-universe hate (which is directed towards characters who do terrible things) and out-universe hate (which is directed towards characters who are unpleasant to read about).
