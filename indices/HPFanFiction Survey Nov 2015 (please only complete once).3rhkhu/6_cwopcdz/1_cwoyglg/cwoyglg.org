Well, for most of the series, Voldemort just wasn't a very convincing villain to me. A lot of his prowess is handwaved, and a lot of his actions are ... well, let's just say they don't support the claim that he's the most brilliant wizard of his era. Or the most brilliant Dark wizard, unless all other Dark Arts practitioners are either knaves or fools.

So Voldemort rarely feels like a three-dimensional character to me, which means I don't have that intense an emotional response to him. Umbridge, on the other hand, is deliciously deceitful, effective, and repulsive in ways I find entirely plausible.
