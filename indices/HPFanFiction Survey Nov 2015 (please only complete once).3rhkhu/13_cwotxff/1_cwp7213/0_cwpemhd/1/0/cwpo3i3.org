Then it's a bad question. I work at a university. I am in no way connected to anything educational because I work in a research lab doing cell culture, protein engineering, and microbiology. I don't teach and never will. Nothing my lab does is for the purpose of educating anyone, which is pretty typical of academic labs.

Prior to this job, I worked for a medical devices company that makes immunology based products. Prior to that, I did biofuels research. Literally none of the jobs I've held or companies I've worked for fall under the categories you have available.

Just...put science as an option, man.
