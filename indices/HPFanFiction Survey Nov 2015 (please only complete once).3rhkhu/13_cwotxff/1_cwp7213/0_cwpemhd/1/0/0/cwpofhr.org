The question is "What industry do you work in?" not "What is your profession?"

People who work at universities work in the education sector, regardless of their role there. Secretaries at a university are also employed in the education sector, even though they're not doing any teaching.

This is the traditional, mainstream, accepted way surveys investigate employment by sector.
