Energy.

  And I'm telling you that's not how it works. Are you seriously saying that if I worked for the NIH instead, even if I were doing the exact same thing, I'd suddenly be in civil service? That's absurd.

And I'm telling you that is how it works. Your industry is not defined by your specific role, but for the entity you work for.

Are you saying that two people who work for the same company but in different roles work in different industries? /That's/ absurd. An industry is composed of companies, companies are composed of employees. The employees work within the same industry that their company is within.
