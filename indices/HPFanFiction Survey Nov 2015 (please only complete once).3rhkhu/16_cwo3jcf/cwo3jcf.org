Magical England does not need the ICW! Their former head is assassinated in cold blood by terrorists and they did nothing! The British head of state is murdered in his office and the ICW does nothing! ICW has no power! It has no backbone! England does not need the ICW! If they're going to leave us to solve our own problems anyway way, should we be obligated to help when they call for help?
