It was obviously Herpo the Foul, inventor of the Horcrux. It may not have been perfect, but it was an easily used method for Immortality that he brought into reach of the common wizard. Uncommon wizard. Rare wizard with the appropriate conscience and morals... fuck it. SOUL MANIPULATION. That's like saying Einstein was a terrible scientist because someone used his knowledge to build those big ass bombs. Granted, Herpo did all of the terrible things too, Herpo *THE FOUL*, but there's no discounting his genius or the untapped potential of his research.
