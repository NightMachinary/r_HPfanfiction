If anyone wants access to the raw data to do more detailed analytics just give me a shout.

Edit: Hrm, I had expected that the "Other" options would take what people had written and turn them into a new category that would be part of the pie charts. Clearly that hasn't happened. What I'll have to do is use the raw data to make a chart of the responses once the survey is over (i.e. when responses stop coming in).

Edit2: Interesting to contrast the DLP results: [[http://dlpsurvey.krzaq.cc/]]

Edit 3: Okay, we have over 500 responses now, so I'm closing the survey. Thanks everyone! Big props to the people of this sub for not trolling the survey. Not a single "attack helicopter" in sight for the gender question.
