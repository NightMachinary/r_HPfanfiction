I agree with this and wonder if it relates to the platform. I tend to find (with HP and other fandoms) on other sites that there are generally a lot of women reading fanfiction. So much so that finding a guy is a big thing. But on Reddit (even for fanfiction subs like this) there tends to be more men overall.

Anecdotally I find a lot of women I know are not really aware of Reddit esp for fandom things or finding fic. Or they are surprised I use it because they've heard it can be a hostile place for women. I'd be curious to see what the overall gender usage of Reddit is in general compared to the results for this sub.

If this same survey was replicated on twitter or in other communities I wonder if it would be a similar level...I doubt it would.
