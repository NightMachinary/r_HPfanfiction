Eh... perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned my opinion on Harmony, what I tried to say was that there are active communities dedicated to pairings that are looked down upon here, and those communities are very female-dominated. That, combined with popularity of harem and harry/multi threads, lead to my belief that this sub is more male-dominated.

As we are offtopic though: Draco/Hermione = star crossed lovers, generally an appealing trope in romance stories. And Snape/Hermione I think is 99% because of Alan Rickman's voice, although I'll admit the revealed backstory in DH also makes him somewhat more appealing. Lonely, dark man with a troubled past and such.
