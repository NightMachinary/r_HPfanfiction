I half agree with you, coming from the complete other direction. Canon!Harry is a wussy little bitch, and does not deserve a worthwhile or happy relationship. Its why i like ooc and au harry, to have a protagonist that is actually a hero, in a heroism requiring situation.

that said, i dislike malfoy and hate snape, so you're on your own with the relationships there.
