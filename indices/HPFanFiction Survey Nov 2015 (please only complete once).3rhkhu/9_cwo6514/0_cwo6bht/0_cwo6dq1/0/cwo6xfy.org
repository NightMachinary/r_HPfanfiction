I /have/ read Harmony stories, but I rarely like them for the romance part of the story. Frankly when it comes to Harry, he's okay but not the type of guy I want to see as a romance interest in a story.

My two favorite pairings are Dramione and Snamione. Both are not very popular on this sub, yet are fairly popular on fanfiction.net and have active communities behind them.
