Hmm ... I'd think harem stories to make sense from women's perspective.

I mean, yes, I don't get the whole fixation on pairings and romance (which probably makes me weird to at least some degree, what with the perception that women's literature is mostly romance), but if you aren't unwilling to share---and harem as it is written by most fan fiction writers presumes consent to share from the get-go so it's technically not cheating and the danger of the relationship ending is lower---then in a typical fan fiction scenario where the so-called “harem politics” aren't an issue it's sort of an easy way out if you put yourself in the place of the character because you both get the guy /and/ don't actually have to fight with other women /and/ most likely the man is going to be quite rich.

So yeah, peculiar kind of wish fulfilment. Though personally I prefer stories of the usual fantasy kind (you know, the character has a goal, struggles to achieve it, there's a journey of some sort either mental or actual, and so on) with the main character being female, so I tend to be a sucker for the “fem!(whatever-main-character)” stories for as long as they aren't centred on romance (I don't mind if it's there, but as part of the story that makes sense and not its central part that is or at least feels forced).

Not sure about the slash part, though, so I'll take your word for it. Though I do think it might have some to do with how low-quality much of the slash is and how enforced the pairings feel, too. Because most people who write slash (be it “femslash” or “slash that is not femslash”; honestly, the distinction feels weird to me, but eh, whatever) do it mostly for the pairing---and for the smut, of course---and that means their plot tends to suck.
