Sorry, this is a quick reply because I have to dash to work, but - no, it wasn't fair to call you out on the slash remark, and I apologize for being unpleasant. You're not doing anything that a thousand other people haven't done before you. Here's the thing, though. I've been in fandom for 10 years - a drop in the bucket compared to a lot of other folks - and although my "community" (several overlapping circles, actually) is primarily slashers and femslashers, it's populated by fans who write and read all sorts of things - except, apparently, for certain tropes that are popular here, but that's not really pertinent to this point. I've participated in conversations in all venues all over LJ and Dreamwidth and lurked in even more. And again and again, I and other slashers have seen the formulation "Slash is bad because..." or "Slash sucks because...", and the end of the sentence is always something to do with implausible pairings, romanticizing the villain characters, self-inserts, terrible prose - reasons that apply to /all other fanfiction./ So if you had said "most fanfic is sucky because..." I wouldn't have had a problem with it Because it's true. We all know that. Who better, since we're the ones who read and write the stuff? But slash gets singled out over and over for the sins that afflict /all/ fanfic as if those inadequacies are something particular to slash or as if slash stories unavoidably and automatically have a higher ratio of suck to excellence. The people who say this perpetuate the assumption, and other people repeat it as if it's a well-known fact. It's a way of separating slash from "real" fanfic - cutting it out of the herd and then blaming it for the mainstream perception that all fanfic is squicky and gross and written by teenagers on a sugar high.

The difficulty in finding recs for good slash and femslash fic is an accident of entry point, I suspect. And of personal taste. When I entered fandom - when I fell in with a surprised and resounding thud - I fell directly into a slash community, found friends immediately, found and joined rec communities, paid attention to the names of authors whose stories I loved, talked to other people who were posting about slash, and set about tracking down all the fic I could consume concerning my favorite pairings/characters. I was lucky, because LiveJournal was at its fannish peak then, and it made conversation central to my experience, plus it was the sort of platform in which rec communities flourished. I had no trouble at all locating or making recs, although if I'd fallen into

Btw, I think I also had a exasperated reaction to your post because you made no distinction between "pairing fic sucks" and "I don't like pairing fic." Romance is a perfectly good reason for a fic to exist. As always, the quality lies in the handling of it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with romance/erotica as a genre - but there's also nothing wrong with having zero interest in it. I don't read published romance fic, and my interest in slash is closely tied to my interest in very specific characters. I'm in fandom for the characters and to a lesser extent the world. But I like the erotic charge between characters enough to write it, and I've discovered some extremely talented authors during my time in fandom, whose work I will defend against all sneers and dismissals.

I also understand the preference for having a woman character in fic that you can relate to, and I know plenty of readers, whether femslash or het fans, have no interest in slash because its main focus isn't women. The lack of women doesn't bother me, because I obsess about certain characters and dynamics (and now certain favorite writers) and don't give a fig about the rest. But I can certainly see the point. I read a metric ton of published fiction, and most of the novels have a vast spectrum of female characters, so that's where I get my fix when it comes to reading about women. Mainstream fiction doesn't give me what I seek from slash fic, though. I come to fandom for what I can't find in published fic.

And of course there's the issue of misogyny, which used to be a fairly pronounced ugliness in older slash fic and still lurks in some writers' output. However, het fic is just as misogynist - it expresses it differently and has its own popular ugly tropes, but it's just as guilty. Having female characters in a fic doesn't magically absolve it of idiotic attitudes toward women. Misogyny in fandom is a thing, and it's a backbutton issue for me, too. But lack of female main characters isn't inherently misogynist if the story is focused on the developing relationship between two men. Don't read it if that bores you, but don't consign it to the suck bucket on reflex. And I think it's fair to say that both het and slash have slowly been evolving away from old unexamined attitudes toward sexuality and women's purpose in plot and as protagonists, mirroring changes in the culture at large.

Re: terminology. No, there's no umbrella term. Slash and femslash are two different things, and it's important to have terminology that distinguishes them. Fans who write femslash have fought to gain visibility and a sense of community separate from the larger perception of slash, which has a much more dramatic popular presence and a gazillion more fanworks. As a consumer of both, I certainly don't want them folded back together because the effective outcome would be that femslash disappears inside the umbrella term.

...so much for being a quick reply. But I am sorry for snarking at you. You're not the first and won't be the last to frame the conversation in a way that implies things you don't mean to imply (although in your follow-up response, I think you /do/ mean to imply that slash is worse because it evolved as pairing fic, which means it can never escape its roots as romance - which I don't agree with, and which, if true, would be true of het fic as well, but never mind). I've just heard this said over and over and over and over by fans who would scoff or be defensive if someone stated the same thing about their preferred genre as if it were an accepted fact, and would debunk the assumption just as sharply.

Ninety percent (or more) of fanfic is ... not good, and some of it is downright execrable and gives me secondhand embarrassment, and that applies across the board. Fortunately, no one has to read badfic (unless they get a kick out of it), and no one has to read good fic if it's not their thing.

One last point (yes, yes, eyeroll - I apologize for nattering on): I have no problem with people criticizing individual fics for their poor storytelling, grammar, characterization, what have you - although I'll snort disparagingly at anyone who says "that pairing is stupid and unbelievable and the fic is automatically awful because Snape/Harry (or fill in the blank), because ugh, who would write /that/?" And I'll discount their opinion as not worth my time. But praise and concrit of specific stories is always welcome; it's part of the fun of a shared interest. Selective condemnation of entire genres? Not so much.
