  Though I do think it might have some to do with how low-quality much of the slash is and how enforced the pairings feel, too

Yeah, no. I mean, we all tend to universalize our own opinions, but objectively speaking, slash fic is no more "low quality" than het fic, femslash, or gen, percentage-wise. There are excellent slash fics, good, thoughtful, erotic, emotional, plotty, etc. And of course there's mediocre slash, and embarrassingly bad slash, and the ratio of good to bad is exactly as much tilted toward badfic as any other category. Het and gen fic are not bastions of glorious prose and fictional plausibility. Nor are they any more persuasive to me, on a pairing level, than slash fic. The epics of Harry going dark or conquering the world often render his character and the magical universe unrecognizable to me, perhaps in the same proportion to which you find romance or pairing fic OOC. It depends, as always, on the writer's talent.

And believe me, if you're gay or bisexual or simply sympathetic, slash pairings don't feel any more 'forced' than other non-canon pairings. For thousands of readers and writers, they're far more interesting than anything canon gave us. They're unexplored territory - territory you may not care about, but we do.

I don't deny that most romance plots are unsuited to sustaining 100K word stories on relationship development alone; other elements are crucial to keeping a story inventive rather than repetitive. But, oddly enough, that applies to non-romance, too. Very few fanfics, IMO, can pull off epic-length wordcount. The writer has to be talented on several levels - basically, have the skill set of a novelist. That's rare in fandom.

(And apologies if you already know this, but the term 'slash' was coined 50 years ago when Kirk/Spock fic became a huge underground phenomenon. The slang term 'slash' derives from the use of / between names, and it signifies exclusively male/male. The word 'fem-' or 'femmeslash' grew out of a need to flag female-oriented content, a necessary distinction because readers of f/f want desperately to find each other's stories in the sea of m/m fic. The descriptors 'gay' and 'lesbian' aren't used because the characters generally aren't, canonically speaking.)

One last thought, re: harem fics. I assume - and those who read and write them, please speak up to contradict me if I'm wrong - that the fics are written from Harry's POV (or Neville's or whoever's), not from the female characters'. I've seen mention of Harry "deserving to get all those gorgeous girls," which implies women as things to acquire, like prizes, and most women I know don't think of themselves that way. And the people I've met in poly relationships certainly don't consider themselves part of a harem. So, fantasy, yes, but not one I've noticed in any of my female-dominated fandom circles.

  most people who write slash (...) do it mostly for the pairing---and for the smut, of course---and that means their plot tends to suck.

Thank you for telling me my writing sucks without having taken the trouble to read it. Not that I expect you would like it, and not that I require /anyone/ to like something that's not their jam. But it's a rather large leap to make, and partly what I mean by "discomfort with slash" - the tendency to assume, without giving evidence other than "it's slash," that it's somehow different in kind and quality from het fic. In my experience, het fic is just as preoccupied with pairings and smut - and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.
