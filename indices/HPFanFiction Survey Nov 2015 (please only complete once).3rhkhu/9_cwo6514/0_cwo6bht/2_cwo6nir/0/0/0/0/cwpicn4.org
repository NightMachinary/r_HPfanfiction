Actually, I never wrote that slash is objectively worse or even any worse than other stories on average. It's all about being centred on romance to such a degree that anything resembling plot is forgone that makes them suck in my opinion.

But considering this part:

  Thank you for telling me my writing sucks without having taken the trouble to read it.

It seems that I hit a sensitive point and you went on a rant without actually making sure that you are ranting at the right person.

I honestly want to say that what you did was bad form, but considering that much of your message isn't a rant but an actually helpful reply and that you probably had to rant at people who though you vile for being into slash, I guess I can sort of understand even if I think you should have paused for a moment and checked twice before doing that (because it doesn't feel nice when someone chews you out for writing something you didn't actually write, you know).

And just to make it clear, because I do not desire to fight with you because---the part that is a rant aside---your replies were actually fairly good, I do not have anything against slash; if anything, I have quite a lot against romance that makes no sense and has no plot and is just garbage, and quite a lot of stories (including slash, but neither being limited to slash nor being more common with slash) in general are like that; no, let's take it even further, I dislike stories that make no sense in general and are just contrived, and the romance genre in fan fiction is just more notable for stories like that. But there are stories with slash that I like, even if none of them are romance-centred and the slash just happens to be there. Though sure, I do sort of prefer “femslash” over the other kind because it's kind of easier to see myself as one of the characters, but either way I don't have any issues with slash at all (and the “sort of” is there not because of romance reasons but rather because I generally like having a character to project myself onto, and that means I like if there's at least one woman or girl in the story who is actually a worthwhile character, and sometimes slash that is not “femslash” has not a single female character that is important to the plot). And yes, bisexual, but it doesn't really matter.

Continuing from the above, think about it: most of the stories are of low quality, so you rely on people's recommendations. But there are less recommendations for slash because less people are into it, so if you want to try it you most likely will have to try on your own, and most likely (because you do not have any recommendations and the average quality of fan fiction in general is low) you will get something bad. Say what you want, but I think that does contribute to how some people feel about it, as instead of getting recommendations for slash the way “normal” stories get recommendations they step on a mine and decide that it's all bad, rinse and repeat with many other people.

And getting back to harems, neither have I seen any written from a woman's perspective, or at least none that were not crack which I think doesn't count. I'm just looking at it with what I have and taking a guess about what could be appealing about the genre to other women considering that most of those stories are indeed male-centric and it seems sort of counter-intuitive. I'm not saying that my guess is right, since I actually suck at romance (yay, me), and I'm pretty sure even those who are into it don't read all the stories in the genre because some (make that many, most likely, as it tends to be with fan fiction in general) are still trash, but that's what I have for the guess.

Also, is there an umbrella term for both “slash” and “femslash”? I don't want to keep on writing both because it's seriously annoying but it appears that if I do not it will be taken wrongly by other people. Though thanks for the info about the origin of the word, that was ... sort of helpful; well, it will be if there's an umbrella term for both, otherwise I will deem it shrug-worthy and just keep on explaining what I mean.
