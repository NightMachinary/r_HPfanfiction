Well, I have to say thanks for taking the time to write is, especially with so much of it (it may or may not seem like it, but I do like walls of text---for as long as they aren't a single three-page-long paragraph in a story).

And I apologise too; I probably could have worded what I wrote much better, it's a recurring issue for me and tends to result in misunderstandings of just that sort.

I do agree with you on the entry point thing. And this is actually what I was trying to write about when I wrote the part in which you think I ended up once again seemingly down-putting slash. Sorry about that, I have a tendency to go on a tangent once I start writing something and then end with a batch of text that resembles a pancake more than it does the original idea. Thing is, with a wrong (I think that's not the perfect word to use there, but I can't think of any better one right now) point of entry it's harder to find stories of a certain kind (due to lack of community that actually recommends those stories and all that), and since there are more, probably many more, points of entry that aren't about slash or femslash or both, than they are dealing with either of those, it's a self-perpetuating cycle and I think (or at least hope) that you get what I mean here despite me probably mangling the text yet again: that at least some, and possibly many, people think slash (and femslash) to be worse just because they didn't luck out with their entry point and were left with swimming in the sea of rubbish to find the good stories those with the entry point in question would have shortly gotten recommended to them, and that that is something that happens to many other genres too and not only slash.

As for the lack of distinction ... well, I do make a distinction there, it's just that I once again failed to convey it well. /I don't mind pairing fics/ for as long as the plot makes sense and is interesting and the pairing does not feel out of place with the plot in the story (so if you write a story that made it make sense and the story was interesting and it would be well written, I could probably enjoy even something like Petunia/Dolores); on the other hand, I am of the opinion that /most pairing fics suck, just like most fics suck in general, and it's just more visible with romance-centric stories/ because instead of a failure with some plot device or some plot hack you have a failure with emotions which leaves a more intensive distaste after biting into such a thing. I guess in the end it's that most of the stories where I enjoyed the romance did not have the romance as the primary focus but rather a secondary one, just being there but not actually making the fic appear as “romance” for me, not primarily at the very least.

Point is ... because I'm probably making a pancake out of the text again, that I do make a distinction and the same reasons that turn me from romance fiction also turn me from other fiction, but that reason happens to be more visible when the story is centred on romance. Or at least I see it as more visible then, which might very well be due to a certain personal reason that is a mess to get into.

And another thing is, for me both slash and femslash are just as real a fan fiction as stories that are neither of those are. Notably, I remember enjoying a Harry/Lucius fan fiction (with no smutty bits, but eh, whatever) which weirded me out but only because I don't like Lucius as a character and the very fact that the author managed to make not only the pairing but also Lucius's character for it make sense left me feeling confounded for a bit (kudos to the author, in any case, for making it actually work). Just, you know, I lack that point of entry so for me it's random digging until I find something read-worthy from that category ... well, either of those categories, since it would appear that slash and femslash are not the same thing. So yeah, it's not about slash or femslash evolving from romance (did it even? I don't know and I don't think it would be fair if I rejected it based on the potential of that being true), but about each and every individual story it is about for me being /too much/ about romance, to the point where the plot isn't there; but if the plot is there and the story is written well, I don't mind and probably will enjoy romance, be it het, slash, femslash, polyamorous relationship or whatever else there might be (I mean, for as long as all the people involved are all happy with it, it shouldn't really matter what their relationship is like exactly and with whom), and the specific pairings don't matter to me for as long as the characters are likeable and the pairing works in that particular story within the plot of that particular story.

I guess, all in all, I'm just bad with romance because I tend to approach it really logically (or so they call the approach; I perceive it as a bit absurd but eh) so I can't stomach romance that tastes like plastic. It doesn't mean I dislike romance as it is, I'm just ... I guess it would be fair to say I am overly critical, not only towards that but about other things as well.

As for misogyny, I'll probably sound stupid here, but my approach to it in stories has pretty much always been “eh, people are being stupid again”; I know it's here in many stories, and not only in stories actually, but that's something that goes from the culture and the times we are or were in so I can't really blame the fiction for it (unless the author of the piece I am trying to read happens to be just that bad, in which case I'll probably not read it anyway). And I can project myself onto male characters so I can do with that, it's just ... easier, I guess, or more convenient, to do that with female characters.

And yes, I do agree that off-handed condemnation of whole genres is a no-go. I do tend to say “most of [insert whatever] suck”, but that's because I'm used to the fact that most of everything sucks with no exceptions and unless you get recommendations you just have to keep on digging for the good stuff that is there somewhere under the mountain of crud. But there are good stories in every category ... or at least in most, there might be some niche category that only has one story made by some troll, I don't know enough to reject the possibility of that being the case.

And thanks again. In any case I'll be trying to explain what I mean more readably in the future, if such a thing is even a possibility with me, so that we'd avoid any repeats of the past ... I guess it would be fair to call it silliness, since neither of us actually meant to wage war. And from my side I just ask that if you see me saying something that sounds controversial, ask if I meant it or if I'm just not making sense again, and it'll probably happen to be the latter and all will be fine (and yes, I'm like that with talking in real life too, goes with having a motor-propelled mouth and a weird sense of humour and a near lack of ability to detect sarcasm even in one's own speech).
