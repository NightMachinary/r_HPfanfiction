  I also understand the preference for having a woman character in fic that you can relate to

Funnily enough, when reading sex scenes, I prefer reading about two guys instead of two girls (if it comes to non-heterosexual sex), despite being a straight woman.

I don't read slash fics in general though, because I mostly read romance stories and frankly, I just want a female protagonist and a hot guy for that. Although if it is a more smutty fic I don't mind a second guy being added to that...

One question though, what do you think about authors not tagging stories as (fem)slash? It rather annoys me if a romance story goes that way because it breaks my identification with the protagonist, but I imagine it also makes it harder to find the story for people who /are/ interested in it?
