Yeah, I wandered over from what's left of HP fandom on LJ, which used to be incredibly active and was definitely majority female. Also, the HP section on Archive of Our Own, which was founded by slash fans, is still mostly comprised of fics posted by women.

So the existence of harem stories - which don't seem to be a very prominent fantasy for women - and the focus on Daphne Greengrass surprised me, because I'd never encountered their popularity before. Also, the discomfort with slash on this subreddit is partly explained by the percentage of straight men here. Likewise, the tendency to re-write Harry as a warlike world-conquering badass, whereas on LJ you'd see a lot of superpowered Harry whose ambitions and affections stayed more within the scope of canon and of the familiar, developed characters.

It's a reminder of how huge the HP fandom still is, even now.
