I disagree, this sub and DLP are male-dominated, but there are other communities that are female-dominated. Most of the stories that I read where I know the author's gender, the author is female.

I follow this community, a few tumbler pages and some twitters that give good recommendations for pairings I like. I'm fairly sure of all those only this one is male-dominated.
