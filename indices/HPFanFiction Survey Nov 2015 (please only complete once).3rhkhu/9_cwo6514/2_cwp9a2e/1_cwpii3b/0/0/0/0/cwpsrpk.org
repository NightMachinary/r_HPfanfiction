I don't think it was in any of the books proper; one of the supplemental materials, probably, Rowling likes (or at least appears to like) to make those.

For all I know, it probably was something that only got released after the last book was released. But from my perspective it was weird to get Umbridge using that spell and Rowling's subsequent comment about it as the aforementioned proof ... no, thank you, please mail Umbridge to Antarctica in a crate without a wand.

Also, I just checked the wiki (the bit about maggots is from some game released on Pottermore or for Pottermore or whatever, in 2012 so way after the last book, but allegedly canon) and unless they messed up on the wiki the official version is that evil wizards can't cast it but Umbridge could because wearing the locket Horcrux enhanced her evil affinity ... what is this gibberish?
