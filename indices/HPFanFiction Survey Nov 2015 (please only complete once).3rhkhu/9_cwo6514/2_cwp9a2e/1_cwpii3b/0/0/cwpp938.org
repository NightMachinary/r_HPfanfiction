There's the “an evil person trying to cast it will turn into maggots” thing, which admittedly we never saw so it might be just a superstition, but which still kind of feels like an inconsistency because there's more to the whole “good and evil” thing than just proclaiming oneself as belonging to one or the other category and considering how Umbridge approaches things I think she counts as “evil” even more than Tom Riddle does.

And instead, we got her casting it, as “proof that even in people like her there can be some good”, which feels ... off, yes, that's the word.
