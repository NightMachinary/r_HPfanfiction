I bookmark all stories I read online (and that I enjoyed) through Delicious. It allows me to tag stories by fandom, genre, pairing, etc. Most importantly, in the event that all of my devices are stolen (which has happened before) or otherwise indisposed of, I can always access my bookmarks from anywhere, regardless of device or operating system, as long as I have a browser and an Internet connection. After trying a lot of different things over the years, this is what I've found to be most convenient and reliable.
