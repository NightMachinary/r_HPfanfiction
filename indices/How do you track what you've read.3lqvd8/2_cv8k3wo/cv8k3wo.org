I use chrome's bookmark manager. I have several folders setup (one for potential stores to read in the future, one for ones I have read and enjoyed, one for ones that are WIP, and one that I have read and disliked). Once a story is bookmarked in any folder it shows up with a filled in gold star in the address bar, this way I can tell if it's in one of the folders and saves me from having multiples.
