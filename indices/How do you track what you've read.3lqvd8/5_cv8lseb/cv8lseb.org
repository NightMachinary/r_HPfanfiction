I read on safari. It has a "Reading List" that works across platforms (I usually read on my iPhone). So that's how I keep track of what I'm going to read.

I usually have a few tabs open in safari with the stories in currently reading. Some have been open for ages when I get bored and move onto something else for a while. But I go back and try to finish everything that's open every few months.

I don't really keep track of what I have already read. If it's great and finished I favourite it. If it's great and updating I follow it. If it's great and abandoned I follow and sometimes favourite. Otherwise I just remember, and if start reading something I've already read I'll usually work it out right quick.
