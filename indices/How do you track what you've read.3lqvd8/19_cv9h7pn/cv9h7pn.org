If I've read a fic and liked it, it goes in my favorites on FFN. If the author doesn't have something in their bio against downloading, it also goes onto my kindle where I've got them sorted.

Things I see while browsing that I want to read eventually go into my mobile chrome bookmarks.

I'm still in the process of adding things I've enjoyed over the years to my favorites list, so I'll get that awful déjà vu every so often. But since most of what I read is 100k+, it's thankfully a smaller pool.

Edit: I also don't track my in-progress fics. I only read one at a time, and I'll keep the tab open on my mobile browser, or if I have to close it, it's in my recently closed tabs.
