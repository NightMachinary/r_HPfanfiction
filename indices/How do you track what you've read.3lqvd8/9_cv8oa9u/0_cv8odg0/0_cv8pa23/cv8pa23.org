Well I'm having a bit of trouble deciding which app to consistently use. Two apps I've found that are amazing but one key feature is lacking in each that the other has. (I'm in Android BTW)

Fanfiction Reader- amazing can open recommendations from this sub into that app and download instantly or use a different method. My only gripe is the inability to sort by figcs that you completed

The second one is "codex fanfiction reader" which can sort by fics completed but the download method is a bit clunkier
