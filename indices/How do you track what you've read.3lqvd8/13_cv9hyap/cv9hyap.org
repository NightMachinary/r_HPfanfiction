- Calibre + FanFicFare plugin to keep and update my library of fics I've read or intend to read.
- Reading List plugin to automatically push newly downloaded or updated fics to my e-Reader.
- e-Reader to keep track of what I've read: once I'm caught up on a fic, I simply delete it from the e-Reader, while keeping it in the Calibre library.
