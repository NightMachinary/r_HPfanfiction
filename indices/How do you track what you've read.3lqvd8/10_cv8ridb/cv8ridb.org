I usually get about three chapters in before I realize, "Damn, I've already read this." And depending on the story, I'll either go back into the tedious search mode or think, "Oh well, it's been a while and I remember liking this story quite a lot. Let's see if it still holds up."

Sorry if this doesn't give you any ideas, I'm not the most organized individual
