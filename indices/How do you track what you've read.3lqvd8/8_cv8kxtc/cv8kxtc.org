I download everything and sort into folders on my comp. I have a "To Read" folder, and for the stuff I've read I have subfolders for different fandoms. Dowloading also ensures that if the fic is deleted before I get around to reading it, I still have a copy. If I can't read something in a single sitting then I'll convert and transfer to my ereader, so my page will be marked there for coming back to later. I rarely read WIPs, but I have a handful of WIPs that look interesting so I track them via whatever website they're on and will read them when they're finished/abandoned, although I still download every chapter as it's uploaded in case of deletion.

I also have a word file listing fics I've read and enjoyed. It has title, author, summary, pairings, and links, which makes it easy if I want to re-read something but it's been a while since I read it and I can't remember the title or something, and it means I can quickly and easily finds recs for giving people.
