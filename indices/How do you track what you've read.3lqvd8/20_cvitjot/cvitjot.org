I don't actually (I remember some by summary, some because after the first chapter I know how it ends etc. - but that's because lots of pairings I read don't have that many fictions, like Harry/Fleur, Harry/Nymphadora (I don't like calling her "Tonks" it's a family name...so she doesn't like her name? - Grow up Nymphy, I don't like mine that much either (too common...I'd rather have something as unique as her name, just for a man!)), Harry/Daphne and lots of others (I do read Harry/Hermione, but only occasionally - and I've stopped reading Harry/Ginny)...)
