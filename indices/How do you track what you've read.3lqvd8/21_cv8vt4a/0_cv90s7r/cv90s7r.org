I use hatena bookmark with the the chrome extension. I bookmark all the stories I read on hatena, so when I access a page, I will see the "already bookmarked" icon if I've already tried reading it. Since I don't see anyone else doing the same on hatena, I leave notes with full spoilers about what happened so far on it too. It's extremely useful when a story updates after I forget what it was about. Even with hatena, I still end up reading the same story twice every once in a while, when the author cross-posts on ffn/ao3 and I forgot enough about it to not recognize it on the other site.
