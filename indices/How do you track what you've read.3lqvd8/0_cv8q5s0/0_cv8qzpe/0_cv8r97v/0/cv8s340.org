If he is like me, its both a curse and a blessing. I've gotten 20 chapters into something before with a growing sense of deja vu before figuring out what it was, and then no longer being able to continue as I now know what is going to happen.

That said I can reread some of the ones I know I loved and be really surprised which is nice.
