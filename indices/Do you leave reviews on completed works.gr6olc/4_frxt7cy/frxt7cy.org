I have to have either like it a lot and if it didn't have a lot of reviews, I might give one so it's found easier (also might give one if I liked it a lot). Or if I think it was good idea and would have liked it but it wasn't well written (wrong grammar) or had some spacing issues well basically issues that would make it really hard to read the story, I would usually give a review to give constructive critism, so the writer would know that those issues should be looked up to ease of readin it.. But I never give negative reviews, only good critisism so author can fix up things that might be unintentional or impact if other would read the story etc..
