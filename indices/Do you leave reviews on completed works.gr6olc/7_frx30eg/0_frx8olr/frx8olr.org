Wow, imagine working hard on a story only for the reviewer to leave a review, not because they liked it, but because they hated it.

In that case, if you absolutely felt the need to tell them, I would PM them privately.

Writers of fanfiction are not paid, they get very little credit, only the ones a lot of people like, or are controversial enough, constantly seem to get recommended or talked about.

Giving a person concrete criticism is fine, but if all you have to say is stuff that you disliked/hate, it'd be better doing that more in private with them, and if they say something like criticism is welcome.
