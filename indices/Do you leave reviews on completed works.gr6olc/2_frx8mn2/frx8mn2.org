I regard reviews of WIPs as a way to help keep the author motivated so I'll usually leave them every so often. All of my best encounters with authors have come from leaving thoughtful reviews. Also my worst encounters with authors, but I guess that's the rough with the smooth.

If a story is WIP but I just read 50000 chapters to catch up or it's finished then it'll be one review at the end unless there's something I particularly want to say.
