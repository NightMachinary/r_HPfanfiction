Ah, okay. I don't really have any fem!Harry fics that stick to canon - they're mostly more... divergent than different, I suppose. Like, some have her still go through the Triwizard, but she handles it and the people around her totally differently.

And then there's a few which are different, like The Archaeologist by Racke, where male Harry gets punted to an alternate universe where he wakes up in his dead sister's body and becomes an Archaeologist/Curse Breaker type.

Other than Racke though, the only six good ones I know are all in the link Ceplma posted elsewhere in this thread (I posted in that thread too).
