I can't believe no one has put out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Conner]] series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]. Might just be because it does end up getting recc'd quite a bit. When I read PotDK it made me have tinglies because I reminded me so much of this series.

It's a complete seven year series with a completely AU world. It has over 3 million words and when I first read it I couldn't put it down until I was done (which meant lots of things didn't get done that August... hmmm more proof how good it was, I can actually remember exactly when I read it...).

Things I think you'll like:

- length of the story
- breadth of world building
- very thorough view on the cultures of light and dark magics and the rituals that go with it
- Harry/Snape mentor
- Harry's allying with the Malfoys and those relationships

Looks like enough of the fine details have finally faded enough that I can properly reread it (if I don't wait long enough I end up just skim the stories) so now I know what I'll be reading for the next month.
