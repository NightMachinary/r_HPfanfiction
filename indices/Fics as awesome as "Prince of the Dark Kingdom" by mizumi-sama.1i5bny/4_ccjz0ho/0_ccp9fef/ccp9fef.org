eee, I cna't wait to get started on this one. This looks like a FANTASTIC series to read, eeee :D

Thank you for the rec -- This one will be one of the next on my read list :)

Right now i'm reading [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic]] by [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/][GatewayGirl]] and it's making me roll around and enjoy the feels. So I'll probably try to read some 'short stories' first, before I dive back into another one that will give me those tinglies again :)

I think PotDK is still my FAVORITE ever, but there have been some good--REALLY good--seconds out there <3 Hoping this one will definitely be a contender :D
