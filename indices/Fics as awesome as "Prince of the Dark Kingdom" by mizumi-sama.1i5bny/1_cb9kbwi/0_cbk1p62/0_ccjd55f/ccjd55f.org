Yah, so i know it's late, but I just checked up on this thread to get a new recc and saw this post (which must've been added later, 'cause I so totally would have commented on GreenGecko being amazing!).

The Denarian Renegade does not require any knowledge of the Dresden books to be good. How do I know this? Took me about a week to get through them 'cause I couldn't put them down and I haven't touched a Dresden book before (prolly should seeing how much I enjoyed this one).

I can definitely see shout out characters and some greater world things that would prolly make more sense to someone who has, but this story was very self explanatory.
