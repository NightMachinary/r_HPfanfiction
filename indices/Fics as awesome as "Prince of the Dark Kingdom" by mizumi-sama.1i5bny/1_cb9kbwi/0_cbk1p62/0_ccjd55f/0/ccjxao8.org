Regarding Green Gecko, I rolled around on the floor in joy for like a WEEK as I read though aaaaaaall of it. That book inspired my kindle purchase :D Then I read [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=781][A Year like None Other]] that also made me spasm around happily, if you haven't read that one either.

Thanks for hte feedback on the Denarian Renegade.. I''ll totally put that on my 'to read' list now :3 That's awesome, though, it sounds like great writing... I read another Harry Potter+Another Series fanfic a few days ago despite it being my favorite non-HP Franchise (stargate) it was... really pretty horrible. Kinda soured my palate for the idea of crossovers with Harry Potter. Sad further because I read the author's other stories too and they were AWESOME, even the one that was written at the same time as the crossover. But with this reinforcement, I'll definetly read the Denarian Renegade now :D Thank you!!
