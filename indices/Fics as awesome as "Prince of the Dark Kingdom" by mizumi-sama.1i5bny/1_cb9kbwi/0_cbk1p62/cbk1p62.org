I missed this responce before, sorry! Thank YOU also for your recomendations!

I'm glad you're enjoying POTDK! :D I, personal, read ALL of it, then ignore it for a few months at a time until there are 2-3 updates, and then read them all :) WHat'd you end up deciding on?

The Denarian renegade seems like a FACINATING idea! My only hesitation is that I havn't read the last few Dresden Files novels yet and am terrified of spoilering myself. Am I in any danger of that? :)

Resonance sounds fantastic also. I think I just found my next story to read! Thank you!

(oh, as another note.. regarding Resonance never quite being finished, I just looked at the author's blog.. they said... uh.. on Aug. 8th, 2013 at 10:06 PM (so, like, 2 hours ago) "Back to Resolution... I had a really hard time picking this story back up after putting it down. I've been taking a pile of writing classes and juggling three other stories was at my max. But, classes are out right now and its just me and two cats for a few days. So I'm catching back up with the hopes of wrapping it up this weekend. " :)
