I just wanted to say thank you so much for linking this fic, by far one of the best I have read, finally got to the end of book 6 and am debating going on or waiting for updates to come along :)

Two stories (series actually) that share some common elements with PotDK that I greatly enjoyed are [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] by Shezza. It's a 3 part series that comes to about 600k words, some x-over with the Dresden Files books. Semi-Dark/Ruthless Harry, demons etc, very well written in my opinion.

Another that I read quite a while back and loved, though it was never quite completed to my knowledge is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] and its sequels Revolution and Resolution by GreenGecko. The entire series comes to something like 1.4m words, Troubled/Powerful Harry, raised by S. Snape, dealings with the Fae and other 'underworld' elements, again a very well written story and a great read.
