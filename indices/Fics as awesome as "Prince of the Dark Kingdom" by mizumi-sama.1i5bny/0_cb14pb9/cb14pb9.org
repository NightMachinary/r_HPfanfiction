Hmm. I can recommend some long stories with solid worldbuilding and many of the desiderata you request. For variety, I'll avoid some of the ones I've recommended recently to this subreddit (jbern's stories, joe6991's stories, nonjon's Browncoat, Green Eyes, Shezza's Denarian Renegade/Knight/Lord series, etc.):

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is a solidly written, novel-length, complete story with quite a lot of worldbuilding, believable friendships/relationships, and avoids character bashing. This story has one of the most haunting endings I've encountered in fanfiction.

  Post DH. In the wake of victory, Harry struggles with life, love, and the reform of the British wizarding world. He learns that life is complex, and that happy endings are fleeting. Chapter 24- Dreams: The Unicorn in Kensington Gardens

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] by Master Slytherin is quite solidly written and has a darker tone, much like PotDK.

#+begin_quote
  The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li. Novel-length, very AU, a bit of a fusion with Ender's Game; updates are frequent when they happen (the next portion of the story is being workshopped over in the Work By Author section of DLP - membership required to read). This is one of my favorite stories still updating.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

Also, by the same author, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], a very dark AU that's really a couple of novels juxtaposed. One of the best "wrong boy who lived" stories you're likely to find.

#+begin_quote
  On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] by Myst Shadow - AU, plot divergence after Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron and Hermione get serious about magic early on. An intriguing plot, though the story updates relatively slowly.

#+begin_quote
  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.

If you don't mind dabbling in another fandom (Star Wars), I can't recommend highly enough blank101's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm][Son of Suns]] trilogy, which is nearly a million words and very well written. Luke is captured at the end of Empire Strikes Back and is turned by Palpatine, becoming a Sith Lord. The story is perhaps the closest parallel to PotDK that I can think of.

#+begin_quote
  Son of Suns Trilogy Part I - AU set at the end of TESB. When Luke and his companions are caught and taken to Coruscant, Palpatine begins to systematically take apart his life to create a new Sith, turning Luke against his allies, father and beliefs with devastating consequences. Action/Drama/Romance Luke Skywalker/Mara Jade, Vader, Han Solo/Leia Organa, Mothma, Madine
