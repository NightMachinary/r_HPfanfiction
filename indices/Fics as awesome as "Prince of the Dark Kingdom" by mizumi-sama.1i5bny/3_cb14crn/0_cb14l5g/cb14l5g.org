Nope.

Harry's relationship with Voldemort defies explanation, but best single word would be to say that Voldemort ends up as harry's mentor. (and harry isn't evil, either.) Likewise, Harry's relationship with snape is... more teacher/student, with an EVENTUAL shift to something more like father/son-ish.

That said, there IS one or two homosexual couples in the story--but not featuring any canon characters. Harry himself has one or twoish girlfriends, but he's not really much of a boyfriend--too much else going on--and the relationships tend to be a part of the story, rather then the reason for the story..

Also, I realized I didn't link the story: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]
