... how is that a joke in any shape or form?

first of: starts off with an insult "Oh shut up.". If that is how he starts a joke, he is just asking for his joke to be taken seriously.

second: Nothing that even remotely hints at a joke. No punchline, no visible sarcasm even in text form. It is literally just 'everything is political'

to put it bluntly: If it was a joke, which I have a hard time believing, it was a shit one.
