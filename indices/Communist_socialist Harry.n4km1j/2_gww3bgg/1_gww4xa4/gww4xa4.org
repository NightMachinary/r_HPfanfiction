errr... No. Magic will just amplify inequality.

When you have people that can't even cast a shield charm and they have to rely on people that have all the power in society why should the people in power dedicate their existence to serve other people's needs instead of following their dreams? This is especially apparent in Harry Potter when a powerful wizard can do whatever he wants and society can't stop then.

This is more an Ancapistan than anything else.
