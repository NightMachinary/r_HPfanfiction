How does Marx apply to what is essentially a pre-industrial society? What are the "means of production" in Harry Potter? I see no evidence that there is anything recognizable as capitalism in Wizarding Britain. I think we'd have to look to the Middle Ages in Europe, with their guilds of skilled, specialized craftsmen, to find a Muggle economic model similar to Wizarding Britain.
