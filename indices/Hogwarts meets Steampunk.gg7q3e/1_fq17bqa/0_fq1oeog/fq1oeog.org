Depends on how magic disrupts electronics, for example, if it disrupts waves (Radio, infared, etc.) It probably wouldn't work, if it adjusts the conductivity of certain substances in common electronics, (gold, slicone, etc.) It probably would.

Edit: pIt might work if magic acts as s constant high/low current, effectively emp-ing the area constantly, then it probably wouldn't work.
