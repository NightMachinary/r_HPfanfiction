That brought to mind a possibly interesting idea for a story. A little tragedy, a little horror. Possibly fun. :)

Hermione keeps the Time Turner after they rescue Sirius - the usual Harmony rationalisation of needing time to practice - but it turns out the Time Turner got damaged on the night they rescued Sirius. The Turner may still protect against aging of the body, but no longer so for the mind, and so time travel isn't safe for her anymore. Every jump muddies her mind a little bit further, takes just a little bit more of her memory.

When she finally realises, Hermione, desperate to retain the memories of the few friends she's ever had for as long as she can, makes sure to interact with them as much as possible, keeping those treasured thoughts at the forefront of her mind, knowing full well that each interaction might be her last as all her memories of them drift away into confusion as Cause and Effect intertwine like a mandala. All her nagging, her persistence, her constant use of their full names, is just her trying to hold on.

Could be an interesting exploration of early onset dementia in a younger person who treasures their mind.
