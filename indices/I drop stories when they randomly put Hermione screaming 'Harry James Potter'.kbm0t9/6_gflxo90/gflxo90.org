Typically, the usage of your full name---at least in America---is something done by your mother, and lets you know that you really have fucked up this time, and are in a LOT of trouble.

I'd imagine the usage of Harry's full name is to call attention to the fact that Hermione acts more like his mother than his friend---or to just clearly state her role as the Mom Friend.

I'm willing to bet that the writers that do this are American and aren't aware that this isn't a global phenomenon. I'm only just finding out that people in other countries have never experienced the terror of having their mom say their full name when they've done something wrong.
