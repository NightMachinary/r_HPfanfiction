I do find it weird the over emphasis fanfic writers put on middle names. Maybe my corner of the world is unusual but I don't think full names are that commonly used when angry with someone (sometimes if joking angry), and even then I think using the middle name is overkill? I can't recall my parents ever using my middle name.
