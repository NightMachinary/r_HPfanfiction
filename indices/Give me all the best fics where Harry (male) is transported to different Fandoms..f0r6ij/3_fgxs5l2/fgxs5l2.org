linkffn(Post Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe) is set in the MCU universe but except for a few "cameos" (one early on and one just recently popped up) from his old (and totally dead) world, the magical world does not exist. It's still a WIP so it's possible a fusion could happen but as of right now there's not even a real hint of it happening. He is told that he could "eventually" bring back his world but that's it.
