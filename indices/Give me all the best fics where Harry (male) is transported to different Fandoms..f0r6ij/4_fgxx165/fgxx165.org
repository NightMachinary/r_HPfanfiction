This isn't complete without the Lone Traveller Anthology. It's about a Harry who does the age-old trope of the time travel ritual, but fucks it up so completely that he becomes dissasociated from any one universe and starts travelling to different points of time where he can make a difference - in the beginning, it's just JK's world, but it branches out quickly into a bunch of different fandoms.

There's a few more larger arcs by dunuelos in their own threads, but those are announced in the main stories. Dunuelos goes a bit strange with real-world religious symolism by the end of the second story (a bit over the top, but not preachy or anything), but it's a lot of fun to read.
