Oh, thought of one more.

*Gods Among Us - Battlestar Galactica* (the reboot, I think?) - I went into this having a vague idea of what this show was about, and I feel like it did a decent job of explaining what was going on. If you're heading in fandom blind you'll probably be okay. (The description also says stargate, and I never watched that either.)
