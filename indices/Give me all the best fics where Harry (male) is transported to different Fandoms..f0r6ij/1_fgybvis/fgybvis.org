Thank you for so many additions to my reading list! Here's a few possibilities for yours:

*Through the Wormhole - Star Trek DS9*. A three part series that easiest to find [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1456411][here on ao3]] but the most recent updates are only found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13446963/1/Through-the-Wormhole-Year-3][FFN]]. Harry goes through the veil of death and ends up in the wormhole when Sisko met the prophets during the premiere. Starts out pretty true to the series, then diverges because it has to. This author also wrote a lot of stories in the Lone Traveler series, linked elsewhere in this thread (they qualify, and are great guilty pleasure fix-it reads).

*Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain - The Dresden Files*. I have mixed feelings about this one, but its certainly an interesting read.

*Illusions of Grandeur - Supernatural*. I loved this story, and am pretty disappointed that the sequel has been abandoned. MoD!Harry is old and from a previous version of the universe.

*Browncoat, Green Eyes - Firefly* universe. This one is probably not what you want, but the portal vs fusion line here is a bit blurry and the story is excellent. It's /is/ technically fusion, but its also the 26th century, Harry is the last/only wizard and it reads like a portal fic until you're more than halfway through. If you aren't familiar with Firefly, the earth is a uninhabitable flaming rock and humanity now lives elsewhere, its a space western, and you should watch it.

*They Call Us Dark - LoTR*. This fic... this story fits what you're looking for but it /does/ have some issues... I liked the concept and would read the hell out of a beta'd rewrite but.... problems, it has them. For instance, the author is very likely a non-native English speaker and uses some confusing terminology such as referring to Harry as "the raven" and forgetting to tell us that s/he's talking about his hair lol. Also: keep in mind that some elements are made up from whole cloth, and /this does not have anything resembling a LoTR canon finale/.

*The Power he Knows Not - LoTR*. Unlike the previous one, this is a great story. It follows stations of LoTR canon a bit more closely (with a twist), and is a completed story written by the same person who is working on the Shadow of Agmar and Elves Most Fabulous (which I'm linking without talking about - they also fit. Elves is crack, Angmar is serious and excellent but incomplete)

*The Archmage of Arda - LoTR*. It's complete and I liked it and I don't remember anything beyond that, sorry.
