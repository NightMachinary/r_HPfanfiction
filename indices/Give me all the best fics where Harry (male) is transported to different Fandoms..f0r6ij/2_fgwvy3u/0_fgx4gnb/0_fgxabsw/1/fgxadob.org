  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called ‘The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  The one grateful thought that he threw to the sky was that he was not surrounded by trees. Truly, Harry was used to waking up in enchanted and lonesome forests and while he could surely survive in one again, the wide-open, grassy plain was a sight for sore eyes.The untamed magic and general feel of a land unknown to him were far outweighing any relief he could find, however.Because of course Harry Potter, the boy who had never stuck between the lines of “physics” and “magic,” would again defy the rules and end up very, very far from Hogwarts -- the place where he should have been at the moment. Appearing in a world with nothing but the clothes on his back and the wand in his holster for protection was very unfortunate indeed, and it was only the mind-numbing shock Harry was in at the current moment that saved the grass in a small radius from him from an explosive destruction.“What,” he said, “is this.”OR.The one where Harry finds himself in Middle-Earth and goes with Bilbo on his quest, making attachments and saving a few lives along the way. But don't be fooled: Fawkes is the real hero of this story. This is basically an "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH FAWKES" story. I'm a big fan of his.

  Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange changes while attempting to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could the two possibly be related?

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
