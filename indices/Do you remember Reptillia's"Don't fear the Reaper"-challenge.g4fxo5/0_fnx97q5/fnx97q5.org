Soul-mates are an intriguing concept at the first glance, but it leads to all kinds of questionable situations regarding consent and free will if you think about it some more. Especially if some diety tells you that there is a script and you will be repeating your life until you get it "right". And the other person has even less say in the whole mess.

IMO the only way to do time travel without too many questionable situations is the accidental kind, preferably into a parallel universe so you don't have to worry about loops or paradoxes like ceasing to exist because you altered something, making your trip into the past impossible. And no romance between the traveller and his former peers, at least while they are teenagers. Harry/Lily in the 70s is way less questionable IMO than Harry/any Hogwarts girl set during the books.
