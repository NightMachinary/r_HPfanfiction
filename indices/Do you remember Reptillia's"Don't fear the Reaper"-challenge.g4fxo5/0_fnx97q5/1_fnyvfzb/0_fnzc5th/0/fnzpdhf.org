Fair enough.

But on the other hand you could argue that our parents/guardians and our environment shaped how we think and feel/ how our soul tic 🙂 and with that we are more compatible with some then with others. Imo it's the same difference and personally I find the the concept of a soulmate, somepne who is exactly right for me out there reassuring.

Btw I remember a story with soulmates in where it said that everyone had more then one and had to have activily /choose/ to be with one. But alas we will probably not agree on that topic. 😁 And that it ok 😉
