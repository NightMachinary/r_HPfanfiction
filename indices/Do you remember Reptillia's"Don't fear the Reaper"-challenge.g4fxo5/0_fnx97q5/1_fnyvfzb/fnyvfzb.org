The thing is I don't equal soulmate with automatically got together aka soulbond. imo a soulmate is someone who's made to be the most compatible person for you, to the very core, your soul. It doesn't mean u have to bond that way just that it's ur best (but not only) shot for lasting happiness. Of course the powers that be want that, because they made u that way, but alas; free will and all that.
