  Harry/Lily in the 70s is way less questionable IMO than Harry/any Hogwarts girl set during the books.

Why? Lily in the 70s and the 90s girls would be the same age, Harry would have the same mental age difference and he would have the same uneven acquaintanceship advantage in both cases. The only difference is that with Lily Harry is hiding a first degree blood relation, making the relationship much more questionable.
