  The Reptillia challenge usually takes Harry aged around 17-18 and drops him back into the start of either year 1 or 3 or 4 with the goal of getting together with the girl. The first four years of Hogwarts would definitely be questionable. And even if they are older, it is basically a diety forcing them to get together, which is dubious content at best.

This is the same for Lily, unless by Lily in the 70s you just meant post Hogwarts Lily.

  it would not really be questionable since they have no memories and no regular mother/child relationship

But they're well aware of who they are in relation to each other. I guess it might not /really/ click for Lily, but Harry has no excuse IMO.

Again, unless by 70s Lily you mean just post Hogwarts Lily (which makes it an apples to oranges comparison really), the situation is the same aside from the incest angle. Even if you don't mind that, you can hardly count it as a positive element to make Harry/Lily less questionable than the other scenario. At best they're even.
