Lily, in the spring of 1977, would be 17 and not yet in a relationship with James. Harry, aged anything between 16 and 18, would be a suitable match age wise.

And two 17 year olds is certainly a better match than a situation which, no matter how noble the intentions, would result in, at the very least, unintentional grooming because Harry has a lot of insight into that person and the events about to transpire and would end up manipulating Hermione or whoever else even without wanting to do so. And that's not even considering deities having shipping wars and the impact that would have on free will and consent.

Harry thrown back a year wouldn't be bad. But that challenge has a vastly larger scope.
