The Reptillia challenge usually takes Harry aged around 17-18 and drops him back into the start of either year 1 or 3 or 4 with the goal of getting together with the girl. The first four years of Hogwarts would definitely be questionable. And even if they are older, it is basically a diety forcing them to get together, which is dubious content at best. Although the questionable bit there are not the actions of the time traveller but rather of whoever made that "plan".

  Harry is hiding a first degree blood relation

Who says anything about hiding that fact. Lily has no emotional connection to Harry and the only memories Harry has of her are due to dementors. As long as they adopt rather than have children on their own, it would not really be questionable since they have no memories and no regular mother/child relationship.
