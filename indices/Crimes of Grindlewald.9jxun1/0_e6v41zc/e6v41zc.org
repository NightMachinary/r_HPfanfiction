  Anyone else think that maybe JK Rowling went and read some fanfiction and decided to get in on the act?

Yes well considering the sheer amount of fanfics, it would be considerably hard for her to come up with something new. Especially given how very little thought she has been shown to give to all her non book additions to the setting. You can find a fanfic pre-empting basically everything written on Pottermore.
