  I also wonder, not for the first time, why a lot of people write Grindlewald and not Grindelwald.¯_(ツ)_/¯
#+end_quote

Because it's a German name and in English most words with that sound use /le/. Spind/le/, Cand/le/, Cast/le/, etc.

At least it's a more forgivable mistake than /Virgina/, /Hairy/, or /Dumbledoor/.
