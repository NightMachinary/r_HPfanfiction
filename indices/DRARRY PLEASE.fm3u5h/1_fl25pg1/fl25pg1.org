[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/119096]] (Lord of the rings crossover with Draco/Harry, it's good! Trust me!)

So I've read hundreds of Harry potter fics and I'm 100% certain that I have a decent amount of drarry fics HOWEVER FF.net is rubbish at organising stuff so I've got to troll through my follows and see what I've got which might take a while so.... Yeah.

I shall succeed!!!! (⌐■-■)

(The one above which I recommend, it really is one of the few drarry crossovers I've got so don't worry! Not all my fics are like that! )

I'll be back... Might take a few hours since I should be asleep but I WILL be back! (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
