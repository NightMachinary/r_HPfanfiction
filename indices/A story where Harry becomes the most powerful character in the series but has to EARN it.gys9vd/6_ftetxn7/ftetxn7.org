This is one of the more unique stories I've come across where the difference in the power of wizards really comes into play. Remember how Moody mentions in canon that the entire 4th year class could shout Avada kedavra at him and he wouldn't even get a nosebleed? This fic is probably the only fic that actually remembers that line and uses it properly.

I don't know if it fits your description exactly but it's very interesting, there's a lot of power involved and I don't recall any ass pulls.
