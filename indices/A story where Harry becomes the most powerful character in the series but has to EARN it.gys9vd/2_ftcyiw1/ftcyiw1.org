Try linkffn(a second chance at life) He transfers to another school in the US where he learns blood magic and all kinds of abscure magics. The school is only for the elite and there are vampires, werewolves and many other types of creatures there. Harry is nowhere near the strongest there so he works his way up, eventually being able to surpass your average vampire with ease. Most people there have at least 2 animagus forms that they train for and they get attacked by demons which are vicious, winged creatures that want to overtake the Earth. Its worth reading but it's quite long.

Edit: I think there might be a sequel to it.
