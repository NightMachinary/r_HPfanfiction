I really don't like this story. I tried reading, I really did. It has a lot of the things I like in HP Fanfiction. Wandless magic, unique creatures, unique magic, and good world building in general. It's just so slow, and bogged down. It is so different from HP that it should require a bit more info, but it goes way to far, and has way too much. I'd say if you like exploring whole new worlds with a crap ton of world building, this is the story for you. For me though, it's way too much, and barely keeps anything from HP beyond names.
