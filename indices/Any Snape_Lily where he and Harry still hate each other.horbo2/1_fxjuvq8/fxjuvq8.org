In /Obscura Nox Animae/ Snape doesn't care for Harry. The two don't really interact though, so if you're looking for that dynamic, this might not fit the bill.

But if you wanted to see Snape and Lily manage the conflict around his dislike for (and cruelty toward) Harry, then this fic does a pretty good job.

On top of that, it's a very unique premise, and the writing's great.
