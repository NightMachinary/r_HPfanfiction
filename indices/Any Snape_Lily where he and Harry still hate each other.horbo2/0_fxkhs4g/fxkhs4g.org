There's one that was very AU where James died and Voldemort was defeated somehow (I believe) but Lily was raising Harry on her own and once he went to Hogwarts started seeing Severus again. What she didn't know was that the two only 'behaved' when with her at home, but hated each other at Hogwarts. Sadly, thats all the info I have, I just spent 10 minutes looking for it in my documentation but it's not there.
