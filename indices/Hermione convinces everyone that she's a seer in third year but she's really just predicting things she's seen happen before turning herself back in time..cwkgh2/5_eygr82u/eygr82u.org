There was a story that i've been looking for myself where Harry Luna and Hermione are doing some time travel shenanigans. And in one of the chapters Hermione has to replace Tralawny taking the class she herself was in before she went back in time 12 hours. She ends up using her prior knowledge to mess with the class a lot.

It was an interesting fic that i've been looking for. It involves Fae, and something to do with the goblet of fire being a really REALLy powerful artifact that wasn't engaged to its full potential during canon GOF.
