I read a fic like this. It wasnt the focus, but it definitely happened. For the life of me I cant remember what the main plot was

Hermione saw Neville about to drop a teacup. She catches it as it falls.

Trelawney makes the prediction about something bad happening to the other gryffindor girl. Hermione has the girl make a list of what she thinks it could be, then makes sure those things won't happen.

That gryffindor girl ends up convinced that hermione is a seer on par with Trelawney.

/What the hell was this???/
