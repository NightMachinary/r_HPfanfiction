More a vignette than a story, but "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/A-Father-First-Damn-It][A Father First, Damn It!]]" by Madrigal-in-training has James take his family out of England when Dumbledore warns him to go into hiding.

The Potters leave in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12011178/1/Harry-Potter-the-Clockwork-Mage][Harry Potter the Clockwork Mage]]" by TheRavenIs. This story was removed, and has been reposted by the author. I don't know if it has been rewritten, because I didn't like it enough to read the whole thing the first time around.

There was one other story I had in which the Potters left England, but that author has removed all her stories.

I've got a number of "Harry leaves England after X happens" stories, several of which are not "Harry leaves after winning," but I'll have to try to post them later; my battery needs recharging, so I want to end this before my laptop shuts down.
