The few recommendations that come to mind aren't James and Lily running away during the first war but rather Harry running away with someone (which fit your second request)

*Nobody's Hero:* linkffn(7806752) has Harry and Ginny run away to France shortly after a few weeks after Sirius' death. Technically fit the "Potters run away" part as Harry and Ginny get married the night they leave so Ginny is a Potter. Unfortunately uncompleted.

*Finding a Place to Call Home:* linkffn(9885609) has Harry and Astoria Greengrass run away during the Triwizard Tournament.

*I See No Difference:* linkffn(13722277) has Harry and Hermione run away shortly after Harry's name is drawn out of the Goblet of Fire. Currently W.I.P.
