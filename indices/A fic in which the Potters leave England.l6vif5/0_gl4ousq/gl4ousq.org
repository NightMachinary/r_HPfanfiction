There's a one shot where it expounds on the fact that while James is a Gryffindor, his mother was a Black (fanon, I know) and he decides screw this and leaves for the Continent, knowing his child is at risk and he's -going to do everything he can to protect him-. So he and Lily and Harry leave with Sirius. Good thing he didn't take Peter. :)

As I recall, it implies he knows that if Voldemort tries to leave Britain, he'll have major trouble.
