Actually the patreon site is for my original fiction. As a perk, I offered some of my supporters an early preview of an nofp chapter that was posted in its entirety on ff.net a week later. You aren't missing out on anything except original novels with my characters in my world so I don't see where all this entitled rage is coming from. As for an actual legal fucking job, I am disabled and bed-bound and have been for several years. I started the patreon after I was rendered unable to work a traditional job.
