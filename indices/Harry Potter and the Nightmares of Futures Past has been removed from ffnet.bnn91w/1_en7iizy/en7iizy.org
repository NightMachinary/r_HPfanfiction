Still up on FFA under their other Pen name (Viridian Dreams) but without the recent update.

Just checked SIYE, and Phonex Song as well, both up, but last updated long ago (chap 40 for SIYE, and 38 for PS)

Can still get the whole thing (including new chap) via "e-book" format off of his forum on his own website.

Side note, I was under the impression that it was completely abandoned at this point, color me surprised.

Edit: a word

Edit 2: more info
