Yeah....and I need to wait too. For the writer to get back into things. After his accident and all. I'm actually kinda Lucky. Because I started reading nightmares only like....a week ago. I really respect the author, who is still writing this wonderful story, even though he's going through a hard time. Hope he gets well soon. and the fans too for sticking with him for so long.
