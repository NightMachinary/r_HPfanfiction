The only thing I can think of that makes sense given the stated reason is that somebody doesn't realise that S'TarKan = ViridianDreams and mistakenly assumed that the story had been copied.

I don't believe it's the Patreon thing or surely the ffn mods would have blanked the user profile page rather than one of the stories.

Hopefully it'll be back up again before long.
