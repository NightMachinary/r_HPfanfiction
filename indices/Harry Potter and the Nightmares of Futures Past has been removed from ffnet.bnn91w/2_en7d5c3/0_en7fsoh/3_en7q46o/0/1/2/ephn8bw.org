No listen, profit from fanfics are not allowed. Period. Believe me,if patron was allowed,the actual owners will sue the website. And if it comes to that I doubt the devs of ffnet will hesitate to shut it down. The so called "Donation" is,no matter how you put it,profit from property they have zero rights to.
