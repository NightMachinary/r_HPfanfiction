Yeah, but one could just as easily say that I'm not necessarily buying groceries, I'm just donating my money to the lovely grocery store for providing such a fine community service. It's a copyright violation. I am not a lawyer (I just play one on tv) but you'd be insane not to make the one-to-one between using someone else's characters to make money in this situation. That being said, I'd HAPPILY donate to my favorite authors. My morality here is in the author's favor. But A03/FF.net would be insane people to allow any kind of direct money donation because they would be sued into oblivion and rightfully so.
