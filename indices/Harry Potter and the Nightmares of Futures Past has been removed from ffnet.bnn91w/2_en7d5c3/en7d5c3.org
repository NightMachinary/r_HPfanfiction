Huh. I don't remember that story being very objectionable although it's possible that I'm overlooking something?

I felt that there was some buddying H/G stuff which would probably be weird even if Harry's future memories fade, but it seemed fine. I don't think I remember any crazy violence or anything like that either. I suppose there's some potential copyright implications of how the author does beta-ing though, but considering everything I assumed that everyone was okay with ignoring that.
