For Moody though, I don't think he meant to show it to Harry to be sobering. That was the way Harry took it when he realized so many people he knew had died for this war, and because he was feeling so miserable as it was. Moody seemed to show it to him because it reminded him of the good times, and the friends he fought this war with.

If Harry could show the picture to James or Teddy with the same intention, I think it would be a nice short fic. I'm also not sure how much Harry and the family would tell the kids about the war. The kids might see some familiar faces they've seen at Diagon or parties before, but never knew were in the DA.
