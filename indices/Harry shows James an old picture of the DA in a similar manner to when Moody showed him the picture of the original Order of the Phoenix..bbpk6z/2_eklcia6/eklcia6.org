Ok, I totally took this prompt as Harry shows James--- Harry's father--- the picture and assumed time travel would be involved. However reading through the comments, I can totally see how OP probably meant James Sirius---Harry's son.

My mind probably jumped to time travel as I typically prefer those over next-gen fics, but I can totally see it working if the pic that Moody shows Harry in canon was taken recently from when HP time travels. Potentially HP could have his copy from future-Moody on him to help prove validity. Maybe copies of that pic hadn't been handed out yet ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or HP popped in exactly as the picture was taken. Like /snap/ /poof---theres HP/ ‚Äúwho the hell are you‚Äù /everyone draws wands on HP/ etc. And then HP could follow up the ‚Äúold-Order pic‚Äù by showing his DA pic and perhaps an additionally updated Order pic--- where the Marauders get to marvel at old and scruffy looking Sirius & Remus as well as an even more mangled Moody.
