Wow, that was exactly the type of story I wanted when I saw this. So short, but so captivating. Would be nice to see a continuation where James goes looking for Dennis. Maybe he finds him through an ad for a photo gallery, because Dennis has followed in his brothers footsteps of being a photographer.
