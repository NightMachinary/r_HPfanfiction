"You need to do something about him, Harry." Neville ran a hand through his hair. "The way James acts...it's like he thinks he's a gift to Hogwarts and that it's my privilege to teach him. He doesn't understand...I wish I knew /why./"

"He's young," Ron suggested weakly. "He's really only known peace. Privilege really, given who his parents are. Can't really blame him for not getting it."

"He's almost seventeen." Harry said curtly. "When we were his age, we were risking our lives to bring down Voldemort and destroy his Horcruxes."

"I was leading the resistance inside Hogwarts...I still dream about some of the things the Carrows did."

"I get nightmares from when we were grabbed by the Snatchers...and Fred."

"I think I have an idea," Harry murmured.

James Potter, ever the arrogant arse, rolled his eyes. Another lecture from his father. Another lecture on how he wasn't applying himself and how he took too much for granted. Bullocks. He was James Sirius Potter, son of the war heroes Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley. If it weren't for them, then they'd all be under Voldemort's thumb. There wasn't enough ways to say "thank you" for that.

"This is us, Dumbledore's Army...I thought it might be a good idea if you saw what we were before, during the good days."

"So what?" He had met a few members of the DA too many times to count at all those remembrance dinners. And yeah, they fought against Voldemort. And his dad saved the world.

"There's your Uncle Fred. And Uncle George of course. Never saw one without the other then."

James smirked at the twin expressions of glee staring back at him. It was too bad that Fred had died during the War.

"That girl with the long hair is Lavender Brown. She wanted to design dress robes." A pretty girl with shiny brown hair waved. "During the Battle, she was mauled by Fenrir Greyback. Punctured a lung. Bled out before Pomfrey could check on her."

James stiffened.

"That small boy? Colin Creevey. One of your mother's best friends when they were in school. Threw himself at Dolohov after Lupin was killed. Last spell he ever cast was a Shield Charm over your mother.

"And Dennis? The little guy next to him? Shut himself up after the War. Nobody's seen or spoken to him in twenty years. I don't even know if he's alive."

This is tougher than I thought. I may come back to this.
