So, let me pose a simple question to you: if Hermione's a bad owner who's taking every class, as well as trying to make sure one of her closest friends doesn't end up dead, what does that make Ron?

He blames her for her cat's "actions" when, if you look at any type of animal attack save for maybe a spider and lizards, would require blood to be on more than just one sheet, as well as fur from the animal attacked, yet there wasn't. Just ginger cat hairs. Perhaps he was just looking for a reason to blame Hermione.

On top of that, this is when Hermione is also doing all of the work on Buckbeak's case. Ya know, to help a friend. Harry at least has the excuse of Quidditch, but Ron? He doesn't have the excuse of "too much homework" or Quidditch.

Both are at fault, but Ron's actions towards Hermione in the book like, I don't know, getting upset that she would rather have Gryffindor miss out on the Quidditch Cup in an attempt to keep her friend safe, is damning to the whole Scabbers thing. It's a two way street where if Ron wasn't an asshole, you'd have a valid claim. As it is, you trying to blame one person when the other--in the eyes of others at least--valued a broomstick over his friends' life
