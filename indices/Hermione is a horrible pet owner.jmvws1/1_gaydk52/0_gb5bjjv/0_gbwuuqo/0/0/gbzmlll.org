It is actually. It is fanon that it wears off. According to JKR herself, it affects an item down to the molecular structure itself.

For example, the Ministry attempted to reverse the Transfigurations on the Quintapeds but were unsuccessful so they remain transformed to this very day. There is an entire branch of Transfiguration dedicated to the reversal of transformations. A properly transfigured item (such as one done by an expert such as McGonagall or Dumbledore) would last forever unless intentionally reversed by someone.

Conjuration is temporary, but transfiguration is forever.
