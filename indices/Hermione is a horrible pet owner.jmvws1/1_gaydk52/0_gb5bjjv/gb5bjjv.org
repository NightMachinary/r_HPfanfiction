I just realised - Scabbers never left the protection of the boys' dormitory, except when Ron himself went out of Hogwarts - like back to his house. And the other boys didn't have problematic pets. Harry's owl didn't try to eat Scabbers even once.

Hell, Mrs. Norris never even went near Scabbers, and it's Filch's pet with unlimited access everywhere.

But who decided to bring something that proved times and times again to be dangerous to Scabbers? That's right, Hermione. Hermione never tried to stop Crooshank from coming to the Boys' dormitory. In fact, she encouraged it.

Cats are pets. You need to teach them where they are allowed to go and where they aren't. By violating the sanctity of the boys' dormitory, Hermione effectively told her cat "it's okay to go on there". By never punishing her cat for attacking Scabbers, she effectively told him Scabbers was fair game.

What could Ron do, then? Buy a cage to hold his pet rat? With what money? The Weasleys are poor as heck. Send Scabbers back home? Then why have a pet in the first place?

Ron did protect Scabbers. Not to the fullest of his abilities - but then, he wouldn't think about his wants or his pet's wants.

Furthermore, owls eat cats. Should Hermione buy a cage for her cat? Owls are on the "authorised pets" list. Or maybe, it's Harry who should cage Hedwig. Hmmm, decisions, decisions...
