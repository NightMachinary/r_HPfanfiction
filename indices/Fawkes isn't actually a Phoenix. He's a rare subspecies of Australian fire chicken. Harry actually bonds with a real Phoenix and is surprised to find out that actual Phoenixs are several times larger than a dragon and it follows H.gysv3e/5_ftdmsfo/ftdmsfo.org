Last night I dreamed about about the American Thunderbird and as I petted it I marveled at its size. I woke up wanting to look it up because I had the thought that the Thunderbird and Phoenix were similar but in Fantastic Beasts Newt's friend was huge compared to Fawkes.

I decide to look at my Reddit messages and found this post. A dragon sized magical bird? After that dream I don't feel I have a choice but to add this prompt to my to do list. Warning: a thunderbird and Snape will make an appearance.
