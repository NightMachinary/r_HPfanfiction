Now there's a thought.

"Ohhh! A unicorn!" Girls swooned as they spotted a bright white unicorn.

"Careful 'ere, students." Hagrid said in a deep voice. "You see that one black hair on the tail?"

"Oh that's so pretty."

"That just makes it even better!"

"I know, right!"

"Tha' unicorn is from Australia." Hagrid finished his introduction.

A silence felt over the group and the girls who had decided to step a bit closer instantly drew back in fear.

"Ha.. Haa.. Hagrid!" One of the students whispered fearfully. "Don't go near it. You don't know how it'll kill you!"

"Ohh. Don't fret students!" Hagrid said jovially. "I'm from Australia too!"
