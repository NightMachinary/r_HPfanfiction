there is actually a species of phoenix like bird in Persian/middle eastern mythology called Anqa(also called Simurgh in some stories.) and it is said to be large enough to carry full grown elephants to its nest in its talons.

In classic myths, Anqas are said to live in Khaf mountains but Some porteguese explorers that have visited madagascar are also known to give similar accounts of giant elephant eating birds(there was a giant species of eagle that ate elephant birds tjat lived in madagascar at that time.) Location of Khaf mountains change from story to story; some children tales give contradictary locations like south arabia or norther iran, but in medieval middle eastern mythology, khaf mountains are usualy depicted as a circular mountain range made out of emerald and jade stones that circle the world and prevent its oceans from flowing out.

Many other mythological creatures are said to live in khaf mountains such as Devs(persian word for giant.), PÃ¢ris(persian word for fairy), as well as manticores and djinns.
