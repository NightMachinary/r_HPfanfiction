How about Dumbledore knows that Fawkes is an Australian fire chicken and has done everything in his power, including taking books about real Phoenixes out of Hogwarts. With him teaching enough of the British Wizarding World about "Phoenixes" using Fawkes as an example that the new books printed in Britain use Fawkes as a reference and the old books are thought to be wrong.

Dumbledore perpetuated the lie that Fawkes is a Phoenix because an Australian Fire Chicken is a magical cross between a minka and a mulduwanke. The Minka is a bird, that featured in the stories of the Ngarrindjeri people of the Murray River in South Australia. The minka were believed to foretell death. The mulduwanke is a similar bird of the Ngarrindjeri, but instead of foretelling death it stole children. Both were believed to live in dark recesses. When an Australian Fire Chicken bonds with a magical person it is foretelling they are an extremely evil person who will steal magic from children. Also there is no way that the human can break the bond. So Dumbledore casts a very strong glamour that changes the looks of Fawkes and to mimic the burning days. He also casts a audio equivalent of a glamour to hide Fawkes cries. Also a male Australian Fire Chicken aka an Australian Fire Rooster is what can kill a basilisk, not a domestic rooster.

Harry bonds with the real phoenix sometime before he fights the basilisk and his phoenix is the one who heals him or bonds with him because of or during healing him. Or Fawkes kills the basilisk before it bites Harry.

Also the brother wands with phoenix feathers Tom's wand does use one of Fawkes's feathers but Harry's wand uses one of his real phoenix's feathers and either Garrick Ollivander was spelled to believe they were from the same bird in some way or spelled to say they were.
