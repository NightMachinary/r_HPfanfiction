The completed story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]] by DerLaCroix is probably worth a look. In it, a medical oversight leaves Harry with a piece of Basilisk Fang in one of his bones, then during the Third Task, a Dragon's spike impales him in the exact same spot.

End result? Basilisk Venom + Phoenix Tears + Dragon Bone = Alchemical Metamorphosis.

And Harry doesn't know what's going on, but no longer trusts adults enough to ask for help...
