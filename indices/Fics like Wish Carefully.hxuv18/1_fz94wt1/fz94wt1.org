The Golden Age is a canon compliant continuation fic that tells a story where the good guys get everything they want, but as in Wish Carefully the results aren't really what they wanted. Don't read it unless you can appreciate some less-than-gentle ribbing towards the main characters of HP.

Something Like Your Family is a fic where Harry takes the long view in his revenge plan. It's a lot like Wish Carefully. I don't want to say anything else because I don't want to spoil it, but I think you'll really like it.
