Probably the most aggravating scene in the book for me, because there's no way anyone with half a brain would have bought the hurricane story.

Weather satellites had been a significant thing for two decades by that point. Hurricanes show up on them for quite a while since they take days to form out at sea, and then break apart. The damage isn't even remotely similar to what a hurricane hitting should be, since there's no flooding mentioned.

Tornado is barely plausible, and might have been what they meant. In which case it's abysmal editing.
