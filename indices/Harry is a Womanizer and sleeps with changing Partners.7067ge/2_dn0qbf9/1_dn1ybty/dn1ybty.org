yeah, ok. He doesnt have to be a Womanizer but sleep around with several Partners, but it would be nice IF he is one. The icing of the Cake would be a one-sided Attraction of Hermione for Harry (the idea for this came in mind from "The Best Man" by luckintheair04, in which Ron and Hermione are marrying, but Harry leaves the celebration. At some Point, she divorces and visits Harry to ask for a place to stay. Unknowingly of her Harry has started a Session with his secretary, but she confess she is ok with it, so she waits until he is finished. I have to admit, that since its a H/Hr Fic, it has double-edged Thoughts/feelings about the situation awoken in me)
