If you're into Lovecraft, I have massive list of Lovecraftian HP Fics over on this other thread - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fo50ge/are_there_any_good_lovecraftian_harry_potter/]]

Other than that, I'd suggest just going back through the older threads of this subreddit and seeing what you can find. I've gotten a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't seem to be recommended much these days but is all over threads a couple years back.
