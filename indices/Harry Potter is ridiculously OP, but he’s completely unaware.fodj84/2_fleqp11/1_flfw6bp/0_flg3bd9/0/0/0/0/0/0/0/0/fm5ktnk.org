Exactly. I'm quite willing to accept that I might've been wrong about it - psychologists have known that the time of day can have obnoxiously strong effects on people for ages now. Could just have been in a bad mood that day. Could also have been accurate - but there's no shame or issue in trying again. I'd hate missing out on a good thing more than I'd care about being wrong, so eh. :)

Do you have a playthrough or tutorial you'd recommend? No biggie if you don't, I'm just curious.

And oh really? That's quite interesting - I really liked what you did with the Goblins and the big distaff reveal. It's pretty rare to see a Helpful Goblins Time Travel fic where the traveller gets accused of something by Goblins and ends up spilling a lot of details. And quirky Death is always fun. Might I ask what you didn't like about it yourself?
