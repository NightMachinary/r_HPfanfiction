Oh, I don't deny they're fair. They are. Scrupulously so. You do everything perfect and get the right 'code' of attacks and dodges and you win. You make a mistake, and you die. It's the same way most games are, just turned up to eleven. And yes, the Animations and Level Design were both gorgeous. The way the first section interlinked with itself and hid passages and such was a delight to see.

I never really found it terribly rewarding though. It was just "Move, dodge, move, die three seconds into the fight, return after death, move, dodge, move, dodge, die four seconds into the fight, return after death, move, dodge, move, dodge, attack, dodge, die six seconds into the fight" over and over. And that was every fight that was more than one or two of the human townspeople.

That's what I meant about a brick wall. You're essentially doing what some hackers do to get passwords - brute-forcing patterns of combinations until you get the answer that lets you through. Thus, slamming your head against the wall (ie. doing the same thing over and over and getting hurt for it) until it breaks (ie. Victory!).

I enjoyed every bit of the story and world I saw, even the enemies were cool and interesting to see and wonder about, but that mechanical repetition code-cracking was quite dull. I saw it as a "I just have to do this fight for thirty minutes and die twelve times and then I can see more of the game" block, I suppose. The fights were a block to experiencing the game, the game wasn't a reward for the fights.

And I totally agree. It's perfectly fine to enjoy the genre as much as it is not to. My opinion neither modifies nor supercedes yours and vice versa. I do apologise if I come off that way - tone is hard to connote over the internet and all - but i am just genuinely curious.
