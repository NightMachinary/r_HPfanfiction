Hi - apologies for the immense delay in response. Life shit unfortunately piled up and I had to put a lot of hobby stuff on the back burner to get it all done.

I did, however, get to watch some of that walkthrough and replay the game (up until I beat the first boss - the 'Cleric Beast') and it definitely helped. I admit, I still feel a little like it's deliberately fighting me to stop me progressing, but that feeling is reducing as I get a feel for things. I even beat the executioner guy hiding behind the barrels right after the first lever-gate thingy.

And ah, okay. Well, there's gotta be some consolation in that - despite your shitty tropes, people stuck around and found the story a great read. You may be using something bad, but you made something pretty good out of it. :)

And I hear you're writing a new one as well, so you can take those mistakes and use the new story as a second chance to do things better. (Heh). Really looking forward to reading that once I find the time to get a little further into Bloodborne proper, since I've seen from comments by yourself and others that it's pretty linked in to the game proper. :)
