This is a fantastic no-commentary playthrough from a very experienced player, where they basically trash on all the bosses apart from a select few that are difficult regardless of your level of experience: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJyc-sD1DiY]]

Honestly, it's mostly the shitty tropes and foundation that I used to prop up the fic in the beginning. There's a lot of strange plots that I had that don't really go anywhere because I still didn't know how I wanted to get from point A to B, so I just made it up as I went along - and it shows.

It's just largely incoherent for almost the entire first half of the story, and I strongly dislike it because of that.

But, I am quite happy to see the story where it is now even if 99% of the readers have no idea why the fuck I'm making the decisions I am with the story, but I know exactly where it's going now and how to get there (hint hint, only four more chapters).
