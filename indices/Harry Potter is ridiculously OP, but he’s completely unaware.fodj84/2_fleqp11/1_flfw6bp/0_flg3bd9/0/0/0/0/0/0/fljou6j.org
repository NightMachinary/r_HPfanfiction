Good to know. I've always been slightly leery of that being an issue after my current friendship group kept getting anxious over my using full-stops and wondering what they'd done to annoy me. I was so baffled to find out 'k.' was supposedly irritated where 'k' wasn't. Punctuation Slang is weird. :D

It's a fair point. I imagine most people hear about the 'get gud scrub' culture of Dark Souls and paint Bloodborne with the same brush and many of those who don't try it would probably enjoy Bloodborne where they wouldn't enjoy the (in my view) far more malicious Dark Souls.

Given your quite sincere enjoyment and views, it does seem that I'm missing something perceptively here - mulling over my experience, my opinion was definitely coloured slightly by the circumstances in which I played the game (I usually spend a lot of time out of the house, so enforced quarantine and mild cabin-fever does not make for an overly sound/objective mindset for me), so I'll likely try again once this whole thing is over and I'm feeling a little more prepared. If I can make it through Board Policy Meetings, I can make it through anything. :D

EDIT - As a quick aside: I didn't see your tag until now, and I just wanted to say I absolutely adore your fic. You're an excellent storyteller, to the point where I reread the whole of your fic every so often over a couple of sittings. :)
