See, I would argue against the brick wall metaphor. While the games are notoriously difficult, they're still fair to the player.

The closest thing I could compare them to would be a rhythm game. You find the pace for each boss and enemy and roll with it.

It's an incredibly rewarding experience with phenomenally tight animation direction and carefully planned levels and enemies, and beating an area you may have been having trouble with is such a great feeling.

It's only a brick wall if you choose to see it that way, and it's totally fine to not enjoy the genre. Everyone has their own tastes. I'm just saying not to miss out on a top notch title based on one mishap.
