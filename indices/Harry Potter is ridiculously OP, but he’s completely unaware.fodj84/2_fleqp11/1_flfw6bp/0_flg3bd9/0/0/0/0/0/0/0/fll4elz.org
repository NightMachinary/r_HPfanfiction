Hahaha. Yeah, the English language - especially typed slang - is just so incredibly fucking strange.

Oh, there's definitely a lot of that 'git gud' mentality and I won't argue against having some of it myself, but Bloodborne is probably the most accessible title within the genre due to sheer entertainment value.

Don't push yourself to enjoy it if you don't feel like you can, but I've noticed that a lot of players tend to just go at the game with the wrong mindset in hand.

A major part of the series /is/ dying. You learn from your mistakes and discover the patterns of the enemies, level, and bosses, until you figure out a way to crack the code or come back more powerful than before and stomp all over that big bad bastard. Honestly, there's no shame in watching a tutorial or playthrough just to get a sense of what people familiar with the genre play it like. I know that's what made me realize that I was playing the series incorrectly, and while what I was doing was effective, it wasn't /fun./

Thank you! I'm happy to hear you enjoy the story. While I really, really don't like how it started I'm pretty happy with how the story has turned out as I've developed as a writer.
