It's been /ages/ since I read it (it finished in 2005!), but that's a pretty big plot point in linkffn(2163835).

Basically plot happens to harry and his magic gets much more refined, and he doesn't realize what it actually means for him, so he's able to do all sorts of shit that he really shouldn't be able to do (like melting down galleons without explicitly breaking the protections the goblins put on it first)
