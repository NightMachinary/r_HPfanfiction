Snape: linkffn(To Shape and Change)

Ginny: linkffn(Ginny Returns; From the Spark to the Flame)

Ron: linkffn(The Red Knight) (technically he is reborn, but its functionally the same thing)

Harry's Twin Brother: linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw)

There is also a whole host of fics about the next generation time-traveling back to visit there parents, most of which involve them returning to some time around the 5th book. Ironically CC would not seem that different from most of them.

Also, there are several fics where multiple people are time-traveling along with Harry. I personally enjoy these more than solo stories, since it strikes me that someone traveling into the past by themselves could easily devolve into insanity. Examples include linkffn(Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always; We are the Golden Trio!).

As an aside, has anyone ever found a Luna and/or Neville time-traveling fic? I feel like this would be entertaining, as how much they know about beforehand is up in the air.
