Why? It seems worse than a stunning charm in every way, since not hitting a vital area doesn't take out an opponent and still allows them to attack back, like James did after Snape cut his cheek, if Snape had used a stunning or disarming charm he would have won, not to mention that any enemy could be simply under the imperius and even those who arent are more useful alive, since they can be questioned.

And even if you want to kill the death eaters nothing stops you from slitting their throat after stunning them.
