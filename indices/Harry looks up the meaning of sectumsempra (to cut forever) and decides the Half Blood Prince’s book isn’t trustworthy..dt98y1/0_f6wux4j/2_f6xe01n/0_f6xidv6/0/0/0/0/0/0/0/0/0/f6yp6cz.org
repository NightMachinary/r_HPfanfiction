Shield dont always deflect sometimes they just negate the attack. And literally only the Killing Curse was mentioned to be difficult to shield against, for all the other spells it seems to be entirely dependent on the skill of the caster.

Sure lethal force isn't necessarily bad, but its certainly less than ideal when your opponent could be fighting against his will under the imperius. Like sure it would still be justified since your own life is in danger, but its really not much harder to incapacitate them non-lethaly.
