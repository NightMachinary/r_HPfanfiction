If you deflect a blasting curse into the ground next to you, that will end up rather badly for you. If you do the same with a stunner, nothing happens. And there are certainly a few other spells which are difficult to shield against.

Also, nothing wrong with lethal force. Molly Weasley does it in canon. And authorising the unforgivables against Death Eaters has precedent.
