Allowed to? Maybe. Reasonable force is usually a thing, depending on your jurisdiction. If you have a perfectly nonlethal countermeasure that you DON'T use - which Harry and co. do 100% of the time - then you are, in fact, not allowed to resort to murder willy-nilly.

Oh, and Malfoy was, in fact, being coerced - Voldemort would have killed his dad had he not.
