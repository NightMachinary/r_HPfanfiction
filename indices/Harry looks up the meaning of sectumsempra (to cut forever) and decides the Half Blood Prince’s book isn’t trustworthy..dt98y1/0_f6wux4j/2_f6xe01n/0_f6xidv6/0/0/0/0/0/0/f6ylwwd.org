Coercion is not a valid defense for both, war crimes and crimes against life. Basically, what you were threatened to do must not be worse than what you did. Malfoy was threatened with the MURDER of his father and he tried to MURDER Dumbledore. Hence not a valid defence. And no one forced Malfoy to attack Rosmerta or Katie Bell. No one forced him to use the Imperius. That's entirely on him, not Voldemort. And those attacks were especially condemnable since he basically strapped a bomb vest to a civilian.

Also, stunners and the disarming spell are easily shielded. Which makes them stupid to use if your life is on the line. You want something that's difficult, if not impossible to defend against, since you have a good chance of snuffing it if you don't win. In that specific fight, Malfoy was trying to use the "I make you almost braindead" curse.
