If a bunch of racially motivated, fascist terrorists decide to attack a school, then that's not really a concern. I mean, if you get to interrogate them, fine. If they die, well, better them than the children or the defenders. You should not endanger your lives for those of the people coming to kill you.

Unless you work for an intelligence agency, but that does not apply to Harry nor anyone other than Dumbledore, who can easily 1v5 the Death Eaters either way and does not need to resort to Sectumsempra. And maybe Moody.
