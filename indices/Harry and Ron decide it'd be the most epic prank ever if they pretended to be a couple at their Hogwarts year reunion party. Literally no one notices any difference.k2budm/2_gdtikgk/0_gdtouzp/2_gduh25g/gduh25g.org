I wouldn't say that it hates slash, but just that the most common slash pairing are unfortunately incredibly toxic ones. I've read some of the Harry and Ron slash fics that are out there and enjoyed a few of them (the ones I didn't were mainly just because of poor writing), but I absolutely refuse to read a Drarry or Snarry fic for the same reason I won't read a Dramione fic, I hate the idea of people being paired with someone who consistently abused them.
