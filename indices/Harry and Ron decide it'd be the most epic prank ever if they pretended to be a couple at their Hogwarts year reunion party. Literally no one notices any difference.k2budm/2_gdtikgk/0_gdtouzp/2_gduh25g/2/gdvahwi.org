Oh, come on. It's obvious in this thread than any other that "most common slash pairings are toxic" is just an excuse to validate homophobia in this subreddit. The original comment was about Harry/Ron, the most vanilla lgbt ship possible in this fandom.

How many times have you seen Delenda Est recommended in this sub? Because I'm pretty sure it's in top 3, at least. So how is it that a fanfic with Harry/Bellatrix as the main pairing can be so popular, while Harry/Draco requests are downvoted to hell? They are both Enemies-to-Lovers ships, but I'm sure we can all agree that only one of the enemy characters there is completely irredeemable, and it's not the desperate teenager.

Edit: Lol, cheers.
