Aside from what [[/u/KimeraGoldEyes]] said I can think of two other reasons. 1. The movies portray Ron as a garbage character, all his good moments are given to others and he's downgraded to comic relief at best which played into a lot of fanon tropes about how awful he/and the Weasleys in general are and 2. I think Harry-Ron are just a really solid platonic friendship, there's rough patches but overall just a really good friendship and there aren't enough positive depictions of friendships imo
