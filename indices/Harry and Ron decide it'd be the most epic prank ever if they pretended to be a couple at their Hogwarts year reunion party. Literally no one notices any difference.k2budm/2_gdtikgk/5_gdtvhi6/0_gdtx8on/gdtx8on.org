I find it ridiculously stupid that people downvote others because they like a certain ship that includes the LGBT community, or even a ship they disagree with. Whenever I see a ship I personally disagree with, I just scroll past it. Just because I don't like reading female ships most of the time, that doesn't mean I'm going to downvote someone who asks for Hermione/Luna or Ginny/Luna. That'd be pretty freaking hypocritical considering most everything I read tends to involve male ships, as well. People should just ignore the things they don't agree with rather than shoving their small-minded views and biases down other peoples' throats.
