I'm not a Ron basher, I just find his personality not to my taste. When Harry let him come slinking back after the first task in GOF, I was surprised that Harry was so forgiving. I just don't relate to Ron being a bit of a flakey friend. He's a normal kid, for sure, but not the sort of kid I'd have hung out with in high school myself.

We're allowed to have personal likes and dislikes. I also don't voluntarily read any fic where McGonagall has a leading role - doesn't make me a McGonagall hater, it just means she's not my cup of tea.
