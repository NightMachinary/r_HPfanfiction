First of all, I remembered the only good Harry/Cho fic around, even if it is basically ancient by now. It's still very enjoyable. linkffn(4259161)

Given that the most common f/f Hermione pairings are Ginny, Fleur, and Pansy, I excluded those.

There is /Dignity in fear/, which is a 5th-year rehash with a Hermione/Tonks pairing. The recent chapters have moved into the summer before 6th year, but I don't like the direction of those since they feel like an author insert about homosexual solidarity. You can, however, pretend that it is a complete 5th-year story if you just read chapters 1-23. I really love this story because the author has a very unique, outstanding way to depict emotions. It also gave me the idea for /Under Guard/, which is a one-shot with the same pairing and a similar premise, but a focus on humour.

There are several Fem!Harry/Hermione stories, which do not read like the usual Harmony fare. The first one is Hermione centric with a dark-ish MC. The second one is just fun entertainment which goes into crack territory (Fem!Harry goes drinking with Bellatrix). linkffn(11602420; 11629750)

For Hermione/Luna, there are a couple choices as well. linkffn(9940328; 3973687) Looking through Ao3, there are a few decent ones around there. In no particular order linkao3(1243798; 1678169)

And the sequel to /Call Me/ is Mandy Brocklehurst/Pansy Parkinson, which is decently written after the first chapter but sadly hasn't updated for quite some time (I offered to beta it but haven't heard from the author in months). linkffn(12884777)
