The story is decently written and free of bashing. It has teenagers being teenagers (sex, drinking, parties, trying out drugs). The characters act in a believable way, even if Lisa's father is a little too reasonable in two scenes. There is just a small amount of angst involved. It's a good, character driven feel-good story, not a grand epic.

I would consider it top-tier because it is a nice change of pace to the usual "summer after Sirius died" stories. If it's the first fanfic you were to read with that setting, it wouldn't hold up well. But after 2846826 IndyHarry stories, bashing orgies and canon rehashes, it's highly enjoyable.
