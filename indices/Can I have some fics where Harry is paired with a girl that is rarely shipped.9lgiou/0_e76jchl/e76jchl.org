For Lisa Turpin there is /Call Me/, which in turn inspired me to make her the love interest in /No Longer Alone/. The first one is a romance where people are reasonable (too much so in two scenes), the one I wrote is a 4th year AU with a romantic subplot (so the main focus is on other things).

/Whatever happened to Bromance/ is Harry/Romilda, even if what's going on is more lust-driven than romantic. Also has a likeable McLaggen (I know). linkffn(5445767)

If you count Narcissa Malfoy, there's linkffn(10503844).

There are also a few Hermione/"background woman" rare-pairs I could recommend if you are into that.
