I love linkffn(Dirty Blood) . It is brilliant, even if it is still just in the 5th year and hasn't been updated for some time, but I don't give up hope. The characters are all brilliant and realistic and they read as teenagers, without being terrible cliches and they all feel unique and the characters never feel one-dimensional. It gives Lily some female friends without them being Marauders in pink
