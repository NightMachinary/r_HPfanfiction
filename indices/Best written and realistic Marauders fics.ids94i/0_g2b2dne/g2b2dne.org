so this one is from a different angle, mostly looking at Regulus, from an older Sirius' POV, but I found it to be extremely credible.

Regulus in this is a precious bean but not in the ways it's usually presented. poor kid.

Though if you're a snape fan or overly armoured with the marauders, you may not enjoy it, even though it's from Sirius' POV
