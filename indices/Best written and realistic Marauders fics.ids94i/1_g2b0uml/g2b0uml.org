[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights]] is absolutely brilliant. The characters are very well-written, and they act exactly how I imagined. No stupid nicknames and obnoxious pet names for teachers, no love at first sight for James and the story focuses on other things than "pranks all the time". I highly recommend the story even if it will have wolfstar in later chapters.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/chapters/33372651][The Mapmakers]] was a nice surprise. I read it recently, and though some plot-points seemed a little too far-fetched, I enjoyed the story very much.
