Um, no, I don't write stories with a "goal to put any specific characters into a romance." I write stories to write stories. To explore plots and character interactions and worldbuilding fun. My main character is bisexual, and she has been in a few relationships before, and she will go through a few more over the course of the story, but she is just not a romantic type, and she prefers being single and doing what she loves in the world. :) So she will always end up getting out of the relationships eventually, either because she ends them or the other person does. But she does enjoy casual sex, if the time and person is right.

So yes, relationships for her are more like curiosities. Like sampling food.
