I think I might just store away this idea to write later in my ideas folder! Well, two separate versions of it actually! One with female!harry/normal Neville, and then one with normal harry/female!Neville. :) I think the latter will turn out to be more interesting for me to write. Or at least more challenging, because I'm not really too great at writing guy characters. Especially not if they're the MAIN character - I only write girls, because I'm a girl.
