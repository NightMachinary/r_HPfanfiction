Exactly, and it doesn't have necessarily be Neville as the male, we could have a completely different Longbottom, because being female, Augusta probably wouldn't keep comparing her to her father, so the kid wouldn't have the same personality, which could be a "catalyst" to have a stronger friendship with Harry from the get-go, evolving into a romantic relationship later on.

Its really something I've always wanted to read, there's a few fem!Ron or fem!Draco, but never fem!Neville. And whenever its fem!Harry, its either femSlash or its paired with Cedric, Twins(one or both), Snape or Draco, so it gets stale. No love for Neville.
