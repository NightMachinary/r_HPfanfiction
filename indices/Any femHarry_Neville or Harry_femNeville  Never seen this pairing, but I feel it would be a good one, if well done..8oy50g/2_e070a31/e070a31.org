Oh, that's something I have never read before EVER! :) But it sounds like it could be pretty interesting! :) Taking their similar backgrounds, their shared prophecy-ness, and the blossoming friendship in OOTP, except you make it continue on into a romantic partnership! :) What if Neville went along on the Horcrux hunt too with her? What if they went to the YULE BALL in 4th year? What if all those instances in year 1, like the broom class incident, the three headed dog stuff, all were what cemented Neville's crushing on her? :) But it isn't really realized until like 4th year?
