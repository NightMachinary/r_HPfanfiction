Check another comment from AlmaLamaEmperorKusko and my response, its basically that. It has a load of different opportunities that can make a divergence from canon with next to no effort, while also being something that's rarely, if ever, done. I'm also a huge fan of Neville, but I don't like slash, so I'd never read a Harry/Nev, if there's even one.
