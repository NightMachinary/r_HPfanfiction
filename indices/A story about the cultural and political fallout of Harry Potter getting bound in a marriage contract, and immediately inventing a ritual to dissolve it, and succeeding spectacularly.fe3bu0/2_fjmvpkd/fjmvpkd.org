Another thought: Being able to break a contract is not too crucial - if everyone wanted to break them if they could, they would not have been made in the first place. If your parents are willing to do this to you, odds are you were raised to think it is ok and will do it to your kids. So, the contract is not as important as the social pressure and custom.
