The rules for each of the threads are in the first post of that thread... As for the review tags, you tag the last person who posted, and that's the person/story you review. Someone tags you and reviews your story in return. Those would probably be the best place to ask for reviews, although you can post your story in the thread "Pimp and Promote your story"
