  ...and a strong first chapter

And a good summary. Actually summarize the story, not just the divergence point. Main character pairings should already be in the character stats, don't repeat them or list every single pairing. Do not include author's notes^{1.} Do not use sentences that start with "What if Harry was..." or "Watch Harry as he..."^{2.}

^{1} "BETA'D UP TO CHAPTER 7!"

^{2} "...takes the magical world by storm!"
