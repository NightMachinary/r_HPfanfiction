- Harry-centric. No question.

- Powerful and competent Harry. Wish fulfillment is a big aspect of fanfiction. Write the story of a life you wish you had, with power, money, success, and witches, written in a way that makes it sound like Harry's PoV instead of you projecting, and the readers will come rushing in. Few people outside of Hurt/Comfort fans like seeing a weak, doormat Harry.

- Good writing, intriguing summary, interesting premise, and a strong first chapter. New readers will check out a fic by scanning the first chapter, and if they don't like it, won't keep reading. If you ask authors, most will say their stats show that their Chapter 1 will have 4-5x as many hits as Chapter 2, and it curves down as the chapters go on. Give people a reason to check your fic out, by writing a spell-checked summary with a strong hook.

- Action/Adventure category with a magic system and setting that leans close to the books without major background adjustments (eg. Muggle AU, coffee shop/university AU, werewolf alphas AU, Cursed Child AU). Other popular sub-categories are Suspense, Humor, and Romance.

- Rating T, M, or higher. Means the fic will have swearing, violence, and sexual themes. People love dark and edgy content, and a high rating shows that your fic is not going to be a simple kidfic. The average HP fanfic reader is much older than in the heyday of HP fanfics, back in 2003, and as many of us OG readers aged with the books, we don't to read HP fics with the same childish tone of Philosopher's Stone.

- Updates frequently, or on a regular set schedule with dates posted. Once a week at the same time each week and you will get readers opening your fic who normally don't read fics until they're completed, because they trust that it won't be abandoned.
