Regarding your first point, stories don't have to be Harry-centric to get a good number of reviews. There are plenty of other stories that don't have Harry as the main character that have gotten thousands of reviews. The Three Portals, Games are Afoot, Applied Cultural Anthropology, Have You Ever, Ultima Ratio are just a few off the top of my head that are stories in which Harry isn't the main character but have gotten many, many reviews.
