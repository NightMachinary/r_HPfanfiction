An Indy, god mode Harry fix it story with a goddess Hermione, a non-existent Ron, best friend Neville or Draco, and a manipulative, idiot Dumbledore. Maybe throw in a kind Snape and a super bitch McGonagall, a Daphne Greengrass who has always wanted to be Hermione's bestie, seer Luna, and potion master Ginny.

You don't have to use all these clichés, close your eyes and throw darts on a board.

On a more serious note, pick a cliché or a fav pairing and do something new with it.
