To be honest, the bulk of readers at any given point are the ~1-2 year types who just get into any fandom. Most often, these people immediately go for the wish-fulfillment and common tropes - Dumbledore/Weasley/Ministry bashing, OP!Harry or OP!Hermione, insta-romances, harems, and fix-it or canon-rehashes. And they think thats amazing, not realizing its almost literally carbon-copied 20,000 times on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] /alone/.

Thats not just in Harry Potter either; its fairly common to see nearly identical reviews in these types of fics across genres. Go look at say some of the low-brow Naruto, Star Wars, or Game of Thrones fics (not the ASOIAF ones so much though) and you will see the same sorts of wish-fulfillment stories get the most reviews.

The question you should ask though is the same one you could say about the writing itself: its about the /quality of the reviews, not the quantity/. Most of those aforementioned fics have texting-style meaningless reviews (either good or bad). In its own way, the quality of the review(er) says something about the quality of the fic itself I think.
