There are certain types of fic that seem to garner higher numbers of reviews and the more reviews you have, the more you get. Don't ask me why; the logic escapes me. But it seems that many readers are more inclined to leave a review on a fic that already has plenty. And there are review games that will guarantee comments. But really, don't you think it would be pretty soul-destroying to be pandering after readers rather than writing something you really believe in? I reckon that no matter how many reviews you get, you'd pretty soon get sick of writing it and you'd probably start to despise your readers.
