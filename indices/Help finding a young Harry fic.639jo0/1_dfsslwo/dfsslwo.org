I'm intrigued.

But the only Ravenclaw Harry to come to mind right now is BakenandEgg's fanfics, and Penelope I don't even think has any moments in that series.

Do you tend to read incompletes? Regardless do you think you could estimate its length? Like it's definitely longer than 10,000 words, etc. Lastly, do you think you can recall what site it may have been on?

Any or all of those could help narrow it down.
