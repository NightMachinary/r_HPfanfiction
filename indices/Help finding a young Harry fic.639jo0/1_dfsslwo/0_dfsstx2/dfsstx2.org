It definitely was longer than 50,000 words, and I don't think it was complete, but it might've been. Just for reference, Penelope wasn't a listed character, but she showed up in a couple scenes and was ensnared by Harry's adorableness. I vaguely remember a scene where Penelope reprimanded Harry for something then felt bad afterwards because of how adorable he was and how sad he looked. And it definitely was on FFN.
