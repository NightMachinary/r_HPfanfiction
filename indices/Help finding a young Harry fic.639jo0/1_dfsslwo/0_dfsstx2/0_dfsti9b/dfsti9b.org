Well, I did a very basic search on FFN using the search term Ravenclaw, under Harry Potter (Books), put Harry as a character, and then made it include only 50k and up fics.

I went through opening up any that talked about Harry being the main character and was starting from actual first year, and then skipped around in the few chapters to see if a ctrl+f would find "Penelope" or if the chapter titles had anything hinting at what you read.

I can't guarantee that it wasn't in that stack at all, but I'm like 90% sure it's not. Unless you think that scene you described happened way later in the narrative.. Harder to be confident then.

But that means it is either (1) probably a story with a Ravenclaw Harry that doesn't have Ravenclaw in the title or summary or (2) a story that got deleted/removed.

But yeah, sorry, it's gotten too general for me to search. But OMG, I just noticed you found it yourself, so I don't need to feel bad.

Good sleuthing!
