I recommend these two all the time, but with good reason.

Firstly, linkao3(2345300) ‘The Very Secret Diary' is literally just a story told through Ginny's diary entries from Chamber of Secrets. It's haunting because at first it's just another generic “I have a diary, I can angst” story. But slowly, like watching a video of a train crash, it draws to the sinister conclusion and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. Perhaps a little dull at the very beginning but very quickly picks up and is well worth a read.

Secondly, linkffn(6243892) ‘The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks' is a good classic mystery. Set in third year, it's somewhere between a normal HP whodunnit and a murder mystery, featuring creepy imagery, a well-built mystery, and a few subtle misdirections and red herrings along the way.
