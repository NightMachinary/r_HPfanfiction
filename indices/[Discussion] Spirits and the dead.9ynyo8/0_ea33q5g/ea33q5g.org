That's an interesting topic to approach, and I think it all depends on what the author is going for in the story.

Is it a tragic story? Is it sticking more to the themes of canon, with it being somewhat light-hearted and adventurous?

Whatever sort of genre the author has gone for, that should dictate the way she's written.
