Personally, my opinion is that if the Potterverse afterlife exists, that's pretty strong evidence that a benevolent God exists too (which is most certainly the case in Rowling's mind, considering her IRL beliefs). Now, would a benevolent God make it so that the souls of the dead could never heal from whatever mental disability they had in life? What do you think?
