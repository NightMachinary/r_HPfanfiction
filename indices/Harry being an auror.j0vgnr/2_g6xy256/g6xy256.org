  But i bet the only reason he joined the aurors at the end is because of peer pressure

I don't think so. Harry has this huge "saving people thing". In becoming an Auror he does exactly that. I don't think he would be unhappy as an Auror. He has the need to help people and he loves Defence Against the Dark Arts - Auror is the perfect combination from that two things. Aside from that: there will always be dark wizards. Harry is nobody who sits by idle and watches other people getting hurt. He enjoyed teaching the DA, yes. But the main reason he enjoyed it was not because he was a passionate teacher but because he wanted to help them fight for themselves. This part of teaching he can also have by mentoring younger Aurors. On the other hand as a Hogwarts teacher he wouldn't be able to help people like he is as an Auror. So if he would read about dark wizard attacks sitting in the Great Hall I think he would quickly get frustrated by not being able to help.
