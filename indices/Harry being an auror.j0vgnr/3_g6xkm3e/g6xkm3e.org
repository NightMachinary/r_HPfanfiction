Harry's life has been filled with fighting. It is all he knows.

Also the fight against Voldemort doesn't stop in DH. Yes Voldemort dies but what he stands for is still out there. The blood supremacy movement isn't dead because of him. His fight isn't done. So the premise that Kingsley hires Harry and Ron and technically anyone who wants to be an Auror from the Battle of Hogwarts it isn't hard seeing him say yes.

Then force of habit sets in. Being an auror is comfortable. Fighting Dark Wizards is what he knows. Ron would arguably be the most disillusioned by the work as it is nothing like what they did in the books. I could see Canon Ron go work with George after a while.

Harry however would likely stay until he feels like Voldemort's movement is well an truly dead. He wants to make a difference. I could easily see Harry start teaching after maybe 10-15 years maybe when his kids start attending Hogwarts maybe after they graduated depending on what type of parent he is.

If he becomes the literal opposite of his own adult figures from his childhood I could easily see Harry become a teacher when his kids attend Hogwarts.

Harry doesn't know how not to fight, so he would likely keep fighting.

The same thing happens to soldiers after they are done with a tour. They can't function in peace time and long to go back to war. Being an Auror is the closest he would come to that or maybe he would just become a hit-wizard or something.

He would only feel alive in a fight no matter how enriching teaching would be.
