I don't see Harry as an Healer because he simply never took interest in helping people that way - but his grades wouldn't be the problem.

For becoming a Healer you need exactly the same NEWTs that you need for becoming an Auror. Harry at least had good enough marks to fullfill the Auror-Requirements at OWL-Level. He would have to go back to Hogwarts to take his NEWTS but he has the basic requirements.

We often forget that Harry actually had pretty good marks because we have Hermione on his side who is the equivalent of a straight A student. But Harry isn't that bad either - Auror is one of the most demanding carrier-choices and Harry met that requirements.
