AFAIK, cells mostly age and eventually die because the ends of chromosomes, the so-called telomeres, become shorter every time the cell divides. Given that growing requires some cell division, changing her appearance a lot would cause rapid cell division, making her cells actually age /faster/ and therefore, make it probable for her to die at a /younger/ age than the average wizard.

Also, lots of cell division in a short time makes it more probable for her to develop tumors.

So much for the nerdy side of things. But then again, it's magic, so who knows!
