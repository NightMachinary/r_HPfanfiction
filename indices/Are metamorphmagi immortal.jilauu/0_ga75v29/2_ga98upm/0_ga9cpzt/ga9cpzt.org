That's an interesting addition, thanks! I wonder if wizards know about gene therapy, haha. If they do, they could add some naked mole rat to their genome to make sure they don't get tumors.

But given that the wizarding world is stuck in the 19th century, they might not even know that DNA is a thing XD
