Just like transfiguration doesn't change the fundamental nature of an object, I doubt that Tonks' metamorphmagi powers changes her fundamental nature. While she can change how she appears, she is still fundamentally a 20 something year old witch who is the daughter of Ted Tonks and Andromeda Black. While she can change how old she appears to be, it doesn't change how old she actually is. Also, if metamorphmagi were immortal, it would have certainly come up in the books. Just imagine how desirable they would be to the wizarding world, and Voldemort would almost certainly have at least done serious research on them.
