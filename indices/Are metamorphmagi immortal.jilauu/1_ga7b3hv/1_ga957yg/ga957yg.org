Permanent transfiguration isnt common or easy. So not a good idea to seal an artery and watch it revert a few hours later. And a transfigured, permanently unchanging body part will definitely cause problems with the natural bodily functions. Stuff that makes large changes to the body, like polyjuice, is also difficult and expensive to create for a temporary effect.
