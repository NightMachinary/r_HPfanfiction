I have a few! Although none of them deal with Lucius and Narcissa interacting with Harry (in a canon-compliant or AU sense), they're all about their relationship with one another.

Under Obligation would be a good one to start with, it's one of the oldest and most popular Lucissa stories. It was written before HBP and the Black Family tree came out so some of the details are no longer canon (age order of the Black sisters, extended family names, etc) but I still think it holds up well. A lot of Lucissa seems inspired by this story in some way or another. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2078117/1/Under-Obligation]]

If you enjoy that but would like something lighter or, conversely, more serious, the authors who collaborated on Under Obligation each wrote their own really excellent stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1329152/1/Tainted-Love][Tainted Love]] is darker and more complex but incomplete, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2025248/1/Lessons][Lessons]] is fluffier and finished.

A more recent, canon-compliant story is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26862214][Vacillation]]. A lot of Bellatrix and Rodolphus in the story as well. It's very long and in-depth about their feelings towards each other growing over the years, bit of a commitment.

If you're looking for something brief but beautiful, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2999761/1/Goodnight-Little-Dragon][Goodnight Little Dragon]] is probably my favorite one-shot of the family. So sweet and touching.

Again on the flip side if you'd like a truly, deeply disturbing one-shot... got that for ya too in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5933746/1/Paterfamilias][Paterfamilias]]. It's only rated T but it will mess you up and you'll need to read through it twice to bring all the pieces together... be warned!
