I've never understood this. Sometimes, people just break up. That could easily and logically happen. They're all 18 or under- they break up with significant others all the time. Not only that, many times people who break up at 18 remain friends. It's not a leap at all to think Hermione and Ron could have an amicable breakup two months after dating. Same with Harry/Ginny.
