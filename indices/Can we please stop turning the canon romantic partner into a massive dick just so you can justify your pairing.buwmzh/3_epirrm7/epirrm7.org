  It honestly makes me think less of their relationship when you have to make someone out be be such a monster to make sure the ship stays afloat.

That's because it's a telltale sign of bad writing. There's a reason bashing stories are almost always poorly constructed. Apparently two people can't fall out of love or have never started a relationship in the first place. And if you have to make up reasons for two people (not) to be together, maybe it's because you can't find an actual reason.
