I wish I could upvote this more than once. Seriously though, this is such a problem especially with the Harry/Hermione ship. It's gotten to the point that when I see that pairing it's an automatic turnoff even when the rest of the fic actually seems interesting. It's not even that I particularly like the Ron/Hermione ship, but I just have too much ptsd from seeing the Weasleys get bashed over and over again to push Harry and Hermione together. In my mind, Harry/Hermione has become synonymous with bad writing and OOC, and it really ruins for me stories that I otherwise would have genuinely enjoyed.
