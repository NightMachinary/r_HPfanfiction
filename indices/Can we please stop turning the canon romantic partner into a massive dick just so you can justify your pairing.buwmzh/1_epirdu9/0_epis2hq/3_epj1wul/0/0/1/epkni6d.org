Apparently, you managed to absorb exactly 0% of the point I was trying to make, as your points were based on quotes that were taken completely out of context, you used those points to deviate from the main conversation, and you did nothing to ultimately add to the conversation about the psychology of either character. Also, pointing out that Hermione also has issues doesn't really help you case. I didn't say that she didn't have issues, and I thought I made it clear that I know she does have issues, based on the fact that I gave an example of her lashing out at Ron with magical violence after losing control of her emotions, as well as pointing out the result of a major personality flaw(s) in her character. Hermione's inability to respect personal boundaries, her own stubborn attitude when it comes to admitting her own faults, and her dismissal of things she doesn't agree with or like, all contributed to A) Ron blaming Hermione for Scabbers' death, and B) the weeks of them not talking afterwards, because Hermione couldn't admit that Scabber's death could have been her fault, nor did she try to offer her condolences for Scabber's death. That's literally all Ron would have needed, but she didn't do it. She couldn't own up to her mistakes or admit her own flaws, but she still managed to point out flaws in other people. This is a persistent pattern throughout the series for her, and while I love the character, I also freely admit that Hermione was a busybody arrogant hypocrite, with tendencies of both neuroticism and neurosis.

Again, though, why point out the fact that she has issues? Literally does nothing to help your case. Just because she has issues, does not excuse the fact that Hermione is the one who has a history of attacking her friends.

I remember you, though. You're the person who insisted that Harry and Hermione banged in the tent in book 7, despite the presence of a Horcrux that literally eminates evil and negative emotions; despite the fact that Harry and Hermione barely talked at all, and eventually brought out Phillius Nigellus' Portrait, just to have someone else to fill the void of Ron leaving; despite the fact that Harry could hear Hermione crying in her bed for /weeks/; and despite the fact that the only contextual evidence for any sexual content in that tent is Harry staring intensely at Ginny's dot on the Marauder's Map, and thinking really hard about her.

Listen, I get it. You're not a fan of Ron, and you are a Harry/Hermione shipper, and that's fine; but you have /got/ to think through your arguments better before posting.
