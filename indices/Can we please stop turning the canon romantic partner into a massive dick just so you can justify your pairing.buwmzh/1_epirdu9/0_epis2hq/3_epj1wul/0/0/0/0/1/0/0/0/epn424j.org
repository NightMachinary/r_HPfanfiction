Rats are normal pets here in Switzerland. Saw a guy with two of them in a bus, letting them climb all over him. That doesn't change that rats are and have been pests and other animals were raised to hunt them. It's his responsibility to keep them safe - he can't expect everyone else to lock up their cats and dogs. Just as you need to get the proper habitat for say a desert lizard, you need to get a safe habitat for your rat.

Also, rats aren't on the list of approved pets, so a rat isn't a normal pet for Hogwarts. Which means the rat's owner needs to adjust, not everyone else.
