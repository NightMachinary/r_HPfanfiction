From a pure rules perspective, if you interpret the "students may bring an owl or a cat or a toad." as being the choice in pets, Ron is in the wrong and Hermione is in the right. I agree completely with that point.

However, I feel this goes under "Just because you are right doesn't mean you are correct."

The pet policy, now that I look back on it, never explicitly forbids rats, it just limits a person to 1 cat, toad, or owl based on the language. An only at the end would clarify it immensely.
