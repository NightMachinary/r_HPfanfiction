There's Mr.Noris, Harry Owls, Weasley family own Owls, countless Hogwarts owls coming in and out of Hogwarts, and yet out of all hundreds to thousand potential predator, Hermione cat is the only predator that is interested in hunting Scabber.

You're an idiot for thinking the owl/cat are normal muggle owl/cat, they are intelligent somewhat magical animal. Especially Hermione cat who is a half-kneazle which a species of cat who are highly intelligent compare to normal cat, she could ask her cat not to hunt Ron rat and the cat WILL listen, if Hermione cat didn't realize Scabber is animagus who is a secretly a death eater.

So not only Hermione didn't give a fuck about his best friend pet rat, she probably doesn't give a fuck to any pet that got "eaten" by Crookshanks. That includes, Harry pet, Hedwig, fortunately for Harry and Hedwig, Hedwig is an actual owl and not an animagus, but Hermione doesn't know Scabber is death eater animagus, Peter Pettigiew, so I highly doubt she care enough to tell Crookshanks to stop hunting Hedwig let alone Scabber.
