I always thought that fault was on both ends. While I thought that whole Ron/Percy gets an exception for his pet is kinda stupid, the fact is that Hermione's pet seemed to be trying to kill it.

Of course Scabbers was a grown man in a young boys bed, so my sympathy for the character is non-existent.
