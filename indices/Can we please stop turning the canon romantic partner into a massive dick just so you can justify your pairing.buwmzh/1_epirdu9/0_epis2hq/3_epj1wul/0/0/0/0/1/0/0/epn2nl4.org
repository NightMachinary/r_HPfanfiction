I'm not quite sure it is the same thing. Said rat was in the boys' dorm or Ron's pocket most of the time. Free roam seemed to be a thing for the pets in the Tower. And calling it a pest is a bit unfair. Magical Britain has a lot of pets not considered normal by "Muggle" standards. They sold rats at a pet store.

If you ignore the fact the rat was Pettigrew, Ron definitely should have taken better care of his pet (a cage or something) and Hermione should have tried to keep her cat out of the boys' dorm (as it kept attacking Scabbers even when it was on Ron). There's some Owls that feed on cats (however rarely). If Harry had the same issue (an OWL that tried eating Crookshanks), would it be the same?

They were both in the wrong is what I was saying from a responsibility standpoint.

They are only 13-14 year olds, so I'd cut them some slack for being middle schoolers. Pettigrew pretty much played them both by faking his death (it seems to be a theme).
