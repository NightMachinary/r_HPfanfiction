Did you really forgot the animals in Hogwarts are most likely if not are in fact magical animals.

They smarter, more intelligent compare to their non magical counterpart, they should easily able to identify a domestic rat and a wild rat.

​

And the only reason we read of no other cats running around is the fact that JKR barely fleshed out a handful of characters.

​

It's a freaking story book, not a movie, she has all the resource and times to write about how hogwarts owl are preying scabber.

​

Hermione cat is the only one that preying scabber. And if you still disagreed dont bother, I'm not interested in you headcanon.

​

And how do you forget the animals in hogwarts are fucking magical intelligent animal. Croooshank is a freaking half kneazle for fuck sake, Owls can deliver letters to a human they never met before.
