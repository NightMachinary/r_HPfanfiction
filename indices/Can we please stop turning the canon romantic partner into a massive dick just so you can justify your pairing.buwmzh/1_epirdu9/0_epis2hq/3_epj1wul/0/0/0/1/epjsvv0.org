So you are saying that men are not better than animals who are guided by instinct? Because that is what you are forgetting. A cat or an owl is an animal, it will always chase prey. And the only reason we read of no other cats running around is the fact that JKR barely fleshed out a handful of characters. I mean, we don't even know the names of Hermione's parents, so why should Demelza Robin's cat be implemented.
