Not being the paragon of chivalry is a far cry from being abusive or a rapist.

Sure he yelled when it looked like Crookshanks had killed Scabbers. Scabbers was his own pet. His. Coming from a poor household with 6 siblings, he got attached to the few things that he had, even if he never really showed it. And when Hermione refused to respect his possessions by continuously ignoring his requests and demands to keep her pet /cat/ away from his pet /rat/, is it any wonder why he'd be pissed off at Hermione?

It's why he was also mad at her for taking away Harry's Firebolt. Ron doesn't like see things being taken away. He's stingy like that. Again, stems from his family life.

Also remember that Ron has issues. He's the last person to believe that anyone isn't good enough for him or think he deserves anything.

His deep, deep insecurity and low self-worth means he's always afraid that he's not good enough for anyone. Not good enough to live up to the expectations his brothers made. Not good enough for his two best friends. Not good enough to be attractive to anyone. It's a belief that's so ingrained in him, that he'd never try to do anything like what the fics try to portray him as. And when /he/ gets emotional he yells, and he's stubborn enough that he'll hold a grudge for ages, but he's never even attempted to harm one of his friends, no matter how angry he got, as far as I recall.

Hermione though? Miss Hermione "I'll set a flock of birds on you" Granger? Her, I could see, if she was angry or hysterical, and her perception was that she was teaching him a lesson and correcting his behavior.

Just to note, I don't think either one would be abusive with their canon personalities, but out of the two, Hermione would be the one who is closer to that extreme.
