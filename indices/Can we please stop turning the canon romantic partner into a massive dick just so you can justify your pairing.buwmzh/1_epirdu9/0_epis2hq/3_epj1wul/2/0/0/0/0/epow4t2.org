I completely agree. I probably should have said is a valid excuse.

While I like the concept of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as a trio, I have major issues with their characterization in canon, even with them being teenagers.

Harry is a bit lazy. As of first year, he knows Voldemort is going after him, and almost did kill him and stays stagnant. That is not alright. He might not be able to beat Voldemort in a straight duel at the end of the series, he should have been a much better match for any lieutenant.

Ron is characterized as noble and insightful. Which promptly gets laid to the wayside in book 4 and book 7. I'd like to see a Ron that similar to a mix of Bill and Charlie. But instead we end up with a character that coasts on Hermione's intelligence and Harry's reflexes and luck.

Hermione I feel never really grew as a character. Her heart is in the right place, but her questionable actions are never really commented on. She never really had tact in the books. She dismissed Lavender's pet dying for a vendetta against Trelawney, she was a know-it-all to Ron in book one (I'm not saying Ron was right to insult her, but a more socially aware person would have helped Ron without being rude), she shows disbelief at Ron being prefect (I'm not saying he was a bad alternate choice, but Harry deserved the bad first and foremost). Prisoner of Azkaban had the whole scabbers and broom incident. Half Blood Prince shows her petty side with Ron dating, ignoring Malfoy's suspicious behavior, and an annotated Potions book, and she's dismissive of correct theories in Deathly Hallows. Each of these incidents is fine, but she never really learned from the incidents in question. As it was, I hope Rowling had her mature after the books significantly, because I could never see canon Hermione as a Minister, more of a department head or senior undersecretary.

I say none of this as bashing, but more of things I wish they could have done better with the characters. I have fond memories of Hermione breaking the rules to help save the day, Ron defending Harry in multiple books, and Harry's goodness. I just feel part of it for plot was forced. I don't mind Hermione and Ron having a spat in book six, but both should have confronted the issue, and the pettiness was awful.
