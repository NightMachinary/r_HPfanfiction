Hermione in canon would be more likely to be physically abusive than Ron. I'm not saying Ron is perfect, they'd definitely need couple's counseling, but Hermione is the only one of the two to actually hit the other.

Mind, I think canon Ron is still a bit of a dick. But he's not evil. And canon Hermione is possibly the most loyal person to Harry. I like to think they both mellowed out in adulthood. Half Blood Prince Hermione as a coworker would be a nightmare.

Lavender's treatment in canon is appalling. She's essentially used by Ron and thrown away. Hermione I think treated her better in the 6th book.
