Wherein Ron can't get it up.

OK, now I want a fic where the reason for the breakup is that Hermione is sexually frustrated because Ron has ED and lashes out at himself about it and won't seek treatment, so it leads to huge arguments. They try counseling together and it just doesn't work out romantically after a while, stay friends and ... profit?
