I based her reaction a lot on how Harry reacted to seeing Ginny with Dean in HBP. Inside he is upset and disappointed but outwardly he does his best not to show it because he knows he has no right to take it out on her or Dean. You know...how decent human beings behave.

It was amazing to me how many reviews/messages I received from people genuinely shocked at how I treated her...the large majority were pleasantly surprised.
