As was I. So many fanfics try to make their characters extreme either from lazy writing or for dramatic effect that reading well written characters can be a bit of a shock.

The other bit I thought was great and perhaps unique is that in 99.99% of Haphne or Harry/Slytherin you get Harry being told "Be more Slytherin" "Do the political schmoozing." "Come up with a sneaky plan." Etc. Your fic subverted that completely and had Harry's honesty be a major positive and, when Daphne embraced the Gryffindor lifestyle, she became happier and more fulfilled. It was a genius bit of writing.

Great story overall.
