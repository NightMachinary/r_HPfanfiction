Thank you and it's great to hear that because what you cited was what inspired me to write the story in the first place. I'm not a fan of "super political/conniving Slytherin Harry" stories because they (for the most part) suck the life out of what makes Harry such a great character and he ceases being Harry along the way. The goal was for both characters to evolve...Harry becomes more confident and ambitious thanks to Daphne and Daphne becomes more unguarded and honest thanks to Harry. They bring out the best in each other.
