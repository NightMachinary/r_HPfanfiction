Yeah, that came out wrong.

I'm just annoyed at the many post-war fanfiction with bashing. If you really doesn't like a character you can just kill them using the war as an excuse, you don't need to find some obscure reason to bash a character.

Maybe I should've used [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] as an example.
