THANK YOU! Personally, I prefer it being made so that (insert other partner here) beats (canon partner) to the punch and (canon partner) is therefore never really considered, or that the events of the story unfold in such a way that the relationship doesn't form naturally. To be fair, some of Rowling's pairings feel relatively forced in the first place, so I really don't see why the rejected partner needs to be made into a living turd for the non-ship to be plausible.
