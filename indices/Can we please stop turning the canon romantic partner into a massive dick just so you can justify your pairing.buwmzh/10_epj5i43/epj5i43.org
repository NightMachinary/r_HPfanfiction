The irony is that if you need to bash anyone, it probably should be the people actually in the pairing. For example, if during DH, Harry and Hermione actually did get together when Ron was gone, /they/ would be the assholes. If you wrote a Draco/Hermione story and summarized it in its simplest terms as Hermione leaves Ron for Draco, Hermione would more likely be considered the asshole in that situation. While I rarely read fics like this, one of my pet peeves regardless is how they never handle such a situation in a realistic manner, where the partner that cheats or gets with a former Death Eater is treated as the asshole.
