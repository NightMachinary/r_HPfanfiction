It's not about whether it would have been cheating. I agree it would not. It's about whether it would have been wrong of them to get together, given the entire context. And I'd argue it absolutely would have been wrong and Ron and Ginny would have been totally justified in despising them over it. Now, if Ginny and Harry didn't get back together after the battle, and they decided not to resume their relationship, and then Ron wound up deciding never to make it official with Hermione, and then Harry and Hermione got together, then I would agree it would no longer be an asshole move, though some heads up to Ginny and Ron would be appropriate. But that is an entirely different scenario than the one I'm describing. Anyway, agree to disagree.
