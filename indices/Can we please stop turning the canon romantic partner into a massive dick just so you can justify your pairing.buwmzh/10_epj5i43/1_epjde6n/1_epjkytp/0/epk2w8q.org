1. Not convinced.

Even if Ron and Hermione could be considered some kind of unofficial item - which would arguably not be binding in any case - Ron pretty much lost any right he may have had to complain when he walked out on them. In a situation where all their lives and the fate of the country was at stake, for selfish reasons. If that's not enough to qualify as a breakup, I don't know what is. Harry and Hermione were free, at that point, to do whatever they wanted romantically and call it none of his business.

1. Partially right, but overall no.

There is no way that Harry would have considered Ginny dating someone else to be cheating. Sure, he didn't want to break up with her, it was about her safety. But he did it, and he wouldn't be so inconsistent as to consider her still obligated to him. Dating someone else could actually make her safer, so I would expect him to be academically pleased and verbally approving while emotionally hurting. He wouldn't call it a betrayal, not at all.

I'm agreeing that this one is partially right because if, after their breakup for security reasons, Harry immediately went chasing after the next skirt he saw, then Ginny would likely feel betrayed, that he had lied to her about the reasons for their breakup. On the other hand, if the stresses and shared experiences had simply pushed him and Hermione together over time, and they arrived at the Battle of Hogwarts as an item, I don't think Ginny would call that cheating.
