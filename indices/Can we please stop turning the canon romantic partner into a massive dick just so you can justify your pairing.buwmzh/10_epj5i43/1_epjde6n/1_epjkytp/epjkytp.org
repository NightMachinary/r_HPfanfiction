While you may technically be right, it would still be a bitch moove in both case.

- While Ron and Hermione were not "together", they turned around each other for months, in not years by that point. Hermione getting with Harry (who had never showed any sign of attraction for her), or even Ron getting with anyone during this timeframe would be a pretty bitch moove.
- In Harry case, he may be "technically" single, but he and Ginny both know that the breakup was just to protect her while he is chasing Horcruxe. Both would consider the other getting with some as cheating.
