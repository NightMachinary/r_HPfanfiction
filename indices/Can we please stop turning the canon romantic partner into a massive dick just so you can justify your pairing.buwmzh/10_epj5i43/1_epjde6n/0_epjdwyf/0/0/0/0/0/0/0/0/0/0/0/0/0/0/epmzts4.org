Holy shit, I was trying to get you to admit that there were surely /some/ situations where it would be wrong. I really thought a 50 year old dating a 16 year old would be that situation even you would admit would be wrong. But instead you openly admitted to being ok with that. And people upvoted it. I mean, I just don't even know what to say at this point.
