Uh, you absolutely can still be an asshole.

For example, the situation I gave. Also, breaking up with someone and then dating their relative/best friend/somebody they are forced to interact with a lot. Or how about dating someone who is already in a relationship. Or how about a situation where you date the 18 year old daughter of a good friend?
