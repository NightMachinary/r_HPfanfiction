As long as it's not cheating and legal, and you actually love them, dating them is not an asshole move. Your feelings are not worth less than your ex-partners', parents' or friends'. Because you deserve their consideration as well - and expecting you to cater to them at the cost of your own happiness is a dick move.

(I really don't like that asshole attitude that your ex-partner deserves more consideration than your new love or yourself. It's like thinking that your spouse matters less than your friends or ex-partners. And that's just wrong.)
