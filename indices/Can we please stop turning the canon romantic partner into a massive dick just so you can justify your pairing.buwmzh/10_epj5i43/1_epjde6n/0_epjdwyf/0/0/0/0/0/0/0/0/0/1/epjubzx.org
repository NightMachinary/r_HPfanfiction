But Harry never had romantic feelings for Hermione though. He still tracked Ginny on the Marauder's Map, indicating he still had feelings for her, so the act of shagging Hermione would indeed be an asshole move because he'd basically just be using her at that point. Which goes back to the original point, in that to make it “work” Harry would have to be vastly out of character. And Hermione too, for that matter, since she had feelings for Ron.
