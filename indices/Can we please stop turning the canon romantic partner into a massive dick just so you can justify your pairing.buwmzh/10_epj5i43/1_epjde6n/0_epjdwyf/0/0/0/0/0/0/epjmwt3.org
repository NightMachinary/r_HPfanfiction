Well, considering Hermione was sobbing over Ron leaving, it would be tough for me to even imagine them hooking up and then immediately dropping their feelings for Ron and Ginny, but I digress.

Yes. they are free to enter into new relationships. But they'd be assholes for doing it with each other compared to new people. I mean if you don't think dating the girl your best friend is in love with and who is best(or really good) friends with your ex who still loves you is a dick move, then there ya go. I for one do.
