First off, agreed that isnt cheating but the world doesn't work like that. They technically wouldn't be wrong, they'd just be assholes.

What bothers me about your view is you seem to just be removing the entire context of the H/G and R/Hr backstory. You leave out that both Ginny and Harry were really broken up over the break up and neither lost those feelings, even while they were apart. You forgot that Hermione was coaching Ginny on how to eventually be with Harry. You leave out the fact that Ginny and Harry shared that post-break up kiss that was a promise to be together when the war was over. You omit everything Ron and Hermione shared leading up to the final book and that everyone, including Harry, knew they had feelings for each other. You're also omitting that Ron's biggest insecurities revolved in part around the idea Hermione who choose Harry over him.

It really isn't this black or white situation. It's not like because they weren't officially together, than it's not a shitty thing to do to a friend or an ex. It's called being a human and being empathetic and not a sociopath.

In summary, if Harry and Hermione hooked up during the hunt, they wouldn't be wrong, but they'd still be assholes.
