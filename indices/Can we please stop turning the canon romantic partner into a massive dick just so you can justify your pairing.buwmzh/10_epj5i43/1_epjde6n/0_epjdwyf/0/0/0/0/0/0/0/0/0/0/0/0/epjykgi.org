You keep acting like this is a blanket rule that should govern all situations, and that people don't have these things called feelings. That this is a black or white issue, which it is so not. And I'm saying that in this specific example I gave, it clearly would be a dick move. Because it's not like Ginny and Harry broke up because it just wasn't working for Harry. And it's not like Ron had put his feelings out there but Hermione rebuffed him, or they dated and both were back to being just friends. Harry and Ginny were still very much a thing, and both clearly still loved the other.

You're acting like a robot where things like ethics and moral behavior don't matter in the face of one's self-interests.

I also noticed you didn't answer my specific situations on potential asshole-ish behavior, so I assume you actually do agree that its perfectly ok to date a sibling or best friend of a recent ex, or its ok for an older man who is best friends with a guy to date his 18 year old daughter. So is there ever a line? What if she was 16? Is it now an asshole move for a 50 year old man to date a 16 year old girl? At what point for you does it become a dick move to date someone as long as its not cheating or illegal?
