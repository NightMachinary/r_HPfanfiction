So dumb. Absolutely zero compatibility. I have no idea what JKR was thinking....

Literally the only thing they had in common was that they were both friends of Harry. I don't see a single thing that a someone like Hermione would find attractive in someone like Ron.

His eating habits...? His study habits...?

But then again, nobody knows what crackpot ideas go through Rowling's mind lmao. Remember, Dumbly-door is gay, and Hermy-own-ninny is black.
