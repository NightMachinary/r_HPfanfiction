Yes omg I hate it so much! I'm a dramoine shipper when it comes to fics but I absolute love hermione and Ron in canon and Ron is one of my favorite characters. Literally in almost all dramoine fics Ron ends up a villain and it sucks. Harry is like a reluctant but supportive friend while Ron always acts so horrible I hate it.
