Yeah I've read this. There is a story called "Relationships Change" where Hermione and Draco are head girl and head boy and have to share a dorm. Hermione is dating Ron and he tries to force himself on her and she says no. She's crying and Draco ends up comforting her in his own awkward way.... and Ron busts in on them and starts calling Hermione a slut... says she will end up pregnant with an AIDS baby with Draco. Hermione reports Ron to the Head Mistress and he ends up expelled... he turns all dark and revenge plotting. Now I am not much of a fan of Ron but damn, this was harsh.
