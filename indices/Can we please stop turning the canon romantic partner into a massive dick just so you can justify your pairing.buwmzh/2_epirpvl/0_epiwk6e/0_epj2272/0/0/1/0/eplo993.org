Actually, either parent could have any colour eyes, provided the both carry the gene for green eyes. IIRC, green is the least dominant of all eye colours, so the gene requires 2 copies in the one person to be expressed, and any other colour present in the genome will be expressed rather than the green. So really, Lily and James could both have brown eyes and Harry could still get green. What's not possible is Lily and James both have blue or green eyes and Harry getting brown (then I'd be questioning whether Lily had a side piece.)
