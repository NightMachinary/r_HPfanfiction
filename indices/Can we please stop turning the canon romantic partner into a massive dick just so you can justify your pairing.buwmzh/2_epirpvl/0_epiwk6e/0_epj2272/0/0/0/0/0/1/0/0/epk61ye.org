Well, rather than Phoenix I usually think that James is the White Stag. Like the myths about the Lord of the forest and stuff but people are just like "your a deer" when in fact he could be any number of forest/hunt deity incarnate which is why James is always the 'wild one'. Like Cernunnos(I think), who dies and is reborn every year or something... Which makes sense for Harry to have a death encounter every year.

Harry is a deer god or something.
