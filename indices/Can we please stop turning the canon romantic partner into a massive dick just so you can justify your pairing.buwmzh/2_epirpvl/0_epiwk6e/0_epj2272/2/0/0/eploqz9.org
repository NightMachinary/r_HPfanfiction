I'm just here to say, I've always thought Severus should have survived that bite. He was a Potions Master for frick sake. What kind of /Halfblood Potions Master/ wouldn't have antivenin, blood replenishers, dittany, pain killers, and other assorted healing potions on them? Especially one that works with a snake-snogging mad-man! I don't find it even the least bit plausible that Severus Snape, master spy and Potions Master, was unprepared for any of the many ways Voldy could have killed him. Rant over.
