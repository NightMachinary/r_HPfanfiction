I would really love to read a good post-Battle Severus/Petunia story (yes, it would be a bit AU, but Severus' death is completely useless anyway; his dying is important, but he can just survive the bite somehow, and Vernon should get cardiac arrest long time ago anyway). Two broken guilty people looking for reconcilliation and redemption. However, the stress in the first sentence is on “good” and there aren't any, all is just trash.
