This is Britain, the country where people apologise to lamp posts and thank empty lifts and authors are trying to claim that Harry was the first and only person to ever be polite to a goblin? Sorry, that just doesn't work.

Not to also forget that the wizarding world is not made up solely of arrogant purebloods and that each and every year there are people arriving that have never seen a goblin before but are familiar with interacting with bank tellers - muggleborn parents.
