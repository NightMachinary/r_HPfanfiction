In the world of Harry Potter respect towards magical and nonmagical things is a basic theme. It is a portion of why the Death Eaters are the antagonists, and Harry has a muggleborn friend.

That being said, respect towards something is not what we have issues with. In the goblin world we only know two things. One that anything that theg protect they feel is theirs. This is referenced in the poem on gringotts entrance. Also of note is that they are particular about their deals. Gobins as Bill states view deals as literal interpretations. Meaning when Griphook agreed to take the trio to the vault, amd grab the cup, as soon as Griphook had the cup he demanded the sword, which was his payment the action. He then notified the rest of the goblin nation what was happening. This shows the goblins are more loyal to themselves than to anything else. Including that which they guard.

To claim that being polite will get anything from such a race is laughable. Based on these observations, the closest thing that will get you is a knife in the back at the best opportunity to benifit the Goblin Nation. The goblins seem to be more than willing to use humans to further their own agenda.
