That is a fair point, I can see them doing a lot of things in order to have the opportunity to learn wandlore. The thing is, though, many of these fanfiction don't really touch on that, and goblins usually gain nothing but respect and gold out of the relationship between them and the main character (usually Harry). And if they do, I can imagine something along the lines of what Griphook did in DH happening: the moment they get the knowledge of wandlore, backstab Harry. But in these fanfic, the goblins continue to remain loyal to Harry, which is nice and all, but not something I find keeping to the portrayal of goblins in canon.

Well, I tried to form my points on goblin culture from what I definitely known from canon and Pottermore. Initially, I thought they were a warrior race, too, but then I realised that was purely something fanfiction cooked up/assumed. Pottermore lists goblins as 'cunning and clever', and they are definitely a proud race that hate wizards, from what I can see in canon. You can see their pride in how they count Gringotts as being impenetrable to wizards. Their wizard hatred underlies the interaction between Harry and Griphook in DH, and the tension between races is in every scene between them. Although, I suppose their greed for gold is debatable. It's mainly characters with potential biases that call them greedy.
