True, but then this the world of Harry Potter where everything is over exaggerated. The idea of goblins bending over backwards to help the wizards because they want to wield wants fits the setting and I'm not thrown out of the story by it.

As far as goblin culture goes I think a lot of your points are likely formed more from fanfiction than the stories themselves. We get to interact with goblins in book 1 for a chapter, and book 7 for a chapter, with a few references to goblin wars thrown in for comic effect with HoM. We legitimately know nothing about them beyond those few pieces of information.
