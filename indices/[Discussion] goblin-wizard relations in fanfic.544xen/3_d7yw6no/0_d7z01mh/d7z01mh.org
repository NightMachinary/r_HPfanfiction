That's interesting, I've never really thought about what the goblins stand to gain like that before. While that is true, the extent to which the goblins attempt to encourage the behaviour to their advantage is often exaggerated.

True, there is very little we see about goblin culture in canon. As far as I can tell, the only things we really know about them are that they like gold, they're cunning, hate wizards and are a proud race. Since they're such a proud race, though, I can't see them as willing to treat any wizard with more than stiff politeness unless a wizard treats a goblin with what counts as respect in goblin culture.
