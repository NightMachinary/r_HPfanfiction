So, the stories that do this well are the ones where the goblins realize that Harry doesnt have the same bias as the rest of the purebloods /and/ has the power to help the goblins so they respond to his politeness positively.

In that case it's not that no one has ever been polite, but that this is the first person who will hold substantial power to enact change in their world to treat them as equals, and they want to encourage this to their advantage.

That said, we get very little look at goblin culture in the novels, so we have no idea what their world is like, and what they consider polite or professional. It is unlikely that no one ever has treated goblins politely, nor that they are so starved for recognition that they will bend over backwards for whoever gives it. At the same time, children are indoctrinated into seeing goblins as savages that will rebel at the slightest provocation, barely under the control of the ministry so keep your dealings with them short, making it likely that no one talks to the lm more than neccessary.
