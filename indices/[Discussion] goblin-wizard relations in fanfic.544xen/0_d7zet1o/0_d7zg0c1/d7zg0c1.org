A good point and might be perfectly true (no way of knowing from canon) but Hagrid certainly has his own biases. He's blind to Dumbledore's faults, as one example, and certainly nurses a grudge (however well-founded) against Slytherins which is unprofessional for a school staff member. His dislike of the goblins may also be class resentment. Given his pariah status as a expelled suspected murderer retained in his position only on an eccentric's sufferance Hagrid likely has financial problems and could be unlikely to feel warmly towards bankers of any race. Anyway no particular point here just rambling about Hagrid.
