Confectionary Chronicles has a BAMF, intelligent, and capable Hermione. She does go through some stuff to get there, so the BAMF isn't immediate, but it does definitely get there.

It is a Supernatural crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Supernatural to read it (I literally know nothing about it beyond that there are two brothers and a gay angel and they go to hell a few times - I haven't seen a single episode).
