There was noise in the crowd and Harry's fierce gaze wasn't quite enough to contain the murmuring. He scanned the crowd quickly, seeing plenty of lips open or flapping like fish and yet no one spoke. /Give 'em a minute/, he thought, /it was a big proposal/.

Harry looked to the sides of the stage where he could see all that had supported him in what had to sound crazy. Ron, who stood gesturing to him, holding a thump up as if telling him he had done well, Hermione bushy hair covering her eyes and hands over her face, he knew her to be chewing her nails to deal with the nerves. Ginny - Ginny who had promised to follow him wherever he went.

He had been away from her for a whole year, when that whole Horcrux thing had been afoot and he had hated it. He didn't think it was someting he would ever want to go through with again, especially not now Ginny had gifted him with kids. He had what he had never had, a family. He wasn't going to be a coward, as he had tolld Lupin so long ago his father had died to protect him and he would do the same to protect his children.

Finally, as Harry's eyes rested on Ginny in the dark side of the stage for a bit too long someone spoke. It was a question. Harry had expected them to have them. "Why?" or "Are you crazy", he was prepared for them all. Just not the one that actually left the old looking wizard's mouth.

"Are you saying that we'll colonise space? The rest of the system? Where will we stop, do you have a plan?"

Harry's lios thinned in a smile.

"Yes, that's exactly what I propose."

...Someone else piped in, annoying but Harry couldn't say he didn't get it.

"Are you saying then that..."

Before anyone else could interrupt he made his statement, the last one he'd do all night.

"Yes. That's what I'm saying. Wizardkind, all of us? We're going to colonise URANUS"

(Sorry, cheap joke)
