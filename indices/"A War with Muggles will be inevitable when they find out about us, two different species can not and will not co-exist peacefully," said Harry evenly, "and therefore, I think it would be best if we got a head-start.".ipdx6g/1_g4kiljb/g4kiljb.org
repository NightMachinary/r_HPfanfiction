Really, avoiding war would be super easy.

Step 1: Allow highly qualified muggles to be granted knowledge of the magical world.

Step 2: Hire muggle experts to cooperate with wizards in keeping track of secrecy hazards such as social media.

Step 3: Hire muggle experts in genetic modification and medicine. Also create a fake biotech startup that acts as cover.

Step 4: Have scientists and potioneers create a potion that contains three things: A massively complex mess of modified Crispr proteins, RNA snippets, engineered viruses and other biological elements that looks like it could be a super advanced cancer killer, a magic potion that is undetectable by nonmagical means and renders all that RNA stuff inert, and finally a potion that actually slowly cures cancer. Important: Potions have to be mostly plant-based with as few components of long lived magical creatures (dragons, griffins, ...) as possible.

Step 5: Have gene editing scientists, economic engineers, potioneers, herbologists and enchanters figure out how to mass produce the cancer cure at massive scale, unprecedented for the tiny wizarding world. Here's where minimizing magical creature parts in the potions is important, scaling production of plants by several orders of magnitude is far easier than animals.

Step 6: Have your fake biotech startup sell the magic cancer cure. Might take a while to get it approved since no outsider can make sense of how it works apart from the fact that it does somehow work really well with no major side effects.

Step 7: Cure cancer on a worldwide scale.

Step 8: Repeat process from step 4 for some other extremely hard to cure illness.

Now if secrecy fails, you can immediately jump to step 9: Inform the world about the cure's true nature and publish statistics of how many million lives you saved. Should be a sizeable portion of the population. Now if any leader threatens war you can just respond by pointing out that it'd cut off access to cures, and nobody wants that.
