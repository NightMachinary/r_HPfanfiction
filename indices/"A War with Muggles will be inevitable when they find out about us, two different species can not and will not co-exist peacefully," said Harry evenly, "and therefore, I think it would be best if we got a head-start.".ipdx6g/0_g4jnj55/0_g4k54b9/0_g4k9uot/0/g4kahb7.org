Eh, Rise if the Wizards was actually big in wizards are better. Savior of magic had the war be pretty much one-sided, there was also another in which Harry was an ice elemental in which Voldemort wiped-out the muggle-world with little to no effort and For the Love of Magic had a somewhat equilibrated power balance until Harry gives up and starts the apocalypse in his own terms. All in all it is kind of a mixed bag.
