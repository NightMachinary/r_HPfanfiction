Tonks who can hide in a crowd of pastel-haired girls and boys

Witchy young adults excited about traditional mason jars and candles and old fashioned calligraphy

Hordes of kids wanting to buy an intelligent owl to send messages to their friends in the night (bc everybody knows owls sleep by day /duh/)

EVERYONE WANTS TO RIDE A BROOM

Everybody welcomes magic into their lives like coaxing frightened animal to pet it. Noone mentions witch burnings and when someone does none would support it. Magic is /delighted/ by all the attention. As much so it barely notices when wizardkind withdraws; it has all those youths now.
