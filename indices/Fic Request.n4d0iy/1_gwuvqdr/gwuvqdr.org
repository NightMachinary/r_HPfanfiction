/In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new./

Its complete and has a sequel fic which is not yet complete but 31 chapters pretty long. It has one of the best characterizations for Regulus ive ever seen and my favorite characterization of Sirius. The first story more of a character study the second is more plot heavy but its very well written probably one of the best written fics I've seen like stupidly good.
