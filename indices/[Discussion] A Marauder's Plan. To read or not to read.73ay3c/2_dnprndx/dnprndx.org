I'm a pretty big fan of this story but I think most of that is because I don't mind or like the things you mention. Sirius does maintain a father figure role throughout the story. Harry does become less emotional and more "there's a prophecy I need to help get stuff done" as the story progresses but he never becomes some 14 year old cold hearted mercenary. Dumbledore does continue to make mistakes with regards to Harry and the prophecy throughout the story. Almost everyone in the story besides Dumbledore is always saying "I don't care that there's a prophecy we're going to kill this guy with minimal help from Harry" while Dumbledore continues to try to force the issue. If you really dislike the things you mentioned then yeah you probably won't like the story but I always found it to be a well written piece with a nice dose of fluffiness while also being serious when necessary.
