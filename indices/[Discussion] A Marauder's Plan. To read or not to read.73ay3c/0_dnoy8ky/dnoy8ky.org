He gets slightly less emotional in the next arc and then acts pretty much the same through the whole fic. But I have to warn you, it generally gets stupider further on. I'm not sure if it's now or soon that the author will mention scar tissue on a magical core. Not to the mention upcoming "Harry Potter - the most powerful magical fetus of his generation".

EDIT: Also prepare for more bashing.
