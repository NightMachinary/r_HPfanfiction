What the English did to Australia is now considered not only a genocide, but one that is essentially ongoing. People like to ignore what happened to Indigenous Australians because the English never actually left, so their descendants got to control the entire narrative. They didn't have slaves because they had colonies which were easily exploited.

All this to say that I would've rather not been invaded by anyone, let alone the British.
