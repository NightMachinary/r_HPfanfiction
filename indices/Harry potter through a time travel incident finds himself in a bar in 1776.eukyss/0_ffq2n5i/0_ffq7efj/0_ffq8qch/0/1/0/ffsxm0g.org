Slavery wasn't really abolished because of immorality. Slavery was bad for working men, and slaves were increasingly fighting back against their masters. It was abolished mostly for economic reasons- as well as because people increasingly opposed it.

The British really cling to the idea that it was just a nice thing they decided to do one day. But that was actually great when it came to the American Civil War, because the English people already really believed their own stories and refused to help save slavery.
