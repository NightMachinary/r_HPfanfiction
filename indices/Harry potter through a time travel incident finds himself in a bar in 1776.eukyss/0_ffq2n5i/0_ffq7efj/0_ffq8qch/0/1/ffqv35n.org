Sure, but it was also never 'illegal' until 2010. It was the slave trade specifically that was abolished in the British Empire in the 1830s or so. Everything else we usually do with slavery, kidnapping and illegal imprisonment and whatnot, that was illegal early on, but actually owning another person wasn't illegal until 2010.

Legally speaking, we didn't really consider it a state of being, so we had no laws against it.

We did do pretty well with suppressing it once we cottoned onto the whole immorality thing. Got a bunch of laws passed and treaties signed that let us use our navy to police the Atlantic Trade Routes for slavers and kick them in the balls when we found 'em. We were the second biggest trader in the Atlantic Triangle, so don't romanticise us too much. We were twats, back in those days. Or bigger twats, at least. The jury is out on us nowadays.
