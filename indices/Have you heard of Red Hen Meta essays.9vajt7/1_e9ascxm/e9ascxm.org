That's actually a pretty fascinating analysis of the Weasley family. Useful for those of us writing our own fics as well, so that we have better character motivation. I know I'll get some good use out of that.

For other essayists, I've been partial to Dan H's articles on Ferretbrain. I don't necessarily agree with everything about it, but his one on Calvinism is pretty insightful (even if I've heard the statements about the Church of Scotland aren't actually accurate).
