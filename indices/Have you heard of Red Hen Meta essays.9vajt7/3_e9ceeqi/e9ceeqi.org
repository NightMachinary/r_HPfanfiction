"Or his reactions. Blowing off his falling out with Harry over the Goblet of Fire with “he's just jealous” may have made Harry feel better, but it wasn't a particularly accurate interpretation of the situation. Mere jealousy would have been if Ron were indeed fuming just because Harry had gotten some more public attention and he didn't (Q: When /hasn't/ he?). That wasn't what was going on at all. Attracting public attention wasn't the issue --- although that made an easy stick to beat Harry over the head with.

Ron was upset that Harry had somehow managed to get his name into the Goblet /without/ him. He was convinced that Harry had gone and done it by himself, and then was shutting him out even more by not even having the decency to /tell/ him about it. There was some jealousy present, sure. But he wasn't /just/jealous. Ron is used to being outshone, he doesn't mind it too much so long as you still /include/ him. But now he's been shut out, and rejected as well, and it hurts."
