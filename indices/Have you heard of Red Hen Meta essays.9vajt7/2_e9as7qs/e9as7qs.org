Interesting article about Weasleys.

I agree they are not a nice bunch. Molly is of course my least favorite among them, not that I think she's bad or evil. No, my biggest gripe against her is that she always thinks she knows best, but is not nearly competent enough to make the right call. Examples:

- Assuming Hermione was a slut based on Skeeter article
- Opposing Twins's plan for the shop
- Denying vital information to Harry, against Sirius's wishes
- Assuming the worst of Fleur
- Sabotaging Trio's effort to prepare for the Horcrux hunt

On the other hand, I disagree with that author's assessment of Ginny's development after GoF. It seems she wants Ginny to remain that meek and innocent little girl. I don't. I don't like perfectly nice, innocent, and moralistic characters at all. They are boring.
