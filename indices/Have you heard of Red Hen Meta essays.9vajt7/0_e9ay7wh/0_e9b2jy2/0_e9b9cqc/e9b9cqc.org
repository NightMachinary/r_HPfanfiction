I haven't read all of her essays, but it seems a bit strange to treat the Weasley family in a very uncharitable light but then give Snape some breaks. But that's almost certainly my own bias because I'm not a fan of Snape apologetics (especially in Canon with "Albus Severus Potter." Christ what a name).
