This mirrors my thoughts quite well. She's an interesting, thoughtful, well-reasoned read. But she tends to take the darkest possible view of any given character's actions and motivations. (I guess Percy is an exception in the Weasley essay above. And she'll give Snape a break here and there too.) Of course, always attributing everything to malice and character flaws can be fun to read when you dislike a character....
