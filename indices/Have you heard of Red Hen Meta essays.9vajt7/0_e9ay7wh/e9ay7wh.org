I've read Red Hen's works quite a bit, and she's an interesting author. The biggest crux of most of her logical reasonings is often a negative view of a character/situation. Compared to some other head canons (Taure's), there seems to be a very Hobbes/Rousseau dynamic going on. Interesting stuff, but also sometimes unnecessarily dark for me.
