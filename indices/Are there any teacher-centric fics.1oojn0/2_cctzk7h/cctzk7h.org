Since you said any pairing and any rating, I'm going out on a limb and recommending a Snape/Harry fic (even though I know many, if not most, of you guys dislike slash, especially that of the Snape/Harry variety) that is set post-series, when both of them are professors. It is a two shot, under 8k words, and is fairly amusing. There are numerous scenes of interactions between and among teachers.

"Writen for Snarry a thon 2010, Harry and Snape teach at Hogwarts - Harry begs Snape to pretend to be in a relationship with him to keep the new teacher in town who doesn't seem to understand 'not interested' off his back. Pretending becomes reality." Rated M

EDIT: OH MY GOD I can't believe I almost forgot one of my favorite humor fics. It isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I think it's near enough that you may enjoy it. Neville is Professor of Herbology and Harry is Head Auror, and they get together and complain about students/aurors while getting drunk at the Leaky Cauldron. It is side-splitting, seriously, I never fail to crack up when I read this fic. It's fairly gen, but there are mentions of canon relationships (i.e. Neville/Hannah and Harry/Ginny).
