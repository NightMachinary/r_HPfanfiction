The only one I really know of is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5386877/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Veil-of-Mystery][Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery]]; first of a completed trilogy, though sadly it's far bigger than you say you want, the first book is 400,000 words, because of the author's tendency to stretch things out.

Occurs during 6th year; Harry ends up in the DADA position after no one else qualified applies, and the fact that all the members of DA in 5th year got O's in their Defense OWLS.

Harry continues only the classes he'll need to become an auror; (6th and 7th years getting taught DADA by Albus, (Nothing's mentioned about the Cannon Slughorn/Severus teaching positions other than Severus continuing to teach potions)); the rest of the time spent teaching.
