  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

3 chapters, set across a single day in the midst of the chaos of Umbridge's short reign as Headmistress. A great portrayal of a great character. The appearance of Emmaline Vance is a little sobering, because she dies offscreen a few months later between OoTP and HBP.
