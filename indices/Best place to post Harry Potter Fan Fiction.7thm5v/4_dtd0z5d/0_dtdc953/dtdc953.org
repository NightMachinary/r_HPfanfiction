I think harrypotterfanfiction.net was the first site I used. I haven't been to HPfanfictiontalk. But I am aware that there others. I personally used to use Yahoo Groups(various), but given yahoo's current reputation no way I'm touching it now. And groups such as AFF and HPfanfiction which seem more dedicated to smut. Not to mention the numerous shipping sites like Flaming Nargles and Simmering Cauldrons , but these are the ones that mostly seem to disappearing the fastest. And thank you for the sites, I'll go check them out right away.
