There are a few other decent-sized archive sites out there. I'll highlight two:

harrypotterfanfiction.net

Pros: - Been around forever, established readership - Relative consistency of product Cons: - Probably the most restrictive content rules of any archive site - Minimal interactivity between authors and readers - Site owner is a raging narcissist who's constantly threatening to shut the whole thing if he doesn't feel respected enough

HPfanfictalk.com

Pros: - New, author-driven community - Good opportunities for interaction between authors and readers, e.g. comment and reply system in archive, forums tied to archive - Readers tend to be supportive of new authors; minimal trolling - Nice selection of content-formatting options Cons: - Small community with relatively low profile. You're not going to get famous overnight - Moderation of content will seem heavy-handed compared to AO3 (this may be a good thing, depending on your point of view) - Community as a whole can be somewhat tumblr-ish. Expect drama if you don't respect people's pronouns, etc.
