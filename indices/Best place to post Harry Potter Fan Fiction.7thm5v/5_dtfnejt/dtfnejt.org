As a reader I much prefer fanfiction.net for four main reasons: you can search by story length, search for main character, you can exclude characters from your search and using the dark background makes reading on your laptop a lot easier on the eyes.

On AO3 the tags often get ridiculous and when you search by character you get every fic that the character is in, but they're not necessarily the main character. It is helpful that you can get the whole story on one page and even download it in mobi format. I do find the site a bit clumsy and unorganised.

I don't know what would be useful to you as writer though. I've never read on FicWad, but FFN and AO3 are both pretty big, so if you want as many readers as possible I think it's useful to post on both sites.
