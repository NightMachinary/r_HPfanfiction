When I started posting again, I looked first at FF.net, but I was put off by the restrictions WRT sexytimes, so I went with AO3 instead. Reading on this sub, I've observed that there is a fair bit of racy stuff on FF.net, so I've been posting there as well. If it gets purged, then I still have a home on AO3.

Some people feel that AO3s tag system is needlessly complicated, but I don't think it's too bad. I like the kudo system for letting an author know you like the fic if you think care enough to leave an actual review. I find that in general, readership is lower on AO3, but it seems like maybe readers there are a bit more responsive, but your experience may differ.
