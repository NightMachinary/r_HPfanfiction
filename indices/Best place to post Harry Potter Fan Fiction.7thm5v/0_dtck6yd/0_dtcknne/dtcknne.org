yeah, I was thinking about multiple sites if only because of Portkey. When I first started reading, there were so many sites, but now it seems like it's dropped down to a handful. I love the idea of the tagging system, but you're right it doesn't seem like it's used properly. I think my biggest grip with FFN is you can't do a >=T Rating search.
