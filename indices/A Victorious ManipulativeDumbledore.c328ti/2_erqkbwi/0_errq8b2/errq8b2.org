  Sounds like a rather horrible time of fanfiction reading.

It's only horrible if done wrong. Which admittedly is much easier to do than getting it right. For me, I find it hard to believe that canon Dumbledore is really manipulative only because I realize that the series started out as a Roald Dahl-esque children's story and evolved into a young adult series, with JKR not quite making sure everything lined up correctly. Because of this, I'd rather read something where Dumbledore is actually manipulative and is successful in doing so, because we see a lot of unsuccessful manipulative Dumbldores currently.

  there could be no pay off

A well-written story is its own payoff, regardless if the protagonist is good or evil. To me the whole appeal of fanfiction is to see all the different possibilities that could take place using a familiar universe.
