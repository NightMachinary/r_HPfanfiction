Sounds like a rather horrible time of fanfiction reading.

What would be the point? He did that in canon, and even sacrificed himself to ensure his plan continued correctly. Sounds like the story would be rather poorly written and totally nonsense like What Was Your Plan. It would only be written to go against the stream, and there could be no pay off. The evil guy wins, and then literally nothing can happen after that.
