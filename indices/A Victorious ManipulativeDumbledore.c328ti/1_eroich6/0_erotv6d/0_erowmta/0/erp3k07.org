  his plan still was directly responsible for voldemorts defeat.

And that's a bad thing because...

#+begin_quote
  but in practice he still literally sacrificed harry for the greater good.
#+end_quote

Which is the only way to defeat him because Harry is too weak arse to be called the chosen one and Dumbledore love Harry too much to make him a super soldier. Does. Not. Mean. He's. Evil.

Call him manipulative whatever you want, don't try to make other see it as a bad thing let alone evil.

  Also dude chill a bit, were all fans of hp or we wouldnt be here so really no need for the insults my dude.
#+end_quote

I will never insult anyone if they weren't such a small minded fanatic of a certain character they hate.

If they wanna write ff of a character who is the opposite of they should be in canon. Go ahead. It's called fanfiction for a reason. I encourage it. It's for fun.

But if they decide to force it to become canon, not headcanon but literally HP Canon, Dumbledore is evil or Ronald Weasley is a jealous git or Molly is a literally a bitch. That's just pissed me off.

Edit: also what does Dumbledore gain from the war even if he's still alive? NOTHING.
