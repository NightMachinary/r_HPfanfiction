  Hagrid was never sent to fetch Harry which resulted in Harry being alone for his birthday. He gets fetched a few days later which leads to objective reality taking on a new tone and a new choice made every microsecond. Like a seed being enriched in soil, roots expanding so too does the universal wavefunction. It expands and adapts. Rating will go up. A/U

Commas are your friend. Your summary is a bit disjointed and has awkward phrasing. Many words are repeated in close proximity. I like the metaphors, but don't think you need both.

You have a tendency to write your sentences in the format "She did/had/was/etc ..." While this is fine, too many in a paragraph/story is unnecessary.

#+begin_quote
  She had a way to organize her the task ahead of her. She strategized the best way to approach her work. Her plan was to start with the final exams; she would start grading them and planed to get those final marks done first. Even though she had a reputation for being strict, she did bump up people to the next grade level if they were shy of a few points. It wasn't much but enough to increase the grades by two percent. "exams" she thought. It was her first priority.

- Most of the sentences in this paragraph start with she/her. Try rewording so the sentences are statements.

- The first three sentences are a bit redundant -- organize/strategize/plan. Length is great, but repeated ideas take away from the plot.

- Write thoughts like: ="Exams," she thought.= Also consider using italics to easily differentiate from spoken dialogue.

- Ideas in this paragraph need more segues -- the point bump was abrupt

Good luck on the rest of your story :)
