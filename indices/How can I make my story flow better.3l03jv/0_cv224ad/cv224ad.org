I looked through your first few paragraphs. Not every thought or action has to be explained. The bulk of the writing should contribute to the story, like adding suspense, developing a character, foreshadowing, etc. There is too much on what's happening and not enough on why I should care.

I think the best way to learn how to write in an "interesting" way is to study how different authors lay out a scene. Settings and actions often aren't straightforward but implied and they're always /relevant/. Minerva roaming down the hallway midday then sitting at her desk is a lot of words for not a lot of info. It doesn't give me any mood or anything from your plot.

Punctuation and paragraphs also help regulate pacing, and you should read up on how to properly space out dialogue; any google'd guide will do.

Be mindful that your characters are not you, nor outlets for your beliefs, nor exist to infodump and move the plot forward. That's how they turn out all the same, bland, and/or OOC. Minerva in the beginning is very much an infodump of things I don't know why I should care about.

Hope that gets you somewhere :) If I'm vague, I can try to clarify.
