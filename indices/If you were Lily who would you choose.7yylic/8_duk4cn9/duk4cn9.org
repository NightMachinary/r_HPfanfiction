Not hard to choose between the popular, good looking, funny guy who managed to mature and the ugly, infamous guy who like the dark arts and is friend with Death Eaters.

Both were bully, so we can really blame James for something Snape did too.

On another note, it really bother me that James take often the blame for bullying Snape in fanfics, when it's obvious that the memory we saw isn't the entire history.
