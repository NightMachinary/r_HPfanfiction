Well, neither, to be very honest. But definitely James (if someone was holding a gun to my head...).

But I really don't like what we've seen of him, I can only assume that he went through some drastic changes (Well, I'd hope so for my own sake in this unfortunate situation).

Remus wouldn't be too bad, I suppose.

Sirius is said to have been very handsome but I'd probably end up murdering a man like him... edit: he actually tried to murder Snape and didn't seem to have... well, evolved from then (yes, there were admittedly extenuating circumstances. We don't know who he'd be if he hadn't been in Azkaban).

Andromeda Tonks and Marlene McKinnon are rather awesome in my Headcannon. But we don't know a lot about that generation...
