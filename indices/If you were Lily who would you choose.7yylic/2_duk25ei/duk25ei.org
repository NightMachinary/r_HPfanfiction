If it had to be one of them, james over snape. I wish we got to see how their relationship evolved, because we dont see a lot of james's good side. i can only assume that he grew up quite a bit, really quickly, when he got that head boy badge, for her to fall for him. He wasnt particularly nice in the scenes we do see him.
