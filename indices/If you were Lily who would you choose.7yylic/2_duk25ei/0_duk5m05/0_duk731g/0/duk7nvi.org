Oh I know all of the characters had their own faults, Harry included (his capacity to forgive anything, though admirable, is one of them). But Snape's entire redemption arc was just villainizing James and Snape obsessing over Lily. The scene on the train wasn't even necessary, other than to show that Snape was racist. We already knew from OotP that the Marauders were bullies.
