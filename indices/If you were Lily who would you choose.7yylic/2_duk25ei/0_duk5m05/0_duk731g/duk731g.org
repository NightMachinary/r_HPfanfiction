  Well Snape had to look good somehow, didn't he? Apparently JKR thought the best method was to villainize James.

I don't think that was really the point of writing James like she did. There are a lot of thorough analyses that propose that it's part of a big theme of the books: Harry learning to stop adolizing positive figures in his life.

His father whom he idolizes in the first book, and the Marauders who looked so fun, are suddenly revealed to have been bullies no better than Malfoy and his goons. Dumbledore, our neighborhood Grandfatherly Wise Old Mentor, was pals with Wizardhitler as a child and may or may not have set Harry up to die. Molly and the Weasleys may be nice, but Molly becomes overbearing and overprotective in /Order of the Phoenix/ and distinctly less fun.
