My problem is that when trying to create a Snape that you could emphasize with, JK sacrificed James' character. It was fine that she showed that Snape was bullied by James in school, but we never see James grow up and redeem himself. They say he did, but JK never shows it. And that makes him look like a terrible person who's only redeeming quality was that he sacrificed himself in the end, and while that's good, it's not enough to cancel out his behavior in school.

If I really had to pick, then Canon, I'd choose neither, Fanon, I'd choose James.
