I guess it's a matter of what was baseline personality. I don't know whether I buy it, but a lot would interpret that James' schoolyard bullying, unprompted and petty, was an expression of his /baseline character/, whereas Snape becoming a Death Eater was out of desperation and pressure from the other Slytherins; so that while Snape's actions as such may be worse than James's, they paint his character in a better light.
