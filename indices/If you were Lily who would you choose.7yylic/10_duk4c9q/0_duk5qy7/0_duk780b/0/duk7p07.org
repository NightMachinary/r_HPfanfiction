I see what you mean.

There are some other factors as well, imo.

Snape came from a very disadvantaged background, had an abusive father, was a halfblood and had one friend (whom he lost).

James had two parents, his parents seemed to have been decent (took in Sirius etc) was rich / wealthy-ish (definitely not poor), was well-liked, a Quidditch star, seemed to have had the school behind him when he bullied Snape and also â€˜got' the girl...

It doesn't make him particularly sympathetic. Whilst we see Snape suffer through the whole 7 books.

However, wasn't Snape ok with letting Voldemort kill James and Harry? (Or am I mixing something up? There are some instances where fanfics have repeated something so often that it kind of seems to become part of canon, tbh..)

I guess it depends. But based on what Lily would have known when she was a 7th year?

James may have been very flawed (but could have changed for the better) whereas Snape was the wizarding version of an actual Nazi.... in a violent and active organisation. (And didn't seem to have shown any signs of change.)
