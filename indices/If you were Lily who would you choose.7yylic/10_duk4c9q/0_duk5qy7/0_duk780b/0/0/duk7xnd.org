  However, wasn't Snape ok with letting Voldemort kill James and Harry? And simply asked for Lily...?

Matter of interpretation again. Maybe he was self-centered to the last and would have killed Harry himself if he knew Lily was safe, but... I doubt it. It seems more to me that Lily was the best he could /get/ out of Voldemort. He knew Voldemort was going after Harry no matter what, and even if he asked for just "James and Lily" Voldemort might start to ask just why he wanted the two of them alive; whereas from Voldemort's dialogue in that scene, it sounds like Snape got him to avoid killing Lily by spinning it that he essentially wanted to ravish her.
