I wish there were more twinfics with good potters. In addition to three black birds which someone else mentioned there's Genius Fratris, but it updates pretty slowly. And also Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by Santi is a classic. I prefer when both the Potters and Dumbledore are good which is even harder to find.
