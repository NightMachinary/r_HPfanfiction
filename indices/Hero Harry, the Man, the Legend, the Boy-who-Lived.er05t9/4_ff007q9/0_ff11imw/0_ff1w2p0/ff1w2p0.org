It's a doorstopper of a series, but also extremely episodic. There is an overarching continuity (of a sort), but it's not terribly important except for the ending arc of #3. Good for a mindless read when you need to kill some time or want some basic Super!Harry fixing all the things, but it can be a bit heavy-handed when it comes to imparting a desired message and doesn't really obey the "show, don't tell" rule of storytelling.

Crosses over with a number of different universes here and there, including (but not limited to) Babylon 5, Star Trek (various), Buffy, The West Wing, and The Elenium.

As an aside, I've been having a bit of a rough day and was looking for some mindless reading to take my mind off things, so I think I'll follow this rec too.
