Harry tapped his wand against the table. "So, you have powers too."

Dudley shrugged. "Yep."

"And you go to a special school to learn how to use your powers."

"Yep."

"Any moving staircases?"

"No."

"Monsters in the sewers or on the grounds?"

"Yeah, but they turned out to be unlucky mutants with communications problems."

"Dark Lords out to kill you?"

"No, just some speciesists who want to recruit us so we can wage war on the humans. They're normally okay with us saying no though."

"... Right. Any, uh, fighting against bad guys, solving deadly mysteries and some such?"

"No, the teachers handle that stuff."

"The teachers?"

"Yeah. They moonlight as superheroes."

"Huh... Any evil defence teachers?"

"... Before my time I think."

"Cool. What about classes?"

"Oh, best in the world. Our curriculum is literally the best and the support we get is superhuman. I even got a special diet program for free as part of my scholarship."

"... Fucking Hell Dudley. Do they take prophecised saviours who've dealt with their Dark Lord or is it just mutants?"

"I'll ask Professor X next time I see him."

"Please do. I want to finish my education before I join the Aurors."
