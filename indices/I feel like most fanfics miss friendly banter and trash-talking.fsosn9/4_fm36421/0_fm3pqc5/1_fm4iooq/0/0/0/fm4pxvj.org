Ron's unsanctioned pet was on the food list of two of the sanctioned pets. It is probably only to the fact that it was in fact not a rat that it survived two years at Hogwarts.

He refused to properly secure his pet (eg a cage), he did not even possess any kind of carrier (like Hedwig's cage or whatever Hermione used). Worst case he could have simply asked his family or McG to transfigure one, yet he never does. That shows how much he cared about that rat. Therefore he has no right to complain at the natural behaviour of Hermione's pet.
