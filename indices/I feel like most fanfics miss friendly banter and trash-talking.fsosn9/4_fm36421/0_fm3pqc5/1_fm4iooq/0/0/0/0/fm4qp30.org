  Ron's unsanctioned pet was on the food list of two of the sanctioned pets. It is probably only to the fact that it was in fact not a rat that it survived two years at Hogwarts.

Unsanctioned? IIRC, it was Percy's pet rat first. If McG allowed it when Percy started Hogwarts, why should it be banned just because Hermione brought her cat? The cat that kept coming into the boy's dorm, for that matter. Ron's pet takes precedence.

  Therefore he has no right to complain at the natural behaviour of Hermione's pet.

Cats eat rats, fine. Then why was Hermione crying over the accusation that her cat ate the rat? Crookshanks had been going after Ron and Scabbers for months and she pulls the "Cats eat rats" card as a reason not to do anything to control her pet, but when Scabbers finally disappears its, "Why are you blaming Crookshanks for eating your rat? He didn't do it!" You gotta pick one.
