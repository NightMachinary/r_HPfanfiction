  As for why McG never said anything to Percy, well, most likely she did not notice. Or maybe she had pity with the Weasleys. In which case it would be like a police officer looking the other way when someone is smoking a joint.

Didn't notice? For FOUR years? Okay if you say so. And pity? Lee had a tarantula during Harry's first year. They have poisonous fangs. Did McGonagall 'pity' Lee as well?

  Probably because she was overworked and Crookshanks, for some parts of that year, had been her best friend (the firebolt mess was her fault, but that did not make her any less lonely).

So Hermione is free from responsibility because she's overworked. Right. Okay ðŸ™„. Had she controlled Crookshanks better or at least admitted "Okay, fine, maybe my cat ate your rat, I'm sorry", after saying "Cats eat rats", then maybe Ron's reaction would be uncalled for. But after failing to control her pet AND not taking responsibility (remember, Scabbers was found dead in the BOYS' DORM, not the common room, not the corridors, not the classrooms, in the BOYS' DORM)...yeah Ron's anger was justified. No two ways about it.
