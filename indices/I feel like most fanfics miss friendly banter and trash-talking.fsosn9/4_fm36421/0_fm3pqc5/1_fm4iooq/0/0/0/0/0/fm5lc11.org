No mention of rats. Therefore they are not allowed. As for why McG never said anything to Percy, well, most likely she did not notice. Or maybe she had pity with the Weasleys. In which case it would be like a police officer looking the other way when someone is smoking a joint.

Probably because she was overworked and Crookshanks, for some parts of that year, had been her best friend (the firebolt mess was her fault, but that did not make her any less lonely).
