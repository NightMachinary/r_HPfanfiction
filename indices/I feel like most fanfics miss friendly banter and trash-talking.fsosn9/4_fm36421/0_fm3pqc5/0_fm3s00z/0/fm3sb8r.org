In the first four books, they constantly are trying to hurt each other verbally. What Ron says during the Yule Ball, or more accurately what he implies (Hermione is either a naive bimbo or a traitor after Hermione had been the only one who really stood with Harry) would be a friendship ending moment IRL. And in year 3, the gloves were off completely.

If anything, those books show that Ron is unable to take a good ribbing is stride, nor does he attempt to during the whole pet fighting business.
