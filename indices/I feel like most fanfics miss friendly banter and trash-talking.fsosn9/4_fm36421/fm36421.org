To quote Prisoner of Azkaban; /Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, â€˜You asked us a question us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?'/

I think that infers that the trio banter (or at least Ron and Hermione do) at least a bit. And then there's the common non-serious arguments between Ron and Hermione, they're probably a lot like the arguments between the Top Gear/Grand Tour crew, and then Harry randomly chimes in with a sarcastic quip.
