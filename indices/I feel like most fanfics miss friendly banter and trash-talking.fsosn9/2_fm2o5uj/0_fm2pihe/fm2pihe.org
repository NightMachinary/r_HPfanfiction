There are quite a few military movies where the characters are bantering while in the trenches or under fire. Gallow humour can certainly fit such a situation, or baseless boasting and then calling that out.

Also, I disagree with the idea that such scenes do not advance the plot or otherwise contribute little. It is a great tool to show character dynamics, to show their friendship or even as a background thing in other scenes.
