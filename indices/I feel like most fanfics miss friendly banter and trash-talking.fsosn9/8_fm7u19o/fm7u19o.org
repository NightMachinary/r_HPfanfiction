Agree with the comments that it's largely because of the skill required to write good "banter". It also depends on the plot and tone of the story, and how else the characters are developed.

Yes, Harry has a sarcastic streak, but too many writers then try to make that his entire (re-)characterisation, and it just makes him come across as insufferable.

I'm sure the writers fill in the characters more in their minds than they do in their stories, but when every piece of dialogue is either functional (driving the plot) or sarcastic (reinforcing that one aspect of the character), then it just makes the character lifeless.

I think with this aspect of character crafting, like with all things, it is about balance. This is where the world-building and inconsequential "scenes" come into play. A good writer will use the dialogue to show us something that a less skilled writer might tell us through the narrative.

Part of the beauty of the books is that they incorporate so much world-building, these are the usually irrelevant snippets (and occasional Chekhov's guns) that make the world seem deep and rich in history and detail. That matters every bit as much as driving the plot and getting to the next bit of "action".
