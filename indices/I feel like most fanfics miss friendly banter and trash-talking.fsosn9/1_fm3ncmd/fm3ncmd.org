Harry is sarcastic, but rarely so towards his friends. His sarcasm usually comes out as a result of anger or irritation, but rarely when he's in a good mood.

Ron can certainly throw some shots, like the example below.

  /“I've got two neptunes here,“ said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can't be right, can it?”/

  “Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney's mystical whisper, “when two neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry...” (*Book 4, Ch.13 "Mad-Eye Moody")

But, he's a few years out from being able to take shots in stride.

But it is because of this, that I think that a Post-Hogwarts Harry and Ron would be great for this. Once the awkwardness of puberty is over, I can definitely see them doing this.
