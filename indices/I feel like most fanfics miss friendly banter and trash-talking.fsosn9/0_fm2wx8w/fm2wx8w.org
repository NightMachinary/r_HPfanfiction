I think the main reason for this is pretty simple: good banter is hard to do right. It has to come off as in-character, be mostly original, and mesh with the atmosphere. That goes double with relatively serious fics, where it can be hard to set up scenes appropriate for that sort of humour.

When you think about how many authors struggle with dialogue in the first place, it becomes a little more clear why there's so little good banter. My advice would be to look for authors who write well developed dialogue; there's a decent chance you'll find what you're looking for along with it.
