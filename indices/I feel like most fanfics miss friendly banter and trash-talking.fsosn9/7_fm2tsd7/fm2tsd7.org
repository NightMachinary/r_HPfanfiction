I try to do this in my fic between fem!Harry and a Muggle!OC. She's snarky (I hope) and he's playfully arrogant. It's a careful balancing act though. I agree scenes should advance the plot, but what about fleshing out characters and getting readers inside their heads?

But yeah, Ron might make a 'self-deprecating' joke or two but Hermione would never use 'crude humour'.
