Not sure if it would qualify but Umei no Mai 's crossover fanfic Black Sky that's a Harry Potter x Katekyo Hitman Reborn comes to mind.

It's about a FemHarry that's actually like the adopted child of James because he was infertile so he did a ritual adoption of Lily while she was pregnant with FemHarry(?) and Sirius provided some of his dna.it's been awhile since I was able to re-read it due to time constraints of irl so I maybe misremembering that bit but this FemHarry was raised by Cassiopeia Black and other members of the Black family and was able to overthrow the ministry while she was in school with some help of her friends. . It's a long fanfic that's at over 300 chapters now.
