You got it:

- linkffn(Protection from Nargles) is a pure-fluff H/L piece that is so sweet it'll give you cavities.
- linkffn(Uncle Harry) the original one-shot that inspired the infamous Contractual Invalidation, a bit of humor and sweetness in one package.
- linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much) is possibly one of the best 'Dudley has a Magical child' stories out there, with a very canon-like feel and one of the most sympathetic Dudley portrayals I know of.
- linkffn(for a pessimist, i'm really an optimist) is a good oneshot example of annerb's masterful characterization skills with otherwise banal story ideas that makes the whole thing a joy. Check her other H/G oneshots too, though her best work is still the changeling and some AO3 materials not on ff.net.
