  He is less interesting than Harry and Hermione.

LIES! SLANDER! LIES AND SLANDER EVERYWHERE!

To give a more mature response, the reasoning behind less fics and pairings for Ron is simply because Harry is the main guy character and Hermione is the main girl character. So what does that make Ron? The next male character? When you look at it from that (admittedly shallow) perspective, it's no wonder he has less fics.

I've also noticed that there are people who don't ship Hermione and and Ron together because they love Hermione and hate Ron, but it's never the other way around. I've seen some people who love Ron and don't like Hermione but still pair them together. Hence why Ron is almost exclusively paired with Hermione.

But yeah, the bashing of him is ridiculous. I would rant about that, but I've already gone on more than enough times about my overflowing hatred for Harmony shippers, so I won't.
