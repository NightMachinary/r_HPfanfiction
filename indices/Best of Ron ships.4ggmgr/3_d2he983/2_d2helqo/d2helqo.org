Probably, and it completely proves Ron's jealousy in the book too, which is oddly ironic.

We don't care as much about Ron because, well, he is less interesting than Harry and IMHO Hermione. He doesn't have that many skills other than chess and is negatively portrayed a lot in the fanfics I read at least (eating habits, study habits, jealousy, etc). But I also think that makes him one of the more believable and human characters in the series. He has flaws and isn't extraordinary in many ways, much like many of us. That is supposed to make his character more relatable to the audience more as well, but I don't think that really happens. Maybe because everyone else has a specific character trait they are known for in the series, everything is supposed to be extraordinary in HP and he isn't or, perhaps, we don't like him because he reminds us too much of our flaws, whatever the reason is, he is ignored and cast aside in a lot of fanfics or used a plot device to show how Harry has no friends.

That was a whole lot of connected thoughts in one paragraph. Please read with caution lol.

EDIT: A lot of this is my person opinion.
