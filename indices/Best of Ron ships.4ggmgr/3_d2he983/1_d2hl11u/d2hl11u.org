I'm determined to find fics for this thread. Ron needs more fics. He can be a great character when not thrown into the OOC heap. The loyal, average guy with a normal family in a world chock-full of orphans and extraordinary talents? C'mon, writing him is a genuine /challenge/.

And I'm saying this as someone who doesn't really like to read about the Weasleys.
