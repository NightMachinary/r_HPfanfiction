linkffn(Disbelieving in Trees by potter47) is probably my favorite of the lot. Slightly rom-com-esque, but fits Ron and Luna perfectly, I think.

linkffn(Bare Feet and Blubbering Humdingers by A Million Ways). post DH romance, pretty decent stuff.

linkffn(Ron's Admirer by Goldy). Mildly amusing.

A couple of oneshots that are pretty good:
