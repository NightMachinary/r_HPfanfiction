In linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorchach's Blot), at one point, he gets bitten by one of Australia's particularly venomous spiders, only for the spider to die due to Harry's blood being poisonous.

The spiders KEEP biting him because he seems like a basilisk to them, and basilisks are natural enemies to spiders, for some reason(I have no clue WHY a spider would care about a snake, though)
