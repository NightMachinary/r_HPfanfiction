Frowning, Harry began to approach Ron slowly. “Ron, don't you think this is a bit excessive?”

Ron's eyes flicked to his before returning to the spider on the floor. “That thing is evil, Harry. Have you seen it's size?”

He flicked his wand again. Another green flash of light flew out and crashed against the arachnid crawling across the Acacia wooden tiles of the floor.

One second. Two.

Nothing. The spider got back up on its legs and began crawling across the floor again, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

Ron let out a loud groan. “Just die already! Merlin, what's wrong with the spiders in this house?”

Harry shook his head and looked on as his best friend prepared to cast yet another killing curse. He couldn't blame him for being unnerved, but this was taking it a bit too far.
