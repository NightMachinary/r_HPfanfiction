I'm French, but infortunately I'm not familiar with the British educational system. But on the top of my head :

- Bread at every meal. The baguette thing isn't a cliché, we really are fond of bread.

- Cheese. Cheese variety vary by region, and since students are coming from every part of France, there are probably a good variety of cheeses proposed at Beauxbâtons.

- In a fancy school like Beauxbâtons, a typical breakfast at Beauxbâtons would probably be either milk/coffee/hot chocolate, fruit juice, toasts with butter and jelly and pastries (croissants, pains au chocolat and pains au raisin).

- Students from overseas regions to add a bit of diversity. Fun fact, France has territories on every continent (we even share a border with Brasil !)

- French climate is very diverse. North students are probably used to rain, cold wind and cloudy sky, than students from the South who grew up in sunny regions.

I'll try to come up with more, if you have any question I'll be happy to answer them :)
