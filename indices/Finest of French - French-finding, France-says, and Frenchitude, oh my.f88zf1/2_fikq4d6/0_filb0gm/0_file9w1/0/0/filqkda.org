Why would one school for the Latin part of Europe make more sense than a school per area? If we're taking that route, it really doesn't make any more sense for the UK to have its own school compared to Italy or Spain or the low countries.

It's a lot more reasonable if you take the approach that the triwizard schools are simply the 3 most prestigious in Europe - but there's basically no way that it's reasonable to have them be the /only/ good schools on the continent.
