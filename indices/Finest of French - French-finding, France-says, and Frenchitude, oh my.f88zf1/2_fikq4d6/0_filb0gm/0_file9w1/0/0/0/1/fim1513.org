Seeing as Beauxbâtons is located in the Pyrenees I personally think that the school was created during the Reconquista. Or at least the original building was built during that time. See, I think Beauxbâtons was originally a ‘châteaux fort' in the Pyrenees used by Christian wizards and eventually around the time that the north of Iberia was retaken, noble wizarding families that spoke French and the Christians from Iberia sent their children to Beauxbâtons. Over the years the tradition went on until Iberia was fully reconquered and afterwards. I also imagine there being a school in Rome as vestige from the Roman Empire, but that it would have slowly transitioned into a wizarding Catholic school with a direct link of communication with the Holy See (depending on the reigning Pope) and with the Inquisition and the Witch Hunts spreading it would have gotten less popular in the Italian magical community. This coupled with the integration of Naples into Aragorn would have made Italian witches and wizards attend Beauxbâtons until there were more Italians there than at the Roman Catholic Institute of Sorcery. The classes would have been given in either French, Latin, Castilian, Catalan, Portuguese, and (maybe Basque) and the administration would simply have had to add two or three classes (I mean groups per year) in Italian. The fact Beauxbâtons expanded regularly through history would even explain why it has a Baroque architecture instead of the contemporary one of the time of its construction. You can also bet your ass Charlemagne would have made sure his wizarding subject (and others) would have an education just like he made (with varying success) to his Muggle ones. So, what do you think?
