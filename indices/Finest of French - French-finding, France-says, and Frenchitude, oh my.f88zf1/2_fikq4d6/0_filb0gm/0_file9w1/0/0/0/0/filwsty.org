The language is somewhat similar, sure. But again, unless there's a reason to argue that the magical societies would be integrated, it doesn't make any sense to me that the Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian magical societies would just happily send their students to Beauxbatons instead of making their own school. The histories of France, Iberia, and Italy are also certainly varied, and quite different by the time of the SoS - it's remarkably lazy, to me, to just group them together, and I'm sure that people from Spain and Italy and the like would be more than happy to tell you why they wouldn't have gone to France for school. (And again, around the time of Hogwarts being founded and for the next few centuries, England would have likely been more associated with France than Spain or Italy would have been.)

Like, at least if we were pretending there'd be one school for the HRE or the Ottoman Empire, we could make the argument that there was a single muggle state that encompassed the whole area - you can't do that with France/Italy/Iberia. I guess I'm just going to disagree with you as to the amount of sense it makes :/
