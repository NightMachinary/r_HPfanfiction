Because the languages are similar and supposedly easier to learn if you already speak one.

They are also pretty close culturally because they all stayed catholic during the reformation and Spain, Portugal and France had a similar interior structure, unlike for example the HRE or the British monarchy. At least until 1692, when the SoS came into effect. Portugal even used to be in a personal union under the Crown of Spain.

There's also no deep historical animosity comparable to the ones between Poland and the German state(s) or Poland and Russia. Or anything in the Balkans. Therefore putting the Latin countries into one school would go over a lot smoother than trying the same with Serbia, Bosnia, the Ottoman Empire, Transylvania, Poland, the Habsburg realms, Greece and so on.

Obviously "more schools" are the easier route.
