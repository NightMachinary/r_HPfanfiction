Right, so it's before the Valois dynasty existed ;)

For France, I'd point to the end of the 100 years war for it really becoming a centralized thing - yes, Philippe Auguste did a lot in the 12-13th century to concentrate power around the king, but that fell off after Philippe le Bel's reign again - so we're back to the 15th century for true royal, centralized power to become predominant (Louis XI being where I'd personally point to).

But I'm very much not picky with the chronology - so Beauxbatons or any other school being founded way before or after its Pottermore date is no big deal to me, as long as it works in the fic.

As for the Ancien Regime culture/structure to it, it's certainly an option! I personally find myself less convinced by it because of how relatively open wizarding France seems to be towards non-humans (Fleur and Madame Maxime are the only two French characters of importance that I can remember in the books, and both are part non-human and in important positions) - which implies, to me, more along the lines of the ideals of the Revolution compared to the Ancien Regime. But if you were to take that route, it'd be very much pureblood culture and Noble focus
