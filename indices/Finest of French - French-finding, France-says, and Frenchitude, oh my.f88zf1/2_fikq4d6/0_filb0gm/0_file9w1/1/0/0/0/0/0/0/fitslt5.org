Heh. Yeah. You make a good point. A third estate of seventy people wouldn't really work as well if the other two estates only have thirty between them. Could be that the magicals took the role of the First and Second Estates while the Third Estate were the Muggles, so post-Statute they were stuck without their peasant-caste. That could be an interesting thing to explore, how a society of Magical Superiority Nobles would change when they were suddenly bereft of their servants. So, their society falls in the 1690s when the Statute is implemented (and yes, I googled that) and then muddles along for a century until the Revolution happens and the influx of new ideas rejuvenates the society and they restructure to more Revolutionary ideals.

Oh, the Irish would probably be miffed, yeah. The division of North and Republic was only in the early 20th Century though, so a few hundred years post-Statute. At least some of them would be okay with it. :D

Oh, agreed. Very much a leader. But that provides some conflict. A powerful and self-possessed (l'audace, indeed) general who believes wholly in the cause but is... less than enthused about Grindelwald would likely result in some immensely vitriolic politicking and hierarchical jockeying. It'd be a fun balance to play around with, methinks. And you're right, he did have an excellently... 'reputation-boosting' death. The 'poor fisherman' thing, right? They even made a play out of it - Danton's Death - where he was portrayed as quite the hero.

Of course, I found out recently that a British children's comedy show called Chucklevision also did a special that was... quite 'special' indeed. If you haven't seen that, you really ought to. It's closer to the Pimpernel plays than actual history, but it's a truly spectacularly odd insight to what British Children in the early 2000s were implicitly taught about Robespierre and the French 'situation' back then. You'll either find it hilarious or be utterly horrified. :D
