The Thermidorans are towards the end of the revolutionary period, yeah - that's initially the group that purged Robespierre (from varied ends of the spectrum politically) and then set up the Directorate (to replace the Committees), which puttered along for a few years until the coup of Brumaire, where Napoleon (+ Seyes + Napoleon's brother saving the day) set up the Consulate. Depending on who you ask, the boundary for the end of the revolution tends to be with Thermidor, Brumaire, or even when Napoleon ends up declaring himself emperor - like everything with the Revolution, it's not super clear!

Danton did indeed have a good last line - it's supposed to be "Tu montreras ma tÃªte au peuple, elle en vaut la peine !" - "You'll show my head to the people, it is worth the sight!" But like you say, good and evil are not very clearcut in most major historical figures - and trying to reduce their complexity to a single facet is... not usually particularly useful.
