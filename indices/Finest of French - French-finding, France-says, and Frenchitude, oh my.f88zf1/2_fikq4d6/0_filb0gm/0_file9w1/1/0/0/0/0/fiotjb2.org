Oh, definitely not. I very much forgot to actually make that clear in my comment. I just sort of skipped that part and went on to the explaining my agreement without actually explaining that I agreed first. :D

Hmm. Yeah, that seems logical. Kind of a conceptual migration from the Muggle Revolution to the Magical World. I imagine there'd be a lot less orthodoxy (in the general philosophical/, not religious sense) in Tradition and Etiquette than the English Pureblood society seemed to have. Probably a lot more amenable to discussing new ideas, even if they never integrated them. Do you think there'd be a Wizarding Ancien Regime that was overturned then, or more slowly pushed out?

Hmm, yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Europe is a set of very... individualistic countries. Too much history to really integrate overmuch like that, huh? Hmm. The only unifying thing I could really think of is that they're all countries that had overseas colonies at one point. Well, and the obvious of them all being ex-Roman provinces that didn't join Byzantium. That could be an interesting beginning, considering it was a thousand years-ish prior to the formation of Beauxbatons. Your way is probably easier though. Occam's Razor, eh? :)

(Feel free to tell me I'm poking too much, I'm very aware that I'm close to basically pushing you to work through an entire novel setting at this point :D).

And yep. Danton is the most half-giant person since Andre. I still remember the Monthly Review line where he was described as of colossal height, athletic make, and coarse and displeasing features. Quick aside - I've actually been tempted to use him as a model for an OC Character that'd be a big general of Grindelwald's. That kind of righteous fury, and especially the reporting of that whole conversation with Robespierre about innocents being executed, really makes him seem like the sort of person that'd fall under Grindelwald's idealistic spell, then be stuck once the more terrible actions unfolded. Very interesting man to read people write about throughout the past.
