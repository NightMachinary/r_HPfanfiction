Using the muggles could be one way of having a third estate, yeah - an option there would be to start it off with muggles living on pureblood estates fill that role initially (since I imagine some purebloods would also be muggle nobility), but transition over time around the SoS to incorporate muggle-borns and poor half-bloods and non-humans - with the Noble Families filling the role of the 2nd estate in wizarding society, centralizing power in the same way. So then, a century later when the French Revolution comes around, you've got that same class of poor wizards/witches, and somewhat well off ones that aren't noble, that start to get the same sort of ideas.

For Danton's reputation, I was more referring to the fact that we tend to forget about his ethics problems (it's pretty apparent that he was enriching himself along the way) because of how he died - and how it fits into the anti-Robespierre narrative the Thermidorans wanted to push to distance themselves from the terror. A lot of the portrayals of the Revolution in movies and plays will make sure to play him up as the good Republican who gets unjustly executed in the final display of Robespierre's megalomania (like the one where Depardieu plays him).

I haven't heard about that comedy special, I'll have to give it a watch. Nothing would really surprise me about British teachings of the Revolution in general and Robespierre in particular, though :P
