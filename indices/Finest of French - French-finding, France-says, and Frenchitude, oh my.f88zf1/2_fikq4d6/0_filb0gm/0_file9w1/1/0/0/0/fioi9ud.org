Oh, my bad - seems I misread you there!

I see what you mean with integrating Rowling's worldbuilding - I just find myself a lot more lethargic with doing so outside Britain, just because it's so lazy (the handful of schools, the names of the Brazilian/Japanese ones, etc) - it's just so... dead/boring. At least within Britain there's a lot of little details and fun tidbits to try to piece together for something canon compliant!

I've always liked the idea of the Revolution having had some wizarding involvement - not necessarily breaking the statute, but I could see an overlap between muggleborn rights movements in the WW and the revolutionary ideals (Plus, Danton could totally be a half-giant). It's easily possible that the WW would have stayed more removed and had the ideas of that tumultuous period slowly percolate through - or, if involved to some degree, had the more vociferous purebloods emigrate.

For the educational matter, I really don't like the idea of Beauxbatons as the only magical school for that whole area of Europe - it just doesn't make any sense to me, unless the magical community in those areas were to be united into a single nation. I don't see the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, etc not having their own school if they're independent political entities, and willingly letting themselves be more or less at the whim of the French. What I can stomach is Beauxbatons being the premier and most prestigious school in continental western Europe, where families from other nations would plan to send their kids there for a better education. Like how some families in Britain would send their kids to Durmstrang, despite Hogwarts being right there.
