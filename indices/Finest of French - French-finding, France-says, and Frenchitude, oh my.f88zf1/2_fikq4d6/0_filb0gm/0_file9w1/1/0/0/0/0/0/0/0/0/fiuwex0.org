I do like that. You're probably still right about the size of the Wizarding population being strongly limiting in the Ancien Regime regard, as you said previously. There's likely some balance to find in there somewhere, but I think I'll probably end up using something close to this iteration when I finally get my current HP fic idea done enough to upload. And my fifteen other WIPs finished. :D :'(

I always forget that Thermidor is a thing that isn't just Lobster. They were part of the final days of the Revolution, right? The whole replacement of the Convention with the thing that Napoleon overthrew that I forget the name of. I wanna say the Directorate, but I don't currently have the opportunity to google things (long story) and I'm not fully certain on that. I know -ate was a Middle-English, Middle-French thing so would've been around in language by the Revolution, but I'm not sure what they went with.

And ah, okay. I think it is like I said, a good death often forgives a poor life. I do hope he got as good a last line as history and theatre seem to enjoy, though. A man like that would seem to deserve it - good and evil were often entwined in historical events and figures, but he seemed to do decently enough. His portrayal does get surprisingly accurate/'real' in some plays though - that Danton's Death play I mentioned does have him be a 'purported hedonist', despite his ascribed heroism.

...I don't know. This Chucklevision one is quite... something. I really can't describe it in any other way. I think... imagine if Jeremy Clarkson and Arthur Weasley were wandering through France during the Revolution and got involved/got front row seats to various events. That's probably the right vibe for it.
