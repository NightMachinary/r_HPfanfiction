That's what I was thinking about the difference in protocol/tradition between the French and british magical society, yeah - less uptight than typical fan-cannon, more open, etc. For the Ancien Regime aspect, it does depend on how we picture the WW in centuries past. To have a true 'ancien regime' setup, you'd really need to have a very sizable wizarding world - if it's small, you wouldn't really have the social stratification that characterized it, and there wouldn't be the various sub-units in wizarding France to have all the variations in local laws/regulations/privileges. I think you could certainly have had a fairly robust noble culture in wizarding france in the pre-revolution, I just don't know if it would really fit with what I think of the 'Ancien Regime' as something fairly specific.

Yeah, exactly - I imagine that already in the books, the Irish are probably somewhat unhappy at apparently being rolled in under Britain. There's just so much history across Europe, and it's not been unified in the last millenia+, that it's hard to think of them being so united without any pushback and still maintaining enough distinction to have their own governments.

That'd be interesting to use Danton there - though he was always more of a leader than a follower! His contrast with Robespierre is also always fun to read about (my favorite is a line from Robespierre's sister, where she tries to put it delicately that Robespierre was much less charismatic in person). Danton is a complex one, though - his reputation ended up a lot better because of how he ended up dying (and thus not getting the hit job that Robespierre got by the Thermidorans), and how his whole ethics situation got mostly forgotten... But I'd love to see a 'de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace' speech in a fanfic!
