Oh, yes. I was trying to agree with you. Apparently failed that one dismally. :D

I mean sure it's not really a big deal, but it's slightly interesting to see how we can integrate Rowling's appalling worldbuilding and internationality into real life historical events and culture, no? It might be inconsistent bullshit, but with the power of fandom we can make it work. :D

It's a very good point - that does seem more Revolutionary than Regime. Which is interesting, since it was supposedly after the Statute was implemented in the 1600-whenevers. Though, it'd be more interesting to me if the structures and institutions continued, but were influenced by the Revolutionary attitudes (perhaps during the Revolutionary period between Muggleborn immigration and the French salon-esque habit of intellectual discussion and exchange-of-ideas, or perhaps the people in the older institutions were killed by Grindelwald and the Revolutionary-minded Muggleborns just filled the gaps). So, the French could've had a Monarchy that moved away from the 'Let them eat Brioche' ignorance to a more socially responsible mindset. Centralised authority does work really well with smaller populations like the Magicals, after all.

I am curious about your broad thoughts on the previously mentioned educational-situation matter though. You've not said anything that contradicts what I can find in other sources, so I'm pretty sure you know your stuff in this regard. Do you think a Beauxbatons serving the entirety of the Latin/Western end of Europe would exist, or have any ideas on how it might've come about?
