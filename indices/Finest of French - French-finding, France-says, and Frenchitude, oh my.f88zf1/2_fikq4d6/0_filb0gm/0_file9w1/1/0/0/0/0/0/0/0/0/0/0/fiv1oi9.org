Ooooh. That is a good one. It's a very 'pimp' line. I can imagine the awkward chuckles rippling through the crowd at the guillotine. I can definitely imagine Skip the Use quoting it and making a big lyric-drop moment out of it. Or, less appropriately, a big American rapper taking a more Macklemore thrift-shop-esque 'walk in the club, like what up, show my head to the people' sampling approach to it. Anyway, I'll stop that tangent there before I ramble too much about the fact that I've actually heard of some French musicians like a boastful fangirl. :D

Not particularly useful and also less fun. It brings them down to our level, making them both good and evil, I think. Makes them interesting instead of just admirable/worshipped. It's part of why I find the intersections of history and psychology and socio-anthropology so entertaining. It helps us realise that Heroes are always just people, and people are always just Human. And I'll stop that tangent there too. I'm just tipsy enough to get bubbly-enthusiastic about history and start asking you a million chirpily phrased questions about French history (because this stuff is incredibly interesting and, in case I haven't said it before, I'm wholly grateful at you taking the time to educate me on almost a dozen different threads now and would love pointers to some good textbooks and such that I can read more about this with without bothering you too much more) and aside from trying not to be 'that person' on the internet, I also have other things to do. :D

Oh, I did get Directorate right? Noice. Go me. And okay, the 'Consulate'. I definitely wouldn't have remembered that. Too much confusion with the modern sense of the word a la Embassies.

I imagine the end of the Revolution came before the end of the Revolutionaries, with my current tipsy-logic. When the big changes and 'revolutionising' finished versus when the last of the people who made those changes were removed from power. The two aren't intrinsically identical, after all. They probably got lazy, right? :)
