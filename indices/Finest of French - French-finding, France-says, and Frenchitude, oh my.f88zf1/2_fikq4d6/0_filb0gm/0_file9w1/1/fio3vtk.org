I mean, Beauxbatons is canonically formed before the 1290s (assuming they've been involved with the Triwizard Tournament since the start, 1990-700 is 1290) and after Hogwarts in 990, so it's apparently 'definitively' some time between those two dates.

If memory serves, that was about when France started to become a unified thing and helped push a lot of intellectual/cultural/literature developments, so perhaps a particularly English-hating Manor Lord built up the school as an alternative and it was simply good enough to compete. Could have gotten lucky and brought in some big names to teach that pulled in other students. Or perhaps it originally was a French-only school and simply grew to include the other nations after it established itself. If it was after 1290, I'd note that I've read a couple of textbooks that say France was one of the most populous regions in Europe by the mid-1300s, matching and possibly exceeding Italy and Spain.

Plus, if Rowling's terrible maths is actually right and there's only 3000 Wizards in England, then there wouldn't be too many more than that in Western Europe, so I suppose more than one big fancy school wouldn't be overly maintainable or useful. But if it were right, then we'd be buried under a mountain of avian porcine and hell would be boiling over, so... Perhaps Not. :)

EDIT - Oh, and also, someone else noted that perhaps 'Modern Magical France' might take more of an Ancien Regime culture and structure to it. I'm curious, what are your thoughts on that?
