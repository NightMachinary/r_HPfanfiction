The house of Valois only emerged in the 14th century, actually (1328 - they get their name from Charles, Comte de Valois who died in 1325 and never ruled France - the 'Rois Maudits' - or Accursed Kings - series includes him, if you're interested in that period.) - and you're incorrect as to how much of Europe was ruled by them. The Valois were originally only in France - at most, you could also say there was one Valois king of Poland-Lithuania in the 16th century, and a bunch of dukes, but they certainly did not rule most of Europe. You're probably thinking of the Habsburgs (who'd rule in Austria, Spain, Bohemia, the Netherlands, Hungary, Naples, Portugal, etc) or the Bourbons (France and Spain, primarily). Past that, of course, it doesn't really make sense for them to send their schools out of country to be trained for no real reason, whatever the muggle king's dynasty might be.

Like, there's really no reason why there wouldn't have been an Italian or spanish magical school /except/ that JKR didn't really care about anything outside the UK, and didn't bother to explain it. The language is different, the culture is different, etc - if we're going to say that those magical communities are intertwined enough to have Beauxbatons the only school for continental western Europe, then it's almost certainly going to be a single school.

Obviously you're free to find whatever justification you want to make that work... but if we're taking the muggle justification from that time period, you'd have no real reason for /Hogwarts/ to exist - if I were to hazard a guess to what region of Europe outside of France in the 12th-14th century would be most likely to send nobility to France to be educated/raised, it would be England.
