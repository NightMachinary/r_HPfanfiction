I never had any problems about Beauxbatons teaching students from around half of Europe. In my headcanon, the school was created later than Hogwarts, during the XIIth or XIIIth century.\\
At that time, the Dynasty in place were the Capet of Valois (a branch of the Capetian Dynasty), and other branch of the Capetian dynasty ruled most of Europe), so it's not that hard to imagine that the children of all these countries were sent to Beauxbatons. With the Statue later happening, the school kept teaching children ignoring what happened in the Muggle world.
