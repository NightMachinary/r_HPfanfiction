[[/u/little_lou]] covers some excellent points to keep in mind - personally, I would take a few steps further to more structural ones. Obviously, we know very little about Wizarding France in Canon, so you have a lot of ways to take it.

One big one for me is that you do want it to reflect french culture and history, and so it should feel rather distinct from Wizarding Britain. One way to do that is to start the wizarding culture/society from scratch, and decide how it might have evolved. For instance, we get hints from canon that France is more open to non-humans than Britain is in the wizarding world. Emphasizing that might lead to ideals of the French Revolution playing a bigger role in the Wizarding culture of France - and so with much less of a pureblood focus than the ones we see in Britain. Other divergent points are always interesting to pick up on.

For Beauxbatons in particular, I'm personally not a huge fan of it. The way it's a school for half of europe in canon, and pretty barebones, just doesn't really do it for me. But it does give you room to take it as is - a Hogwarts like school in a castle - or shift it to be more along more modern french lines (eg, directly state-owned and nearer the major wizarding center of France instead of remote, etc). I'd be more than happy to have it renamed and retconned in a fic to something different... But that's beyond the point of this post!

Food wise, you'd definitely want to play up the much better and abundant ( ;) ) bread, pastries, wine, and other classic french dishes. When eating with family, meals tend to be very relaxed and take a long time - at least in my family & connections (I can't speak towards British culture on that front). My family tends to buy everything local when we're in France - so going to the local market, small shops in walking distance, buying fresh bread, etc.

Much will depend on how wizarding culture is decided to be portrayed. If it's more along governmental/centralized lines (ie, around Paris), it'll feel very different from being spread out in the countryside and across the whole of France. If you live in Britain, I'm sure you've been able to take a trip to Paris and/or the French countryside, and see some of the differences pretty visibly (I've run into enough brits in vacation in the Dordogne to notice that ;) ). But France is a lot more spread out and agricultural than the UK, I believe.

In some ways though, it's very hard to say. I've mentioned before that a lot of the british culture in the wizarding world got rolled over into the magical side of things, so it's hard to know what should change to really fit the same 'feel' as a british person would have reading the books, you know?
