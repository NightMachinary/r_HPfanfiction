I know this from my French exchange; pain au chocolats are twice the size you get in the UK and about a quarter of the price.

So if you're writing a piece where there's an equivalent of Hogsmeade (I hope that's right), the pastries are larger and cheaper than the british equivalents.

Bread is also a fair bit cheaper as well.
