I'm not sure if it was clear when I wrote students but they're usually uni students with a part time job that have nothing to do with the middle/high school they're working in, not the students of the school that are paid to be prefects.

But other than that you're right, except that like the teachers, the supervisors have a distant relationship, they're more here to enforce the rules than to take actual care of the students, at least that's the experience I had. Sorry I'm not clear but it's kinda hard to explain the concept..
