Not at all, you made perfect sense. Entirely clear. They're cheaply paid eyes hired externally to help keep order and discipline. Impersonal watchers and enforcers, not friends.

Our prefects in the UK would only ever be students on the rolls of that school. The only time you'd get uni students going into schools would be with Charities like Place2Be or as teaching assistants through a contract with the school or work experience with a university.

Teachers being distant is quite relative. Some teachers will get very friendly, sharing personal anecdotes and life milestones. Some teachers won't. It's very relative, but we tend to prefer the friendlier teachers.
