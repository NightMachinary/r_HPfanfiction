As a French that has a million head canon about Beauxbatons and French magical society as a whole, here's some of mine:

Administration : we love filling forms, there's no way inscriptions to Beauxbatons are just answering a letter. Same with the banks, there's always a form to sign, informations to give, etc..

Complaining and arguing : if you don't know how to small talk in french, complain about the weather, about your class, about teachers, about your boss, about government, anything you can think of. More seriously we're used to questioning everything, arguing a lot, not in an agressive way, more as an intellectual exercise, and as a result we complain quite a lot.

Strict teachers : the student/teacher relationship in France is a pretty distant one. My only point of comparison is Australia, and in France most students use formal 'vous' to talk to their teacher, and teachers are usually pretty strict.

Les surveillants/pions : not sure how to translate this, but the closest would probably be supervisor. In french middle school, there are young men and women paid minimum wage (usually students with a side job) that watch the students during meals, during study hours, and in the schoolyard when they have free hours. If it's a boarding school they'll also be there at night and checking everyone is there, they're the ones students go to when they have a problem outside class. They're kind of a middle ground between a headboy/girl and a teacher.

There are also other little things like :

-the marks aren't letters but a number out of 20

-obviously food, magical p√¢tisseries etc

-smoking, even though you can't legally buy cigarettes before 18, a lot of high schoolers and even middle schoolers smoke outside schools, and no one would make a fuss if they saw teens smoking in public.
