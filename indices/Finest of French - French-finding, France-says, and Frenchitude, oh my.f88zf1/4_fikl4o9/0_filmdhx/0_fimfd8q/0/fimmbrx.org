We did! A-G for handed in work and a U if you didn't. Though we never had plus or minuses, and just had an 'A*' for the highest marks. I believe the system is numbers from 1-9 now, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

Well, all that aside from university degrees which are rated on a first, upper and lower second, third, and fail mark.

I vaguely remember my primary school (This was over a decade ago) using numbers then letters where 1 was the highest and 7-ish was the lowest and each number grade had a letter attached like 1a was basically an A+, 1b an A, then 1c an A-.

Do you know why your system uses a number out of twenty? It seems an odd thing to pick, given ten or a hundred would make percentages easier to do.
