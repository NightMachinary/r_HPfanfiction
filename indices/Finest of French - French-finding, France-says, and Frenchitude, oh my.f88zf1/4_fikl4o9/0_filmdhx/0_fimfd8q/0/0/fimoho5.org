Honestly that's a mystery to me, I suppose that making out of 10 isn't precise enough and 100 is seen as too complicated,but it's kinda random.

Some notes can be out of 10, or any other number, usually if it's just a small test with only a few questions, but they're always converted back to out of 20 marks, so that we can calculate average for each subjects and an overall average. Not sure how this works in the UK, but we use average notes a lot, there are your own average, and you can compare it to class or school average notes in every subjects, or overall.

Also the marks aren't always whole number, you can have a 16,25 or 12,75 out of 20,and when you average all of them you can end up with something like 14,96 out of 20. So in the end is a really precise system.
