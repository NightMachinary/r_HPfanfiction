Yes the baccalaureat works like a diploma, so at the end of your last year of high school you pass a written (and sometimes oral) exam in every subject, and if you have a 10 overall average, your bac is validated and you're out of high school and can go to uni, if you don't you most likely will have to retake your last year of high school.
