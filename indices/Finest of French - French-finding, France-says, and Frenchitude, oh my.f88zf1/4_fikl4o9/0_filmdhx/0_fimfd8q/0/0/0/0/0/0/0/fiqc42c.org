Okay, so grade validation is just saying that you've passed? Like comparing your achieved grade to the minimum required grade and noting if it exceeds or doesn't meet it?

We... don't really have a process for that, I don't think. We have a process in the other direction, where a uni student can resit their A-Levels for better grades, but I'm not aware of a similar thing for us. To my knowledge, generally you just have a grade threshold (usually an E or above) to pass the course and you either pass or fail. I'm not personally aware of anyone who repeated a year like that, or left school for anything other than behavioural reasons. You just get a low grade and a crappy qualification.
