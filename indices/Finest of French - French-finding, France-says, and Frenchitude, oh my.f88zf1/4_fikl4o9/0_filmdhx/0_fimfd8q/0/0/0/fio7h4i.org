Oh, that's interesting - grades not being whole numbers, I mean. That seems really precise and efficient, if a little more difficult to calculate. Britain's relationship with mathematics is quite... contentious.

Our version closest to an averages system is a weighted thing with a name I forget. I really wanna call it SARS or MEMS for some reason, but I think that's something from a video game. Essentially, each test is a certain section of your final grade, so you get a grade for that 20% or 40% of your grade, and then the test grades all add together to make the final 'average'. Meaning important tests or assignments will have a bigger influence on your grade than others. Otherwise, there's no real averages system.

From what I remember of our grade comparisons, it was more often done to 'excellence' than averages. So, you'd see pictures of higher scoring students on the walls with captions of "Name did really well on her tests, she got 8A*s and 2As" and things along similar veins. I don't remember any comparison to personal or class or school averages at any stage of my education.

Does French Education often focus on averages and the like? Is there a similar 'this student did really well, be like this student' vibe to either grade feedback or motivational literature/wall posters?
