Oh yeah, we also have coefficient, each teacher can decide that a certain mark will be worth 2 or 3 times the others..(to complicate this already not so simple average thing) Subjects also have different coefficient, depending on your section, like if your in the science section, maths, physics, and biology will be worth a lot more than French, history and geography for our equivalent of A-levels.

And we use personal and class average a lot, it's the main thing universities and other postgbac schools refer to to select students, and having a 14 average in a 10 average class is better than a 14 in a 14 average class. Also to validate your bac (A-level equivalent) you need a 10 average overall, I'm not sure how A-levels are validated?

We do compare with average, between students and also sometimes between classes, but it's never an official thing done by the school, more by the students themselves. Some schools will rank students from best average to worst, but nowadays its pretty frowned upon.
