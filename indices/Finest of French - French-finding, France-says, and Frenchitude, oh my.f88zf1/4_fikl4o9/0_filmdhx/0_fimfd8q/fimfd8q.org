As someone else said, having never been to the UK, it's hard to know which part is UK and which part is just magic school specific. I just assumed the UK also had a letter system like in the US.

Also I'm not sure all of those would translate directly to Beauxbatons, maybe they have mark out of another numbers or something. Smoking also I'm not sure how it would translate to the magical world.
