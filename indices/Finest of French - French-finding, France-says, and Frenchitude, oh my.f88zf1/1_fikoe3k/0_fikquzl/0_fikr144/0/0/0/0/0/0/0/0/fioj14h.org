I'm both French and American, actually - so I have at least somewhat of a look at both :P

In the US, the main political parties (due to how the system is setup) are very broad. So the Democrats encompass everything from center-right in French politics all the way to the somewhat-left. That's with caveats that on some issues, like healthcare, the view in the US is just off the charts to the right compared to France/Europe.

For a socialist candidate, the US would likely not vote for any actual socialist - the equivalent of the France Insoumise would be super fringe at best. A social democrat - along the lines of the old PS - would certainly get the vote of a lot of democrats if selected. That's where I'd put Bernie Sanders at, at least with his policies in the US - somewhat center-left by French standards, and there'd be a lot of democrats very happy to vote for him.

He's also done a lot to rehabilitate the term 'socialism' - even if he is now using it to mean social democracy. 15-20 years ago, a self proclaimed socialist would probably have had no chance - now, at least, that's changed.
