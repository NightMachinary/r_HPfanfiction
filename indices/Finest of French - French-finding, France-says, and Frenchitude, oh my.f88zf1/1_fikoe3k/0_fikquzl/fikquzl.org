Adding to the taboos topic, we are more opened to sexuality than in America. For example, a lot of ads in France will contain nudity and boobs, especially in the 90s.

The perception of religion is different too. We consider it belongs in the private sphere. I don't know if its possible in America, but you aren't allowed to wear any religious sign in French schools.
