A few things I know about France (as an American):

- */There is no snacking./* That is an American thing. French have multiple small courses and/or portioned meals to SAVOR and not simply EAT. You will get confused looks if you are snacking on the Metro. You get confused looks if you're strolling around France chomping down on food from a bag. They'll instantly identify you as a foreigner or "Frenchman/woman who has spent time in America" in seconds. They just KNOW.

- The French, compared to America, are infinitely more intellectual and don't have as many "taboos" in discussion as Americans do. They like to debate and discuss controversy, while it's hard to get into a controversial convo with somebody in America without somehow insulting them or getting into a heated argument.

- If it isn't already pretty well known, French are not as ridiculous about LGBT+ individuals. So if you're writing a "Harry-Attends-Beauxbatons" kind of fic, the "sexual awakening" stage of his growing-up into a teen is definitely going to be a lot more diverse and exploratory than what you'd get at Hogwarts (because stuffy old british customs of the wizarding world in britain probably aren't super cool with LGBT+.... unless you read into the "witches and sorcerers in Britain were a LGBT+ coded thing, so thus the wizarding world is hella cool with LGBT+" but it's all up to you on that.)

- Also pretty obvious: FASHION. Clothing styles in Britain are a completely different animal to French clothing styles. Do some research on 1990s french fashion and everyday wear vs. British fashion. and everyday wear. Trust me, there is a serious difference. Harry will look infinitely more trendy than anybody else in Wizarding Britain.

That's just a few things. Really, do some research on 1990s France. That's a pretty solid jumping point.
