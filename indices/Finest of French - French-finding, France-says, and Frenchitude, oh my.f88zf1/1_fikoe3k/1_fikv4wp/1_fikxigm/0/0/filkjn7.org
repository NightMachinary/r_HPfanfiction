IMO, it's not 100% for kids - it's /primarily/ for kids to have a snack at 4, but it's not really entirely for them. (Eg, my mom has a 4 heures every day still, and she's well past her childhood ;) )

Then again, unless significantly aging up the Harry Potter world, that'd certainly fall within the purview of kids ;)
