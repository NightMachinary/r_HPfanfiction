I always got the impression food is approached differently in France than the US and UK. It seems to be more of a social experience there than a fact-of-life/bodily-maintenance activity. Like you snack more/as much to be around friends than to actually eat.

As you know, I'm not French, so my impression is entirely second-hand from occasional tourist experiences, friends, and generalisation from similar situations I've experienced in Italy. We Brits often treat eating more like we treat brushing our teeth than we treat going out with mates, something I'm fairly certain we've gotten from the Americans.
