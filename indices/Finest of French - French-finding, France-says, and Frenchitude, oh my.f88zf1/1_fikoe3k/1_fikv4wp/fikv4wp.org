To correct, there /is/ snacking - but not like in the US, like you say. But 'un 4 heures' (a 4 o'clock snack) or gouter is not at all uncommon, /particularly/ for school age kids. But yes, people don't typically walk around eating a snack - you'd find somewhere to sit down and eat (either where you bought it, or a park, or something similar).
