I think that the WW had some descriptions on the elements:

- The wood represents the 'personality' of the wand;

- The core represents its inherent nature - for example a Unicorn hair wand will be less likely to turn dark arts, a Dragon heartstring core is easily swayed toward dark arts, a Phoenix feather core is shy, but very picky, however when it reveals its powers, they can be very powerful;

- The state is pretty similar to what you said;

- The length is usually proportional with the height of the wizard but a very short wand may choose a person that has a need to prove themselves, while a very long wand may choose an overconfident person.
