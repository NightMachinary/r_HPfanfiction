Yeah, thinking on it it kinda does seem a bit too far; though in my defense I did just finish binging Invincible before I made the post, so maybe I was a bit bloodlusted because of that.

That said, I kinda had the idea that Dumbledore started out the fight just trying to restrain Harry, but Harry kept hitting all the wrong buttons with a ceaceless tirade throughout the fight, culminating in all but accusing Albus of murdering Ariana, leading to Dumbledore's last nerve snapping.
