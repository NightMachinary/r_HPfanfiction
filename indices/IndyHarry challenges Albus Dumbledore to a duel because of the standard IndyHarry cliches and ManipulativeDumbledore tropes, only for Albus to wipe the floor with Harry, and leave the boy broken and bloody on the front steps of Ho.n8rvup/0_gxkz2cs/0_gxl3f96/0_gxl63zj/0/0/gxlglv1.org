I was under the impression that who it was that ultimately dealt the fatal spell to her was unknown; due to the chaotic nature of the three-way duel between Albus, Aberforth, and Gellart. All I know for certain is that Aberforth blames Albus, Albus blames himself, and Gellart didn't really care. Also I suspect that her death was a tragic accident that came about because two or more spells collided together, and went ricocheting off in random directions; thereby meaning that all three combatants would technically be the cause for her death, because it happened as a direct result of them choosing violence over words.

All that said, part of the idea would be Harry phrasing his taunts in such a way as to imply that Albus went out of his way to murder his own sister, possibly alluding to a bunch of fictional reasons that seem consistant with the deluded picture of "Albus Dumbledore" Harry has conjured in his mind.
