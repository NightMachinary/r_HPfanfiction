Drarry feels like something you'd only get if you read the books or -- more likely -- saw the movies as a teenager and up.

Because...

A) Movie Draco is very charming.

And B) Post Puberty people probably percieve possible parings with a passion more often that pre puberty people do.

And as someone who read HP in the 4th grade and has a noncommittal relationship with the movies... I don't really get it either.
