Several things that have already been said in here plus more.

1. They honestly are a bit obsessed with each other in canon. Because of this it's fairly easy to assume they would 'notice' the other if they were attracted to them.

2. Enemies to lovers is a popular trope and as someone who enjoys the trope it's just fun to me. This plus it honestly seems like they go out of their way to annoy each other sometimes.

3. There really isnt a better gay ship for main characters. Harry is kind of familial and very platonic friends with the weasley kids so they just arent seen like that as much. That plus there arent a ton of rlly fleshed out male characters Harry's age.

Like it's not everyone's cup of tea but its popular so people have their reasons. And honestly for a lot of fandoms the most shipped relationships tend to be gay ones.
