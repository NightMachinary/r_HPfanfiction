Probably enemies to lovers and the fact Draco (at least from a article I read, do correct me if I'm wrong) tried to offer friendship and Harry declined. Plus they'd look kinda cute together, at least that's my opinion. This is all coming from a Drarry shipper who doesn't get involved with the fandom though haha. The whole “they'd look cute together” is mainly because their hair colors are completely different from each (Draco's being super light and Harry's being super dark). Not sure why other people ship them though, that's just my reasons
