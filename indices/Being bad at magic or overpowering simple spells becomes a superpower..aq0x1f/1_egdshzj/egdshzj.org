Hm. The closest I can think of that fits is linkffn(A Sage Among Wizards by Kythorian). It's not really close at all though.

There's just one part where Naruto-as-Harry points out that while the other students struggled to do some minor bit of transfiguration, his particular difficulty meant that he learned how to produce explosions at will.

I feel like it should be said that the problem with trying to harness this sort of thing canonically is that it's likely entirely unreliable and mostly unrepeatable. Sometimes your failed levitation might cause the feather to explode, sometimes it might make it rocket into your eyeball.
