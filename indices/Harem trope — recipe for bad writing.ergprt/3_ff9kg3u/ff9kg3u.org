I wanted to agree with the general idea as writing good harem plot is either really hard or leads to crack fics. Harem Crack Fics are rather interesting in my opinion and allow for both doing the multi relationship plot as well as they remove some problems. However they are not the only way as one can trully make a good plot while keeping harem elements, provided of course that the are not more people involved than the author can manage and that the story pacing is somewhat slower to actually give time for character development and relationship development.

There are few important points beside that:

Trying to make all of the relationships involved as perfect ones leads nowhere.

Rushing it leads to failure or to crack.

Harem politics could work so well if anyone actually did them in any way other than political marriage.

While it is connected with other problems, tropes and cliches, why almost no story has a character as both bashed one and a part of harem, it could be quite a plot.

And finally, what actually lead me to writing this comment and unlike most of additional points above that are there because I like to rant is that harem stories can be mysoginistic but doesn't have to be. They are hard to write of course but it does not make them some special kind of evil. Discarding them can be of course a simple preference but it is a bit kinkshamy..

TLDR Harem stories are hard not bad, so dear writers GIT GUT or make it cracky.
