Harry's motivation is the smallest problem. Given that he's starved for affection and care thanks to the Dursleys, he'd always give 110% in that regard.

And given that there are potions to regrow bones, there ought to be some to help you bone. If the spirit is willing but the body weak, there are always human transfiguration, possibly metamorphic powers, Polyjuice (fresh muscles and "tools") and good ol' toys.

Also, not everyone has to be a nymphomaniac, nor does Harry has to be the only source of "entertainment". If anything, Harry and a girlfriend/wife "getting together" with another couple would probably be the most believable scenario for an M/F/F/F situation, and that would drastically reduce the "workload".
