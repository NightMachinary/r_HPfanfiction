No, I live under a rock. It's nice but a bit cold, and I can't plug my phone... Yeah I heard about it. Viagra is not often taken by young, healthy and fit people. And it can be dangerous if used too often. Taking potions at sixteen, seventeen...just because you decided it would be fun to have 7 girlfriends... Plus Viagra doesn't prevent you from feeling the pain of over-exertion, and it doesn't get you in the mood. You might be aroused but that doesn't mean you're up for a good shag. You can fulfill the basic motions but it doesn't mean it'll be good. Now Harry having to satisfy multiple partners, without losing interest and enthusiasm...without hurting himself...without loosing feelings in his bits...without taking more and more time to reach Merlinland. Even potions can only go so far! (strange topic innit?)
