  I'm not against polyamory. But harem fics are just a recipe for bad writing. Harry spends two paragraphs with each girls and each of them seem content with only that.

The thing is, just like with any group of people you write about, you CAN make pretty much any size of cast work if you spend enough time on character development AND the interactions of everyone inside that group. BUT, here's the issue. Doubling the number of people does not double the number of relationships between the characters, the increase is much larger. It gets infeasible really quickly:

- 1 Character - 0 Relationships

- 2 Characters - 1 Relationship

- 3 Characters - 3 Relationships

- 4 Characters - 6 Relationships

- 5 Characters - 10 Relationships

And so on. With each character you add, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep them unique and their actions and interactions believable. Romantic entanglements are just the cherry on top of the already difficult characterisations and relationships. Look at Canon and at how little we actually learn about the characters other than Harry. We don't even know the names of Hermione's parents, or what her dream profession would be. And that's just the trio, nevermind Ginny or Neville.

But while it kinda works for (distant) friends, that would be unacceptable for people in a committed relationship. So you either don't move the plot at all or you do as most harem fics do and ignore characterisation beyond one or two generic traits. And that's why they are so bad. Not because the premise is inherently bad, very few are, but because the people who write that kind of fic usually lack the necessary skills to make their premise work.

Tl;dr: Anything up to 4 people can be made to work with enough effort, everything beyond that is doomed to fail.
