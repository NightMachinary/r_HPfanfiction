Yeah, I feel you on that. I reread my comment and realized that I might have come off as condescending which wasn't my intention, so I'm sorry for that.

I LOVE the Poly trope which is a big part of why I don't like Harem fics, honestly. As a Poly person myself, it always seems like kind of a cop out when the author goes for Harem. There aren't nearly enough Poly stories out there.
