Oh yeah I agree with you. Good poly is hard to find. It starts as poly then turns into a harem fic with a godlike man and objectified and badly written women. The love is almost non-existent. Harry just throws “I-love-you”s left and right without any reason about why he fell in love. “Susan if you sign this betrothal contract, I'll promise to love you and cherish you for as long as we live [...]” well sorry to burst your bubble toxic male but you can't promise love, you either feel it or not, you can't force it. I'm not a Poly person, but I don't mind and even like reading good poly fics, but they seem to be rare commodities these days. While I'm gay and prefer slash I will read anything as long as it is well-written and makes sense.
