Oh I agree with you. Freedom of speech and write whatever makes you happy. I guess some people would enjoy them and it's their right. I'm just hoping for more thought-out stories in the future.

As a reader, I just wanted to give my thoughts to the authors.

I respect their work. They write for free, for my entertainment so it would be rude of me to bash their work (which I kind of did, sorry ---but I only meant to bash the trope). I don't have the right to feel entitled to only what I consider being good writing.

Bad writing is inevitable but if I can denounce some tropes that inevitably lead to it, then I want to do it.

It's just frustrating when a story holds promise and then is botched mid-way by a poor attempt at writing a polyamorous trope.
