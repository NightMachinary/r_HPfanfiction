Do you mean that straight (cis) guy like to watch straight action (men and women) having sex, so they must be attracted to men as well?

I can't tell you about that, I've never been in a straight male's head.

I suppose most of it is projection though. You know imagining being the male getting some. Imagining what it would be like to have a giant tool, or what it would be like to have rough encounters (when most non-professional women wouldn't let themselves be roughed up).

I don't know if there is attraction, I think it's more akin to admiration and wish fulfillment.

But I agree with your assessment of harems. The problem is that most authors have no experience with polyamorous relationships and can't figure out the dynamics of it clearly.

So they write it with a powerful man surrounded by love-sick women, vying for his attention. They write it like they would a single relationship and multiply it by the number of women they want Harry to be with. They make all relationships progress at the same pace, when it doesn't work like that. And finally, they write it with Harry not questioning his attraction to many women at all. They just assume that he would instantly go with many women, instead of asking himself if it's normal, or if it wouldn't be better if he had an exclusive and monogamous relationship.
