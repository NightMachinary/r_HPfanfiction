Ugh share, you made it sound very unromantic.

I'm a male, attracted to only males. I'm not attracted to women one bit. A girl could be my platonic soulmate but that's all.

I don't think everyone is a bit bi.

You can be straight and appreciate the beauty of girls but that doesn't mean you'd have sex with one.

True, some guys are bi but prefer to think themselves as straight because their « masculinity » would not allow them to consider being with a guy.

But some people are straight or gay only and that's something to accept.

Sexuality is immensely complicated, you can't simplify it by saying that everyone is a bit bi.
