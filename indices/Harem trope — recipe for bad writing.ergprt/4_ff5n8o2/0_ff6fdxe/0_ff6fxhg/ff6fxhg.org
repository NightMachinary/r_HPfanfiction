I have the theory that everyone's at least a tiny bit bi. I mean, most people are attracted to a guy copulating with a girl, right? Both woman and man are involved.

Either way, it doesn't even have to be bisexual. The girls could share the guys and guys could share the girls. Shouldn't be too hard to write, right?
