Ooh this is fun.

I imagine Harry would be sort of like the Harry from AVPM, if you've seen it. Harry would be super full of himself, and love being rich and famous.

Let's see... Luna would be a very closed minded, "won't believe it till I see it" type. Neville would be a bully to Draco. Snape would be cheerful, always smiling and awarding points. Hagrid doesn't like animals, and is very good at keeping secrets. Fred and George would be uptight and serious like Percy. Percy would be the one cracking jokes and teasing everyone. And Crabbe and Goyle would be talkative geniuses.

It would be utter chaos. I love it.
