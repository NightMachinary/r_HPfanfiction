I now want to write a fic with almost everyone switching genders, but Ron and Ginny in particular.

Gin, or Gingalain (Gingalain, in Arthurian legend, is Gawain's son, so it's sticking with the theme because "Ginevra" is the Italian version of Guinivere, King Arthur's wife) or Gawain (better than Gingalain, at least), would probably be the "forgotten" child much like Ron is because he's just another male and was born after the much-awaited female. He'd probably be really bitter and jealous and I imagine that he'd be a secret Slytherin. He probably would've read all of his siblings' old books and learned all he could about Hogwarts.

Ron, or Rhona (I don't much like the name Rhonda), would probably be super full of herself because she's been doted on as the only female in the Weasley brood. She probably bullied Luna Lovegood for being odd and weird and isn't the best sibling. She's probably alike with Percy in regards for being the least favoured sibling.

For Harry, I would use the name Rose (I heard that's what Lily would've named Harry if he'd been a girl, I don't like it when people call the female version of him Harriet, though it's not that bad of a name). She'd look a lot like Lily, I suppose, and would be really really tiny. She'd be shy but very intelligent (she'll actually use her flipping brain!) and would also be very resourceful.
