If the personalities are so different though, I mean more than just what can be explained as the difference between a male and female who are otherwise exactly alike then isn't it really a new character though? Like male!Hermione being a perv, I'd read but only if it's secondary to him still being a massive bookworm like original Hermione. In short there needs to be something connecting them to the original character aside from name, for me.
