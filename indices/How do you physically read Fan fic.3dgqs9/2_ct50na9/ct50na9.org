I used to read it on my laptop, but now it's all smartphone all the time. I especially like that ff.net has the handy option to increase the text size and/or reverse the colors so that you read white text on a black background. It makes staring at your phone for hours way easier on your eyes. (There's also an app for ff.net so you can download the fic and read it offline. Not super user friendly, but if you know the title then it's easy to search and then you can save data.)
