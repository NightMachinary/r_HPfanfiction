I read on my laptop when at home, or phone when not. But I really want to buy an e-reader of some kind, because I get the feeling it's not the healthiest for my eyes. I like to read a lot, add that to the University stuff I already have to do on my laptop, and the movies and Tv-shows I also watch on my laptop most of the time, then I'm spending way too much time staring at the same display. It's not great for the eyes to be moving in distance so little (e.g. better if you do your homework on your laptop, read a book, watch tv on the telly - your eyes have to focus and get used to different distances).
