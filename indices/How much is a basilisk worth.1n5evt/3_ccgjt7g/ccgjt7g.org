Why are basilisk parts so rare? I mean, sure, its dangerous, but so are dragons. Basilisks can be created almost by anyone (use a sticking charm on the egg and the frog). It could be grown in a cave or a reinforced building, away from people. It can be fed by dropping animals from a door in the ceiling of the cage, with no need to look in. (one can make this extra safe, by using two sets of doors - like an airlock). And at last, it could be killed by having a cock crow, again, with no need for it to be in the same room.

If wizards manage to /farm/ dragon parts (for gloves for goddamned first years) than it should be even easier to farm basilisk parts.
