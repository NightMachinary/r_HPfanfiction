There are some things we can compare it to. For instance, Basilisk venom is pretty similar to a super acid, so look up how much H2F:SbF6 costs for the amount of venom we're considering (the NSA will instantly put you on a watchlist) and convert that into galleons.

For the scales do the same with carbon nanotubes or some other highly resilient substance (you're definately on a watchlist by now, if you weren't from the acid).

For the skeleton, use the going rate for dinosaur fossils and you'll get a pretty good figure for what wizards would pay for the bones of Slytherins basilisk (The NSA is now wondering what the hell you're planning).

For the organs, do this with the price of human organs for transplants of the same total weight as that of the basilisks organs (expect a knock on your door in the next two hours).

All in all, expect it to be worth several billion pounds, so yeah. Harry will probably be obscenely rich if you do this.

EDIT: H2F:SbF6, not HF:SbF6
