As for the skin/hide, the basilisk "may reach up to fifty feet in length. The male has a scarlet plume upon its head. It has exceptionally venomous fangs..."

The book also says that they are believed to live for hundreds of years. That's quite a bit of snake shedding and venom producing. I'm guessing if your character could use the shedded skin and somehow "milk" the snake, you'd be just fine with selling them
