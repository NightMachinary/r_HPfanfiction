In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Basilisk is given a "Known Wizard Killer / Impossible to Train or Domesticate" classification by the Ministry of Magic. They are created by hatching a chicken egg beneath a toad, so they are more than likely easy to get, however I would think that the Ministry would definitely ban them. In fact, in the book, "creation of Basilisks has been illegal since medieval times, although the practice is easily concealed by simply removing the chicken egg from beneath the toad when the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures comes to call."

So I would say that a black market trader would definitely require quite an arm and a leg for the thing.
