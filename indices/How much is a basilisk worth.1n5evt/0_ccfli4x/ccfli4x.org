The intact hide is no doubt worth much more than a shed skin. A molt is the sloughing of dead and broken scales, whereas the living skin is the 'good stuff'.

The venom doesn't have to be voluminous to be deadly. What the story gets wrong is that most venomous snakes only inject with the two hollow fangs- the rest of the teeth are for keeping the prey from slipping away.

As the raising of younger Basilisks is a simple if risky business, the venom probably isn't too valuable. Unicorn blood would be much more valuable. You might suggest in your story that very old Basilisks have much more potent venom, but it isn't like Harry died the second he was poisoned. It took enough time that Fawkes could work up some tears to heal him. What makes Basilisk venom so awesome is that phoenix tears are the ONLY treatment.

Probably the most valuable component of the Basilisk is its eyes, since most breeders would have them removed for safety's sake and adventurers fighting one in the wild wouldn't likely survive if the eyes were still functioning.

I've used the idea that a very old Basilisk's eyelashes would be magical enough to function as a cut-rate wand core. Snakes don't normally have eyelashes, but they don't usually have the power to petrify or kill with a look, either.

King cobra's can grow to 20 feet long, but they're still only as thick as a fat loaf of bread. This is relevant because the amount of harvest-able skin depends on both length and circumference. If you treat the Basilisk like the CoS movie - a monster that can swallow a caribou - the circumference might be 15 feet (diameter of ~ 5 feet; 2 x Pi x Radius, right?). A more reasonable mutated Anaconda size might only have a circumference of 6 feet (diameter of 2 feet). Translate that into sq. yards of 'fabric' and compare to premium leather for value.

Or is this too much math for fanfiction?
