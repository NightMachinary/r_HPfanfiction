[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanoboa][Titanoboa]] was the largest prehistoric snake, growing to 50 feet length and weighing about 2500 pounds. This might be a better analogue to the CoS Basilisk for your estimates.

Edit: 2500 pounds means around 1.2x10^{6} cm^{3} volume. The length is 1.5x10^{3} cm, so this works out to a snake diameter of about 32 cm, or around 100 cm circumference.
