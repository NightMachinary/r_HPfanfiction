I mention linkffn(Time, Mr Potter?) a lot but the fight scenes really are pretty awesome, and there's a bunch of them. The final Hogwarts battle is like seven chapters long on its own.

I will also mention linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) for some cool fight scenes. They aren't quite as common as in /Time, Mr Potter?/ but the ones that are there are still pretty good. Also, the premise and world building is quite original as compared to a lot of other fics.
