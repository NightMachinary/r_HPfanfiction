THE quintessential action fic is without a doubt linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim). Wall to wall action.

You will also like Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991) if you haven't read it already.

The first chapter of Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) is packed with brutal, gritty battle sequences.
