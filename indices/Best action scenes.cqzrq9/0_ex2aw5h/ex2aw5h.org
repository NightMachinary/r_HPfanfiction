The best action scenes? Well I'll give you a top five:

- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): this fic actually has what may be /two/ of the best action scenes in the fandom, hands down. If you read nothing here, read this fic - personality just oozes from everything here.
- linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): this fic is jam packed with fight scenes as Harry speed runs taking down Voldemort and his forces in twelve hours. The best though is probably the graveyard fight honestly.
- linkffn(Realignment): another time-travel action thrill ride, the best action is in the first and last battle scenes as Harry tries to go all Terminator in 1943.
- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): this one can be a bit rough, but there are some badass fights here. The best part is midway through as we see into Harry's backstory through Hermione's eyes, but early on even we see some sweet action scenes.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): first in a trilogy, and a bit rough in the later stages, but I will spoil a bit of the later part of the story by saying at one point Harry dive bombs the Battle of Hogsmeade on a broom and kills ~30 death eaters with a single curse. The peak is in the second book though.
