I like smart Harry tags. Because there's a chance that it will be a Harry who does his own research for homework and doesn't depend on hermione. Canon Harry didn't really put much effort into his schooling. I like reading about a Harry who explores the new world he is in. Smart Harry doesn't always do that, and sometimes does it poorly, but it tells me it might be.
