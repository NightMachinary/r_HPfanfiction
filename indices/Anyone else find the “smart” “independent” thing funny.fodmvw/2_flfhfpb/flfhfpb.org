This is mostly because this stories usually take both concepts to the limit. Smart Harry is basically a Harry who's knowledge outstrips wizards much older, experienced and with more resources to gain knowledge than him at an absolutely unbelievable age. The independent mostly is used in conjunction with Dumbledore!Bashing and deals with a Harry that quite frankly manages to get skills that are far outside a normal or even extraordinary child's gasp in how to live alone and then outright refuses to accept any influence from outsider sources under the guise of not allowing himself to be manipulated. In most of this stories he manages to get emancipated at an age no judge in any part of the world would be willing to allow(and for excellent reasons) using his plot-armor.
