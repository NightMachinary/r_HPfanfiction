I like them myself, but I don't feel the least bit guilty about it. Sure, they're a bit repetitive, but they're also fun to read, for the most part, and it's fun to watch as a slightly exasperated Harry Potter becomes emperor again, despite his objections. The only one I don't like is how the Crossover with /Rosario X Vampire/ ended, on a very open cliffhanger. Not to mention the way the other canon characters ended up.
