Thought about that one too, but since he mentioned "a copy of himself running around" I went with the ITMOAS trilogy. But yea, entirely possible that it was this one he had in mind.

And agreed, mjimeyg does that in all their fics, but I still go back from time to time to re-read them all. For some reason they can make any crazy crossover work for me. Like the HPxJurrassic Park one or the HPxHawaii-Five-0. Shouldn't work, most people probably won't enjoy it, but I liked them. Guilty pleasure I guess :D
