I have read a ton of StargatexHP, would even say all thats worth reading, and none of the fics fit everything you mentioned. Maybe you are mixing up multiple stories or the timeline of events is a bit wonky. But my best guess is the "In the mind of a scientist" trilogy by ZenoNoKyuubi:

He has a clone, works at the SGC, is with Tonks, is overly talented in magic, builds crazy stuff, is friends with Sam. And despite the summaries, the series is absolutely worth reading. I recently re-read it and enjoyed it again.
