The difference is in ideology. Extremism isn't an ideology, it's a description of actions done by a person or group. Stalin was an extremist, but nothing in his ideology was remotely like Riddle's. It would be like comparing Riddle to Genghis Khan because they both had loads of people killed. Communism is a political and economic philosophy that Stalin employed in a manner that killed several million, Nazism is the same type of ideology as Riddle adopted: blood "impurities", citing an unwanted demographic as the cause of societal ills and calling that group thieves, street violence as a means of eliminating competition, eventually taking over in a somewhat legitimate manner whilst still retaining the use of violence to suppress opponents, etc.

I've not seen he interview you mentioned. I recall reading one where she made clear there was a parallel between Nazi beliefs about Jewish blood and pureblood ideology about muggleborns, but I don't recall a comparison to Stalin (Riddle doesn't seem to espoused any particular economic ideology so the comparison confuses me).
