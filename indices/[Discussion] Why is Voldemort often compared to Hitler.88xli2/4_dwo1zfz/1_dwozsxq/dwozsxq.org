Except Stalin didn't champion a notion of blood purity/Jewishness, incarcerate people on that basis and institute a state ideology to formalize those racist beliefs as official state policy. Stalin was awful too, but the analogy between Hitler and Voldemort is just undeniable whereas the comparison to Stalin makes no real sense outside of "They both did awful things".
