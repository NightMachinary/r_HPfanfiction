Event if "JKR modelled Voldemort off Hitler" it doesn't mean that his is Hitler's analogue.

"Hilter" is a very big name and I can see why people use it.

But in reality they aren't even close. It's about scale, political power, successes, etc.

As I said Riddle is more close to a leading of some terrorists cell who copied some methods from history books.
