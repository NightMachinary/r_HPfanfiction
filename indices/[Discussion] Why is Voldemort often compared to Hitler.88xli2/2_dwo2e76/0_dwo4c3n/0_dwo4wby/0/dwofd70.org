Actually, that [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent][Author Intent]] is irrelevant is a traditional school of thought in litature analysis. (I think these usually fall under 'evaluate the work itself, independent of intent or circumstances' and 'evaluate the work in the way it effects the reader, instead of the author'

The example that always comes to mind is /A Princess of Mars/. While somewhat fun to read if you take it's historical place into account, if you discard author circumstances it becomes a very bad book. (The book uses a lot of overdone sci-fi tropes, which of course, were not overdone when it was written. It also has significant cringe-worthy elements like setting up the main character by explaining how good he was to his slaves)
