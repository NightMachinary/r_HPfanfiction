I hadn't heard the name till I looked it up for that post, since my interest is more as a scifi/fantasy fan. Guess the more formal systems revolve around poetry and lit majors?

Anyway, speaking of context, my post was in response to "your argument makes no sense because it discards author intent", I was just disagreeing with the notion that consideration author intent is necessary for an critism to be valid. I was not saying it must be ignored or even that doing so is desirable for this situation.

In particular, the statement "even if JKR made Voldemort similar to Hitler, it doesn't mean Voldemort is similar to Hitler.", Which can be cleaned up to "even if JKR intended to make Voldemort similar to Hitler, it doesn't mean Voldemort is similar to Hitler.", Isn't simply a logical contradiction, since author intent is not always sacrosanct.
