Well, I did slightly conflate historical context vs author intent. You can ignore author intent and still take into account historical context.

The approach certainly has its uses. It isn't that uncommon for works to transcend the original authors intents. In the extreme, you can have a work that was intended to be critical of a movement that ends up really speaking to members of that movement and they take it as their own and rallying cry. In those situations, the question gets discussed a lot about 'does the hostile intent of the author reduce, enhance, or not effect the effectiveness of the piece'

I think this would frame it best: If you were going to give an award to the "Most Important" "Most Foundational" and "Best" entries in a category, discarding author intent (and historical context) would be a way to consider the entries for "Best", where you want things that stand on their own and stood the test of time well. Foundational would focus on that context while Important would be more balanced.
