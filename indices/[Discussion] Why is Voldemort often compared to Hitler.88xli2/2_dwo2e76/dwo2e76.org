JKR modelled Voldemort off Hitler. Like [[/u/Hellstrike]] said, the Death Eaters, the blood purity ideals (with purebloods, halfbloods and mudbloods), and many of his methods were directly inspired by JKR's interpretation of WW2. I see you arguing a lot about how it's wrong to compare the two, but in this case it was the author's intention of making nazi analogies. Which means you don't have much ground to stand on.
