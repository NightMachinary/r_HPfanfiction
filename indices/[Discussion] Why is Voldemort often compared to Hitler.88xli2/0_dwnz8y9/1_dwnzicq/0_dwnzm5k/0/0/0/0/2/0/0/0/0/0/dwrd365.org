-#1 was ignored because it was irrelevant to the duel. Harry wasn't a factor until Riddle possessed him. #2 is simply ridiculous. If Dumbledore could have killed Voldemort he would have, there need not be anything more to it. A dead body would suffice to prove Voldemort was recently alive. I didn't simply contradict you, I gave an example.

If Dumbledore wanted to kill Voldemort the Killing Curse trumps any other option. It's unblockable and does the job in all but a tiny number of exceptional cases. Transfiguration just can't compete with that kind of reliability or else Voldemort wouldn't have bothered with the KC. Voldemort could have beaten Dumbledore. Again, that Fawkes had to take a Killing Curse shows Dumbledore was vulnerable in that instance and could not stop or avoid the attack, whereas Riddle was able to deflect, avoid and overcome Dumbledore's attacks. In other instance Dumbledore also stated plainly that he had no way (besides Fidelius) of magically keeping Harry safe from Voldemort because Voldemort's knowledge of magic exceeded his own in scale. That's why he had to make use of Lily's sacrificial protection to invoke the bond of blood enchantment.
