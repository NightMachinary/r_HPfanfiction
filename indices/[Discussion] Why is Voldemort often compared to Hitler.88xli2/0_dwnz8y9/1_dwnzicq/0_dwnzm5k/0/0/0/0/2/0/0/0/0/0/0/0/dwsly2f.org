  Harry was a factor because he was in the room and not able to defend himself against Voldemort's onslaught.
#+end_quote

And yet, as I said, his presence had zero stated impact on Dumbledore's ability to duel Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  A dead body that looks nothing like Tom Riddle, offered up by a Transfiguration master isn't proof of anything.
#+end_quote

You do realize people knew what Voldemort looked like, don't you? That's how Fudge and everyone else knew Dumbledore wasn't lying when they saw Voldemort at the Ministry in OoTP.

#+begin_quote
  The last time Voldemort died, his body exploded.
#+end_quote

And yet it was known by a number of people that Voldemort survived. His last known location (Albania) was known to people who informed Dumbledore of this, as stated in Chamber of Secrets. Hagrid suggested in Philosopher's Stone that only some people thought Riddle was actually dead, given no body was found.

#+begin_quote
  Unblockable, except by a sufficiently massive physical object, and it works every time, except for when it misses. Not to mention that Dumbledore might not have been in the right state of mind to use it, whereas he could animate things to attack Voldemort as needed.
#+end_quote

A spell missing is not blocking the spell. "Blocking" implies getting in the way, not evasion. And Dumbledore said in OoTP that he didn't cast such spells because "Killing you [Riddle] wouldn't satisfy me, I admit", implying he was well within the right state of mind to cast the Killing Curse.

#+begin_quote
  Why not? He's a psychopath, so it comes to him easily, he is probably not a Transfiguration specialist (though very good at it, of course), and he seems to be prone to getting stuck in a rut.
#+end_quote

Riddle is a psychopath but he's also a genius whose knowledge of magic was unparalleled and wouldn't bother using the Killing Curse if there was a better way of killing someone. And there is nothing suggesting Dumbledore was any better at Transfiguration than Riddle. The fact that even with the Elder Wand he couldn't Transfigure Riddle's madness-inducing potion would seem to suggest that Riddle may have even been a notch above Dumbledore at Transfiguration.

#+begin_quote
  Again, that's ignoring the need to protect Harry and that Dumbledore needed to pin Voldemort down, not kill him. For that matter, notice that Voldemort fled the battlefield the as soon as a handful of Aurors arrived.
#+end_quote

It doesn't ignore anything. Until Riddle possessed him, Dumbledore was not a single time stated to have been hampered by the need to protect Harry. Dumbledore did need to kill Voldemort as then prophecy was not impossible to negate (JKR has confirmed this about prophecies in interviews and Dumbledore did in OoTP as well). Killing Voldemort (had it been possible) would have proved Dumbledore's case and saved Harry. Also, Riddle wasn't running from the Aurors. You're forgetting that he had been trying to hide the fact of his resurrection and was soon outnumbered by the dozens of people streaming in. I doubt he could have taken them all given Dumbledore was there but there were other factors.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort knew stuff Dumbledore didn't, and Dumbledore knew stuff that Voldemort didn't. What's your point?
#+end_quote

The point was that Dumbledore in this instance was explaining how Riddle's magical ability exceeded his own hence why none of his defensive spells could have protected Harry from Riddle. In other words, and example of how Riddle's power exceeded his own in some respects.
