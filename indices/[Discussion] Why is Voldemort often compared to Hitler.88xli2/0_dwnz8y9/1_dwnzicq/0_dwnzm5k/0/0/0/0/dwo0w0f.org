There's a lot of pure fanon in your post. Here are things that are not canon:

#+begin_quote
  Grindelwald nearly conquered Europe
#+end_quote

Grindelwald did not "nearly conquer Europe". Grindelwald's goal was the shattering of the International Statute of Secrecy, resulting in a war between wizards and Muggles which the wizards would win. The wizards would then rule over Muggles as "benevolent" overlords.

Grindelwald did not attempt to take over magical governments or territory. His methods involved trying to expose magic to Muggles through large scale magical events which magical governments could not contain. He came into conflict with magical governments because they were trying to enforce the Statute of Secrecy, not because he wanted to take them over.

#+begin_quote
  We never see other wizard countries taking interest in the 'most powerful Dark Lord of the century'
#+end_quote

Both the Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters have international wizards in their ranks. Wizarding governments do not have militaries - international intervention in the wizarding world does not take the form of governments joining in, but rather individuals.

Further, we know that both Voldemort and Harry were internationally famous. See the article entitled "DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL" - [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-2014-daily-prophet-reports]]

On top of this, Voldemort's movement is considered to be of international significance, not just restricted to Britain:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed.

Moving on...

#+begin_quote
  He even puppeted Hitler!
#+end_quote

Simply not canon by any stretch of the imagination. JKR has been clear that the connection between wizarding and Muggle wars is more abstract than direct cooperation or interaction between the two worlds:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: I'm going to tell you as much as I told someone earlier who asked me. You know Owen who won the [UK television] competition to interview me? He asked about Grindelwald [pronounced "Grindelvald" HMM...]. He said, “Is it coincidence that he died in 1945,” and I said no. It amuses me to *make allusions* to things that were happening in the Muggle world, so my feeling would be that *while there's a global Muggle war going on, there's also a global wizarding war going on*.

  ES: Does he have any connection to --

  JKR: I have no comment to make on that subject.

  [Laughter.]

  MA: Do they *feed each other,* the Muggle and wizarding wars?

  JKR: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Mm.

  MA: You've gone very quiet.

So rather than wizards literally being involved in Muggle wars, you have a kind of parallel conflict - that is, wizarding and Muggle worlds mirror each other without actually having causal links from one to the other. It's like there's a "spirit of the times" which encompasses both Muggle and wizarding worlds, and when tension rises in one it is also rising in the other.

The exception to this is WWI, where wizards directly interfered, contrary to wizarding law:

#+begin_quote
  Archer Evermonde

  1912 - 1923

  In post during the Muggle First World War, Evermonde passed emergency legislation forbidding witches and wizards to get involved, lest they risk mass infractions of the International Statute of Secrecy. Thousands defied him, aiding Muggles where they could.
#+end_quote

As for Voldemort, people simply consider him a more powerful wizard than Grindelwald was.

We see this for ourselves in OotP, where Dumbledore needs to be rescued by Fawkes to avoid being killed by Voldemort. Had they been duelling on skill alone, without outside intervention, Voldemort would have killed Dumbledore there and then. This despite the fact that Dumbledore was wielding the Elder Wand. In contrast, Dumbledore was able to beat Grindelwald in a duel, even when Grindelwald had the Elder Wand.

On top of this, the characters recognise Voldemort as the more powerful wizard. Dumbledore refers to Voldemort as the most powerful dark wizard of all time, and he is familiar with both Grindelwald and Voldemort. On top of that, wizarding society more generally ranks Voldemort as more dangerous:

#+begin_quote
  The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown.
