It is a fact. Dumbledore made it clear several times that he could not outright beat Voldemort. From being unable to shield from Voldemort Harry even with the Elder Wand to their duel (in which Dumbledore required Fawkes to take a Killing Curse for him) we see this played out. The difference wasn't huge, but even if Dumbledore decided to return fire with Killing Curses of his own I don't see how that would have changed their duel.
