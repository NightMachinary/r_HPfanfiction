But why though? Grindelwald nearly conquered Europe, he battled Dumbledore in one of the most impressive duels of the century. Riddle is powerful, yes, but he was always scared of Dumbledore, Grindelwald on the other side had no qualms about fighting Dumbledore.

Grindelwald and Riddle were both charismatic and powerful, they each had their own groups and ideologies but Riddle never came close to being an international threat.

We never see other wizard countries taking interest in the 'most powerful Dark Lord of the century', not even once. Riddle was the leader of a terrorist group and Grindelwald was the leader of an international movement. He even puppeted Hitler! It's like comparing the French Militia Resistants and the Third Reich.
