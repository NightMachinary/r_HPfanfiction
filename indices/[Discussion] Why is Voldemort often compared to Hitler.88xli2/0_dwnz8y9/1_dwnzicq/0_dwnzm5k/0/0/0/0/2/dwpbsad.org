Good analysis. This bit I am not sure about:

#+begin_quote
  Had they been duelling on skill alone, without outside intervention, Voldemort would have killed Dumbledore there and then.
#+end_quote

Is that a fact? I seem to recall that,

1. Dumbledore had Harry to protect.
2. It's not clear whether Dumbledore was out to kill Voldemort there and then, rather than just stalling him until the Minister showed up, because most of Voldemort's horcruxes were intact at the time. Whereas, Voldemort had no reason not to go all out.
