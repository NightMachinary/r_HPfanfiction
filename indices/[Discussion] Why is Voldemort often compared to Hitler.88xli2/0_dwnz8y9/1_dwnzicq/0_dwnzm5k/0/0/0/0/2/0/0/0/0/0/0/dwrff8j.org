  -#1 was ignored because it was irrelevant to the duel. Harry wasn't a factor until Riddle possessed him.
#+end_quote

Harry was a factor because he was in the room and not able to defend himself against Voldemort's onslaught. (Priori Incantanem might have helped with just the right timing, but neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore knew that.)

#+begin_quote

  - #2 is simply ridiculous. If Dumbledore could have killed Voldemort he would have, there need not be anything more to it. A dead body would suffice to prove Voldemort was recently alive. I didn't simply contradict you, I gave an example.
#+end_quote

1. A dead body that looks nothing like Tom Riddle, offered up by a Transfiguration master isn't proof of anything.
2. The last time Voldemort died, his body exploded.
3. The reason I did not consider my point addressed is that you didn't speak to Dumbledore's motivations (until now).

#+begin_quote
  If Dumbledore wanted to kill Voldemort the Killing Curse trumps any other option. It's unblockable and does the job in all but a tiny number of exceptional cases.
#+end_quote

Unblockable, except by a sufficiently massive physical object, and it works every time, except for when it misses. Not to mention that Dumbledore might not have been in the right state of mind to use it, whereas he could animate things to attack Voldemort as needed.

#+begin_quote
  Transfiguration just can't compete with that kind of reliability or else Voldemort wouldn't have bothered with the KC.
#+end_quote

Why not? He's a psychopath, so it comes to him easily, he is probably not a Transfiguration specialist (though very good at it, of course), and he seems to be prone to getting stuck in a rut.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort could have beaten Dumbledore. Again, that Fawkes had to take a Killing Curse shows Dumbledore was vulnerable in that instance and could not stop or avoid the attack, whereas Riddle was able to deflect, avoid and overcome Dumbledore's attacks.
#+end_quote

Again, that's ignoring the need to protect Harry and that Dumbledore needed to pin Voldemort down, not kill him. For that matter, notice that Voldemort fled the battlefield the as soon as a handful of Aurors arrived. Fawkes was out of commission by then, so Dumbledore couldn't teleport, either. So, at the very least, we know that Voldemort believes that

Dumbledore (no phoenix) + a few Aurors - need to defend Harry > Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  In other instance Dumbledore also stated plainly that he had no way (besides Fidelius) of magically keeping Harry safe from Voldemort because Voldemort's knowledge of magic exceeded his own in scale. That's why he had to make use of Lily's sacrificial protection to invoke the bond of blood enchantment.
#+end_quote

Voldemort knew stuff Dumbledore didn't, and Dumbledore knew stuff that Voldemort didn't. What's your point?
