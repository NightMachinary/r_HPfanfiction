I did address them. The mere fact that Dumbledore didn't cast a Killing Curse didn't mean he wasn't going all out. He couldn't defeat him, not definitively anyway despite having the elder wand. But Voldemort showed several times he could defeat Dumbledore, seeing as he needed to have Fawkes save him.

Being feared doesn't mean he would win. Dumbledore could match Voldemort, and based onto his mistake in GoF where (according to Dumbledore) Voldemort was afraid Harry managed to match him in skill, Voldemort is terrified by even the possibility of meeting an equally powerful wizard.
