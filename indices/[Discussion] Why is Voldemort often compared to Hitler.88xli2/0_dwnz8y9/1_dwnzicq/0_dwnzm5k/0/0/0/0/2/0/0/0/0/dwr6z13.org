No, you didn't.

1. You completely ignored the point about having to protect Harry.
2. Contradicting a point is not addressing it. In particular, you didn't address the point that Dumbledore didn't have a reason to kill Voldemort at the time; rather, he was out to expose him to the Ministry. (Killing him would just get him brought back a few months later.)

For that matter, even moral and legal considerations aside, if Dumbledore---an unmatched master of transfiguration---were out to kill someone, would the Killing Curse be his first resort?

Lastly, I'm not arguing that Dumbledore could beat Voldemort. I'm arguing that neither could reliably beat the other. You're the one claiming Voldemort could beat Dumbledore.
