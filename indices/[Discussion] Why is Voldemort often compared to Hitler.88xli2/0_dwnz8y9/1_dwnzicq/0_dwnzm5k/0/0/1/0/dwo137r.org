I'm not sure that there's evidence that Grindelwald was more politically successful than Voldemort. We have no idea about the size of their respective followings. Yes, Grindelwald operated across more countries, but that doesn't mean he has a bigger following. Voldemort could easily have operated across more countries too, given the ease of travel. Indeed in DH we do see Voldemort hopping around the continent, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.

Further, though he was later defeated, Voldemort achieved his political goal of taking over the British ministry and commenced the genocide of Muggleborns. Grindelwald on the other hand never successfully exposed the wizarding world to the Muggles. So by that measure, Voldemort was more politically successful.
