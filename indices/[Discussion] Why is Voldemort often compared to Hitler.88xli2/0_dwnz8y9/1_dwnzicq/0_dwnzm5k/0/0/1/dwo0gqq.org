Magical power? Or political?

I don't consider magical power, because it's just a power of one man.

Politically Riddle operated in just one country and still he wasn't successful in it. We don't see any other countries caring about him.

Grindelwald operated globally in several countries. The only one was save is England because of Dumbledore.,
