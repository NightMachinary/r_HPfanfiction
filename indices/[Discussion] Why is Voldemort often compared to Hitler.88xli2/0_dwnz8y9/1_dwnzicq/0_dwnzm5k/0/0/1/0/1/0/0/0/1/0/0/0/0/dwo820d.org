All provided points are indeed correct. The thing I see that any radical group uses the this methods to spread its influence and ideals. Hitler doesn't invented them.

The only thing remaining is preference of blood. Still Nuremberg Laws were anti-Jewish, not all non-Aryans. And he put purebloods above half-bloods.

Grindelwald dictated that wizards are above muggles. And parallels with Hitler are not small too (global war, Nurmengard/Nuremberg, wizards/Aryans above others, etc.).

Still thank you, now I see where the analogue comes from. Still as I mentioned in a parallel thread I don't understand why people put Hitler's and Riddle's crimes on the same level. And here the scale is very important.
