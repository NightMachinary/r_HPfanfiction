  As I've described for me Hitler is a huge political and historical figure. His regime did very horrible crimes against humanity of a huge scale.

  Riddle's figure is exaggerated for the sake of the plot, while it reality his is just a leader of some terrorist group.

But no one in this thread is claiming that they operate on the same scale.

Hitler and Voldemort both:

- Subscribe to a radical racial philosophy which dictates racial purity according to blood.

- Advocate the cleansing of society of certain ethnic groups.

- Killed or otherwise "disappeared" their political opponents.

- Recruited supporters by radicalising young people.

- Performed a coup to take over their domestic government.

- Once in power, began to enact their racial philosophy by rounding up members of the ethnic minority they demonise.

Yes, there is a disanalogy in the scale of their actions. But that single disanalogy does not break the analogy between the two. It simply means that they are not identical.

On the other hand, Grindelwald:

- Had a philosophy of a privileged elite ruling a large underclass, purportedly for their own good.

- Did not take over governments but rather attempted to subvert them.

- Never achieved power.

The only analogy between Grindelwald and Hitler is that they were both defeated in 1945. But even the timescale analogy isn't good, because Grindelwald was operating since the 1920s, where Hitler only came onto the scene in the 1930s. They're not even both German, as Hitler was Austrian.
