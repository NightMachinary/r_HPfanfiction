Yes. Probably I'm putting too many thoughts in it. As I've described for me Hitler is a huge political and historical figure. His regime did very horrible crimes against humanity of a huge scale.

Riddle's figure is exaggerated for the sake of the plot, while it reality his is just a leader of some terrorist group.
