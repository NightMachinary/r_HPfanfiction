  I looked into pottermore and HP Wikia and I haven't found any signs of "genocide of Muggleborns".

Look up the Muggleborn Registration Committee. This was a significant part of DH.

  How many of them? Still even with them there were no signs that anyone outside of England cared.

At the very least, Gregorovich and Grindelwald. Also, there are indeed signs that people outside England cared, as quoted in my post above. I will reproduce it here for you:

Both the Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters have international wizards in their ranks. Wizarding governments do not have militaries - international intervention in the wizarding world does not take the form of governments joining in, but rather individuals.

Further, we know that both Voldemort and Harry were internationally famous. See the article entitled "DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL" - [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-2014-daily-prophet-reports]]

On top of this, Voldemort's movement is considered to be of international significance, not just restricted to Britain:

  Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed.

(DH Chapter 2)

In any case, I'm not sure about this attachment to geographical extent being the same thing as importance. The wizarding world is highly integrated at the international level, with freedom of movement and global wizarding laws. It's essentially like a global EU. The complete take-over of the government of a "member state" would be significantly more troubling for the community than an unsuccessful international terrorist.
