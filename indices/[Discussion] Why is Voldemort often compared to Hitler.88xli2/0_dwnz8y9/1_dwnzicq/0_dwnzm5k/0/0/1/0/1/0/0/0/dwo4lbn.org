So were the concentration camps, officially. The clear subtext is that said Muggleborns will "disappear" once interned.

Or they're too scared to, knowing that said action would likely be ineffective (the British Aurors had no success and it's not clear that having more Aurors would help).

Or there are political impediments to interference.

Or they are sympathetic to Voldemort's cause.

There are many possible reasons beyond "they don't consider it important". The fact that Harry is mobbed by people globally, not just in Britain, indicates that the international community is very much invested in what happens with Voldemort.
