I think you're importing too many ideas from Muggle prisons into Nurmengard. All you need is a building with enchantments to prevent people from escaping. You don't need guardians, logistics, or support. Anyone can do it. Hell, Voldemort did the same at Malfoy Manor, well before he had taken over the magical government, though he clearly put less effort into making it inescapable.
