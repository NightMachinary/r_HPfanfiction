I believe there's some misunderstanding here.

I'm not reducing Hitler as a political and historical figure or his management and social skills. Quite the opposite actually.

In the message you've replied on I mean that usage of terror, violence and propaganda is not enough to put Riddle on the same level as Hitler.

Hitler is so big figure Voldemort couldn't even dream to become.
