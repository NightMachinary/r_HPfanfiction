You are, as Taure said, simply pointing out the difference in scale (and the fact that, as this is fiction, the MC is a child). You've not pointed out a single structural difference between the ideology and methods employed by the two.

I hate to ask (seriously, it's an awful question), but are you a Hitler sympathizer? The consistency of your insistence of the difference between the 2 (even just analogously) is quite odd.
