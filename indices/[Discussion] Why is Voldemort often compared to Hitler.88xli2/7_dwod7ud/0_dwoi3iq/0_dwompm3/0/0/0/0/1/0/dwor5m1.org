  What did Riddle make similar?
#+end_quote

Instead of going to prison he literally came back from the dead (that's a bit grander than serving 9 months instead of 5 years). Then he changed his methods and overtook the government from the shadows in a semi-legitimate manner, while his violent thugs killed and intimidated his political opponents. At the same time he instituted laws to spread his ideology and oppress those he deemed unfit for his utopia. Do you seriously not see the similarities?
