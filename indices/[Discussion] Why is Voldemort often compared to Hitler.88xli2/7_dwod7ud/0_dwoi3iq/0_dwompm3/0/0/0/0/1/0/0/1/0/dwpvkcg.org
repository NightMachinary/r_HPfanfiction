It was pointed that Riddle has just two things in common with Hitler:

1. he is racist and uses blood purity ideology as basis for his actions;
2. he copied some of his methods from the Hitler's handbook.

And those two points are generally common for any leader with radical views.

But Hitler was more than that. He build horrible regime (I don't know where you got your question from), but he also played a huge role in the history.

Unlike Riddle Hitler had great political and social skills.

In politics Riddle is a looser. At the end of GoF he had a huge advantage over his opponents: no one believed in his return, the governance was against Dumbledore and Potter, his followers were in the elite of the society. But instead of playing his cards right on the political field he used them as mere soldiers and then there was DoM fiasco.
