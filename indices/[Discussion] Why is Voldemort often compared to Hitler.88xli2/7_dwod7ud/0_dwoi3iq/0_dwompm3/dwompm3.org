  Hitler is distinguished from others by scale. His regime killed dozens of millions.

Hitler didn't personally kill millions. It's the ideology and propaganda that made it possible. His brand of fascism was certainly unique at the time and pretty incredible at how it unified people behind a common cause. Of course Hitler didn't solely invent it (he incorporated lots of stuff that seemed useful), but saying that Hitler didn't invent his methods is just dumb.
