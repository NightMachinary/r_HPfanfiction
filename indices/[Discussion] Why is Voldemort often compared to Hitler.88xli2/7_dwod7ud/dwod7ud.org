In terms of scale, Hitler and the accompanying World War II enveloped much of the European continent (and of course past these borders as well). Voldemort was solely focused on killing Harry and putting the Ministry of Magic under his rule, thus, confining his initial efforts to the magical community in Great Britain. It goes without saying that its population barely registered against that of the rest of Europe's. However, both Hitler and Voldemort captured the terror in said populations, engulfing them in an all out war. I think [[/u/Taure]] said it best when "scale is essentially the only significant disanalogy."
