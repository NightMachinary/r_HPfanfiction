The Death Eaters are pretty much an SA/SS ripoff. A mixture between a political street fighting gang oppressing other opinions and a fighting force loyal to a person/ideology and not the state.

The Muggleborn registration thing is an almost exact copy of the committee which resulted from the Nürnberg laws. If questioned by them, you have to prove your aryian/magical decent or face consequences. They began deporting the muggleborns to Azkaban, which had been repurposed as concentration camp. The snatchers act as Gestapo/SD squads. The entire thing is a small scale Final Solution of the Muggleborn question.

On a relative scale (small population), the Death toll is massive. Not quite Soviet Union or Poland level, but definitely surpassing the American one in WWII. And he was stopped before he could truly enact all his plans. Voldemort nearly won in 81 and even by 97, he wasn't done.

Tl; dr: The ideology and the methods are very similar to the Third Reich, just on a smaller scale due to the small population of the magical world. Voldemort had his own SA, his own Nürnberg laws and his own Gestapo. He was enacting his own Final Solution. While not a perfect analogue, the parallels to Hitler are there.
