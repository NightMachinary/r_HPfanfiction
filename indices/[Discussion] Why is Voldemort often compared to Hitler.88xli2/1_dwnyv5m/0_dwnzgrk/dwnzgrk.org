Does it mean that any madman who copies some of Hitler's methods becomes smaller version of Hitler?

Riddle's regime didn't survived even a year. Her copied something from Hitler (or Grindelwald?) and he wasn't as successful as either of them.

I believe the same methods are used by some radical groups in unstable muslim countries, but I didn't see anyone comparing Osama bin Laden with Hitler.

About the scale: Grindelwald. He operated in magical world and not just in England. He was dozens times worse that Riddle from any standpoint.
