Krum turned his head into a shark (after /failing/ to turn his entire body into a shark) and didn't have any long-term issues. I am completely subscribed to the idea that human transfiguration can be used in sex with little consequence. Hell, given the difficulty of the subject, I imagine that it's something of a bragging right. Like, "I'm magically skilled enough to make myself literally hung like a horse, and oh yeah, I'm also /literally hung like a horse/."
