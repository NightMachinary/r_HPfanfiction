There are potions too. Fred and George managed to make cookies (Canary Creams) that /turn you into a canary/ for a minute. They did this in their sixth year, which makes them a school-year younger than Krum (and almost two calendar years younger - I looked it up). If two young sixth-years can turn people into birds, then I'm pretty sure smaller, simpler transfigurations are also relatively common.

Mind you, as a children's book with a limited amount of time to devote to fluff, JKR probably wouldn't have bothered writing that stuff even if it was possible. Maybe there's some sort of cultural taboo on cosmetic self-transfiguration? IDK.
