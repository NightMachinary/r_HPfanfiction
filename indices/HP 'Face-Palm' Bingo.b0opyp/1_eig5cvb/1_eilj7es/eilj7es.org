Thanks for this!\\
I'd only say in response:\\
Sev: I should have amended it to "anyone but Lily calling him 'Sev'" or something. We were thinking of those fics in which an adult Snape allows people like Harry or Draco to call him that.

Abandoning stories: I actually don't mind (though of course I don't love, when this happens). But it seems like whenever the author protests they won't abandon a story like this, updates stop a chapter or two later. It's like a death knell.

Screeching: holy crap, I never noticed how much she uses that verb! Thanks. I suppose we were thinking of bashing fics that have Molly and Hermione screeching, but that's a solid point.

Swearing by Nimue etc.: fair point.\\
Thanks!
