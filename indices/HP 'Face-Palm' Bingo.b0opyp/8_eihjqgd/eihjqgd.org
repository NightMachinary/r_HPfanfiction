  Unironic appeal to tradition to explain discrimination
#+end_quote

I mean, yeah, traditionally people haven't been the most open to out-groups in their behaviors, and there are good evolutionary reasons for it: reproduction and survival necessitates discrimination, on a sexual and social level.

So it's a perfectly valid appeal, depending on the context, especially in such an insular world like HP. Certainly as valid as the opposite.

Also, now I want to see all of these done in one story, preferably in one chapter. But by Circe, that would be difficult!
