Would actually enjoy something like that again, IF it came at a cost. Like reading an Elder Scroll in the Elder Scrolls Universe. You get absolutely immense amounts of knowledge and insights written down by the forces that created the world past, present and future, BUT you will lose your sight.

Many times in fanfiction the biggest problem seems to be that their is no cost or not a counter-force (villain) build up that makes this whole lot more power in the protagonist necessary.

But most of the time it is for me: „Ah. Of course your newly acquired library comes with a dimensional portal that gives you a day for every hour in the normal world.“ - closes the FF.
