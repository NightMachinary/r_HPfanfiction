I can totally see her losing her shit right around year 3 or 4. In fact, I think before the first task of GoF would be the perfect timing.

Trolls? Plenty of non-magical creatures are dangerous to kids as well.

Dark Wizards? Whatever, Muggles have terrorists as well.

Deranged House-elf? You shouldn't piss off your servants, magic be damned.

Extremely lethal snake? Oh, Muggles have those! Wait, this one kills with a look... I suppose Harry did kill it and only almost died.

Demons that consume your soul and bring up your worst memories? Er, I suppose magic is worth it right?

My best friend is now trapped in an unbreakable contract that demands his participation in 3 deadly tasks or he no longer has magic. Lovely. Fuck this whole situation, lets look for loopholes.

GoF is my favorite place for a fic to diverge from canon for this reason. Magic has intent right? Part of the problem is likely that Harry ultimately accepted his own involvement. Harry and Hermione could have ditched the magical world and Barty Crouch Jr. might have found himself bound to participate instead.
