I give up. Here are some fics I know about though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/66011][The Moment You Doubt Whether You Can Fly]]

Part 3 is Sansa centric. Sansa Stark/Willas Tyrell is the ship featured. A group called the Dragonborn replace the Death Eaters in this universe.

Also, here's the tidbit that mentions Dany:

/How many people in this hall have met the man who calls himself the Dragonlord, Sansa wonders? How many people have - or had - grandparents who were Aerys' friends at school, how many have parents or older siblings who were friends with Aerys' sons?/

/Sansa was friends with Aerys' daughter, kind of. Daenerys was in Charms Club, and now she's in the Auror's office, training under Cersei Lannister. They say Cersei only takes the best, and that she's mad as a bag of cats, but by all reports Daenerys is more than capable of keeping up with her./

Arya and Dany centric. Arya Stark/Daenerys Targaryen is the ship featured. Yes, this is actually a thing.

Arya centric. Arya Stark/Gendry Water and Arya Stark/Daenerys Targaryen are the ships featured.

I don't know why Arya is popular in the HP AUs on ao3.
