Okay... back with another update on my hunt.

Usually it's ao3 or forums that welcome fanfics that have the more creative, out there, kinda fics, but it appears that FFN's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter_and_A-song-of-Ice-and-Fire_Crossovers/224/4254/][Harry Potter + A Song of Ice and Fire]] has got some in itself too.

Here's some more interesting stuff I found. It's not what you wanted, but it's an interesting read and not at all long.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12646365/1/Dragonkin-Abroad][Dragonkin Abroad]]

Ginny centric two-shot. Ginny is /'killed'/ by the Middle Kingdom(a secret hidden magic Kingdom somewhere in China)'s version of the Great Wall of China. She ends up in Essos.

As to why she was there in the first place... Ginny decided to be an explorer, inspired by Luna's Magizoologist expeditions. Along the way she gains a Dragon animagus form during her stint at the Romanian Dragonreserve.

I love Luna's carefree reaction...

/Half-way around the world, Luna Lovegood groaned in exasperation as one line of the future snapped indelibly into the present and then strolled flashily by into the past./

/Who died from running into a wall? An idiot, that's who. Well, at least her childhood friend wasn't really dead./

/She got up to write a note to Harry that Ginny had declined his invitation firmly, very firmly. Maybe she should start researching dimension travel just in case some of her friends decided to follow their wayward redhead?/

/It could be fun./

/She hummed, cheerfully imagining the chaos that could, might, may happen./

Ginny's musing was equally amusing...

/Then she snickered. All those bets about her brothers leaving the country to get away from their mother...they couldn't compare to leaving behind an entire planet./

I also found another /'Dragonkin AU'/ by InkyStake.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12784378/1/Owlsrest][Owlsrest]]

This one's more darker in tone.

Edit:

...but I love the character interactions. Especially Charlie's and Dany's.

Daenerys trying firewhisky was entertaining...

/"Why is it called firewhisky?" she asked as Ginny rolled a few barrels out of the Owlsrest cellars./

/Charlie laughed. "Oi, Ginny. Remember that bet?"/

/Ginny grimaced but nodded reluctantly. Their distilled firewhisky wasn't like Ogden's but it was approaching it. Fleur, as the best of them in potions, actually managed to approximate the recipe, though she grumbled about overly-paranoid alchemists./

/Charlie pulled out two cups and filled them from the barrel. "Bottoms up, little sis."/

/They drank in one gulp. Charlie grinned at the warmth coursing through his stomach and with the ease of long practice, blew out a cloud of steam towards the sky. Ginny was coughing tiny slivers of flame and gouts of smoke, to her chagrin. She never did take to spirits./

/He turned to Daenerys' raised brows. "That's why it's called firewhisky."/

/He offered her a cup. She looked at it skeptically but took it./

/"Your Grace," warned the large bear of a man who was her knight apparently. But Daenerys knocked back the cup fearlessly. She gasped./

/Charlie laughed. "Just let it out."/

/She coughed, though a bit less than Ginny. The flames and smoke dissipated. Charlie refilled her cup. "It's really meant to be sipped."/

/She glared at his cheerful explanation. "I do not think I will ever be used to the taste."/

/"Yeah, it's a bit strong. It's the warmth that's important."/

/"Not even," she muttered. He patted her shoulder with a grin. She sipped and grimaced./

Them feeding the dragons was interesting as well...

/"Why do you feed them blood and drink?"/

/Charlie smiled at the young woman who was coaxing the pale dragon to drink from the bowl of blood. "It's a precaution, mainly. Dragons are predators and carnivores, it's just their nature. Getting them addicted to the alcohol and animal blood means there is less chance that they would eat humans when they grow big enough. Well, unless you drench someone in wine and blood."/

/Dany's eyes widened. She had not thought of that. "I am their mother. Surely they would obey me?"/

/"And when you aren't there?" Charlie handed her another bowl. "They will need to hunt, and you will not always be there to stop them when they get hungry enough. Admittedly, this is not a foolproof solution but it significantly lessens the risk that they would eat innocents."/

/Dany was quiet for a time. "Thank you," she said at last. "I would not chain my children for fear of what they would do."/

/"Dragons can't be tamed," he agreed. "But a dragon that can control his passions is the more dangerous dragon."/

/She blinked at him, then nodded, conveying a certain respect. "I will keep it in mind."/
