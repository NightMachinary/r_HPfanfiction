linkffn(Royal Ward), sort of. She gets some character development that results in her starting to discipline Dudley and treat Harry better, but it takes a while to show up.

Some of the details of the fic might not be everyone's cup of tea (manipulative Dumbledore, mugglewank, decent-people Malfoys, and a dash of RPF since it involves the royal family) but I enjoyed it enough on the whole to add it to my watch list.
