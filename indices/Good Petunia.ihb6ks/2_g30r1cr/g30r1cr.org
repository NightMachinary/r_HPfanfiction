- “The family evans by dirgewithoutmusic” linkao3(3073562) which has one of the best paragraphs in the whole fanfic scene:

#+begin_quote
  When Petunia was frustrated with Lupin's moping or Molly's frenetic energy, or the way Dudley tagged along behind the twins, Petunia would go tug the covering down off the portrait of Sirius's mother and they would scream at each other until Petunia felt her stomach settle.

- and many others

However, all Petunia-oriented stories have to deal with the issue how the ugly caricature of a human from books is suddenly somebody who could be accepted by the reader of the story as a human being. There must be some at least minimal redemption story. The stories above made at least decent job in this department. There are some other stories, where I wonder why the character is called Petunia when she has nothing common with the person written by JKR:
