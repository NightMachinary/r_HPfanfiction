  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  The life of one Petunia Marie Evans had never been easy, and it hadn't been particularly pleasant for a long time either. In another world, one much different than this, Petunia was alone. Jealousy turned into bitterness turned into hatred - and hatred marks the soul like nothing else.This time was different. Petunia found a family, one that cared for her and loved her, when she was on the brink of loosing herself to her anger and it saved not only her life, but Harry's too.

  It's never easy to be brilliant, friendly, pretty, wonderfully talented Lily Evans' sister. Even when you're also a witch yourself. But Petunia Evans isn't one to just let herself fade in the background and be forgotten, not if she has anything to say about it (and she has plenty to say, even if she doesn't voice it out loud). Someday, she'll shine on her own, just wait and see! However, shining in a war-torn era isn't that easy when you're Muggleborn, and even more so when no matter what, Lily always seems to do everything better...
