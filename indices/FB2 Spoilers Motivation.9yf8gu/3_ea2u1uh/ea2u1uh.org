There are supposed to be 5 movies from my understanding... Imo one of the reason the 2nd was average(besides high standards for hp books and movies) it just seems to me like they are making 3 movies and stretching it into 5 making most of the movies just filled with filler... But hopefully the next one isn't too bad...

It reminds me of LOTR's great movies, "prequel" in the hobbit movies.. 2 real long movies that probably should have been 1 long movie, but that's what happens when big companies get a hold on these things, squeeze every last drop of money out
