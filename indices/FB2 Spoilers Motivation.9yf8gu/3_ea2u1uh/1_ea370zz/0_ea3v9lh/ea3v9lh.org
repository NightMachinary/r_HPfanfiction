To each their own, but spreading something that should be 3 movies to 5, without filling it with great content, doesn't work for most people.

That being said a lot of people (me including are judging it against the Harry Potter movies/books which are so nostalgic to us, it's hard to match up

Also as a side note even though I try not to pay attention to much of what JK says outside of the books I feel she's kinda painted herself into a corner with all the lore she has personally created, and it not necessarily matching these movies
