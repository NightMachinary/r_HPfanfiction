That's just about all filler movies in series, they all end with a crazy scene so you'll come back for more.... It's even done in episodic games, just about all have a middle episode that's just filler.

Like I said above I didn't think it was bad, it was just average and maybe it's just my high standards of HP and J.K. but I expect more than average..... I'd much rather have 3 good movies in a 3 movie series than 2 and a half good to great movies in 5(I'd imagine 1, last half of 4, and 5 will be(or is) the good great parts of the series
