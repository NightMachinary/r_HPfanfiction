More than that, Grindelwald's vision is a true prophecy. The movie's set in 1927. The discovery of the neutron, which led to the fact that the nucleus can be split, and thus the nuclear bomb, happened in 1932...

The destruction shown in that vision is both unprecedented and unimaginable to them, magical or muggle.

I hope he's trying to prevent the war but ends up actually causing it. Which eventually ends up in the dropping of the nuclear bombs on Japan.

After all, he eventually repents and shows remorse for what he did.

I'd prefer him to be a tragic person who did all the wrong things for the right reasons rather than just another evil Dark Lord.
