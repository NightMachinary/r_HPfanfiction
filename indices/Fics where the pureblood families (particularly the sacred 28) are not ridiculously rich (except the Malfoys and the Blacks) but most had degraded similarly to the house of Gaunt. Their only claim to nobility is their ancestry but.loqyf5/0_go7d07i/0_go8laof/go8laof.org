So part of the reason Malfoy wants Voldemort to conquer everything is so his debts (and/or creditors) get wiped away?

As an alternative, maybe the hugeness and opulenceof Malfoy Manor is just due to Lucius and Narcissa constantly maintaining conjured/expanded sections and furnishings - if their spells wear out, it'll go back to being a three-bedroom farmhouse.
