If you indeed have a great idea for a story, the way you know that it's fleshed out enough to begin writing, you have to have at least one signature scene in your mind, the one that frames the rest of the story for you. /Don't start writing if you don't have that scene./ You're not ready, seriously. Spend more time thinking.

Now, if you find you have multiple such story nuggets floating around in your head, then choose by starting with the one that has the most compelling, interesting, signature scene--and (this is key!) /write that scene first before you do anything else/. You're not going for polish here, just for getting content on paper (or on screen).

Get it down. Look at it. Did it turn out to be as awesome as you thought it would? If yes, then you're lucky (and you have all the motivation you need to write the rest of your story). If not, then repeat with your next idea.

/Don't/ begin a story with the beginning. It's too long a journey before you get to the good stuff and, statistically speaking, you'll never get there from here.

This is what works for me, at any rate.
