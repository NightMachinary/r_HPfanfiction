This may be bad advice but it worked for me. Firstly, how fleshed out are your story ideas? If they're mainly just singular plot point (like harry being a werewolf, or AU voldemort never heard the prophecy and won, or maybe Harry is 2 years younger and has a whole new set of friends) you can combine them together, and make a more interesting, complex story.
