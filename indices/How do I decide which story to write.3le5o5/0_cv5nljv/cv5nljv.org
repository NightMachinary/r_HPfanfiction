Choose whichever one you have the most fun in writing

or

Figure out which idea has the best ending in mind. The strongest stories are the ones with a clear direction and plan for resolution. The ending may eventually shift as you write, but it's much easier to decide if a change in course suits the story if you have a baseline destination in mind.

As for the summary, avoid the trite framing phrases like "what if so-and-so..." "Follow our hero as he..." "In a world...". A clear summary catches the interest of fic shoppers and gives them an idea of the tone of the story. You can always ask others for guidance, and don't be afraid to change the summary entirely if the story ends up going in another direction.
