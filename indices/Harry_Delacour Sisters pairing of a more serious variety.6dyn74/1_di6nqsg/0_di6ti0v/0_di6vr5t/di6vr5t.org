It's definitely not a kiddie story, it's a bit dark at times. However, there's very little sexual aspects and innuendo for most of the story. There's a decent amount of combat towards the end of the story. (last 10-20 chapters)

Take this comment with a grain of salt, given the fact I haven't read this story in a long time.
