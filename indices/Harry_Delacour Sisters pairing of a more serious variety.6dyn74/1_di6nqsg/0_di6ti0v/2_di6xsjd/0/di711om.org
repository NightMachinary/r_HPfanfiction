They were just examples of things that would usually prevent a T rating.

I find that much of the time aiming for a T rating actually holds back a piece of fan fiction from reaching its potential. Its more often than not, a sign of an author censoring themselves for whatever reason, usually in an attempt to reach the largest audience, or for fear of a possible ban, or simply for their own personal beliefs.

This is NOT to say that T rated stories cant be amazing or serious. And if you read what I wrote, that's not at all what I said or what YOU implied.
