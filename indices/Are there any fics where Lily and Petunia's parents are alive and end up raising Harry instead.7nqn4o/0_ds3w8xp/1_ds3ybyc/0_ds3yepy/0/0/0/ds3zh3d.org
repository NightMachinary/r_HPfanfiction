Well, book 1 Harry goes to Mcgonagall and she brushes him off, book 2 Harry goes to the world renowned Lockhart, and he's a fraud(Although they suspected him of being a fraud so that is kind of confusing why they would go to him lmao), book 3 tbh Ron was just kidnapped by a giant dog, whats he going to do, spend 10 minutes running to the castle while ron is presumably being killed by the dog? Book 4, he trusts Moody... Book 5 idk honestly. This is probably the biggest offender, as far as not talking to adults, but he /did/ tell snape about Sirius,and he didn't help, and he actually tried contacting Grimmauld Place, he just forgot about the mirror. Book 6 theres obviously Dumbledore, Book 7 there weren't really many adults to trust, lol. Seems like he tries to get adults to help plenty, its just that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless][adults are useless.]]

As far as being better adjusted, the biggest change would probably be him not willing to sacrifice himself so much, which yeah could have a pretty big impact on the plot.

IDK what knowing about his parents would do though. I suppose he'd know Snape was his mother's friend... maybe he wouldn't be so tempted to look at Snape's Worst Memory? edit: actually unless knowing that Snape was his mother's friend made him not hate Snape as much he would probably still look at it lol. Although if it makes Snape hate Harry less he may teach Occlumency is some less brutal way...
