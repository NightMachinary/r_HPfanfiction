To be fair the plot (As far as resurrecting Voldemort. The plot of the theoretical story would obviously be something else for year 1) wouldn't really change if he doesn't go after Quirrel because he wouldn't be able to get the stone out of the mirror. Albus would just show up and beat Quirrel. Although he might not die, so Quirrel may be able to stay as a teacher, thus removing Lockhart... Hmm. More likely he just retires tbh
