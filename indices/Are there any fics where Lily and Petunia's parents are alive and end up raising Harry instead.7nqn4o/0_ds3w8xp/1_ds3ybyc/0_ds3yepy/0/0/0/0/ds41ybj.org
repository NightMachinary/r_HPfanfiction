Put it that way, I'd never considered how much Rowling used the "Adults are useless" trope, even the well-meaning ones like Lupin, McGonagall and Sirius. I will say that in Book 5, Snape did contact the Order immediately after Harry informed him, but he obviously wasn't able to say it in front of Umbridge. Though that whole situation could have been avoided if Snape had just taught Harry Occlumency properly.

Also, the reason why Harry loves Hogwarts so much is because he considers it is his first real home. He never had one with the Dursleys, but if he already had a home with his mother's family, I wonder if he would be as attached to Hogwarts and the magical world. As you say, a well-adjusted Harry would value himself more so would he even be interested in finding out what the Philosopher's stone is and thwarting Quirrell? Or would be just think it's not his problem and focus on school and friends, because that's how most children would look at it.

The Evans telling him about Snape would be interesting. Maybe Dudley would also grow up differently with his grandparents in the picture.
