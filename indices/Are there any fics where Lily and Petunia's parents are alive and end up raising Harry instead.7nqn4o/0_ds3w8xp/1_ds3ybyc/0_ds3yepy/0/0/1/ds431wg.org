Fics like those exists in "James and Lily are alive and raises Harry" fics. Also some with WBWL, though in those for some reason it's alot more common that James and Lily are abusive/neglectful parents, which I don't like.

There's also Accidental Animagus wherein Harry was raised by the Grangers as Hermione's brother.
