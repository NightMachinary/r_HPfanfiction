Super AU... I'm not sure I can dig it and I read all sorts of stuff.. but I don't read like.. non-magic Highschool fics, and this sounds sortof in the same vein.. I think your gut feeling is right, its just too niche / odd for the everyday fanfic reader so you get low views.

Luckily you are writing for yourself....right? it's the only way to do it without going insane with insecurity...or writing cliches. Cliches are what casual readers are looking for.
