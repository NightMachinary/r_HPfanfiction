I've seen your story come up in my searches quite a few times, but didn't click into it because of the summary. Unfortunately the concept of Harry switching places with an actor playing him just doesn't appeal to me. I also found the spelling of Daniyel to be a big turn-off, but I can't say the normal spelling would have made a difference.
