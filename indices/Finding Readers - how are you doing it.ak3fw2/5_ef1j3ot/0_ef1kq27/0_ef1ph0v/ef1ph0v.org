  Or is the idea of Harry running around London not exciting?

It's not so much "Harry running around London" as much as "Harry playing around as an actor."

  Or does it seem like it might be lacking in some aspect of HP that you usually look for in a fanfic, because of the addition of the switching component?

Well, I primarily read fanfic to get lost in the magical world of HP, alongside the characters I know and love.

Fics that put the HP characters in a non-magical environment don't appeal to me at all, and my assumption was that Harry wouldn't have access to magic for some reason in your story (or it would be trivial to get back to Hogwarts).

That said, I probably made a lot of assumptions about your story based on biases I've formed over the years of slogging through thousands and thousands of fanfiction summaries. Anything that reminds me of the "reading the books" trope, or inserts Dan/Emma/Rupert into Hogwarts, generally sends me running for the hills.

I'll give reading your fic a shot this evening.
