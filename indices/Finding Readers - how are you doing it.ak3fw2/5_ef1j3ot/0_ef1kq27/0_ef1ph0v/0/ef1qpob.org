Thanks so much for taking the time to write all that out! That is really, really good to know.

That is really cool, that you want to check it out anyway, despite these totally fair concerns. In that case, let me give you a slightly better, maybe description that may be helpful.

So TP is set half in Muggle London and half at Hogwarts. Initially, I spend a lot more time at Hogwarts exploring magical things there. Harry does have access to magic in Muggle London, and /does/ use it there as needed, though not a whole lot so as to not draw attention to it - basically like any wizard walking around with Muggles would. But I've tried to set up several situations where magic there is necessary. It is not simple to get back to Hogwarts, and the reason is tied into the plot, so I don't want to go into that.

But mainly, I do think that that element you mentioned, of getting lost in the magical world, and with characters you love - it /does/ have that. In essence, that's exactly what Dan is doing, while he is there. And in terms of plot, without spoilers, I actually approached it in a very canon sense as well. That is, there are classes at Hogwarts, Death Eater incursions, learning new magic things, and eventually a showdown with Voldemort, as per every HP book. And I've tried to really make use of canon characters and develop some of them quite a bit. There is one minor canon character, in particular, I do a lot with, but I really don't want to spoil that, in case you end up reading it. And again, thank you for writing all this, and for considering it, even though it's outside your preferred genre!
