Thanks, I really appreciate your comment! Working on updating the summary. :)

Out of curiosity, may I ask what specifically about this type of story, doesn't appeal to you, besides the spelling? That is - does the concept make you think that it might be silly (maybe a comedy) or something like that? Or is the idea of Harry running around London not exciting? Or does it seem like it might be lacking in some aspect of HP that you usually look for in a fanfic, because of the addition of the switching component? I'm genuinely curious, so if you don't mind answering, I'd love to know what it is. Thanks so much!
