Honestly yeah that does sound a little out there for my tastes. I'm fairly vanilla, but you'll find that everyone comes to fanfic for different reasons, and I can't think of fics that are universally popular. For you, something that will put a lot of people off is the OC. People don't tend to read fanfic for new characters, they like to read about their favourite. So as a new author with a first fic, you have to think, why exactly would a reader choose my OC?

That doesn't at all mean that your fic isn't good or you won't be able to find readers, you just have to recognise that it's such an original idea that it will never be mainstream. You definitely have the right attitude and it's so important that you're finding it fun to write, so if I were you I would just treasure the readers who are clearly loving your work
