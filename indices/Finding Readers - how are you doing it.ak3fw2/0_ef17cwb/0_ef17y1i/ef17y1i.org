Thanks, I really appreciate your thoughts!

It's kind of what worries me, which is unfortunate, because it /does/ actually focus quite heavily on Harry as the main character regardless of the additional OCs, as well as plenty of other canon characters like Ron, Hermione, and Sirius. Ironically, in its development it follows a very canon-esque storyline otherwise in terms of the plot. I guess I'm just feeling a bit down about it all lately, but I do absolutely treasure the readers I do have, you are right. Thank you!
