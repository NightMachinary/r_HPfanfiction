Your numbers don't look that bad to me. I think it's the luck of the draw, to be honest. I never managed to get much attention on my fics and they were all regularly updated and completed. Some of them even had popular main characters! I never did work out why some fics do well and others disappear without trace.

You'll find a particular set of opinions on here, but this sub isn't really reflective of the larger fandom.
