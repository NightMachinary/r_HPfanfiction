Well this thread made me check it out, so this is a good way to get readers, linking to your story in other threads when it fits is a good way too.

I have seen your story before but skipped over it, first because your old summery didnt catch my attention, the new one is better. And as a second person mentioned, i was afraid Harry wouldn't have magic(which would be boring)

Now that i have seen here that Harry has and uses magic, and the OC gets to experience magic, classes and all the wonders of the HP world, now makes me want to read it.
