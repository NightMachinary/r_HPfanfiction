That is entirely awesome, thanks so much for letting me know! I didn't want to link it here to keep this entirely discussion based, but I do try to do what you mentioned - and link it in relevant threads.

And I'm so glad the new summary is working out better, I really can't thank everyone here enough for helping out with it! This is such an awesome subreddit, I'm so glad I found it.

I totally agree, Harry not having magic would be entirely boring! If you end up checking it out, thank you!
