Thank you for checking it out! Yay!

I'm glad you're enjoying it. Good points. It's picking up after GoF, so I was trying to capture some of Harry's angsty Cedric feelings from OotP but without going the full route of depression like JKR did, since he didn't spend any time in Grimmauld Place, so that's the main reason I tried to make him a bit sad there. He does stop moping around eventually. Haha

Oh hmm! Do you think he should have told Daniyel's parents he's actually Harry? I'll admit I hadn't considered going that route, Harry seems to have a trusting people thing, and I didn't think he'd want to tell anyone, it's a bit of a crazy thing to happen. But that may indeed have been interesting... for Harry to have parental figures he trusts.

Ah but Travers IS mad! :D But battle comments noted, thank you! I haven't actually written any real battle scenes before that one so that is very much something I'm working on. I'll have to take a look at some of the upcoming ones again and see if I can add more there.

Thank you so much for reading it and for all the feedback. Much appreciated!
