Just finished chapter 8, and so far it is a very good read. The characters are well written so far. Harry feels very angsty and depressed so far, and its hard to relate to him. Hiding that he is not Daniyel from Daniyel's parents doesn't make sense, it would be a lot easier with the truth, and we kinda lack an explanation for his hiding he is Harry. The fight in hogsmeade was VERY underwhelming. Travers seems mad and doesn't seem to pay attention, but they still only send one spell each back and forth, i got a bit annoyed at Ron and Daniyel for not taking the fight seriusly. (Like not using one spell, wait to see if it hits, wait for the opponent casts back, the fire one spell back) Besides the dissapointing fight the actual story, plotlines, and overall feel of the story is great. Will definitely keep reading!

Edit: the aftermath is well done, and i can see why you went the way you did (untrained dan reacting like a muggle, ron on defense) so it makes up for the lacklustre battle. Now i just wait and hope Harry soon starts taking charge, and stops moping around xD
