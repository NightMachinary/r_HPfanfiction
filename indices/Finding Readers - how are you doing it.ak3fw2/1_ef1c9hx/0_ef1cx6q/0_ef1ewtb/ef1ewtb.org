Your explanation makes sense but I honestly think it may be hurting your views/reception. You've chosen to create an alternate universe kinda/sorta based on real life but not actually which makes it even less accessible/relatable. The negative impact of using OC's would be mitigated by basing it on "real life" names but you've lost that advantage. It is clear that you are referencing Dan, Emma and Rupert with the names you've used so why not go all in on the concept?

I know it's stupid but when I read the name Daniyel it sounds in my head like 'Dan I Yell' every time and it immediately takes me out of the story...same with the use of Emily and Rob to a lesser extent. Every time I read 'Rob' I initially think of 'Ron' then realize it's really the actor...it makes it harder to get lost in the writing when I'm having to think about which universe I'm in at the time.

I'm going to keep reading as it is an interesting idea...I just think you may have put up a few unnecessary hurdles for yourself in an otherwise unique concept.
