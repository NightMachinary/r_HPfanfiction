Thanks so much! Those are all good points, which are probably all true. You've definitely given me something to think about, and I really appreciate it. I didn't actually think about how people would read Daniyel in their minds. I had actually considered going with David instead, but I wanted to be able to shorten it to Dan, still. You should actually see the list of names I considered, beside setting on Daniyel. It was quite... /amusing/. ^^;

I'm so glad you're going to keep reading though, I really appreciate you giving TP a chance! It means a lot!
