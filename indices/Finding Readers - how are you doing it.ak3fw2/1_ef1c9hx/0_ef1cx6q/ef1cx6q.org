It's a good question. In my original version of TP I /did/ use their real names, but when I decided to work on the re-write, I really took a moment to think about it and I realized I did not want to write a story about Daniel, Rupert, and Emma. It's not so much about the legalities, but Daniyel, Ella, and Robert are not, in fact, real people. They are nothing like the real counterparts that may have inspired them, and I really wanted to draw a line there and make that clear, because writing about real people isn't exactly something I feel comfortable with or actually want to do. Daniyel is actually a real name, albeit with odd spelling, and I do pronounce it the same way in my head. :)

If you do find the concept intriguing, I do hope you'll consider checking it out despite the spellings.

Thanks so much for the posting day tips!
