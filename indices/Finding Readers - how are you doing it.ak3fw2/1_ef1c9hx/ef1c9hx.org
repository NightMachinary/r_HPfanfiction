I actually tracked your story down after reading your post and had a question. Any reason why you aren't using the real life actor's names? It's a small thing but the different names...especially the odd spelling of of Daniel/Daniyel make it harder to read. It's an intriguing idea and making the 'alternate universe' based solely on the real life actors might resonate more with readers as they are familiar with and invested in Daniel, Emma and Rupert. If you've changed it because you're worried about legalities I'd at the very least use their real life first names.

From a practical standpoint I've found that chapters posted on Sunday morning/mid afternoon Eastern Standard time seem to do the best for me...I'm guessing because it catches the folks in Europe on Sunday night and everyone in the U.S. for the entire day.
