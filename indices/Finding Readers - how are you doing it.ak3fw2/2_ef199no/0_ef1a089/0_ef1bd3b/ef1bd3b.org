No, I mean the story tags on FFN. Four Characters (and if they are paired), two genres and a universe (Founders, Marauders, Books, Movies, Post-Hogwarts, Next-Gen IIRC). On Archive it's not an issue because you can have a hundred tags (even if that makes your story look like shite), but on FFN you have a very limited amount of tags to present your work.

I believe that a lot of people search for Harry and Character X, which is why the popular background cast is a good way to stay visible for the people interested in those characters. And those are the people you want as readers the most. They are already invested in your cast.

As for your description. Daniyel is a stupid name because it looks like it was chosen by a mother who tried too hard to make her child stand out. Grammarly tells me it is spelt wrong. Questions do not belong in a description because the answer is often rather obvious. You have not tagged it as a tragedy, so the answer is "probably not very high. A few background characters may bite it, but that's not really bad."
