Thanks! I've been posting on Saturday mornings and Wednesday, but are Saturday evenings better? I may give that a go next time.

For tags, are you referring to Ao3?

I'm definitely getting a lot more readers on FFN than A03, so I think you're absolutely right there. The one thing I like better about Ao3 is more space for a description.

â€‹

That said... about the description, I've reworked it on FFN several times. Would you mind telling me, if it sounds at all intriguing?

/When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?/
