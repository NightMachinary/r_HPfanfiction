Just started reading your story, it's very good! The plot is engaging and the characters are really well written. I love the concept of Harry switching places with his actor and both of them being stuck in alternative realities. I am also glad that you choose to distance the actors in the fic from their real life counterparts. Rpfs usually make me kind of uncomfortable but your fic doesn't at all Thanks for posting the link on here!
