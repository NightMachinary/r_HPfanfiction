Thanks! I'm definitely getting enough comments about Dan's name to consider actually switching it back out, so this thread is incredibly useful - and I did just adjust the summary as per Iniga's and Hellstrike's suggestions.

The switch /is/ actually the result of a spell going wrong, as you mentioned, which happens during the attack on Hogwarts - maybe I shall reword that as well.

I do hope you'll consider checking it out, if the description interests you. The name does read the same way as "Daniel" and that's how I read it in my mind.
