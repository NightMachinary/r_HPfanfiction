I don't usually read OC stories, but the description sounds interesting. The name Daniyel instead of Daniel really puts me off the story though. I would imagine it would drive me nuts to read a fic where it's spelled that way the entire time.

I would take his name off the summary and make it closer to iniga123's suggested rewrite.

I don't understand why an attack on Hogwarts would lead to him ending up in the muggle world though. I would think the switch would be due to some ritual, potion or spell gone wrong rather than an attack on a school.
