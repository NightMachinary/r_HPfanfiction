Speaking from personal experience:

- Post on Saturday or Sunday evening GMT. That way you are in the "prime" weekend slots for the US readers, who are by far the largest reader base on FFN.

- Rare fandom favourite characters are a sure way to remain visible because they are popular but there is not a lot of content. Tag accordingly. And we are talking about characters like Nymphadora or Andromeda Tonks, Fleur, Pansy, Daphne, not Snape or Malfoy (way too much content to be visible without an established reader base).

- You need to have Harry tagged. Otherwise, you will get a lot fewer views. If your story does not include Harry, you have to expect a lot less attention than you would have otherwise.

- Your story needs to stand out and the description has to make that clear. You have a few hundred characters to convince people that your story is interesting and not just the usual recycled ideas. Avoid questions.

- Archive is not really worth the effort. The comment interface is better, but I had several long discussions via FFN PM while the feedback on Archive was pretty bland and short. And no responses to my answers. It will get you a few additional views, but don't expect much.
