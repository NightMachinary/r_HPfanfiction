Hey!

I feel that I should mention again, that you are the best, and also that this is very, very helpful comment! :)

And I am so glad you're enjoying it now, regardless of how you first found it. It actually entirely made my day when you did decide to check it out, but I'm sure you already know that!

I really like your summary, I may have to steal!

I had actually just changed it to the following after some of the discussion on this thread:

/When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered... and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU Year 5/

But I may very welll merge it with some of the stuff you suggested! Thank you again!
