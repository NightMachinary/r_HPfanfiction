Hi there!

As you know, I do follow your fic, and I can assure anyone out there who's considering it that the wordcraft is excellent, the plot is tight, and the characterizations are good.

That said, I wouldn't have chosen your fic to read if I hadn't been reciprocating your very kind, very inspiring reviews to MY fic. (To be clear, I now read because I enjoy it. But the first click was reciprocal.)

The reasons I wouldn't have chosen it have been covered here: I'm hesitant to read about a non-canon character and I don't like real person fic on principle. These are pretty common turnoffs. However, your fic really isn't heavy on non-canon characters and it isn't RPF at all. I wonder if changing your summary would help.

You currently use: When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

I think it's just as accurate to say something like: A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. With Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?
