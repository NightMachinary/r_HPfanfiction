Mhh, I never had the feeling that Hermione is shown with fewer flaws than Harry or Ron, at least when considering the average of what I have read. I mean I must have read hundreds of fics where her insane trust in authority figures is causing all kinds of problems. Both on a personal relationship level and for the story/plot. Same as her nagging about school work when it isn't needed or being arrogant and self-righteous.
