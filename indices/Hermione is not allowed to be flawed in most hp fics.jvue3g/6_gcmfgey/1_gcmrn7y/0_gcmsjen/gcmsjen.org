Ya that I think having flaws and working on them is a good way to do character growth. But you really only work on them when you run into problems because you have them and have at least some relevant consequences. Gotta be wrong about shit or be bad or fuck up to wanna change.

So because her flaws get hand waved her character growth gets kinda hand waved too.
