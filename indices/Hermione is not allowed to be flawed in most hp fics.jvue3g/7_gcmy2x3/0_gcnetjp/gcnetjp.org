Haven't read /Paradigm Shift/, but it's telling that people bring up the /The Arithmancer/. For Hermione's canon (not fanon) flaws to show, she has to be shown wielding power over others (in order to be shown abusing it). If she doesn't have power in a story, then her flaws are inconsequential.

Which means that in order for you to see more fics with a flawed Hermione who isn't bashed, more fics featuring a powerful and/or leader Hermione need to exist.
