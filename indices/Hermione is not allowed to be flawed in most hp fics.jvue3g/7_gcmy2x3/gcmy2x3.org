  If its not a bashing fic he then apologizes grows from his mistakes.

/Wheezes/

The last time I read a so-called non-bashing premise of this Ron was seriously injured at the DOM battle as part of his "redemption" while everyone else involved was more or less okay.

  But not so much Hermione not unless its bashing. Most of the time its just not a big deal or didn't cause many problems or she was actually right and it not a problem. I know that's a problem that started in canon but it doesn't change much in fanon in my experience. And its kinda a bummer to me because it makes fanon Hermione more boring than other characters to me she gets to be less compelling in fanon than characters who were just meh to me in canon. Cuz she doesn't really get to grow.

I can't wait for all the comments to bring up the Arithmancer or Paradigm Shift a "proof" that "Hermione can have flaws! See! Here's two fics out of 800k+! See? /SEE!/"

I've found that it's okay to bash Hermione if 1) you like her and your preferred pairing is Harmony, and 2) You go easy on her, for example in the aforementioned fics Hermione has issues, but they tend to be downplayed or glossed over just like in canon. She's never really taken to task for her behaviour, gets the guy in the end, blah blah blah. It's more like a going over a speed hump.
