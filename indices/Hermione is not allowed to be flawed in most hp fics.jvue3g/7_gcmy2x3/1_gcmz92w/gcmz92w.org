Ok valid Ron has the opposite problem of Hermione where like all his flaws get dialed up to 11 if he is shown having them most of the time .

But Ron aside there are characters who do bad things both in the fanon of the story and actual canon or have flaws. Those flaws/bad things are called out and acknowledged. Consequences happen.

And then they improve get better go through character growth and Hermione that doesn't happen unless its bashing where the flaws will be acknowledged but the growth doesn't really happen.

My problem generally with bashing is if I want to call out a character as bad I want that character to be called out as bad. Not a version too overly exaggerated that it stops really resembling the character.

But in this case also I do actually want to see her get character growth because other characters get it and she doesn't. But that can't happen without her actually facing consequences and having her flaws explored.
