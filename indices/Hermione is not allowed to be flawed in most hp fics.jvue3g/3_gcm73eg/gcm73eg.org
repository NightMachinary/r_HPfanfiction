I think sometimes people look at being flawed as bashing (hear me out).

I get it that some people dont like to read bashing and that's totally fine, that's their choice; I do think that sometimes if a person's favorite character isn't being portrayed in an all positive light they'll take that as them being bashed. I wrote a story once where I was exploring Hermione's jealousy and it wasn't written cartoonishly, but I was trying to be realistic and someone got upset because they saw it as me bashing her and it wasn't the case.

That makes sense, right? I hope so lol
