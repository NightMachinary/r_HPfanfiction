I mean I don't think people necessarily always think their characterization is fully canon all the time. Sometimes they just really dislike a character and want to lean in to those negative aspects more heavily to illustrate why or just to bash them more effectively.

And not that its necessarily the worst choice you can make or anything but to me personally it's kinda boring cuz the more bashable version of the character less interesting than the regular one. And that's also true for characters I don't like. Like I don't like canon Snape but if I read fic that was very unsympathetic to Snape whether it was bashing or not I'd want it to call out canon Snape so if its too exaggerated then it doesn't really do it for me.
