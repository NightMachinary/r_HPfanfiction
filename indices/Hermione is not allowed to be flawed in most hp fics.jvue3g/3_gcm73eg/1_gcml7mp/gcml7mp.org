Makes total sense. Especially so, since character interpretations are so polarised in this fandom - it means that bashing is so utterly relative to people. If people actually think Ron is an utter jealous monster who'd basically be a Death Eater if Rowling hadn't pulled her authorial strings, then portraying him that way isn't bashing to those people. Equally, if people think Draco was a little sweetie in over his head, or if Snape was a protective, good person all along, then portraying them as bullies and racists (even to the degree many would consider canon) can come off as bashing.

For the record, I'm not saying those interpretations are right or wrong - I don't know enough about canon to dispute and probably wouldn't care enough to do so if I did - but having those different interpretations does establish bashing to be in a very individualistic perspective.
