No I totally get that and I do think that's true. But like I think its especially true for Hermione compared to other characters. Like if you wrote a fic that showed Ron in a good light but still called him out for the whole Yule ball thing I don't think many would call it bashing.

Or if you did like a redeemed Draco story where people called him out for being awful in the past I also don't think that would be considered bashing.

Like sure you may not wanna read those and only want fics that portray them positively and don't really talk about the flaws. But having the flaws won't always mean it gets called a bashing fic.

Hermione tho I think it usually does and maybe because most fics that call out Hermiones flaws at all tend to be bashing fics.
