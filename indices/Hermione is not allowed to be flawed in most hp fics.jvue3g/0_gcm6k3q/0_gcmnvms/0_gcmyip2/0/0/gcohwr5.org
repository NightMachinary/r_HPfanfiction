Like I said, she's Dumbledore's heir. All the brilliance and none of the self-awareness.

I'm gonna put the lack of self-awareness down to her being a teenager though. (Pre-teen in the case of her being at her worst in first year).

I'm also going to argue that this would be one of the ways she actually developed as a character. She didn't even bat an eye when Harry said he wanted to drop out of school to go Horcrux Hunting. She wasn't ever explicitly called out sure, but she did get more relaxed around the rules by second year at the earliest. I'm actually trying to see Hermione fussing over broken rules past 2nd year, and I'm having a hard time recalling one.

We can make an argument about the book thing in HBP, but that was really more about her place in the class as opposed to Harry breaking rules. I don't even think breaking rules was one of the arguments she used against it?

Anyway my point is that she stopped fussing at everyone breaking the rules when she started regularly breaking them herself. It's definitely not the usual way to solve hypocrisy but that's what happened here.

(There's a discussion to be had about Hermione's understanding of rules shifting from word of the law to spirit of the law as time went on, and that informing how she chooses when to fuss over broken rules and when to let it slide. But that's not for here.)
