I've never had this specific flaw be articulated in these terms, and damn you are so right! Hermione's need for control is rivaled only by Dumbledore I think. They definitely share similar ideas about for "the greater good" and knowing what that is for everyone.

As I mentioned in another comment though, this kind of flaw is so HARD to write. Fic writers have unintentionally turned her into dark!Hermione because they tried to explore her penchant for manipulation. It takes a lot of skill to write someone who is both extremely adept at manipulation and has a penchant for ignoring all other obstacles as someone who is ALSO fundamentally good. And that happens to be what Hermione's character is.

This is the exact place that all the Dumbledore bashing comes from, and I really don't want Hermione to misrepresented the same way he (unfortunately) was. It takes a lot of skill to explore the flaw you're suggesting without turning her into Satan's right hand. Rowling barely managed it with Dumbledore, and she definitely failed with Hermione. I seriously doubt fic writers would fare much better.
