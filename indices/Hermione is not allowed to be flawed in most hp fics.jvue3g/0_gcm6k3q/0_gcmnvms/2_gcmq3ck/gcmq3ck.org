Yes yes yes all of this.

I mean I don't mean to suggest that Hermione does bad things so shit on her for it. But she has flaws that can cause consequences and having her face some of them in a fic can push character growth give her a inner struggle and make her more compelling as a character. What flaws depends on the story but you do have canon things to work with. But so often in fics the only ones who point it out only want to call her out not give her character growth and make her more compelling in fic. Basically mostly bashing fics in my experience.

And I really don't think thats true for all other Hp characters. Yes they have bashing fics too but there are plenty of stories that are pro a certain character make them very likable but still call em out and make them grow. It bothers me Hermione isn't one of them because there's imo alot of untapped potential that people don't really touch with her because they won't let her be wrong occasionally unless they bashing her.

Like imagine a story where she realizes her approach was wrong with the house elves and ends up liberating them by learning from her past mistake realizing her approach leaves many issues they have unaddressed. So she changes her approach ( maybe with the help of Ron who i think better at being a people person than her and more aware of the current culture than her) and perhaps that makes her approach other non house elf people differently.
