I mean Ron has be bashed to hell and back so I think Ron facing consequences people are just less likely to ask for because they may not want to read more Ron bashing as a result. But Ron also gets called out faces consequences and changes as a result in canon often enough that I think its less of a arc to crave for him in that regard.

As for Harry he gets such a wide range of portrayals ( which may or may not seem very Harry like) and people generally tend to look for a specific type of Harry more than anything else. Plus most people even people who like him don't have him as their fav character. So maybe they care less if he gets character growth in fics .
