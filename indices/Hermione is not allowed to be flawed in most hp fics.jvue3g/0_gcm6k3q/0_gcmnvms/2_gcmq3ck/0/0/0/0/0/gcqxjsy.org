There's plenty of Hermione-bashing as well, and I don't think bashing counts as consequences or character growth---usually the opposite in fact.

With respect to canon, to say that Ron (and Harry) get called out, suffer consequences, and grow as a result, whereas Hermione doesn't is, with all due respect, confirmation bias. It's only true if you ignore all instances of this on one side and exaggerate all instances on the other side. (Here, I am reusing some earlier posts of mine, because this argument gets brought up over and over again.)

Harry is rewarded for his flaws (impulsiveness and recklessness) just as or more often than he is punished, starting with the Quiddich lesson. After his disastrous leadership at the Department of Mysteries, Sirius is killed, Hermione is cursed half to death, others get broken bones, and Harry's punishment is to feel bad about it. After Harry breaks the Taboo in DH, Hermione's the one who gets tortured and gets her wand broken, Dobby dies, but Harry gets the Elder Wand. And, doesn't even begin to overcome his most defining flaws.

Similarly, what consequences did Ron face for getting Harry and Hermione involved in Draco's idiotic duel? For badmouthing Hermione behind her back (or so he thought)? (For the record, I don't consider him a bully or a bad person for it, but it was still not a good thing to do.) For exploding at Hermione at the Yule Ball? For turning from Harry in the same book?

Hermione gets called out aplenty by Ron, Snape, and others. (Harry doesn't call people out much in the first place, so it's easy to miss.) As for consequences, and growth, for her hectoring of Ron, Hermione is humiliated and almost killed by a troll; for the Firebolt, she is ostracised by her only friends for a good part of a year. (And, she does mellow out over time. For example, in HBP, she thinks that Harry using HBP's book is cheating, but she doesn't turn him in.) She endures being a laughingstock and loses valuable time for her SPEW efforts. (Again, she learns from her mistakes there, and is able to understand house-elves better than either Harry or Ron in DH.) She does get away with sending birds after Ron---probably the single most impulsive thing she's done in all of canon---so you have that. Otherwise, Hermione grows throughout canon far more than Harry or Ron.
