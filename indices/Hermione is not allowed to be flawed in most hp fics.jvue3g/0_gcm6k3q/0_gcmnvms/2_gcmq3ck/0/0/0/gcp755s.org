At this point, it's a matter of taste. To me, a Hermione who has "grown" nicer and more considerate of others' feelings is a Hermione who has lost a big part of what makes her an interesting character.

And, we get requests for a nicer Hermione at least once a fortnight, yet no one ever seems to ask for fics in which Harry and Ron learn to be nicer and more considerate or suffer more consequences for their rudeness. I wonder why...
