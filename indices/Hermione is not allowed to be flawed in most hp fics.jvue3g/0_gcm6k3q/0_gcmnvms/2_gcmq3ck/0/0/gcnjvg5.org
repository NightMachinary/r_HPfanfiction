I mean theoretically yes that would work for this example too if it goes down more a lord Hermione route I wouldn't read it because I don't like that type of story in general.

But ya basically my point was in order for her to grow she needs be wrong and face consequences for that. If the narrative twists the situation to make her in the right then it doesn't have any meaning when she tries to change because there's no real reason for her to thats compelling in any way. Like ya sure she could read more get more smart but its not really meaningful growth. It says nothing about her motivations or struggles beyond she wants to learn more which not that interesting compared to she struggles to see things from a perspective that isn't her own.
