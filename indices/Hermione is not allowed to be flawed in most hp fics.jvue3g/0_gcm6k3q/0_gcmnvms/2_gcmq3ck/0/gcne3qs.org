A question and a statement:

1. How would you view a (hypothetical) fic in which Hermione suffers the consequences of her flaws and responds by doubling down? That is, rather than learning to respect other people's agency, she learns more effective ways to dominate and manipulate other people---both magically and socially---and get away with it? Would you accept this kind of character growth, or would it have to be her learning to be nicer and more respectful?

2. The house-elf thing is exactly what happened in canon. She learned from her mistake, and by DH, she was able to coherently explain to Harry and Ron what made Kreacher tick and how to win his loyalty. Then, if we are to believe WoG, she used the political system to implement the reforms she wanted. But, that happened over a span of years. There are practically no fics that cover such a long span of time /and/ keep house-elf rights salient.
