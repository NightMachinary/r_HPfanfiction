To kind of touch on a few points, the broom arriving with no card should've been a red flag to Harry. Like seriously, even Dumbledore left a note, and he was giving him something from his father. So while Hermione looks bad for going to McGonagall, it's one of those things where both saw the same thing, just went to different outcomes.

The house-elves are honestly a good topic, cause if that's all they've known, how do we know that they wouldn't enjoy freedom? Winky becoming an alcoholic while Dobby flourished is always interesting, and I agree that her original goals were way too high. She should've gone for something simple like showcasing the abuse some of the elves receive. That starts change and can lead to a compromise.

The DA was, without a doubt, the perfect representation of how Rowling changed everything we knew about the characters. Hermione in book 3 would have laughed and said that he shouldn't be doing it. Or, if he's involved, as someone who couldn't be considered the leader. Granted Fudge was an absolute dick, but there's too much danger there and Hermione would have argued against his involvement. Pretty sure Ron would've as well.

If you think erasing her parents memories of her when Voldemort was going to go to any lengths to get them is bad, you're not even considering how they'd be treated. Tortured--more than likely into insanity--as well as them having a sham trial and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss is all but assured if she didn't do that. And the repercussions are high no matter what. If she fails, it's possible she puts them in the hospital. If she succeeds, whose to say she'd be able to get their memories back?

Her flaws are there cause she tries to do a lot over the entire series. Like in book 3 where she takes every class, tries to help with Buckbeak's case, and can't exactly have a social life so she ends up acting in ways that she normally wouldn't. Book 4, she should've brought it up to the others--and maybe even McGonagall or Dumbledore--before trying to get all the house-elves freedom. Book 5 was just Rowling throwing everything out, so I can't accurately use that for any examples because the characters changed from how they usually act.

Book 7, however, is literally a giant case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situations for all involved. So what doesn't seem right might just be the only thing that can be done.
