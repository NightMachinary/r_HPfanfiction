After the war, Hermione found her parents, but she hadn't spent enough time researching the memory modification. There was no way to change them back. Worse, they couldn't even form new memories of her, because she had so thoroughly erased herself from their minds. No matter what she did, she couldn't restore her relationship with her parents or even form a new one.

She spiraled into depression and self-loathing, leaving the wizarding world for good, locking herself away in a room with only the internet for company, so no one could look upon her, beast that she was for what she did to her parents, and so she could never be close enough to another person to cast magic on them.

In memory of her parents, Yorick and Olivia, she changed her name to Yorick and Olivia's Bastard, and in honor of having destroyed their lives in 1997, added that onto the end.

From then on, she was known only as YOB1997, determined to make sure no one expressed admiration for the sick twisted girl who had done so much evil.
