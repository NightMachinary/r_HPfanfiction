I'm going to paraphase another user that has since deleted their account.

Canon Hermione is just walking talking bossy exposition at first, then becomes this perfect goddess that never gets taken to task. The movies made it 10x worse.

But fanon Hermione...It's /fanon/ Hermione that I cannot stand. Fanon Hermione, who is practically Einstein levels of intelligence in First Year. Fanon Hermione, who can come up with an immunity to the Avada Kedavra. Fanon Hermione, who is a beautiful Goddess, sexier than any Veela. Fanon Hermione, who is Harry's only REAL friend, not like that bastard Ron who rapes kittens and is just a Death Eater in disguise.

I hate Fanon Hermione because she's just so damn /perfect/. I understand why so many people make Fanon Hermione like that. Guys like her because she was played by Emma Watson, girls want to be her, so that's the image of Hermione in their heads.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

It seems as though every fic I read, Harry becomes best pals with Hermione. Dark!Harry? Hermione is right there getting dark with him. Squib!Harry? Haha, guess the name of the dentists he starts going to. Harry runs away from home? Where else would he run to but the Grangers? Racist Harry calls her the magical equivalent of the N-word? Naturally, Hermione forgives him because she isn't like that bitch Lily.

It's a fucking cop-out. She's used /everywhere/, look no furthur than [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jtvjft/promt_ron_post_book_7_comes_down_with_a_disease/][this thread]] from a few days ago. I'd love to see /other/ characters get the damn limelight for once. Maybe Harry winds up meeting Dean before Hogwarts or something? Harry befriends the Creeveys? Just stop it with this home at the Grangers crap.

And I haven't even gotten started on how H/HR seems to be shoved into pretty much everything, often including Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing.
