When does she become a perfect goddess in the books? In PoA, she's moody and fighting with Harry and Ron. In GoF, she's insecure and seen as an SJW for campaigning for House Elves. In OotP, she's constantly arguing with Ron and screamed at by Harry. In HBP, she's fighting with Harry about the Prince's book and crying from Ron's insults. In DH, she cries every night because Ron abandoned her and Harry paints her as unreasonable for not talking to Ron after he came back.

Also, I never get what people mean when they say Movie Hermione was a Mary Sue. She was much more annoying than canon Hermione and always jerking herself off for her intelligence. When canon Hermione was complimented for her cleverness, she downplayed it and blushed, but when movie Hermione was called a genius, she started talking about how she wasn't really a genius, just highly logical and observant. Everything interesting about Hermione was taken from her in the movies IMO.

Tangent aside, what do you mean Fanon Hermione is perfect? Looking through ao3, Hermione bashing is more common than Ginny bashing and is only slightly less common than Molly bashing. Even in fanfics where she seems perfect, she's usually just arm candy who spouts off knowledge Harry needs to find. The only Hermione where I could say Hermione was "perfect" was a fanfic I wiped from my mind a long time ago. The reason she's everywhere is because, no matter your opinions on her, the writer has to deal with her somehow if the MC is in her year. She can't just be ignored since she's the top of her class and an ambitious, outspoken muggleborn.

Regarding that thread, I don't think it's because Hermione is shoe-horned in everything. It's just that she has more traits in common with Walter than Ron does. She's clever, ruthless, unsatisfied, knowledge-seeking, unappreciated, arrogant, and believes she knows best. Meanwhile, the only trait Ron shares with Walter is his insecurity, so if we're being canon compliant, Ron could never be Heisenberg while Hermione has the potential to.
