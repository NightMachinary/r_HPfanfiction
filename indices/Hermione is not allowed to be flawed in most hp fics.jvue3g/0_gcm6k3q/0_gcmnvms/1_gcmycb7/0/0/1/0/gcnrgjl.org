I disagree with you on this one. If anything, JK does a good job at making Hermione quite flawed despite often claiming that she is a projection of her teenage self. Furthermore, since the story is told from Harry's perspective, I often feel like Harry doesn't like her all that much.

In GoF, when Harry and Ron fight, it's actually stated that he didn't enjoy her company as much as he did Ron's. In OotP she is the constant target of his outbursts. In HBP he is pissed with her for nagging him about the book of the Prince. In DH he is annoyed at her for being a shitty cook, then for crying about Ron, then for accidentally breaking his wand, then for not talking to Ron, then for not believing in the Hallows. As a matter of fact I am surprised that Hermione is always chosen as Harry's best friend in fics, when in canon he is pretty mean to her and Ron is the only one bridging their relationship (but I sort of get it since most of those fics are written by girls/women who project themselves into Hermione).

They use the two rows Harry had with Ron to portray him as this vile, jealous character, while they completely overlook how nasty Harry could be towards Hermione. I think it's mostly the movies that turn Hermione into a Mary Sue because they were made in the era when they were trying to create more heroines and female role-models (and also because probably the director wanted to bang Emma Watson). Then fanon makes her 1000x worse.
