It's my time to shine.

Let me start by saying I don't really dislike her as a character but both fanon and canon seem to gloss over some serious flaws of hers and /that/ irks me.

I think a major one that gets overlooked is that she doesn't really have respect for other people's agency. For examples I'm going to focus on how she treats people in her /good/ graces.

In their third year, while the gang still thought Sirius was a dangerous convict, she suspects Harry's new broom could be cursed/booby trapped and immediately calls for a teacher. The suspicion, in that scenario, is not at all unfounded and getting an authority figure is a good call overall. The problem for me is that she keeps Harry oblivious of all this. She doesn't make him aware of her concerns, nor does she make him aware she's reported the suspicious package. From Harry's point of view, McGonnagall just comes around one day and goes "no broom for u." Did Harry not need to know he may be handling a cursed object?

Another one is her crusade to free the house-elves. What's their actual status in terms of servitude isn't the subject of discussion. Canonically we know that Dobby flourished as a free elf while Winky became an alcoholic out of grief. The relevant info is that Hermione doesn't take the wishes of the elves in her attempts to liberate them. She just makes an unilateral decision and then tries to enforce it. Even if you take that the elves are misguided and misinformed in their desire to serve, wouldn't it be better to talk with them on the topic; make them aware of the reality of their enslavement? For all her talk of freeing the house-elves Hermione doesn't really treat them as equals.

The establishment of the DA in fifth year is a big one for me. Up to that point Harry's faced an attempt on his life, shortly followed by a kangaroo court, and then the most horrid defense teacher to date. It's been made clear the ministry's out to get him and no one will stand up for him the next time he's in trouble. "Keep your head down" indeed. So, in light of that, Hermione gets him to found an illegal school club at a time that, if someone so much as says "Potter," he's going to be in big trouble. And by "big" I mean "potentially lethal." We know Umbridge would administer corporeal punishment over minor infractions. I wouldn't be surprised if she'd use any incident to "facilitate" Harry's eventual murder. Hermione doesn't seem to take any of that into account and puts Harry on the spot to make her idea happen.

Finally, and most importantly, her erasing her parents' memory. I get wanting to protect them but shouldn't they, as /actual adults/, have some say in how it happens? What's more, it seems to me like a rather ham-fisted and ineffectual strategy. What, don't the Grangers have a single friend between the two of them? No extended family? Was the expectation that everyone they know will just go along with them up and fleeing the country out of nowhere?

I /could/ mention on how she devised a plan to infiltrate the Slytherin common room by drugging, abducting, and impersonating three different people, every step of which sounds /illegal as hell/, but she didn't really care about them, so it's not relevant.

I didn't really mean to write an essay on this (except I did) but it's something that's been on my mind recently. Hope this has been helpful and relevant to your interests. Feels good to get it off my chest, at any rate.
