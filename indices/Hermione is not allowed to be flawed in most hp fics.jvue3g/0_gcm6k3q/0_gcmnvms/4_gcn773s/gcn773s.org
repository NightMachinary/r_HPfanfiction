Honestly, why does everyone act like Hermione was wrong in the House Elf situation? Do you think it was wrong for America to make a unilateral decision to free all of their slaves? Most slaves were brainwashed and almost never rebelled. There's literally only around 30 slave rebellions in total, and even the few "major" ones had less than 50 people (white or black) participating. You act like a 15 year old girl can reason with brainwashed slaves, which is a bit weird IMO. Also, Hermione's goals were quite reasonable:

*“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented.”*
