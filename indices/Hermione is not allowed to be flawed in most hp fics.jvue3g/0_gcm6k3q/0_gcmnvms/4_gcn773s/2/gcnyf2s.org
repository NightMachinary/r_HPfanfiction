Not a comparable analogy. The US issued the Emancipation Proclamation due to military necessity, not out of moral outrage. Lincoln wanted to pressure the secessionists. The Thirteenth Amendment was actually only successfully passed because Congress forced the defeated south to acquiesce. And even then an argument could be made that it was a bad political and economic decision for the country. It certainly devastated the southeast. Ultimately the morality of it is irrelevant. It's her methods that were questionable. I have no issue with a character behaving in an underhanded fashion. But Hermione tends to get whitewashed in the fanfiction I've read.
