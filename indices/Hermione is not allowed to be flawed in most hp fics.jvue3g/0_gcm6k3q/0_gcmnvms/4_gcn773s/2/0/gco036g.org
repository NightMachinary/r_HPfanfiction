  Ultimately the morality of it is irrelevant. It's her methods that were questionable.

So you think the morality is irrelevant? Wow. To me, the morality should be more important than the methods. Would you punish somebody who is trying to do something good but went about it the wrong way more harshly than someone who tried to do something bad but used good methods? I'm sorry if you believe that, but IMO, that's disgusting.

  But Hermione tends to get whitewashed in the fanfiction I've read.

Weird, since judging by the tags on ao3, there's more Hermione bashing than Ginny bashing, and Hermione bashing is only a bit less common than Molly bashing. When Hermione's not bashed, she usually becomes either a shy bookworm who gets seduced by a hot "bad boy" or eye candy that doesn't have any real use besides being an accessory for Harry and knowing trivial knowledge.
