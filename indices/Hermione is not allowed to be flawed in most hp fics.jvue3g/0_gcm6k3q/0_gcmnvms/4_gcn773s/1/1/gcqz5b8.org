In addition to [[/u/Why634]] 's points, IRL, slave owners could not magically compel their slaves to punish themselves for even thinking about freedom the way house-elf owners could compel theirs. If they could, you wouldn't have even fewer instances of slaves seeking freedom.

Even in canon, we see one elf that embraces freedom, another who prefers to work for a different employer but is not permitted to, and another who is placed in a situation that a RL would drink themselves to death over more likely than not.

Hermione was right. Her only crime was that she failed and wasted a lot of time due to ineffective tactics.
