So brownies get compensation and are free to leave the household? That already makes them completely different from house-elves in all ways that matter.

That House-elves get any kind of magic from wizards is pure fanon. In my opinion, it's popular because it means that we don't have to confront the fact that wizards practice slavery and can laugh at the awkward teenage antics of the only person who saw it for what it is.

From what we actually observe, neither Dobby nor Winky are magically diminished despite being freed. Dobby is perfectly happy and functional, and Winky reacts like /a person/ who's served a family all her life (and perhaps going a few generations back), even covering up their crimes, only to be betrayed and publicly humiliated and fired.

But, even if we suppose that house-elves get magic from wizards, the fact that Kreacher wants to change masters and cannot means that it's still unmitigated slavery.
