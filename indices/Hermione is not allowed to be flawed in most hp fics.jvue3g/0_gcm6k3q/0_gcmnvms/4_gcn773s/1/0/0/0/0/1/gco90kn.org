Am I the only one who saw the analogy to brownies in the house elves. Sure there are shitty masters like malfoy, but still, house elves like to serve a house hold because its in there nature. Brownies liked to serve because its in there nature. I believe brownies got some tools and food from the house for there service. Its my guess house elves drew off magic. Hence houses only having 1 in general where as hogwarts could support many more. Its a symbiotic relationship it seems to me.
