I think we're not going to go anywhere with this argument. Academics are still arguing to this day why slaves (and other people in similar positions) never rebel. Some think it was because of the slaves' pragmatism while some say it was mainly because they were brainwashed. I believe they were brainwashed, because even when they had the upper hand, almost all of them refused to take the chance. Although I don't think all of them were brainwashed, the ones that weren't were too afraid to revolt because of the possible consequences. How about we just agree to disagree?
