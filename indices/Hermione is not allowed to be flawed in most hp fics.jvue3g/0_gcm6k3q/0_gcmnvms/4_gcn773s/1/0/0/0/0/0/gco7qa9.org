Okay, I think you're looking at it overly simplified. Most slaves were converted into Christianity, and were literally taught from birth that God believes they are lower than white people and that their rightful place are as white people's slaves. They were brainwashed, and that's a fact. A decent-sized portion of slaves willingly stayed with their masters even after they were freed.
