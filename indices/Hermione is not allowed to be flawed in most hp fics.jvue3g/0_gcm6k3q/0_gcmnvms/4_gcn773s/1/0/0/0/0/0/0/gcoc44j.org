I don't think I'm the one oversimplifying this. Yes, lots of slaves were converted to Christianity or some mixture of Christianity and a native religion/belief system. But that doesn't mean they thought their rightful place was to be slaves. Hell, in the US they would purposefully omit Exodus so slaves wouldn't be inspired by it!

I'm also not surprised that a lot of former slaves stayed at a plantation afterwards. Setting aside how long it took certain areas to hear that slavery was over (and some never really did) - you were just freed. But you have no money, no land, no horse or wagon. The only way you can reliably provide for yourself is manual labor. There may be armed men running around, angry at the loss of their former slaves. It might be easier for a sold off spouse or child or parent to come find you rather than you go looking for them. From a practical standpoint, I can understand why some of them choose to stay close by and become sharecroppers.

Look, I agree that there was a huge amount of dehumanization of slaves in the New World, on an individual and group level. And I agree that the effects of that dehumanization are still felt today, especially when it still continues on a number of levels. I think we have common ground on that. I just don't buy the argument that New World slaves by and large approved what was happening to them. Accepted it, sure. But I don't think the majority of them looked at what was happening and said yes, this is right.
