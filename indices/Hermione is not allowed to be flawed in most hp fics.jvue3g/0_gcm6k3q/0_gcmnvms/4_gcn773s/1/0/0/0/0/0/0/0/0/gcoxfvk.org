There is a phenomenon called learned helplessness, where people immersed in an ongoing negative situation beyond their control just give up and stop trying to change their circumstances, even when they finally do have the resources to change things. The conditions enslaved people were kept in and the way they were treated definitely would caused this in many people.

Is this the case with house elves? We really don't know because the only two elves we're shown had very different home lives and wildly different reactions to being freed. Dobby shows a great deal of strength of character in the way he went out on a limb to defy the Malfoys in spite of their constant abuse, and we're led to believe in the books that it's an unusual trait for a house elf.

I don't believe US slaves were brainwashed at all. Just paralyzed with fear and resignation. If you start compiling and listening to slave music, the vast majority of their songs are about freedom. Getting freed like Moses freeing his people from Egypt is a popular theme. So is looking forward to death because death brings freedom too. If they truly believed they deserved to be enslaved then freedom wouldn't be a such a powerful recurring theme.
