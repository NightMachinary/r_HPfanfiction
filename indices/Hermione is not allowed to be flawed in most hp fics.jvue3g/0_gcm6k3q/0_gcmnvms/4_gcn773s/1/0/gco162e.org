By slave rebellions, I meant revolts that had over 9 people participating. Besides that, slaves that ran away or were very uncommon, only representing less than 2% of the entire slave population. Also, the "worked to purchase themselves" isn't really a revolt since their masters allowed them to do it as they were legally entitled to anything a slave had, so it was almost unheard of at that time.
