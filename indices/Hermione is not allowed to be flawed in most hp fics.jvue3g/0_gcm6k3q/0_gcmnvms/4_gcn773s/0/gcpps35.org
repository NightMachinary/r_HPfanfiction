Generally I see the argument as happening in 2 ways 1 is Slavery is something good for elves actually she just doesn't understand their culture and is forcing her will on them. So essentially very pro slavery and uncomfortable.

The other though is there are many aspects perhaps of the magic and culture that she doesn't yet understand that cause complications and make it dangerous or unsustainable for elves to just be freed . There isn't like a way for them to live freely if they are freed and freeing them without changing some things first.

Hermione may have realized that if she maybe talked to them more first instead of trying to give them clothes first which kinda made them defensive and essentially ended the communication with them.

So if she learns to change tactics not just with House elves but in general and the goal was never the problem. And that I can get behind more.
