"House elf culture", even if it weren't a product of centuries of being magically compelled to punish themselves for even thinking about disobeying, is a distraction.

The simple fact is that we have some house elves who want to be free, who are not permitted to be free. We have others that want to serve a different master, and are not permitted to. That makes them slaves.

Now, one could invent fanon about house-elves needing wizard magic (which is disconfirmed by canon, in that none of the freed elves we see are magically diminished). One could even come up with more sophisticated explanations, such as that without their constant conditioning and binding, house-elves turn into evil imps after a few generations. But, even if one conjures up something like that, it still doesn't address that house-elves can't change masters.

Hermione's only crime was that her methods were initially ineffective, and in that, you have a point. The good news is that she learned from her mistakes.
