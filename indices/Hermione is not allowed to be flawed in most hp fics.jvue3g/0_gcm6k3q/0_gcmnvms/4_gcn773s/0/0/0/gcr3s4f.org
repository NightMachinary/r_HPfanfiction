What i mean to say by culture isn't just house elf culture but also the Wizarding one.

Like Dobby goes free leaves and then goes to doing the same job he was doing before though he is getting paid.

So either he always liked this job and just wanted to do it as a paying job and not a slave or

The way their society is doesn't allow him to be anything else. So doing this sort of work is really his only option.

I think the situation is more the latter. Which might be why the house elves are so against being freed. Worst case scenario is being treated like Dobby was. If they get freed they will be looking for the same type or work but without the guarantee they will get a employer who will treat them well. They risk having to be treated they way Dobby was by going free and the best option they have in the current system is working for a employer who treats them well like Dumbledore.

You have to do some systemic reform at the same time if you want to free them like truly free them. Again not to say Hermione's motivation was ever really bad but she needed to change alot more things before giving them clothes for this to work and trying to give them clothes that early made them less likely to trust she had their best interests at heart even though she was trying to help.

Its not really a crime but the framing not the greatest it can come away feeling like Hermiones problem was trying to free them. Not Hermione's problem was not considering more aspects of the situation and trying to free them when she did and the way she did.
