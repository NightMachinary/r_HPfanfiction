Because the narrative framing of that particular subplot was terrible. It made Hermione out to be a soapbox Sadie in GoF. And in OoTP, she essentially tried to free the elves, but the elves rebuffed her efforts and refused to clean the Gryffindor Tower as a result.

And instead of people realizing that the flaws of this particular subplot are Doylist in nature (ie. a reflection of Rowling's subconscious biases and politics), they tried to look for Watsonian explanations. They concluded that Hermione was in fact a bad activist and therefore has to be taught how to live with chattel slavery.

As much as I love Hermione's show of heart in the SPEW subplot, I definitely hate all the chattel slavery apologia it spouted in terms of fix-it fic.
