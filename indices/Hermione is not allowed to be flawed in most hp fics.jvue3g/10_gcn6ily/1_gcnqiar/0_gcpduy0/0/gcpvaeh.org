[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569][People don't bash her?]] Also, why do you expect her to be bashed for hitting Ron, but Ron and Harry shouldn' be bashed for hitting Ginny and Hermione? I have never seen Ron or Harry criticized for that but every thread about Hermione has mentions her attacking Ron. It's hypocritical and you're extremely biased. Also, when Harry saw how he hurt his friends, he said this:

*“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know...”*

That's hardly an apology. Anyway, I know my questions can't be answered, because you already ignored them in the previous reply since they don't fit your narrative. Goodbye!
