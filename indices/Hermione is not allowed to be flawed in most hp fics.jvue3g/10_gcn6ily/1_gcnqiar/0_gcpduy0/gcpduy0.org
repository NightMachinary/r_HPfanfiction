I meant the flaws women in HP have as real flaws and that are criticised. Hermione isn't bashed for that attack. People only criticse her. And frankly that's refreshing because she is too much of a victim elswhere or gets to be right in the end because blackmail and revenge are no big deal apparantly. Harry's friends tell him Hedwig attaccked them and he feels guilty. Hermione hits attacks Ron twice, is ruthless and very vindictive, but that is not a flaw that seems to be signficant. I just don't think that would have happened with either Harry or Ron. In my opinion Rowling favours her females, giving them flaws that are lovable to some or aren't trated as such. But let's agree to disagree. Other women, like Ginny and Tonks, get to do stuff that I don't find acceptable and that could be addressed, but in their case it's an advatange. But like I said, let's agree to disagree.
