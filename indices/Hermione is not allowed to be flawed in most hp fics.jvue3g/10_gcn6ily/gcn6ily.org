That's where following canon's approach becomes a roblem. In general, I think that if you are a woman in HP, you can get away with murder. And the very fact people's favourite Hermione's flaw is, say, not asking for help shows the kind of characters people enjoy writing. I mean, most people like her precisely because she doesn't mess-up all that much. When they like a character, they someow seem to constantly be in that first stage of falling in love, because it takes some bravery to admit that Hermione might actually be wrong. And her ruthlessness and vindictiveness aren't even seen as flaws. The problem with Hermione is that it's always either 'she's badass'' she is right' or 'Ron did it first/she did that for a good cause.' Strangely, Harry's impulsiveness gets Sirius killed, and he was actually trying to do the right thing, but with Hermione we can't have anything meaningful.
