  but with Hermione we can't have anything meaningful
#+end_quote

This right here is exactly my problem. I actually really liked canon Hermione but in fanfiction because she has no explored flaws compared to others she gets to be way less meaningful and becomes more boring to read about. And its a shame because there is alot of untapped potential if people just let her be wrong sometimes and explored that more .
