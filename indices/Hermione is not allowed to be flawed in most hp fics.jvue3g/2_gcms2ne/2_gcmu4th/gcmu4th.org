Thanks for the recs !

And ya i agree its hard to make her seem flawed in a non bashing way because of how she is.

I think the best way is to focus on relationships. Yes Hermione is smart and usually right about things but relationships including friendships aren't always about being right. You might think you are right but if you use that as reasoning to put yourself in charge of decisions regarding someone else that can only cause problems.

Yes they could make the wrong choice but you have to give them the freedom to make that wrong choice and can't just always take control "for their own good".

It still works because she wants friends she cares for her friends she doesn't want to hurt them but she struggles with relationships I think so it can be compelling to see her navigate them and rewarding when she succeeds. And I don't just mean romance but also friendship.

I think it might have helped if instead of becoming friends with Ron and Harry immediately after Troll incident she got closer overtime. She still helped them but she wasn't as close to them as they were to each other till maybe 4th year. You can see more of her struggle to make friends and get better at it over time and find her people. And be happy because you see how much it means to her.
