Her flaws definitely shine through in her relationships. Her thing with Ron for example is also partly because of how stubborn she can be. There's also her incredibly tumultuous relationship with Luna. Relationships are definitely not her strong suit!

My favorite of her flaws though is when people call her out for being a self-sacrificing idiot. People bullying her into resting, and worrying about how hard she works herself is something I really love to read. One of her biggest flaws for me is how she never asks for help, and I love seeing people challenge her belief that she has to do it alone.
