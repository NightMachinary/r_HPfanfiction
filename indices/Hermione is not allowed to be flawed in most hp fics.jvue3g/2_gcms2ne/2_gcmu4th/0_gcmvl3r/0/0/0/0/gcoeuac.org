One for Ron sure. But fir Hermione, I was thinking more in the lines of Neville Longbottom, Buckbeak and Hagrid, and just generally, her part in Horcrux Hunt. Her actions aren't as grand as Ron's, but it's definitely more consistent.

Also, my bad. I misunderstood. (Or more like I didn't want to see it ðŸ˜…)

Full disclosure, I was that kid. I did well in most subjects without ever actually trying. Not in the level of Hermione, but well enough that doing well was a huge part of my identity.

That said, I'm extremely distrusting when people write those kinds of plots. I'd love to see a well-written version, but for the most part, the current fics just use that detail for "putting her in her place" (again, your comment on how bashers have gone crazy with Hermione's flaws). They aren't compassionate or nuanced takes on how she would react and how she would learn from it. It gets nasty, and my personal investment means that I get very visceral reactions to the nastiness.

Anyway, this is my long-winded way of saying that I have a pavlovian response to those fics (and stories like that in general) now, and I've learned not to touch them with 10-foot pole ðŸ˜…

I do believe that there is much potential for interesting and complex exploration. Hermione working herself to death to regain her former standing sounds like the logical conclusion of this scenario (along with bouts of jealousy and temper big enough to make Ron proud). Maybe a panic attack or two at the lost standing? Massive feelings of failure too as well as terrifying amounts of impostor syndrome. God, I feel so cheated now. It would have been amazing if done well.
