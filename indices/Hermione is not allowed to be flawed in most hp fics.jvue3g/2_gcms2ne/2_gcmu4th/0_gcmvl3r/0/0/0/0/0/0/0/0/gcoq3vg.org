I know you already talked about house-elves somewhere in this thread so I'm going to link

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26712235][The House-Elf Dilemma]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/OldSwinburne/pseuds/OldSwinburne][OldSwinburne]]

  - The entire thing was really all about Hermione refining her House-Elf advocacy

  - It's house-elf subplot was also pretty great
  - Fair warning about Ron being called out (not bashed though)
