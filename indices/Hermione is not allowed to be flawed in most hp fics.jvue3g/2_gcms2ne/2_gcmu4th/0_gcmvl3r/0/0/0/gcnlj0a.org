I was basing the Ron part on his first instinct was jumping in front of Sirius to be like gotta kill me to kill Harry and also sending himself to die in chess game in the first book. Not that he has no selfish interests but he has that self sacrifice tendency in dangerous situations.

And as for the intelligence thing I know alot of people who put their self worth in being the smart one and then struggled in situations where they weren't. Like say when they got to college and struggled in classes.

They took it worse than people who weren't as skilled in school as them. Sometimes that even led to actually doing poorer in classes not because they don't understand the material but because they were too freaked out during the test.

I think it would have been good growth for Hermione not to be the best at a subject that she wants to be good in or even really struggle in it. And then accept that not being the smartest in every subject doesn't take away from her value or intelligence.

Or even like have the half blood prince book not be Snapes or the spells really being useful and come from a unique understanding of the material this person had and Hermione didn't and those spells becoming useful later. Leading people to focus more on Hermione's reaction to the book instead of making the book bad in any way.
