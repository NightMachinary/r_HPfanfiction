I disagree with Ron being the self-sacrificing one. He's definitely got a huge selfish streak (but then again, so did Hermione).

But yes in Hermione's insecurity about not being the smartest in the room! I really hate that the fics that address that are bashing ones by the way. They frame it as her not being as smart as she thinks she is and therefore free game in their quest to take her down a peg.

I also find it really sad how much of her identity is being smart, and by extension of that, being USEFUL. I'd kill for a fic where someone sits her down and just spends time to reassure her that they still love her even if she can't solve all the problems in the world. I'd love a Post-War fic where she's dealing with the idea that she's pretty much got nothing to offer Harry anymore, and just trying to make problems because she can't fathom any other reason for why he might stay by her.

I know people got annoyed at the Prince Book conflict in HBP because she was snooty and she annoyed Harry, but I have deep compassion for the kid who was made to believe that she only had value for as long as she was smart and of use. It makes my heart hurt.
