I don't think she's as self sacrificing as some others. Ron's the more self sacrificing one in my opinion.

But never asking for help or really discussing her plans before she runs off is definitely one. Like in chamber of secrets instead of being like wait I read something in a book somewhere about this thing that could be the monster I think its a giant snake in the plumbing forgot the name hold on lemme go get a book , she instead just runs off. Could be better if she just talked to them first. But again communication not her strong suit. Kind of goes back to her relationship troubles.

I think insecurity also maybe a bit one. One I wish was addressed more was her issue with not being the smart one. You only really get to see it half blood prince where the 16 year old who took notes in the book seems to know more than her and she gets salty towards the book. Hermione is smart and she will always be smart. But she won't always be the most knowledgeable about every subject ever or best at everything regarding like research and studying.

But she's kind of known as the smart one so I can see her face issues if she comes across a situation where someone else may know more than her in a certain thing and come to terms with the fact that not always knowing the most is ok and she has value outside of being the smart one.
