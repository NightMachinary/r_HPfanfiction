I definitely agree. I think half the problem with Hermione is that you need to do a lot of digging to get to her actual flaws. The books had unfortunately never actually deep into her internal life, and the movies are even worse. It takes a lot of effort to build a story where Hermione's flaws feel organic than it would if someone is writing character arcs for Harry and Ron. If you actually want to explore Hermione's flaws in good faith, you'd have to work to even figure out what they are.

Then the other half of the problem is that the flaws you may dig up are actually */very hard/* to write well.

I'd argue that her most obvious flaws don't tend to make for huge character development-worthy problems. She is annoying yes. She can be accidentally insensitive. She's also like a dog with a bone when she thinks someone is wrong. But it takes a whole lot of creativity to turn these things into huge mistakes that would lead to character development. This is especially true if the other characters are her friends and know about said flaws and work with them already.

I'm honestly trying really hard to imagine a scenario where her being accidentally insensitive causes a problem bigger than a minor tiff, but I'm coming up empty. There are more opportunities for her stubbornness like her fights with Ron and alienating Luna, but it's hard to manipulate that in a way that makes way for big mistakes (unless we are talking about romance stories in which yes, that would be a big problem. Watching her learn to compromise might be fun though.)

Her other flaws have a tendency to harm herself more than anyone else. There's her tendency towards overburdening over-exerting herself at the expense of her health. There's her own savior complex that, while much subtler that Harry's, definitely matches if not exceeds his in intensity. There is also her tendency towards self-isolation when a problem occurs for her. Her low self-esteem and insecurities has her putting so much pressure on herself.

Now these flaws can /definitely/ be turned into huge character-building moments, but like you, a lot of people think of character development as causing problems for others. Chances are people wouldn't count these as flaws at all, and many writers don't consider them when trying to write her. Moreover, if they are used, you will have to be ready to fend off cries of "Mary Sue".

And then there is the third category of her flaws which would include her vindictiveness and manipulativeness that, while interesting, are so hard to manage without going full dark!Hermione. They /definitely/ have the ability to hurt other people, but they are hard to pull off without making her look completely evil.

Anyway, all of this is to say that writing a flawed Hermione is arguably considerably harder than writing a flawed Harry or Ron. Her flaws are subtle and complicated, especially as it interacts with her strengths and her role in the story.

Focusing on her being annoying kind of leaves a bad taste in people's mouths when they know full well that her heart is in the right place and the other characters would probably use what she had found later. No one considers self-destruction to be a proper consequence of said character flaws. And her vindictiveness and manipulation are hard to paint as flaws when they are saving their lives.

Harry getting someone killed through his impulsiveness is easy to imagine. Ron blowing up on someone who doesn't deserve it is easy to see too. But */Hermione/* */takes work/*, and sadly not a lot of authors are up to the challenge. The ones who have taken these flaws in stride are unfortunately the bashers who don't actually have to work on being faithful to her character.

Striking the right balance between flawed, perfect, and bashed is a chore and a half given the way Hermione was built a character.
