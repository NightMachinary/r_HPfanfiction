One of my favorite Harry/Hermione fics, [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]], she has flaws the same way Harry has flaws in canon (ie, she is more stubborn than Harry and less willing to forgive, she suffers from vertigo, and well... pretty shit at politics honestly). They are not major flaws, but no more than Harry's impulsiveness is in canon.

There are certainly fics that take the more stereotypical flaws (Tone-deafness and crusading for Hermione, Jealously and short temper for Ron), crank them up to 11, and then have the characters recover/get better, but they are the exception as most fics that crank those up to 11 just bash :P.
