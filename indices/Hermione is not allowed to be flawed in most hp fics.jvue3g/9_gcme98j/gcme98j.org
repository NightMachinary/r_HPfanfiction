Most of the "flaws that have an impact" scenes I've read feel convoluted and forced to me. I usually have the impression that they are more driven by a need to put a character down than any actual character development. Whether that's Ron's jealousy or Hermione's need to be correct or Harry's impulsivness, it feels forced and not really realistic to me - the big moment when a person changes.

That can work in stories where the main conflict is an inner conflcit - where the main enemy to overcome is the chracter's own falw - but in a story centred on defeating Voldemort/the Ministry/Grindelwald/a magical plague/etc? It feels forced to me - just some side story to check the "flawed character" box.

Further, I often feel such scenes are unrealistic. People are flawed, but we generally can control our flaws to function. Or learn to live with them without some big catharsis or catastrophe and angsty soul-searching.

So, I prefer to write my characters with having flaws, and keeping them - or at least part of them. My Ron will still have some self-esteem issues at the end of a story, Hermione will still have issues admititng a mistake, and Harry's still too impuslive - but on a manageable level.

Also, many of us have family, friends and lovers with flaws, and won't call them out for it. In my current story, Ron's very much aware of Hermione's flaws - the need to be always right, the urge to do everything herself, the way she blames herself for everything that goes wrong - but he won't call her out on it because she's not perfect and he accepts that, Some might not tolerate her - or him - but they do, and love each other. Despite their flaws. And without the flaws having "impact".

Sometimes, growing means accepting that you or someone else won't grow out of certain flaws.
