That whole arc with the book felt so stupid to me. Hermione, Ms "take notes and read up", thinks its cheating to use a book? Yeah, right. She'd have borrowed the book for a weekend and copied/learned everything in it. I consider the whole episode OOC stupidity to manufacture conflict. In the same vein as suddenly, no one but Harry suspects Draco to be up to something - plain shitty "The plot demands this" writing there.

The last two books are full of that kind of stupidity I loathe. I don't want nor need such manufactured drama and trouble - just play the enemies straight instead of as idiots and the characters have all the trouble they need and then some.
