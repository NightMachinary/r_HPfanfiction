  To be fair, Harry was completely wrong about Sirius was being held at the Department of Mysteries. Hermione rightly warned him it was a trap but he didn't listen and it nearly cost them their lives, so its easy to see why Ron and Hermione were less eager to jump on Harry's "Draco is a Death Eater" plot less than six months later. If Sirius truly was at the DOM like Harrry said, I reckon Ron and Hermione definitely would have taken Harry more seriously in HBP.
