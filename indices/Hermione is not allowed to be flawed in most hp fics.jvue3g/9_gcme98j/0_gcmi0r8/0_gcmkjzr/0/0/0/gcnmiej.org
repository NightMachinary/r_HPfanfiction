  In the same vein as suddenly, no one but Harry suspects Draco to be up to something - plain shitty "The plot demands this" writing there.

To be fair, Harry was completely wrong about Sirius was being held at the Department of Mysteries. Hermione rightly warned him it was a trap but he didn't listen and it nearly cost them their lives, so its easy to see why Ron and Hermione were less eager to jump on Harry's "Draco is a Death Eater" plot less than six months later. If Sirius truly was at the DOM like Harrry said, I reckon Ron and Hermione definitely would have taken Harry more seriously in HBP.

Also, the main reason people doubted Harry was because they didn't understand Voldemort at all. They assumed that Voldemort:

- Was a logical genius who only let skilled adults become Death Eaters.

- Would deem Draco unworthy of the Dark Mark.

- Expected Draco to actually have a decent chance of succeeding at his task.

- Wouldn't trust Draco with an important task like killing Dumbledore.

- Would want to personally kill Dumbledore out of his own pride.

In-universe, Voldemort was far different than most characters expected. The reality was actually that Voldemort:

- Would give people the Dark Mark regardless of their age (i.e. Regulus, and maybe Crouch Jr).

- Didn't give people the Dark Mark for being competent (i.e. gave Wormtail the Dark Mark despite deeming him weak).

- Didn't give a shit if Draco failed, and hoped he would fail to punish the Malfoys more.

- Didn't care who killed Dumbledore so long as he was out of the way.

If anything, it just proves that Harry knows Voldemort's thought process far better than the vast majority of wizards did; definitely more than Ron, Hermione, Mr Weasley, and McGonagall. Its not so much that they thought Harry was lying, but they assumed certain things about Voldemort that---as reasonable as they may sound---don't hold up from the perspective of the reader.

*TL;DR: Harry wasn't taken seriously because most people assumed Voldemort wouldn't trust a kid to be a Death Eater. Aside from Snape and Dumbledore, nobody who disbelieved Harrry about Draco actually knew what Voldemort would or wouldn't do.*
