I do think Hermione would be someone who does tie her self worth a bit to her intelligence and being the smart one. She would react not well to potentially loosing that status or it being irrelevant in any way and it would be a good growth for her realizing that she has worth beyond her intelligence and being the "smart one".

That being said...ya I think it was a pretty dumb way to depict it and pointless if it wasn't going to be explored anyway.
