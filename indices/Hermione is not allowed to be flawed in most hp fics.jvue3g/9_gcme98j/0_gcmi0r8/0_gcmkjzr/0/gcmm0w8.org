Oh I think I may have phrased things weird. I didn't mean Hermione necessarily hates to be in the wrong. That could be a flaw you give her and debatable but I mean more that Hermione isn't allowed to be wrong in the narrative in a way that has consequences.

Like for example using a canon example. Hermione is a bit low key jealous of the half blood prince book considers it cheating and isn't all that happy that this other 16 year old ( Snape isn't 16 but the notes are from when he was) is somehow figuring out these weird improvements that she wouldn't even consider. So she kinda sours on that book even before the sectumsempra incident.

So she's basically being salty because she's perhaps a bit jealous and insecure that's kind of where this is coming from. But that doesn't really matter in the story because she's right that author was sketchy because it was Snape. The source of her suspicion is irrelevant. Exploring that "flaw" becomes kinda pointless because it caused no real harm long term.

If she was wrong that book owner wasn't sketchy or that book ended up having useful info but the other two got suspicious of it because of Hermione that would be a negative consequence to a flaw she had.

That flaw would actually be addressed then and maybe you'd get something like Hermione not always the smartest but she is still smart and has worth beyond being the smart one and learning that would help with the insecurity some. As like a potential example.

As for functional I mean they are a bunch of traumatized teenagers trying to overthrow a wizard nazi who hijacks the government and trying to start a mass genocide. I think if they were a little less than functional that would make alot of sense.

Like Ron leaving in book 7 ya him leaving caused them alot of problems. Ya he left due in part to issues in regards to his own baggage. But he was also confused scared just got splinched hadnt been able to be healed properly and scared for his sister being in a school being run by death eaters and being punished by being sent to the forest and was wearing a horcrux. You can see why that could have brought out the worst in him. You can see why that worst would cause problems.

But then can also appreciate that he fought back and the difficulty of that considering his inner turmoil and understand that this might have been something he'd be less capable of when he was younger. And all that doesn't change that he was wrong for leaving. The narrative doesn't absolve him for that just makes it understandable that he did. Maybe even make him sympathetic but still in need of a call out.

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of that moment cuz Ron also left after a big fight with Harry in book 4 so it feels repetitive. But I can appreciate the the other aspects.
