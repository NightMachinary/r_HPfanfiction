See, there I disaagree. If you're fighting Voldemort, teamwork matters - and Hermione hating to be wrong won't matter because with the Dark Lord out there, you just roll with that flaw instead of making a drama out of it. Making a big drama out of it in a story is exactly what I'd call forced and convoluted. If Hermione can't reign in herself when working against Voldemort and the others can't tolerate her attitude in turn, then they aren't functional, sane characters but caraciatures, IMHO.
