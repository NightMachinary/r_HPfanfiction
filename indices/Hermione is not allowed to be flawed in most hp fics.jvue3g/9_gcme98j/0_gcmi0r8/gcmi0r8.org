I mean for sure everyone has " flaws " and many of those flaws don't go away all the time. Sometimes you just get better at handling them in certain situations.

Do you for example get frustrated very easily at certain things? Has this always been a problem? Well if its yes for both you probably handle that frustration differently now than when you were 11. Many would argue you handle it better now than before. Storywise that would be considered character growth.

That "flaw" may never go away but you did self work to handle it better. The struggle to handle things can be engaging and make a character feel more sympathetic. When you improve even a little its compelling to the reader because they know the struggle they saw it explored they saw you improve. So its meaningful.

But for that to happen you need those flaws to matter. If they are dismissed,not a big deal, and don't really negatively effect you or important people in the story, and all people who call them out are in the wrong, then those flaws don't matter. That struggle to improve at all is kinda meaningless. Nothing really changes if you improve its not a big deal.

There are ways to make it work I think even in big plot stories depending on how its done. But if its done badly, like is overly exaggerated or like the flaw impacts things that don't really matter in the story but suddenly becomes a big deal. I agree it just seems contrived and I do think alot of the time Hermione being called out feels like that in things I've read anyway.

But I have seen other characters get flaws explored in compelling meaningful ways in fics so I do think it should be possible for her too.

Hermione's flaws I agree are more intrapersonal ones rather than like a thing that would impact like trying to overthrow Voldy more directly. But as long as intrapersonal relationships matter in that overthrow Voldemort story that flaw can still matter . Because they still need to work well together. If the relationships or teamwork doesn't really matter in the story then it would be a bad idea exploring Hermione's flaws in that story
