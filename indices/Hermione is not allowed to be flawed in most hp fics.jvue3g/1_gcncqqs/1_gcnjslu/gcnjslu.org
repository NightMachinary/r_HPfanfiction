Indeed. Also, a lot of the complaitns about "flawless Hermione" come from the stories where she's just the love interest of Harry the Hero - and not only seen through his eyes, so to speak, but also airbrushed into the perfect girlfriend. In some cases, Harry the Hero can make her overcome her perceived flaws with some lesson, scolding or pep talk.

I don't really recall a Hermione POV story where she's described as this perfect witch people complain about. It's pretty easy to write her flaws if you write in her POV - but most of her flaws won't really take centre stage even then because they're not really important.
