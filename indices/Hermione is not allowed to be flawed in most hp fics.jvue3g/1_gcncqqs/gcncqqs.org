Glib answer: Fics or it didn't happen.

--------------

More seriously, for Hermione's flaws to be consequential, her decisions must be consequential in the first place. How many fics do you know in which Hermione's decisions are consequential as opposed to those in which she has no real agency?

--------------

Even more seriously, the problem is that her canon flaws (as opposed to her fanon flaws) are complex and are virtues half the time.

For example, if a character's flaw is that they are impulsive, that's easy to write, and it's easy to show the character suffering the consequences of that flaw and working to overcome it. However, Hermione's flaws tend to be more along the lines of her thinking that she knows what's best for everyone, and being willing to ruthlessly impose what she thinks is best on them whether they want it or not. To write the consequences of that sort of flaw, the author needs to set up complex, long-term scenarios, with complex dialogue and characterisation---all without detracting from the "A" story.

This also comes back to the point about agency. The scenarios in question would require the author to give Hermione power over important characters and events and then have her wield that power deliberately. Again, how many fics actually give Hermione power over others and have her use it?

This is further complicated by this flaw actually being a virtue---a part of what we call "leadership"---a lot of the time, because Hermione does accomplish a lot. Indeed, a whole lot of WBWL/Gray!Powerful!Independent!Harry fics actually treat this very flaw as a virtue when Harry does it.
