Thank you for this! Hermione's flaws are complicated because they interact and intersect with her strengths. The biggest trouble with writing her is that to be faithful to her character, you will have to show /both/ the strengths and weaknesses of whatever flaw it is you choose. If you choose one of the other, you will accidentally turn her perfect or evil. Because that is the nature of Hermione's characters.

You already pointed out her propensity for manipulation and how it doubles as leadership. There is also her stubbornness which, while off-putting, doubles as tenacity especially when paired with her lost causes. There is her single-mindedness which had given her blinders, true, but they also managed to get the team extremely important information when they needed it the most.

Hermione is a very complicated character. Her strengths /are/ her flaws, and most writers do not manage to straddle that line well.
