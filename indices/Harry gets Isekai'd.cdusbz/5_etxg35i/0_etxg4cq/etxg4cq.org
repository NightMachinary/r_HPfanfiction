#+begin_quote
  A hero was NOT what he wanted to be after being turned into the Magical society's clean up wizard. He was far too jaded to be one anymore. So when he gets summoned to save yet another world from destruction, needless to say he wasn't pleased one bit. He knows where a hero's path leads, and he wants no part of it. Too bad they aren't giving him much of a choice.
