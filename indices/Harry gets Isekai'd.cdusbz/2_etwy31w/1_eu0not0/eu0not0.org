[[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Warcraft-Crossovers/224/1035/?&srt=4&r=10&len=10&c2=1][Look here]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6348826/1/The-Black-Scorpion][The Black Scorpion]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster][Wizard Runemaster]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10005918/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Whole-New-World-Rising-from-the-Ashes][Harry Potter and the Whole New World: Rising from the Ashes]] are my favorites Harry in azeroth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13303484/1/Is-It-Wrong-To-Want-To-Conquer-The-World-During-My-Isekai-Adventure][Is It Wrong To Want To Conquer The World During My Isekai Adventure?]] - This is a extra. It is not an HP in Azeroth. It is a Menma in Azeroth. The only reason why I recommend it is because the author writes very well, and they are updating it periodically.
