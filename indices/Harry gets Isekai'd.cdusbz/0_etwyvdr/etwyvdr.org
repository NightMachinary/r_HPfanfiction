Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

It's a Lord of the Rings crossover where Harry is summoned by a King during the fall of Anor.

Only that king is the Witch King. And he had been trying to summon the Master of Death, the dark god Melkor. Sauron's old boss. Oops!
