Ao3's readership is very disproportionately LGBT, if that's what you're trying to get at. It's called “archive of our own” for a reason. (Although that's probably not exactly what the name is referring to). It's also common for female authors to write slash, and you'd also find readers skew female more on Ao3 than other sites.
