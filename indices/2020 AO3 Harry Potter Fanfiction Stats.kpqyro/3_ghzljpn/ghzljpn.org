I find it interesting how different some of the stats become when only factoring in new fics. I maintain a somewhat similar list myself, but for top30 Ao3 HP ships of all time. [[http://home.fiq.se/top30.txt]]

Speaking of stats, any idea what happened with Remadora at some point in the earlier half of 2020? Between early January and June, the total fics with the ship went /down/ by 215. I have no idea why this is.

EDIT: According to my own tracking, Romione overtook Snarry in November. Are you tracking "restricted" fics (those who need you to login to see)? Because I do, which would explain the discrepancy.
