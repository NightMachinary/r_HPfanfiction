To consider the true limits i think we should consider the origins of the room. I like to think that the room of requirement is created by the ambient magic of Hogwarts and grows stronger and stronger with each new generation. So following that line of thought, Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration is out. It cannot obviously summon or create anyone or anything outside the premises.

On the other hand, it could be created by the founders themselves as a helping aid to any student in need and as a last defense mechanism in Hogwarts. Or it could very well be Ravenclaw's secret chamber.

I don't think it can create books or potion ingredients or the like. I think it merely summons a copy of the book required. In a fic I read the room provided Ravenclaw's library when asked for one and the library contained a copy of every book anyone has brought in Hogwarts premises. That seems possible and quite interesting.

I think the room can do everything magic is capable of doing. Or maybe it's the heart of Hogwarts and it's magic, doing its bidding and providing help to the students.
