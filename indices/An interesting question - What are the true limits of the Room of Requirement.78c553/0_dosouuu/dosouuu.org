One fic I read had an interesting premise - if something was in the castle, the room could summon it (explains those defence books and furniture). Also it postulated that, barring things in the castle, everything else it summoned was an illusion (that could not be dispelled because Ravenclaw built the room). A bit like a limited holodeck. So, say, you could summon a swimming pool, but not an actual beach with palm trees. I like this interpretation.

I know fics have used the Room in ludicrously OP ways - like in Miranda Flairgold's fic, Harry uses the room to freeze time and train for years (hello, isolation-caused madness). I don't like this interpretation. If an author wants an outlandish magical solution he should invent his own, instead of using the Room like a lazy bag of dirt.
