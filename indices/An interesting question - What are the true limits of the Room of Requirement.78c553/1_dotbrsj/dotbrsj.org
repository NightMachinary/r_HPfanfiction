Some stories (as T0lias already mentioned) hold that it merely summons items (or copies of items) found elswhere in the castle. Certainly, there's some appeal to the idea.

For me, the Room was created by Rowena Ravenclaw and is her equivalent of the Chamber of Secrets (what became the Headmaster's Office was Godric Gryffindor's room, the Elves' common room was Helga Hufflepuff's). It can Transfigure anything that is required of its owners, based on a wish-extrapolation mechanism not unlike the one Nicholas Flamel put in the Mirror of Erised.

Of course, Gamp's Law means it cannot create food, nor truly living organic beings, though I'm not sure it couldn't make an artificial sentient construct a la Sorting Hat. It also extends to medication --- you can't just wish up a cure for cancer and get a room filled with anti-cancer pills. It can't be used to create knowledge either --- if asked for a library, the books will be copies of the books in the Hogwarts Library as well as any other books that may be in Hogwarts at the moment.

Whenever someone leaves an object behind when departing a version of the Room, that object ends up in the Room of Hidden Things, and may be called upon for a version of the Room, if the semi-intelligent enchantments feel that the 'true' object would be a better match than what it could Transfigure.

Two versions of the Room cannot coexist within the same timeframe. The Room will be inaccessible from the outside as long as the person who initially wished its opening is inside.

For me, Voldemort hid the Diadem in a version of the room he'd wished up to be "A room for hiding a precious object, such that the object may not be summoned by anybody else". He wasn't an idiot. So wishing for "A room containing Voldemort's Horcrux" wouldn't have worked. However, as per White Squirrel's clever idea, asking for the Room of Hidden Things is essentially 'root access' --- it's not just another version of the Room, but its 'unenchanted' state.
