My personal theory is that the room was enchanted to perform magic on and using the objects left in it. Rowena does this to the best of her ability, and creates the room to take advantage of her diadem, which enhances the creativity and wisdom of the wearer, but when used by the room creates a pseudo-sentience akin to the sorting hat.

As the diadem is lost and Hogwarts ages, the room is not sentient and reverts to it's natural state - merely a room that summons specific objects (like a hammock) rather than fulfilling dynamic requests (like a place to sleep). The room only regains full functionality when the diadem is hidden in the room by Riddle.
