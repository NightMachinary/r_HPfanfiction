I haven't read a story with glamour charms in it in a long time, but aren't they used to blur and mask/create an illusion rather than actually changing the appearance? Or am just misremembering this?

If that's the case, any fan fic author can write it in as a minor version of the Disillusionment Charm, I guess.
