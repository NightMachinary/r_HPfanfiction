Okay, then how do you explain being so easy to change someone's hair color?\\
Or Fred and George making several sweets that alter the body's characteristics?

The truth of the matter is that having "Glamours" or Charms to alter one or more things about appearances(most of them are just changing eye and hair color, perhaps hair length) is completely in line with what we see in the series, and don't go against canon at all.

Polyjuice is very, very powerful, it makes someone look exactly like other person, scars, voice and all.

Methamorphmagus is also incredibly powerful.

Most "Glamour" Charms we see in fandom are completely believable color changes with some added stuff like changing hair length style, I really don`t see how this is against canon.
