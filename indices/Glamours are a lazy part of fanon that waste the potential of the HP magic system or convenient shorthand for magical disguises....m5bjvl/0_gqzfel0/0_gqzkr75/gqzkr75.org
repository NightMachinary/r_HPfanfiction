The thing is, they do affect the user's appearance. While this does delve a bit deeper into fanfic than a canon-centric discussion, I read rather good fanfic that explored how objects are enchanted. It turned out that the metamorph-medals weren't fakes; they were only really underpowered. The enchantment was there; it was just too weak to do much of anything. Pity I can't remember it; I'd like to reread it. Does anyone have a link?
