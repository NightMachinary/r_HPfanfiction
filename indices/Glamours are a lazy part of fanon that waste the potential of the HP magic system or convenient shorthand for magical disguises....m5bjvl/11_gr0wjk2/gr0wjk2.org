Isn't a glamour how Grindelwald posed as Graves in Fantastic Beasts?

Overall I think they serve a purpose, but should be nerfed so that only extremely powerful wizards can pull them off to disguise themselves convincingly, like Dumbledore level powerful. Below that power level, so for that majority of magicals, they should mainly just be used to hide a scar or make someone look less pale, etc in my opinion
