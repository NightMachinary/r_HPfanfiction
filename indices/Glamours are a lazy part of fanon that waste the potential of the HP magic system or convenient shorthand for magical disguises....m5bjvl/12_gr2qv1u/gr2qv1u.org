I usually use "glamour" as a name for the field of magical disguise at large rather than one specific spell for this exact reason.

So for example, using a touch of polyjuice to shift your features, then changing the color of your eyes via illusion and transfiguring your hair into an intricately spelled braid would be a valid process to apply the word "glamour" to.

There's also three "categories" which glamour spells will usually exploit:

- Perception, which is the use of magic for illusion of the senses of others. The strength of illusions is their unbreakability, as you don't /actually/ disguise yourself, rendering it immune to enchantments like the thief's downfall and all manner of counterspell. Conversely, their weakness is that users of the mind arts can recognize illusions and see through them with ease.

- Reality, which is the use of magic to shift the physical matter of your body into a desired form. Its strength is the ability to withstand the mind arts and all things that rely on exposing perceptual inconsistencies, but its weakness is that it can be countered with magic. Hitting someone with a general counterspell is very taboo however, as lots of people use magic to hold their clothes together.

- Metamorphosis, which is all manners of shapeshifting. I usually hc shapeshifting to be the ability to bring the soul and the body into unison, which shifts the body as the soul does. Its strength is that if the metorph is good, they can fool basically anything. Even dementors can't see through a shapeshift, as for all intents and purposes, the shapeshiftee /becomes/ what they are, body and soul. Its weakness is that the process of becoming a shapeshifter is extremely dangerous to the body and soul alike.

I really like grouping things into the trinity of Body-Mind-Soul.
