I fail to see from your description how it "violates a huge amount of what we see in canon when it comes to disguising yourself magically".

It is extremely easy to justify the existence of glamours in a canon/canon-adjacent work, while still having the three main methods you describe as the primary ones used. How? Simple, by looking at the first point of glamours you describe... that they're easily dispellable.

In my mind, glamours fit fairly well within charms already. There's a color changing charm, concealment charms, disillusion... Why not a glamour, then? Illusion magic doesn't seem out of place in the Harry Potter world, and having it be a more temporary/easier to detect or dispell type of magic explains enough of why it's not used too commonly.

Also to note on human transfiguration, that is likely not the only way to use magic to change hair color - its difficulty doesn't mean that a color-changing charm, for instance, would be as difficult. Simply that the method for human transfiguration is much more difficult. Harry was supposed to use it in his Charm OWL to change a rat's color, so we know it can be used on living creatures.
