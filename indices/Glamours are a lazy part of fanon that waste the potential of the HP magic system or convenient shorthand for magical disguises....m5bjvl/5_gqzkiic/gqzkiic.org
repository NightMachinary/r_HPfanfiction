I think the only example in canon of someone using a non-polyjuice disguise is whatever Hermione did to Ron when they broke into Gringotts. It was probably a form of human transfiguration though.

I like the idea of glamours being essentially the magical equivalent of makeup. You can make some small changes to how you look (adding or changing colors, hiding blemishes and wrinkles, small alterations to facial structure, and so on), but you can't really disguise yourself. Or at least not any better than a muggle stage makeup artist could, which might be good enough, depending on what you need to do.
