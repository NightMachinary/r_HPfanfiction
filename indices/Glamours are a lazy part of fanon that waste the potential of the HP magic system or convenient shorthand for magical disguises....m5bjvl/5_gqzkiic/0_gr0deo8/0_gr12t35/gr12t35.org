Sure, but it will take them a lot of time, effort, and skill to actually make you unrecognizable. And if that's also true for glamours, that's fine by me. Besides, if all you want is to not be recognized, you could just put on (or magically grow) a fake beard and some glasses and maybe change your hairstyle.

But makeup artists will still have a lot of trouble making you look exactly like a specific person, and there's even less they can do about height, weight, posture, voice, and so on. So makeup and/or glamours still shouldn't be a replacement for polyjuice.
