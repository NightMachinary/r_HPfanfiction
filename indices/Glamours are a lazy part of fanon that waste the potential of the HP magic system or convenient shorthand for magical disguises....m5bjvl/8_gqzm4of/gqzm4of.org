From all the fics I've read, glamour charms:

1. Are only an illusion- they just make your appearance seem a particular way- they don't change your appearance.

   1. Wear off pretty soon. Characters have to reapply them several times.

2. Are easily detectable. They're often described as 'shimmery', and I'm sure than if a character was focused enough, they could probably deduce that our character was wearing a glamour.

Also, most fics just show the person wearing a glamour to simply cover up a scar or something.

-Polyjuice turns your body + voice into someone else's. Not the same thing as a glamour, that just simply changes a small part of your appearance.

-Human Transfiguration gives you that particular characteristic- For example, if you want to make your eyebrows green, the transfiguration actually /makes/ your eyebrows green, unlike glamours, that just make your eyebrows /seem/ green. They also wear of pretty soon, I think.

Metamorphmagus abilities, I'm pretty sure, are just human transfiguration skills minus the 'wearing off soon' part. Not exactly like a glamour.
