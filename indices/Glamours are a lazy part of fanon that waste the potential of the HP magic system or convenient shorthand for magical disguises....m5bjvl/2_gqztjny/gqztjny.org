In a system with more difficult, harder-to-detect methods of disguise, I usually look at Glamour Charms as the really shite version - basically the magical equivalent of using the longer parts of your hair to pretend you have a beard.

Anyone with a brain will notice you're using one, but if you have a good plan and can distract them from paying full attention to you, you can pass unrecognised. Equally, if you're really good with them, you can use a lot of them to change your appearance considerably (but most people aren't that good - people like that internet woman who turned herself into Jack Sparrow are rare indeed).
