I don't really see why you're pressed. Seems like potions and transfiguration have ways to disguise you, each with their own pros and cons, why can't charms? I've never seen a glamor where it didn't have some kind of limitation, so it's use is practical. It “violating” canon disguises sounds a lot more like it just isn't canon, and if you're so hell bent on following canon exactly why are you reading fan fiction?
