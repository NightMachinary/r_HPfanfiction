The idea of glamours for altering appearance was in Laurell K Hamilton's Merry Gentry series, back in 2000. Glamours were a form of fay magic that could alter appearances. Not sure if Hamilton borrowed it in turn from somewhere else. I always assumed that there was some early fanfic writer who read Hamilton's books and decided to use that in a story.
