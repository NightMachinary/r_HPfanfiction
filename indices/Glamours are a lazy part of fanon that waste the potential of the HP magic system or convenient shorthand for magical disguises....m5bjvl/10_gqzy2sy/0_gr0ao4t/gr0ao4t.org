Disillusionment I could see, but expansion charms and the fidelius? Not at all, for expansion charms we know for a fact that they are actually bigger on the inside, not they are that big but just look small. And for the fidelius it isnt that the charm disguises the building from anyone not in on the Secret, it is literally that they do not know that building is there, which is a weirdly subtle difference but an important one imo.
