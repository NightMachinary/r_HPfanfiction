Counterpoint: We have the Disillusionment Charm that sounds very much like a glamour, or Anti-Muggle charms, or even the Fidelius and Expansion charms might be qualified as elaborate glamours. Glamours are just the kind of cool old faerie magic that I like seeing in my fiction, and the author can give them all sorts of believable negative side effects that make the above options more appealing (and it also helps explain how magic is hidden from the rest of the world).

1. Glamours might require something like constant or frequent concentration.
2. Glamours only work if the people you are disguised from /believe/ it's working, similar to a Bogart's reliance on your fear. Someone like Moody would see right through the disguise and render it useless.
3. Short effect or limited changes. Glamour can only do so much, like change your hair, eye, or skin color but can't do much more.
4. They could be inordinately difficult to cast.

I like my magic systems having big flaws that often cause more problems than they solve, like a character using a glamour only to be overconfident and they get caught anyway. I have no problem with anything people come up with in FF as long as it doesn't become a "get out of trouble free" card.

TL;DR I think it's all about how it is implemented.
