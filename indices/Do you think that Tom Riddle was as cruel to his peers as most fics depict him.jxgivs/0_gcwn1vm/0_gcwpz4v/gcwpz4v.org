I see what you are saying... I think for most of us it's really difficult to write a charismatic leader since many of us aren't charismatic leaders. It's easier to write a tyrant because deep down we all think of all the bad things we would do to those who piss us off. I think even Voldemort was intended initially to be the evil antagonist in a children's book who happened to have some servants. However, I like how Grindelwald was written. If you are on his side, he is a really likable person but he won't hesitate to kill you if you stand in his way. I'm a bit sad that Johnny Depp was fired because he really did a great job at that rally in the Lestrange Mausoleum.
