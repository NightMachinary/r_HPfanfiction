The thing is there are few fics about Voldemort in his early years of school. Regardless of whether it's time travel or not, most of them start in his fifth year when he opened the Chamber of Secrets and by which time he already had a following. It's either that writers are too lazy or because such a process is hard to write (I'll be the first to admit I'm struggling with it) but no one focuses on how he got people who think they're superior to him to follow him. I wrote the other day a comment about having read a story in which Tom Riddle seduces, manipulates and eventually rapes a professor who is also the wife of the first muggle-born head of the DMLE and then uses it to blackmail him to resign. I can't remember for the life of me the name of the story. However it's one of the few stories that depict him really charming and pleasant at first and gradually he becomes more and more abusive (and I think that's the most consistent depiction of Tom Riddle).
