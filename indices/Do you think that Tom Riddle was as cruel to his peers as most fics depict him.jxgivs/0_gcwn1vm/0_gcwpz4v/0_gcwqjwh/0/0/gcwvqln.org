A super quick cop out would be him revealing that he is a Parselmouth and the Slytherins knowing what that means. But the charming, blackmail type is probably a lot more realistic. I've dabbled with writing in the past, but I don't think I'd be able to do a Voldemort coming of age justice in the slightest. I'd suppose most writers feel the same way. That depiction I think is the most accurate, or logical. I do think speaking Parseltongue and descending from Slytherin would play a role, but short of the Indy!Harry Goblin blood test trope I have no idea how a young teen Ridde would discover that. Or potentially a Slytherin family tree similar to the Blacks?
