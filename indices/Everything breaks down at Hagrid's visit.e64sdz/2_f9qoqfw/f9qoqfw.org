Hagrid is not supposed to be using his wand since it was broked due to the Myrtle incident. It is well known that spells dont work properly when snapped but he still used it.

I can just imagine it misfiring the spell and slowly turned Dudley into a pig over the course of the day but it went so...so wrong. Imagine pig tail like growths starting to grow in various parts of the mishapen pig child. Imagine the Horror the Dursley feel knowing nothing they could do to help thier child. Imagine seeing them huddled telling Harry to do something. Blaming Harry for the incident, blaming his inability to do something about it.
