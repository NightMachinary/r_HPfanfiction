Well that was dark! Presumably, Harry starved for a while next to Hagrids' rotting body, before a burst of accidental magic saved him from dying of thirst. I expect he would be able to get some kind of message to Hogwarts, and be able to get in in time for his first school year. However, because of his family rejecting him, the blood ward failed, and he is now vulnerable to attack by Voldemort or Death Eaters.

The Death Eaters might follow a similar pattern to OotP, where they laid low for a year to re-gather allies and make plans, then they started making their move. Perhaps there would be a battle in Department of Mysteries during the events of CoS, ... Unless Lucius no longer feels any need to plant the Diary (no doubt Voldemort would keep a close eye on it), giving Harry a normal year, and unless Voldemort was only triggered to hear the prophecy at all by events in Little Hangleton. Wow, alternate history is hard.
