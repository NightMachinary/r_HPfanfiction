Funny you should say that, because the only two I could remember were both Avengers crossovers.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/586020][All Hallow's Eve - New York]] by Whispering Darkness is a fairly amusing oneshot. I'd recommend some of her other works, she does good crossovers. They're all short, though.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21311][Wanderer]] series by cywsaphyre. This one is a bit longer, but it's a WIP that hasn't been updated since 2012. Still good, though.

EDIT: For the Wanderer series, I actually read part 2 first and think that was the better way. Looking over part 1 again, it just kind of jumps right in without giving any of the background info that part 2 starts out with.
