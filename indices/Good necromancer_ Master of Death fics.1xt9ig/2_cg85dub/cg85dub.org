Those are very often crossovers. I will add that with the exception of Avengers I hadn't seen any of the other media when I read the stories, so I don't think that's a huge barrier. Don't know what you're looking for, but some ideas.

Wand and Shield (Avengers), Illusions of Grandeur (Supernatural), Raison d'Etre (Hitman Reborn), Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black (Naruto), Crestfallen (Avengers), All the Worlds a Stage (Prince of Tennis), Wanderer (Avengers), Irreperable (Avengers), all feature a Harry whose been Master of Death for a while - usually very cynical Harry, sometimes less so. Quality is variable, I put them in very rough quality order but I'm very tired (it's very late/early morning where I am) and I haven't read a few of those in a long long while.

It's a Mad, Mad World (One Piece) also has a Harry whose been Master of Death for a while, I pulled out because the Harry and feel of the story is very different. And One Bright Moment Is All I Ask all (Supernatural) I put as well, not my favorite but it's at least original so I decided to leave it in.

I might come back to this and add a few if I think of it, I probably missed a few. Also, this post is a month old, so this is more for future readers than the original poster.
