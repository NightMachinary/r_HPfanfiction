I'm not sure I've heard of anything like that, but I've pondered the idea a lot recently that he could just like... use a leave-in conditioner like brylcreem (sleakeazy would be an apparent in-world substitute product). Especially if he has to give it a rinse repeatedly throughout the day to keep potions fumes from damaging the crown of his goth style then it wouldn't ever really get to be styled better than soaked hair. And with trying to pick apart book canon and real-life subcultures of the timeperiod characters went through their formative years, like, Snape grew up in the muggle world in the 60's/70's. Greasers were a 'cool' thing then! And even traditional conservative types used similar hairproducts way back through the first half of the 20th century. Muggle popculture only really eschewed those products going into the 70's with advertising for products like hairspray mocking how 'wet' it makes hair look, which just as easily could be turned into 'greasy' by trendy kids that dislike the person for various reasons.

Similarly I feel the way Harry/James hair is described could be well applied to hair that's been stripped from overly judicious shampooing and lack of styling. I've noticed mine gets fluffy and hectic when I'm too harsh on it. And with Harry that could easily be down to Petunia not caring to instruct him on basic haircare, or even provide the means if he knew how. While with James it might be a subtle rebelliousness of not wanting to use the type of product that made the family Hair-Potion fortune. Or more like a messy somewhat 'dry' pompadour, who knows how accurate the comparisons of Harry and James' hair somehow being completely identical would be, having been mostly been given by mournful nostalgists.
