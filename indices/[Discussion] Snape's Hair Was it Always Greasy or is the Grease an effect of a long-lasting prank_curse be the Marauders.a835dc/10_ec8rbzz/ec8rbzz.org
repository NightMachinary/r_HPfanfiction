I've heard that before. It's a really sad attempt at white-washing Snape and making the Marauders seem more evil (the over arching narrative being that the Marauders drove poor innocent Snape into the arms of the Death Eaters).

The fact that he has greasy hair is clearly a dig at a lack of personal hygiene, nothing more. This is pretty consistent with how he is described physically all the time.
