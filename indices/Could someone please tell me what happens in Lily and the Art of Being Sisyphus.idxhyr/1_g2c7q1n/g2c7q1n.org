Oh, I'm so sorry that I can't help - this fic lost me on the way because of life events, but if anyone does provide a summary I will anxiously read. It's just so whack I loved it. So offbeat. I was reading it aloud from the corridor to my housemates getting ready in the bathroom one night and it was a riot, such a fond memory. I pretty much needed their politics-majors to contextualise wtf was going on. It's so postmodern it hurts. Wizard Lenin? We love him.
