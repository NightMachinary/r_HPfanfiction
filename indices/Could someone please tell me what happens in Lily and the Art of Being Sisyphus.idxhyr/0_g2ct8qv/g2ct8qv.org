Lily was mindwiped temporarily by younger Tom (can't remember the name used). He made her think she was his cousin (a Gaunt) for a while, whilst also creepily trying to woo her. Lenin went and started to restart his movement and restart the war.

Eventually Lily and creepy Tom went to a brothel in order to try and hide out (can't quite remember why, but I think it was because Lenin was looking for them). Lenin basically barged in and helped Lily to break the spell on her mind. Younger Tom fled. Lily realised she needed to go back in time, she did so. Recruited the vampires, lived in the orphanage with young Tom for a while with both of them being a pain to each other. Then when he went to Hogwarts she returned to the present, had a bit of an argument with Lenin. Lenin sent her off to Hogwarts to catch Pettigrew. Rabbitson is now talking and claims the Dementors are some sort of relation to him, holes in the universe left by Lily building it poorly, and keeps urging her to destroy it or let him do so. Lily is struggling with what to do with Pettigrew after catching him, creepy Tom is still occasionally possessing Ginny to chat to Lily. Dumbledore is refusing to believe Lily about Pettigrew as he doesn't trust her after the previous year.

I think that's about it, but I might have forgotten something or got it a bit wrong.
