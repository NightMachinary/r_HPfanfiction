Hmm interesting. Indeed if you know perfectly why you do what you do while forging I suppose you could reproduce the effect with magic but for this I like more the idea that you can't do all with magic only and that you need to actually work for it even if you can use magic to aid you (here I'm thinking of the forging of Brisingr in the Inheritance Cycle). The folding and heating of the metal. The "soft" and "hard" parts of a blade. The distribution and melding of metals and carbon in the forging or if we talk magic imbuing a weapon or an armor with magic that would hold without needing to recharge it or recast it as you work magic all along the process of forging to mix if with the weapon itself (as in "RuneMaster" linkffn(5077573) with the Potter Scythe).
