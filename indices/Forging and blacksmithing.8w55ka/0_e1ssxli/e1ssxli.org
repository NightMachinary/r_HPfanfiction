I like the idea that transfiguration can be the basis of wizard forging. Transfigure something into a workable substance and dispelling the transfiguration afterward.

Use a wand to turn a block of steel into taffy. Stretch it out and fold it in on itself like it's bread dough. Dispel the transfiguration and you've cold-forged some folded steel.
