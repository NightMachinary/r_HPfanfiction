  "She won't wake," said a soft voice.Hermione jumped and spun around on her knees, her wand pointing at the speaker under the Cloak. If Harry hadn't also been startled into spinning, she would have given herself away for sure. It was a tall, black-haired boy who was leaning against the nearest pillar. She didn't know this boy, but there was only one person he could be - the Heir of Slytherin. ****Hermione and Harry go into the Chamber together. Scenes from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets from the pov of the girls.
