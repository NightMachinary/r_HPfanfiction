I remember reading this a while ago and I think I had the same response. It's really well written but the author gets... Tolkienesque... when describing the soul bond and it becomes rather difficult to read. I'm really looking for a story that goes all 7 years though because a lot of the ones I've found get to about 4th year and then are abandoned.
