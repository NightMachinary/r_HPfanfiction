I think a lot of the seats in the Wizegamot are decided by heritage. It makes sense with the dated Wizarding World. Perhaps some seats are reserved for the heads of the important offices too, like Amelia Bones for the DMLE.

I think the Wizegamot is also the one to decide over the MoM. It wouldn't surprise me if they had a sort of Vote of No Confidence as well, that they act like the body that reigns in the Minister.
