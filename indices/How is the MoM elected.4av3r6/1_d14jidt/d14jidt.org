From what I can tell, unlike the fanon assumptions, the Wizengamot is largely populated by an elderly elite, whose members invite others for consideration to be included. Nothing is inherited, as there is no assumption of honor or value being transferred to one's children. A poweful wizard may have powerfful kids, but the Wizengamot is looking for strong personalities with well-reasoned opinions. None of Arthur Pendragon's wisdom or humanity appeared in his son Mordred, after all. In fact, most of the highly-respected wizards and witches appear to be single (aside from the Flamels, and they never had children- or if they did, they chose not to give those kids the Elixir of Life, which sorta proves the point).

The members carry authority based on their scholarly reputation, and much respect is given to the most elder of members. During low points in Fudge's administration, some prominent members quit their seats in protest.

Aside from them, the rest of the court are the Ministry Directors, who seem to be appointed by the sitting Minister only on the occasion of a vacancy, though one promotion can lead to a number of staff changes.

The Wizengamot are probably also the ones voting in or out the current Minister when they can rally condemnation or support, though most of the candidates for Minister will come from existing (and therefore recognizable) Ministry officials.

Each Minister is permitted to assign their own support staff (as are all the Directors). It ends up looking like a Republic but acting like a Plutocracy, where wealth in this case is replaced by inferred magical power and experience.

It's important to keep in mind that the whole of Wizarding Britain amounts to the population of a small town (3-10 thousand, depending on whose numbers you believe). Most everyone local is known by name or association, and the power of hearsay is much greater than one would expect.
