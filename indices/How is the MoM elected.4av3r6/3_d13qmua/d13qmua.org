Hm. I've never really thought about this. To me it always seemed as though the Wizengamot was appointed too, which doesn't really mean anything, that's just the impression I got.

I think there would definitely be pressure from the community to change the system after the war was over, but it would probably be more about switching to new Wizengamot members. That's just easier than pushing an entire system change. However, if anyone wants to write me a fic with a badass adult Hermione tackling this issue, I would love to read it
