Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions linkao3(10588629), which I just read, has a mostly canon Harry who takes a liking to potions class. And not "Harry is immediately a genius at potions because he looks at a textbook", but rather Harry is bad at potions and just really likes it and want to get better. There's some minor Harry/Ginny mutual crushes on each other, but no actual relationship. Funnily enough, the ending and the sequel start to get into Cursed Child stuff, which I usually hate, but this makes it work

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run linkao3(7331278) is great. It's just under 100k, Draco/Harry slash, and a mix of humor and seriousness from what I remember. It also has one of the best summaries I have ever seen in fanfic.

Holly at Hogwarts linkao3(1048010) is a next-gen fic starring an OC, Dudley Dursley's magical daughter. There are quite a few problems I have with this series (mis-sorted canon characters, some very blatant "all people in this house are X" stereotyping taken seriously in the world, the writing can drag on a bit, the main character has some issues that haven't been fully addressed), but I genuinely still enjoy it. There's been quite a few fun things that recaptured the magic of the original books for me. (Several of the issues I have with the series also get much better or at least more nuanced in the later books). There are 7 finished books (one taking place over a long summer adventure), and the author is currently figuring out what to do with seventh year.
