I actually just finished reading the first 4 books - there were some plot points I've never seen before and overall I found it an interesting read. The first book is 78k, 2nd and 3rd just over 100k each and the 4th ended up at over 200k.

There's manipulative dumbledore, Ron bashing and Lord Potter/Black although it doesn't seem to be as important as in some of the other stories. No real pairing so far but it doesn't look like it will be Harry/Ginny and I'm pretty confident saying it's definitely not going to be Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape.
