I personally think "bashing" is too general a term. The Weasleys do have their flaws. I for one was really bothered in the fourth book (I think, my memory's rusty) where Molly just took it upon herself to get money out of Harry's account and do his shopping for him. To me, nothing about their relationship implied that this was okay and it seemed really invasive. I wouldn't withdraw money from my own daughter's bank account like that and I've raised her myself for 18 years. I think a fanfic that took that instance and others like it and had Harry sit down with Molly and say "Look, you might not see the harm in it, but you're overbearing and kind of annoying." That wouldn't be bashing to me, because Molly IS overbearing and (objectively) annoying.

And I didn't mean to say that you yourself were attacking slash. It's just I've seen too many attacks on it as a trope with really weak justification. It's a trope just like any other, and the stories can be either good or bad depending on the talent of the author.
