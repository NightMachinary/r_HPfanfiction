It's a personal preference. I ship Draco and Harry because from my interpretation of the books, they have chemistry and I like to see that explored. Despite what some others have said - and I am in no way saying they're wrong or that I disagree with them, just adding my own personal perspective- you don't have to be into slash all the time to enjoy a slash pairing. I do not really want to read about Harry paired with any other men, for example. I really hate crossovers that obviously exist simply to pair Harry with another one of the author's favorite characters (HP/LOTR fanfiction can be really guilty of this)

I like stories that pair Harry and Draco and based on the plumbing it just happens to be a gay pairing. I don't need one to be submissive to the other. I don't need for one to start acting effeminate to really stress that THIS IS SLASH, REMEMBER. I just like reading about these two people in a relationship. I actually prefer stories that focus on the personal dynamic and more or less skip the sexual aspect. Because I more or less know how sex works already and don't need a blow by blow (hehehe...) account of it in every story, that's not what I look for primarily. Sometimes I want smut and I'll go look for that, same as with Het pairings, I'd assume.

I can take your argument and replace "slash" with pretty much any other trope and they'd all be just as valid.

- Why pair Harry with Hermione?\\
- Why write Harry as an idiot?
- Why write Fem!Harry?
- Why focus on pairings at all?
- Why write about James and Lily surviving?
- Why read angsty fanfiction?
- Why bash the Weasleys or Dumbledore?
- Why keep referring to Harry as "the raven haired boy/teen/man with emerald orbs."
- Why accept some deviations from canon without complaint, but not others?
- Why change Harry's name to "Hadrian" or "Harold" or "Harrison."
- Why assume that every pureblood family is nobility? (Pottor Manor, Lord Longbottom...)

I could go on and on, but basically the answer to all of these questions is "It may not personally be my cup of tea, but someone out there obviously likes it. More power to them." I personally HATE most of the above tropes in a fanfic, but I'm hardly going to question anyone who does like them.

Edit: couple things looked weird.
