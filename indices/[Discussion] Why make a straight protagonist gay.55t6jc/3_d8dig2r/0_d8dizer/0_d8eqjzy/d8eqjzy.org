I think it happens everywhere. It is still often the default in our society and it's ok, nothing against it. When I want something different though (and I often want it because I"m LGBT and hate gender roles), slash is often able to offer that to me. Some slash do suffer from it as well, where one of the character becomes the "man" and the other the "woman". I drop these fic quicker than a hot potato.
