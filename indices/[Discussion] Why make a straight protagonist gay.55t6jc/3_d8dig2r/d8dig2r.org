For me:

1)Because there is far too little representation in popular literature. So many stories are about straight protagonists. If it isn't explicitly stated, it is often assumed. Even when LGBTQ characters are present, they are often only hinted at. So it's nice to read slash.

2) Slash fics are often not gender roles heavy. I like that. I don't want to read about the boyfriend/husband does these set of things while the girlfriend/wife does these other set of things. These tend to happen less in slash fics. People do stuff due to their characters and not gender. Author is not confined by unintentional gender role bias.
