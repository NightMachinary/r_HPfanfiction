  the first books were written with smaller children in mind

In the first books Harry was still too young to have discovered the joys of tentacular midget/pony porn yet. I'm more surprised over the lack of porn in the later books. The books became progressively darker and "adult-themed".

Of course, the books gloss over a lot of bodily functions. Knowing which technique Harry uses to wipe his butt doesn't add much to the plot.
