I can't imagine Snape being romantically linked to /anyone/, slash or no. (Even his obsession with Lily is creepy and gross.)

Malfoy totally works though. I've said it before and I'll say it again, calling Hermione names does not mean he and Harry could never, ever get along. Hell, /I/ was calling Hermione names all through the books because I hate her character. Most of the names I used were worse than "mudblood" as well.

Aside from the bathroom incident in book 6, Harry and Draco's interactions are petty and childish and if either one of them ever decided to grow the hell up, they'd probably get along just fine.
