Just because. Some people feel underrepresented and thus they create their own worlds, where the protagonist is like them. Also, some people love yaoi and want to see their favorite characters in a yaoi relationship. The latter fics are mostly trash, but the former ones can be good.

To be honest, I have no problem with any deviation - racebending, genderbending, change of orientation, etc. - as long, as it doesn't make it into canon. And if it does... well, there's a reason I drop more and more Marvel comics each week. Which I am glad for, because DC Rebirth is amazing.
