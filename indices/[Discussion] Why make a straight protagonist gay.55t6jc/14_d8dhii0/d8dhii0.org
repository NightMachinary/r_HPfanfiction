Sometimes I suppose it's fair if you desperately wanna write shipping-based fics and all the characters that fit the protagonist's orientation suck.

I seriously doubt that's very often the case, though, considering often the slash-shipping makes even less sense than canon pairings, even assuming a switch in the character's sexuality.
