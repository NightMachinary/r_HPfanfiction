  What is it that makes people write their protagonist like that when there is clear evidence from canon that this is not the case?

When you go AU (which is the whole freaking point of FF), you might as well tickle your own fantasies as well. The readers (and therefore authors) of Harry Potter (both canon and FF) is probably of a particular demographic that idolizes off-canon relationships. Just as fans of ZZ Top are different from fans of Justin Bieber, so I suspect is the case with HP and other fiction universes. I wonder if Twilight fanfics have the same bias (looking at you, young romantic females!).

  I don't know if you guys have noticed it, but if you sort by favourites there are quite a significant majority where the fics portray a gay Harry Potter, despite the fact that canon clearly dictates that he is straight.

I suspect the movies are much to blame. The movie versions of Malfoy and Snape are much more compatible with leather pants than the book versions. Book Snape had no redeeming qualities, Alan Rickman had plenty.

What surprises me most, is that it's not just slash. Suddenly /everyone's/ gay. There's not a straight relationship in sight, except perhaps between Dumbledore and McGonagall. And the slash tends towards unlikely pairings, between characters that are incompatible in canon.

And suddenly, MPREG. Throw in a bit of domination and submission while we're at it. I wonder if just crossing that "forbidden" gay line (many places in the world /teh ghey/ is unacceptable or even worse) makes authors go all out.
