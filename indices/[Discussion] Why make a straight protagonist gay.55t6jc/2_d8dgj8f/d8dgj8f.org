I think it has more to do with the demographics of the fandom.

I have no hard facts to back this up, but my impression is that the vast majority of the authors across the HP fandom are (or were at the time of their first involvement) teenage girls. It's possible that they write feminine protagonists who like boys because it helps them identify more with the characters.

I'd also guess that there is a large subset of edgelord neckbeard males who are responsible for the harem fics.

TL;DR: It's just people writing what they wish for instead of what they know.
