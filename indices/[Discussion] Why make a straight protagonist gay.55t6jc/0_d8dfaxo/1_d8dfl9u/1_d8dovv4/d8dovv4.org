  I'm writing a Harry/ Neville fic, and Harry's gay because he ends up with Neville.

I think this explains all the fem!Harry fics. Some authors want a particular pairing, but are for some reason allergic to homosexuality, or any form of LGBT.

Fem!Harry forces everything back on the straight and narrow.
