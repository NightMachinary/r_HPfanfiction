And if you ship lots of slash pairings, it might be because while there are both men and women in the story, the men have more of a personality and have more interaction with each other, and so you might feel there is more chemistry between two men than between a man and a woman. Since sometimes writers seem to assume a lot of the time if you stick a man and woman together, they'll automatically date, marry, etc., even if one if them is really lacking personality.
