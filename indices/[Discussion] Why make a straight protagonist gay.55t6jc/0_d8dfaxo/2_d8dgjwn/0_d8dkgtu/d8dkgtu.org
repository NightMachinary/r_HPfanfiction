I mean... those slash fics totally exist. I find saras_girl (whose gender I actually have no idea of) to do a pretty good job of this, making the characters still themselves, and still "masculine" - at least, if they are already inherently masculine characters.

Not to say you're not right about a good chunk of slash fics! But also not to say better ones don't exist.
