  The author is gay and identifies with a gay protagonist better.

  A lot of stories take canon, change one thing, and examine what happens from there. This certainly counts as one thing to change.

  The author wants to explore how the wizarding world treats LGBT people, and perhaps compare & contrast that to how our world treats LGBT people.

Lol.

The vast majority of slash fics are written by women who turn the male protagonist gay so they can pair him with a male character that they themselves find attractive. It's the same reason for 99% of fanfiction: the author is projecting themselves onto the main character, and where the author is a heterosexual female and the main character is male, that means having the main character be gay.

The rise in fem!Harry stories represents the same impulse.

Incidentally this is why the vast majority of slash fics also feminise Harry. In real life gay men are still men, they just so happen to be sexually attracted to other men. In fanfiction gay men are basically women with a penis.

I don't think I've ever read a slash fanfic where the protagonist actually behaves in a masculine manner. Which incidentally is tied in to the fact that very few slash fics are actually written by gay men.
