Same.

Another reason why I ship slash pairings is because of the dynamic they have, like two people involved in a tightly-knit bromance, and sometimes you just can't help but think "Is this even bromance anymore? Because they're acting like an old married couple."

It also happens when there's so much tension between two characters that it makes you think why they feel such deep hatred towards one another, because a person never feels something so strongly towards another (both positive and negative) unless that person affected them so much. Anger? Maybe it's nothing. But really intense rivalry or deep hate? Makes me think twice.

After all, hate is not the opposite of love. It's indifference. Why make such a big deal when you can just cut that person out of your life?

So yes. Ho Yay and Foe Yay.
