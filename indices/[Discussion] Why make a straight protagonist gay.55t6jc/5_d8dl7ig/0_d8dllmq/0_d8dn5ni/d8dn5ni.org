Actually... no, I read your whole post. My response stands- basically all reasons boil down to "why not?"

A vast amount of fanfiction is in the "What if X was different" category. Change genders, change years, change who lived, change who died, change what house you're sorted in, change your parents. Changing sexual orientation is just another thing, lets you put together characters who ordinarily wouldn't be.
