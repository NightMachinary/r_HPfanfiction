I don't write male/male slash, but I do write femslash.

The answer in that case is because I want to. I'm a fan of femslash works(and others are fans of slash works), so I enjoy reading and writing femslash, even if characters aren't portrayed as gay in the original works.

If you actually wait for a "gay main character" to come along, you'll be waiting a LONNNNGGGGGGGG time, and it might not even be in a series you like. People like writing about the MC, because they usually identify most with the MC in terms of who they like in the stories-- there are obvious exceptions to this where people ignore the MC's existence in fanfiction, but they're clearly the most popular.

I don't really think there's anything wrong with that, and this sort of question distinctly reminds me of when I was 12 and I left a review on an Eragon/Murtagh fic saying "Why do you make the characters gay when they're not in the story?"

It's a pointless question that is borderline rude to ask because the answer is irrelevant, and it's trying to put people on the spot for writing gay fiction rather than staying with the heterosexual-ness that 99.9% of stories have inherently.

Addressing a few side points:

The reason people don't look for characters that "could" be gay is that 1.) it doesn't really matter whether someone could be gay or not if you don't like the character, and 2.) If you did this, you would have very few pairings to write gay couples in stories with, you'd constantly be needlessly shoehorned into a specific pairing per fandom.

As to the point of many slash fics having a weak/submissive character: I don't personally read slash, but keep in mind the primary writers of slash are heterosexual young females. I imagine that if this occurs, that's the primary reason-- they're trying to make it sensual/tender, and fit the character's gayness to their fantasies, regardless of how realistic it would be in the real world.
