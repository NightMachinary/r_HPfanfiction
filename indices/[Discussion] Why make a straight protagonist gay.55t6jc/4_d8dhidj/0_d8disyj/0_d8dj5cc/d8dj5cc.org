When I said 99.9% of stories were heterosexual, I wasn't referring to fanfiction, I was referring to the non-fanfiction media(the source content for fanfiction), where there are VERY, VERY few popular homosexual stories out there, even nowadays.

The somewhat rude part isn't asking about why there's so many slash fics, it's this underlying assertion that seems to come through of "Why are you writing a clearly straight character as gay? They're proven to be straight in the original content, so why do it?" Which isn't exactly maliciously rude, but comes off as a bit unintentionally condescending.
