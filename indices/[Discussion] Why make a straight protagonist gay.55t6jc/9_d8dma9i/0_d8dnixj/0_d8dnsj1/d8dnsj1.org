The problem is, none of that development is shown to the readers. So to write a fic with strong female characters who don't just revolve around Harry, you need to make up or change about as much as you do to write a fic with gay male characters. Don't get me wrong; some Harry Potter fanfics do a good job of that! But I'd agree that it's the more difficult, and less obvious, way to go.
