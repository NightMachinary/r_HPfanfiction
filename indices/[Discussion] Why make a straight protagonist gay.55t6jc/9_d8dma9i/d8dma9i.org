Because the majority of the interesting protagonists, and thus the protagonists people want to explore in pairings, are male. Compare MLP:FIM fanfic; there, absolutely everything is femslash. And all of the main characters in FIM who have any agency in the show are female, while all of the males are side characters. In Harry Potter, even everything Hermione does revolves around Harry, and she's the strongest female in the series.
