  What is it that makes people write their protagonist like that when there is clear evidence from canon that this is not the case?

Can I ask - what specifically is the clear evidence?

Because, I mean, for all intents and purposes I "look" straight. I am kinda feminine, I am dating a man (long term), I like boys a lot. It would make sense that people who didn't know me would assume this, and it honestly doesn't come up much in conversation for people to ask differently because they've already made their assumptions.

I also like girls a lot.

Surprise!

I think the big thing in my mind is that, we don't actually know specifically about any of these characters? I mean, we know what JK tells us. We know what Harry (our incredibly unreliable narrator) tells us (and he's dense as bricks sometimes). And really, there isn't much (if any) actual queerness portrayed in the books. So how would someone from an incredibly sheltered upbringing (he lived in a cupboard!) who never really had exposure even know?

I know quite a few people who grew up in small towns and married women because they figured that's what they were supposed to do. Then they got older, were exposed to more of the real world, and are now in same sex relationships.

Lots of people don't actually discover, or come to terms with, their identities until they're older.

And JK doesn't have a great track record of displaying sexuality in the books. We have an after-the-fact "Dumbledore is gay!" but no one really could have predicted that from the books. So again, is that character clearly straight? Or clearly gay? I mean, Harry kisses Cho & Ginny, and is clearly in love with Ginny. He is also high-key obsessed with Draco for the entirety of book six and even books before that. It all comes down to interpretation.

Or do we just not know, and want to explore it in fanfiction?

I agree with a lot of the other points people have made, but I think this is important to keep in mind too!
