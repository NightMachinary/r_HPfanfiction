Ho boy. I maybe shouldn't have brought up the Harry & Draco thing since that was not the point of my post, but.

Harry is an unreliable narrator in the same way that all books that only show one person's thoughts / feelings / etc are. The whole point of only knowing what Harry knows MAKES him an unreliable narrator because we have no back up for what he's seeing, or thinking. He thinks x about a person, we never find out more. I'm not going to use Draco again. But like, he thinks Ron's amazing, other people probably don't. That's what makes him unreliable. So if you're writing about someone not him, you can't presume to know everything about them. And even if you're writing about him, he doesn't reveal every single thing about himself because that's just not how books work?

That's clear evidence that he is attracted to females, or at the least to Ginny. That is NOT clear evidence of his sexuality. As I pointed out: you can be sexually attracted to both genders (it's called bisexuality). Also, again, you can be romantically attracted to someone enough to marry them even if you don't know your sexuality - but I'm not getting into the difference between romantic & sexual attraction here.

Yes, that is the canon view of things.

We're writing fanfiction.

If you want to read canon, read the books. Like I'm really not sure why this is such a confusing thing?
