Aside from getting the spoken bits right, this is critical: keep the description of the speaker in the same paragraph with their spoken words. If the reader has to constantly backfit who's talking, your dialog will be jarring and hard to read.

You typically start a new paragraph each time you change the speaker. That doesn't mean that you start a paragraph when you open a quote.

To illustrate, don't do this:

  "I think my dress is gorgeous. I can't wait to surprise everyone." Harry laughed.

  "That sounds great, Hermione, you'll be the belle of the ball."
