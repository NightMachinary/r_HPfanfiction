I'll chime in OP. The voice really don't matter in the first draft of your story. Don't get your knickers in a twist over that and let it hinder your story telling. You can always come back and polish, but you need to have a turd that needs polishing first. It's useless if you spend half an hour on a sentence because you want to get the dialogue /just right/.
