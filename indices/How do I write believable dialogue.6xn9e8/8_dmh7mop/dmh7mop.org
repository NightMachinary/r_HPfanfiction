Know your characters! How would they feel talking about this? Would they like it, do they hate it? Would they rather talk about something else? Are they nervous about it, will they try to steer the conversation away from that topic? Do they not quite know how to react? Would they stutter if they get surprised, or do the clam up and not say anything? Are they in a bad mood and this event caught them at a critical moment?

Really try to empathize with your characters and put yourself in their situation. It helps a lot. This is how people have characters who "write themselves".
