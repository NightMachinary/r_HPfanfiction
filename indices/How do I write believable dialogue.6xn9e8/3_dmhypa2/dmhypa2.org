Lots of generic advice in here so far.

The one tip I'd give is that you should remember that people don't just communicate through dialogue. A lot of bad writers forget this and have people just stand around and spout dialogue. If you can incorporate nuanced body language into your characters dialogue then you'll be in the 1%.
