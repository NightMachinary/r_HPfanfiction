The last paragraph is really important. I can't tell you how many fics I've dropped because a trip to a single shop lasts 10 long paragraphs because the author feels like they need to have:

"Hello, sir."

"Hi, how are you? And call me Harry."

"Okay, Harry, tell me, Harry, what can I do for you today, Harry?" (because you have to insert the name all the time)

"Your best trunk, sir."

"Please, none of that sir business here. My name's Voldemort."

"Voldemort? Any connection to -"

"No, no connection at all to the Dark Lord."

And it will end up being no connection too. I'm exaggerating, obviously, but most of a person's dialogue really needs to have a point. If it can be removed, remove it. If there's no point, foreshadowing, hint, etc etc, just don't have it.
