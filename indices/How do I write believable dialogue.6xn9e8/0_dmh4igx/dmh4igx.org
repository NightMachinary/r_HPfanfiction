First, every character has their own speech cadence and vocabulary. You have to get this right otherwise it just wont ever sound like the character you're writing. For example, snape speaks with a rythm and melodramtic vocab while ron is quite like an ogre but not as bad as crab or goyle.

Then you have to make sure the content of what theyre saying is something they'd say. Dumbledore is a bit mysterious and kinda dances around the point especially around younger children while hermione is super straight forward.

Then you have to make sure what theyre saying is actually interesting to read and not drawn out and rambling unless it's part of the character.

Finally, you have to make sure every line (or most) of dialogue actually advances the scene and plot forward. lots of hellos and hows your day and you left your underwear in the microwave again is really boring to read. They can usually be skipped unless it's necessary.
