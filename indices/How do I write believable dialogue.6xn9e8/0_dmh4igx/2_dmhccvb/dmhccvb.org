  Then you have to make sure the content of what theyre saying is something they'd say. Dumbledore is a bit mysterious and kinda dances around the point especially around younger children while hermione is super straight forward.

And following from this, ideally your version of that character will change over the course of the story (or may have changed from canon due to changes to the history of the universe from before your story occurs) so you have to ask yourself, not just, "is this what canon Dumbledore would say?" but rather, "is this what my Dumbledore would say?"
