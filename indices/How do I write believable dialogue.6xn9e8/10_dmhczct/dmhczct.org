Remember to actually consider if the dialogue you're writing actually sounds like something someone would say. I've seen authors that write grammatically correct dialogue that's really out of place because it's just not the way people talk. The most common example I can think of is a lack of contractions. Almost everyone is almost always going to say "don't" over "do not" for example, so having a character say "do not" needs to be a decision based on context rather than the default.
