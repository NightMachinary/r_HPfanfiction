I recommend narrating a conversation between your characters aloud.

You'll catch mistakes and nuances you wouldn't detect by just writing the dialogue without verbalisation. You'll develop an "inner voice" for your characters that you slip into when you write them.

- Would /this/ character really say this like /that?/

- Wouldn't /this/ person respond like this, instead? No wait, that doesn't sound like him - he'd do /this/ instead of replying...

This inner voice change will become easier to fall into with practice. This is a very good tool in your toolkit for whatever you write in the future.

Perhaps also keep a list of dialogue snippets that your character would say or has said in canon or good fanon, that you can read through to immerse yourself in their way of speaking. This isn't just related to dialogue, you might keep descriptions of their mannerisms i.e. pinching the bridge of their nose and similar behaviours.

Note: also don't worry about crafting perfect dialogue during the first draft. That's silly. Your "internal critic" will be second guessing everything. I recommend completing the first draft as quickly and roughly as you can. By the end you will have a much better internal understanding of how your characters behave, using that understanding you'll be able to better edit/rewrite their dialogue to suit their character.
