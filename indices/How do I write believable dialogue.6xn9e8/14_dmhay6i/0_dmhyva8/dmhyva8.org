This is terrible advice.

I just attempted to read A Cadmean Victory and that author is awful with tags. The first several chapters have 'said' in them a total of 1 time, and even then it is appended with an adjective. It made the dialogue incredibly clunky.

Using an extensive range of tags detracts from a story. Skipping tags, yes. Once a dialogues rhythm has been established that's fine to do, and in fact can help dialogue go smoothly, something which eschewing 'said' does the opposite of.
