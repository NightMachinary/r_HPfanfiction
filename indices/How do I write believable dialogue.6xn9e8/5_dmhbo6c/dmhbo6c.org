Definitely read it out loud. This will make awkward phrasing very apparent. Also, pay attention to how people actually speak when together in groups.

Think about your character--education level, social strata, general attitude about life. Are they happy-go-lucky? Anxious? Ambitious? All of these will have an effect on the way they speak. Do they have any vocal tics or habits? Do they curse?

When I write or I'm thinking about my current work, I have a lot of arguments in my head. Take notes on interesting words or phrases you hear out in the wild. And of course read, read, read.

Good luck in setting your plot bunny free!
