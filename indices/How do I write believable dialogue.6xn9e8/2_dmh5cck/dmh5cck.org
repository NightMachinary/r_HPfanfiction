Read it out loud to yourself. It will immediately become apparent when it doesn't sound natural.

Make sure you use contractions unless there's a good reason for a character not to (not native speaker, formal situation). People also speak in sentence fragments and run-on sentences, though I wouldn't overdo that. They also do not use the names of the person they're speaking to very often.

Make sure you use dialog tags often enough that the reader doesn't lose track of which person is speaking. Despite what people are taught in school, the word "said" is virtually invisible to the reader and can't really be overused. Well, it can, but don't go nuts trying to replace it with other things.
