Make sure you know your character's motivations. This tells you what they might want to get out of each situation and so what they'd move the conversation towards. Voldemort wouldn't be helpful, Bellatrix wouldn't be kind and Malfoy wouldn't be polite, why because they aren't motivated to be.

Make sure you know what your characters know. Hindsight is super dangerous. A character bringing up an event or spell they have no right knowing about is immersion breaking. Be realistic about their knowledge and intelligence. This helps you check if your stimulus to move the plot forwards is clunky or if it fits.

Harder things to accomplish are regional dialects and speech patterns. I would recommend avoiding them unless you comfortable with the characters. Hagrid for example has a thick accent and getting it wrong might be worse than not including it.
