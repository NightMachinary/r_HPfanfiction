Possibly great loss. Draco has never struck me as a good character, or selfless, which is why I personally prefer he is irrelevant or dead in the stories I read, or at the very least acting canonically like a douche and idiot bully.

​

However, I think it is potentially plausible that after the death of Snape, or maybe even Crabbe, Draco decides he doesn't want to be on the side of the man who essentially had them killed. If you want to write him like this during their time in Hogwarts, it could be down to his father's imprisonment, and the fact that Voldemort doesn't care. He could play a Snape-esque role, except using info he gets from other classmates in Slytherin.

​

That's the only reason I see Draco ever leaving the side of the Death Eaters. He doesn't have enough morals to care about the Muggleborn Holocaust, and will only care if it affects him and those he treasures.
