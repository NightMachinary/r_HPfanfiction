I talked for way longer than I intended, so tl;dr at bottom.

I think one of the biggest parts of redemption is that it's a process. Even if the character has a come-to-god moment where they realize a lot of what they believe is bs, they still need to examine their beliefs and /start/ to work on correcting their behavior/way of thinking. There's no believable way Draco wakes up one day and all of a sudden treats everyone equally regardless of blood status. This can /seem/ to happen from an outside perspective, but that would have to involve a period of time where your characters don't see each other. For example, Hermione runs into Draco again X years later and finds that he no longer treats her with disdain and has changed his beliefs about blood purity. To her, the change is sudden because the last impression she had of him is vastly different and she didn't see any of the gradual changes.

However, I would generally recommend against taking this approach, as it can be difficult to make the redemption seem as genuine. There is absolutely potential to pull it off, but it won't be easy. I think it's easier to write a believable redemption arc when you are traveling along the arc with the character, not hearing about their journey after it happened.

I personally think Draco is well set up to have a redemption arc - others may disagree. It has been a while since I've actually read through the books, so I don't have a very clear recall of how we see his behavior change throughout the years, but I think HBP and DH set him up as a victim in this. THIS IS NOT TO SAY HIS BEHAVIOR IS EXCUSABLE. He behaved like a prick and that's something that I think needs to be addressed for a redemption arc. However, we also know for a fact there are external forces at play that influence his behavior.

Most obviously, Draco was raised to believe he was better than others because of his blood. We don't know how aggressively or forcefully this was drilled into him, but we do know that he was raised with those beliefs. In addition to this, Voldemort being resurrected at the end of GoF certainly has an effect on the Malfoys. We see right away in the graveyard that Voldemort is displeased with how his followers behaved after his “defeat” at the hands of baby Harry. Lucius (I'm pretty sure) claimed he was under the Imperius curse (point against him for disloyalty) and gave away the notebook in CoS, which ended up getting it destroyed (another point against him), so our old pal Voldy is none too pleased with him. This then results in Draco's assigned task in HBP, with the threat of harming his family(or just his mum?) against him if he fails. So, even if Draco is still /fully/ on board with the ideology, attempting to kill Dumbledore is a task forced on him, and one that Dumbledore, at least, thinks he did not want (and I agree). Even taking the mark was almost certainly driven in part by Voldemort's threatening presence in his life. I'm not saying it was entirely against his will, but I am saying that he didn't really have a choice to refuse.

So, there we have the framework Draco was working with. Again, this does not excuse his actions. He still was arrogant, entitled, and a bully, and he still did go along with Voldy's plans (I really don't see how someone with his upbringing /wouldn't/ given the circumstances, but that's neither here nor there). He is a very flawed character who has done bad things, and those cannot all be waved away as him being a product of his upbringing, but I do think it is important to remember and to not consider his actions in a vacuum.

Now, as to how we go about redeeming him. I believe he /has/ to be questioning his beliefs and the side he's on by the final battle for him to be redeemable. If he's true to blood purity and/or Voldemort to the end, I don't see how you can move on from there. When and why he starts rethinking things could be for a number of reasons - it's important to have a why, but I don't think it's important for it to be one certain thing in order for him to be redeemable (as in I don't think it has to be because of X reason and any other reason isn't good enough). I think it's best if he's unsure by the time he takes the mark at the latest, but you might be able to work with it being later.

He's probably not going to have much freedom to explore his doubts until the war is over, especially if Voldemort is already back by the time he decides to examine his beliefs. Once he does though, I think he's going to have to realize he needs to atone for his wrongdoings as a part of that. You don't need to make him entirely self loathing, but he needs to be willing to accept punishment for what he's done. Maybe he still tries to get himself a lighter sentence, but that probably needs to come more from a place of self-preservation rather than an idea that he deserves forgiveness where others don't. If he does get a lighter sentence (whether right away or it gets adjusted after the fact), I think you need to have someone “good” having fought for it. Make sure he doesn't get off too light though, or it may make your criteria for redemption appear too soft. You will likely wind up with the feeling that he escaped true justice and didn't properly atone, or that his supposed reform isn't entirely sincere.

I think you could go a multitude of places with what his life looks like post-Hogwarts. You could include some kind of a “community service” kind of aspect of him reestablishing himself, Malfoy funds being largely given for reparations, or about anything else you might think works. The important parts through this are that he is truly repentant, he has to work at convincing others he is changed, and that he's not perfect at it. If nothing else, he has a severe taught bias against those with “impure” blood that he's not going to be able to magically switch off. He'll have to work at identifying his flawed thinking and replacing it, and if he's stressed or upset, he will probably slide back towards his prejudiced and entitled tendencies. He will probably need help from others to identify what he needs to fix as well. Some things are more obvious (muggleborns aren't inferior to pure bloods), but others won't stick out to him as something that needs changing.

I've rambled on for way too long by now, so I guess *tl;dr: Redemption is a journey, you can't flip a switch on behaviors and prejudices, and Draco's background doesn't excuse his actions, but is important to keep in mind*
