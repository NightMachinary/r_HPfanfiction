Oooh! I really love the idea of Draco first experiencing doubts at the World Cup, it's perfect foreshadowing.

He would see how utterly /pathetic/ and /useless/ hurting a muggle child is. What exactly are they proving? /That they're better, stronger, more powerful than muggle children?/ What a /revelation/.

It accomplishes nothing (from Draco's perspective) other than proving what they already know.

It would be like stepping on a baby mouse, you can, but what's the point? It doesn't make you a big badass human.
