I think the best start would be at the World cup. During the attack, he gets separated from his parents and ends up witnessing the death eaters torturing the muggle family. He sees their child screaming her lungs out, bleeding, terror and pain clear in her eyes while the parents can do nothing but helplessly watch till the child stops screaming.

Draco makes some noise and gets attacked right away, just managing to escape with a bloody back and leg. He finally finds his parents only to look at those same eyes the parents from before had and begins to think as he sits on his bed back in the manor.

"Why? Why did they do that? How could they? She- she was just a girl. Just a child no more than 7, so how-. How could they just /kill, torture/ an innocent child? But, they didn't care. They didn't care for her screams, didn't care for her fear, for her pain or that of her parents. They didn't care they took a life. Didn't care if it was a muggle, half blood or pure blood. They didn't care. All they wanted to do was destroy and kill and cause pain and terror.

Was... Was his father involved in this? Did he do such unspeakable things in the last war? Did he care that he was hurting other people? Damaging them beyond repair?"

Draco spends weeks, month on these thoughts till school begins again, till he has to face all those people HE hurt before with his behaviour and he is barely able to meet anyone's eyes.

One day(before Halloween) he has another nightmare. He leaves the dungeons and sprints for the lake to gets some fresh air, to dump his head into the water, to just try SOMETHING to silence those horrible screams in his head that just won't leave him alone.

And then there is Ron behind him, pulling him out since he didn't register he had been too long without air, too deep in his thoughts. They stare at each other. Neither saying something as Ron watched tears streaming down Draco's cheeks.

Ron sits down beside him and waits patiently. Neither taunting nor judging him. And the dam breaks and Draco tells him everything that happened and went through his head.

Rest is up to you.
