1. I think there is a huge difference between pre-HBP Draco and post-HBP one. After two attempted murders (Katie Bell and Ron), it is hard to get him really positive spin. So, when somebody asked about cross-star lovers, I could imagine working Dramione only before that.

2. Honest redemption post-HBP should probably mean going to a jail. True redemption and conversion towards The Right could mean that you plead guilty and server your sentence.
