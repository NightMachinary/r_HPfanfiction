Personally, I have no talent for writing, so fairly certain no one would want to suffer through my struggle to tell a compelling story.

What I can do it think of ideas the seem fun.

We look at Draco as is and see a bigoted, racist brat who feels entitled to everything. How does this change? Something... or someone would need to get him started.

If you've never heard of Daryl Davis, I recommend looking him up. He is an African American man that has convinced 200 kkk members to give up their robes.

Often times hate comes from ignorance and fear of the unknown. My understanding is that the slytherin house was made up of mostly pure bloods. Since slytherin was encouraged through tradition to keep to their house, Draco did not really have close access to a lot of muggle borns. I know that there were a good number of them at the school, but they were not in his social circles. What slytherin would be caught socializing with a hufflepuff?

This prejudice was taught and his access was limited.

I think to get a good redemption that doesn't hand-wave away the canon character, we need the wizarding world's Daryl Davis who goes out of their way to befriend people raised to hate him. Who shows through actions that Draco's prejudices are wrong and he's not so different from muggleborn wizards.
