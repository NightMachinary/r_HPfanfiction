By far, the best part of HBP is how successful it was in reframing Malfoy from a one-note bully, a Hogwarts equivalent of Dursley, into a tragic character. I liked how Draco's choice is so difficult /because/ his parents are alive and committed to one side, especially when juxtaposed against Harry, someone who finds himself unambiguously on good side because of how his parents died.

Still, doesn't make up for introduction of horcruxes.

EDIT: I should probably mention that the reason I find the incidents with Ron and Katie to be not as relevant as they probably should be is because I find them to be very weak points in the book. Draco's character would be so much better if they didn't happen at all, and considering complete lack of consequences for the story, the book would have been better without them as well.
