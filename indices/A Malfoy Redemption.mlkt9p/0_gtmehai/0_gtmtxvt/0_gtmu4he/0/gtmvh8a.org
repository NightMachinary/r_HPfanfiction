It's very telling how invested I was in occupying Harry's mind during my first read of the HBP, because I remember thinking of Draco as whiny during their confrontation. It was only after I came back to it that I noticed this being one of the few moments in the entire series where we are actually encouraged to consider what's going on from a perspective different than Harry's.
