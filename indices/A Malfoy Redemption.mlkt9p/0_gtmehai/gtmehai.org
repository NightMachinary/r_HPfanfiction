I think HBP from Draco's POV would be extremely sympathetic. In my opinion, Draco's HBP character arc is more interesting than Harry's.

Draco gets everything he ever wanted- power, a place at the Dark Lord's side, entrance into a secret club, an opportunity to redeem the family name and save his mother and father.

At the price of everything he cares about and loves.

Kill the Headmaster or I'll torture and murder your entire family instantly makes you pretty sympathetic.

And if Draco's tormented by internal doubt and compromised morals (accompanied by an intellectual problem that stretches him to his physical/mental limits)- that seems like the definition of the human heart in conflict.

I would read /the shit/ out of that.

His rock bottom would be failing to kill Dumbledore, and losing /everything/ the beginning of his redemption would be not positively identifying Harry at threat to his entire family.
