Very true. There's no doubt Draco has a multitude of faults, but that makes him quite interesting IMO. I would prefer we got more character building out of him, and a deeper look at more characters in general. But building a solid narrative around his sixth year, in a realistic, but also sympathetic way seem quite possible.

He's a kid put in a life or death situation, the weight of the world on his shoulders, of course he's tearing himself apart at the seams and taking anger out on others- it's what nearly /everyone/ would do! The fact that he nearly succeeded, is incredible, and shows a great strength of character we don't really see in him otherwise.
