the most important thing in my mind, and some might disagree, is that Malfoy first needs to be punished for his actions. And I am not talking about just 'oh he suffered consequences for his choices'. No, he broke the law and should be punished by the law.

Redemption can not be sought before one has paid for their crimes. If they just walk away freely, it is not redemption, it is society forgiving them for everything and those two are VERY different things.

Only after Malfoy has been punished rightfully for his crimes and evil actions, can redemption be sought and earned.\\
And that is another thing. Redemption MUST be earned. No one can just be redeemed without effort. An easy redemption is meaningless and can easily be undone again, as the 'redeemed' has learned nothing.\\
Malfoy must stand and face the world that hates him for his many crimes and evil actions. He must struggle and work hard, through strife and pain, to earn his redemption.
