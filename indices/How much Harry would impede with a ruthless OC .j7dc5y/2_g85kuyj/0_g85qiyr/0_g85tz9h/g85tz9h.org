That's the problem with fanfics (or at least one of them), discerning Canon from Fanon can become a bit difficult (for some). Is Ron truly an idiot that only pass his classes because Hermione let him cheat on her? Is Sirius truly a manchild that only thinks about pranking people and girls? Is Dumbledore truly an old fool that only thinks about "The Greater Good" and call everyone "My boy"?
