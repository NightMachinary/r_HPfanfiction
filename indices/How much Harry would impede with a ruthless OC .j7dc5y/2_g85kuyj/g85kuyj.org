  /" ...Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance...It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,” he [Harry] said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.”/\\
  *Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince*

Harry would never suffer the death of an innocent, and would probably be ready to fight to protect him, but as long as the "victim" is truly evil, I don't think Harry (or his friends) would be very hard to convince.

It's true that there are several scenes in Canon where Harry "spare" his enemies, but there is pretty much always a reason behind this mercy:

- *Wormtail in PoA*\\
  While Harry did say that "It's not what my father would have wanted" to stop Sirius and Remus, he also explained that Peter was needed alive to prove Sirius innocence. Spending the rest of your life with Dementors is also arguably worse than a quick death, but that's not the point.
- *Stan Shunpike in DH*\\
  As Harry later explained to Remus, it is pretty much assured that Stan is under the Imperius. Harry may be ready to kill ennemies, but that doesn't mean he will let any innocent die at his place, and from his point of view, Stan if one of them.
- *The 2 Death Eaters in DH*\\
  The reason he used sound half as an excuse (and even Ron seemed "relieved" to not have to kill them), but technically, he chose to erase their memories because he needed to disappear and the Death Eaters were less likely to investigate 2 amnesiques than 2 deaths.

​

If it happened during a fight, Harry would not say anything if a Death Eater died. If it's an execution, he would probably raise some objections (if only because it may not be the "right" thing to do, especially if alternatives exist like Azkaban), but not enough to stop the OC from acting.
