Ron was ready to execute Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe. Another OC with the same attitude would see the deed done.

Now if that OC pointed out that Death Eaters were sadistic genocidal magical Nazis bent on exterminating the Muggleborns like the Jews, I doubt Hermione would have any objections either. She should know how her ancestors fought these monsters.

Harry was ready to crucio Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall, and he definitely had his own ruthless streak. If his other three friends (including your OC) were ready to kill, he would certainly go along.
