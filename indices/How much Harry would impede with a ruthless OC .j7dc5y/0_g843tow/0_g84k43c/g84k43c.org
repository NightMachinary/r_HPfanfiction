I see Ron as quite pragmatic. IMO he would understand that some things need to be done, even if ugly.

I think Harry can be prone to extreme measures, but only during high emotional situation. He tried to crucio Bellatrix because she caused Sirius to die and I think he *did* crucio Carrow for spitting on McGonagall, he even said something like "wow she (bellatrix) was right, you have to want it"

But if it's in a cold blooded situation, I think he'll have a morality crisis that will make him hesitant, like when he just disarmed Stan Shunpike instead of stunning and was berated for it by Remus. So I could very well see him doing stupid that would endanger someone because it is the right thing to do in his mind. Like you're going to punch someone and he disarms you, only to realize then that he revealed you.

Hermione... I'm conflicted on this one. If she's vindicated, she can be quite creative in her vengeful actions (Umbridge, Skeeter) but on the other hand, she could be quite sneaky like when she stole Harry's Firebolt because she deemed it could be dangerous. Where's Harry's more direct in his approach, she often goes behind their back to ensure something is done.
