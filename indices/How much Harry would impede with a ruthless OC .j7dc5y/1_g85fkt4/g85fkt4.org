As people have said, I think Ron wouldn't take it too bad. He'd probably be the easiest to convince, especially if that OC tries to explain it to make him also angry. (for example, if Neville had expressed the desire to kill Bellatrix and had had an opportunity, I don't think Ron'd have been the one to step in).

I think Hermione would still try to stop them, would try to use logical points and why it's not good and it will not make them feel better, but I think that if she sees that this OC isn't "able" to let the DE go away uninjured/alive, she might give up. I do think she'd feel different around OC but would try not to make their relationship change (knowing it was an exceptional reaction). As I said while using Neville's example, I think Hermione would definitely try to stop him and bring morals into it ("You can't do that, Neville, or you'll be just like them! Your parents wouldn't want you to become a murderer" etc etc) but if that character is decided, she wouldn't risk it all to stop them as she probably knows it wouldn't be that much of a bad idea to get rid of a DE. I think her reaction if it was Malfoy Senior and not a random DE she didn't know, might be a bit different. Not sure how (pity? because she knows Draco, hatred? because of every very hurtful action he did...?) but I think it would impact her choice.

Harry's by far the hardest. I do personally dislike the "good heroes don't kill" prompt so I really felt angry at Harry while reading the books/seeing the movies because he really stays in that zone. I don't think he'd go along? Unless we're talking life/death situation like the Battle of Hogwarts in which case he wouldn't anyway have a choice. I do agree with your other comment, I think Harry, if not in a life or death situation, would probably endanger the OC by disarming them/blocking their attack in some way. The only solution would be for him to be too far/not there or disarmed and unable to block the OC (physically and magically) (maybe knocked out, half-conscious, busy with another DE, or just without a wand around...). I don't really think he'd just watch and be like "okay great that was the right choice" because he always has that "good boy" behavior, just like when he didn't kill Bellatrix after Sirius' death (which if I may say made me really angry). I guess it really depends on the context and the person's motives (even though it wouldn't matter as much as it matters for the two others).
