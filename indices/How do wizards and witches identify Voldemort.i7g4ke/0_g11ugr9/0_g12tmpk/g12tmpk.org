I would add one caveat to this: the evidence from HBP seems to be that making horcruxes progressively changed Voldemort's appearance. Voldemort lost a piece of soul to Harry on Halloween 1981, and then made another horcrux out of Bertha Jorkins' death before his resurrection. So in GOF he's 2 soul fragments further along than he was when he turned up at Godric's Hollow, so you might expect his appearance to have become more extreme. But it's progress along a scale, so he'd still be recognisable.
