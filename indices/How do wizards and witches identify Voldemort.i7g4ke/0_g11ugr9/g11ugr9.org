  Or did creating Horocruxes alter his appearance?

Yes. By 1981 he, no doubt, looked very similar to, albeit a little better than, what stepped out the cauldron in GoF.

Lord Voldemort's Request, HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.

That was very late 60s-1970.

Bathilda's Secret, DH:

  Nice costume, mister!‚Äù

  He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and ran away

Voldemort's memory of Godric's Hollow.

  Why did these two random wizards identify him as Voldemort if his rebirth supposedly changed his appearance?
#+end_quote

Just a point: Fudge wasn't a random. He was Junior Minister in the Department of Accidental Magic and Catastrophes and was significant enough to be at the scene after Peter blew up the street. And Williamson was an Auror, I think, so chances are high he saw Voldemort before.
