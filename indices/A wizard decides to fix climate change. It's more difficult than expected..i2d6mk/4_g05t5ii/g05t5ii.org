Pollution and trash is talked about in Mischief's Heir, and the final solution is... understandable.

Standard warnings for this fic are: this starts off as over the top crack, complete with over the top bashing. It does settle down by part two of the series, and ends up being a really fun romp for the rest. The tone in part one is not what you'll see in the rest of the series.

It's technically a crossover with the MCU and comics, but whatever you learned via osmosis is good enough if you never watched them. Very minor crossover. linkao3(4629198)
