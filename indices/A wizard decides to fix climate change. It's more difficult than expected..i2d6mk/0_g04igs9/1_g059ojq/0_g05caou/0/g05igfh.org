Not really? I just love the story and like to link it whenever it is relevant. Really, we need more like this to off-set the ridiculous number of muggle-wank we see around.

Edit: I thought you were the one to send the original comment and didn't think much of it, just took the time to look at the complete post to see what you were talking about and saw the original comment again... this is kind of awkward, but I stand by what I said, the story is great and I really love it, so thanks.
