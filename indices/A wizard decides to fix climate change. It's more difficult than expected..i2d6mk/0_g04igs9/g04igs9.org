Dedalus Diggle conjures shooting stars for fun. I think you may be underestimating the scale HP magic is capable of working at.

But ultimately I think looking at it from the angle of scale of the physical quantities involved is the wrong approach. If wizards decided to tackle climate change, it's unlikely that they would choose a solution which works by tipping the balance of the physical mechanisms in play. That's Muggle thinking, not wizarding thinking.

Much more likely is that they would devise a form of magic which directly brings the end result they desire into being. This is generally how HP magic works. Spells are defined teleologically (i.e. by the end result they create), not mechanistically (i.e. by the means they use to create that result). It's the Killing Curse, not the [Insert Means of Death Here] Curse. It's the Summoning Charm, not the Directional Thrust Charm. Etc.

So I can see wizards just getting together to create a global enchantment, or a set of national enchantments, which give wizards direct control over the weather/climate such that they can set the temperature. Like a global/national thermostat. You turn the dial, and the temperature just changes, completely ignoring whatever the temperature "should" be according to physical law.

We know that it's possible to create enchantments at the national scale (e.g. Taboo) and we know that it's possible to manipulate the climate with magic (e.g. Drought Charm), so it's just going to be a matter of combining the two. Unlikely to be easy, but if the global wizarding population are working to achieve it, it doesn't seem outside the realm of their capabilities.
