Magic algae sound great. Probably the best approach to get the massive scale necessary with the very limited manpower of the quite small wizarding world. Although unless you cover a significant part of the oceans in muggle repelling charms it's practically guaranteed that some of these algae will end up under a biologists microscope, so they shouldn't be too blatantly modified. Maybe normal algae treated with growth potions?
