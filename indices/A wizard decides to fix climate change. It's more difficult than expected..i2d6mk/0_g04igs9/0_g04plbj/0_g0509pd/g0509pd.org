  Good point. I do wonder if the direct way of doing it is always better or if there's situations where the indirect "muggle" approach might be preferable.

As you note in your final paragraph, if wizards want to maintain secrecy they need to avoid using magic in a way that would make it obvious to Muggles that something unnatural is occurring. So I think an enchantment of the type described by my post would be very much a last resort type thing - wizards are only going to abandon the statute under very extreme circumstances.

And even then, I can see there being a significant faction of wizards arguing that wizards should just enchant wizarding spaces to be safe, leave the Muggles to their own fate, and then fix the world /after/ Muggle civilisation has collapsed by their own hands. Wizards could probably even restore extinct species using transfiguration.

Probably the best way to do it subtly would be to create some kind of magical algae that reproduces rapidly and eats tons of CO2.
