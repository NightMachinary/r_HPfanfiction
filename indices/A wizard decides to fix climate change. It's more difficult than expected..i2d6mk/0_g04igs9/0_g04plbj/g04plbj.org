Good point. I do wonder if the direct way of doing it is always better or if there's situations where the indirect "muggle" approach might be preferable.

For example, if you're enchanting a broom and the enchantment is supposed to create velocity, then you'd probably have a top speed proportional to how good the quality of the enchantment is, like 150 mph for a firebolt and significantly less for most other brooms.

If an enchantment was added that created acceleration, then that broom might have significant handling problems and other downsides but it may be possible to reach practically arbitrarily high speed. Like 10%c after a few months on an unmanned remotely controlled one. That'd also have kinetic energy similar to a nuke so a creative wizard could have almost untraceable, fallout-free city killers.

A combination of both might be the best.

On the topic of climate, it depends on how difficult the weather modification magic is times the size of the earth (very large!) compared to how difficult it'd be to remove CO2 large scale times human CO2 emissions (a lot!). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, the direct one offers more control but also requires a lot of micromanagement especially if your goal is to ensure that muggle weather scientists don't notice anything.

Removing CO2 requires less management and might be more easily explainable as "I guess forests are just better at soaking up carbon than expected, but it might not last, so hurry up with the Teslas" but it also doesn't allow wizards to control their weather however they want.
