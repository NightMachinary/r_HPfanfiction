This really depends on the exact mechanics of enchantments and such. If it is possible to permanently enchant objects, then it would be possible, over the course of many years to create many thousands of enchanted co2 conversion nodes.

If enchantments require a source of magical energy in order to last, such as leylines, then it would be far more difficult.
