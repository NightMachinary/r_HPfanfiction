Virtually identical story for me as well. Read /Methods/ then also read /Time Braid/ by Shaperv (a Naruto fic) on FFN and got dragged kicking and screaming into that fandom and sub-genre of stories.

Find a story by someone you like, read it, finish it and choke back a tear because you can't read any more, check that author's other stories, check their favorites tab and scan all *those* authors' stories, find one of those you like then rinse and repeat.

Do not, whatever you do, look at bare FFN results in browse mode. The goggles, they do /nothing/.
