I'd seen "Methods of Rationality" linked by several bloggers I read in the span of a few months. I'd normally have dismissed it even so, but I'd heard of the author before in the context of AI ethics debates - the incongruity made me curious and I looked it up. From there, branched out from one author to another using their own "Favourite Stories/Authors" tabs on FF.net until my preconceptions about the field had largely faded and I went looking for more on my own.
