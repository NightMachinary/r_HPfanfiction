I actually saw a fanmix posted on tumblr. "Alone With You: A Draco and Hermione Fanmix". I was high and it made me cry. So then I tried some creative googling and found Isolation. That was like 8pm on a Sunday. 8am Monday I had finished Isolation, Heavy Lies The Crown, We Learned the Sea and The Fallout. That was August of last year. I then went in to work exhausted. My coworker asked what was up and I find out she's a Dramione shipper too. I obviously love going to work with her, and have lasted at this job this long.
