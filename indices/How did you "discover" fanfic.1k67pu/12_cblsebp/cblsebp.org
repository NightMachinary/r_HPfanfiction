My first ever fic was [[http://www.debbiesfics.com/darkness00.html][Draco in Darkness]] by Plumeria and subsequently every fic on her site, to which I've linked. I cannot for the life of me remember how I stumbled upon it, as it's been 8-10 years now. It was probably the result of googling everything Harry Potter I could while waiting for whichever the next book was to come out.
