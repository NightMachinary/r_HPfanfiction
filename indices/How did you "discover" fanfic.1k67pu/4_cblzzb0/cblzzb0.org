I had always been one of those people who thought that the people who read and write fanfic were weird and I wanted nothing to do with it. If it wasn't in the book, I didn't want to read it. About two years ago, I was searching for a topic to write my senior thesis on while at Dragon*Con. I told someone I had just met of my problem and she suggested I do my thesis on fan fiction. Four months later I started researching fan fiction and a month after that I started reading HP and OUaT fanfics. I have been reading fanfic for over a year now and even posted a few of my own.
