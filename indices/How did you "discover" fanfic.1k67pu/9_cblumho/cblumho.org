I feel so old answering this, which is RIDICULOUS because I'm only 26...

... But I found Sailor Moon fanfiction in 6th grade. I've been happily reading recommended fics (even for source material I've never watched/read) ever since.

I once wrote a short Sailor Moon/Ranma 1/2 fanfic without having watched Ranma 1/2. I was praised for my accurate portrayals of Ranma characters. Caused me quite the giggle-fit.
