After my third or fourth time reading the series, I had lots of questions/opinions and wanted to discuss them with people. So I did a google search for some of my questions and up popped a few links to fanfiction stories.

My first fanfic was [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127020][The Hogs Head]] on SIYE. Canon Compliant H/G, Ginny's seventh year and Harry's first year out of school and free of Voldemort.
