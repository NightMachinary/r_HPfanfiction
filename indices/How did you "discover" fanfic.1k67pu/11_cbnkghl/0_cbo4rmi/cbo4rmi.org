I actually started with Kim Possible fanfiction about seven years ago after seeing some adorable pictures based on certain stories. From there, I occasionally branched out into other categories.

I got my start in the HP fandom after I was watching one of the movies, and just had the stray thought, "I wonder what Harry/Luna would be like."

The rest is history.

Edit: That wasn't supposed to be a replay, but apparently I'm bad at Reddit.
