I think it started after reading OoTP. I was craving more HP and couldn't get it from re-reading the original. I was reading loads of weird theories of veritaserum.com and by chance encountered the 'fanfiction' section where people would write their own take on book 6/7. So that helped until Book 6 came along.

After HBP I was reading some weird theories (Dumbledore didn't die, etc) and then I encountered HP and the seventh horcrux. I got sucked into it as though it was an original by JK herself and never looked back after that. I started reading loads of Trio fics and only recently stumbled upon FF.net
