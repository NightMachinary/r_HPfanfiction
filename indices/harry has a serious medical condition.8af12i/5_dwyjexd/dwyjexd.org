I have a strange obsession with hypertrichosis recently, so...visualise a Harry with that?

And maybe everyone assumes he botched an animagus transformation when trying to emulate his parents?

I saw one that was never finished (or got past the first few chapters, though they were good) where Harry was stuck with transforming from human to basilisk every sunset and back every sunrise, too, if you like magical diseases. linkffn(5915237)
