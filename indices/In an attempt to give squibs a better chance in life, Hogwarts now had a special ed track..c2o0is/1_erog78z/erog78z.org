The problem is that like many of the parallels in JKRs work, the no magic= disability one does not really hold up.\\
The goal of special education (at least in the US) is to level the playing field by teaching the same standards in different ways or a different time frame so that the education given is equal for all. Given the nature of the curriculum at Hogwarts, they would never be able to access even the most basic of classes. In magical society, being a Squib is severely handicapping with regards to learning magic. Creating a special ed track only intensifies Squibs as third class citizens similar to the institutionalization of those with any type of disability in the past. Essentially, Squibs would be in what is commonly referred to as a Functional Life Skills Class because they need to be taught basic (muggle) skills in order to flourish.\\
Actually, I think this is kind of the Idea you mean OP (sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth). A better solution would be another school where people know about magic, so the students don't have to hide, but is otherwise a completely Muggle Secondary School Here is where the "no magic= disability" breaks down because removing a Squib from the magical environment removes their "disability". I'm hard-pressed to think of a disability that disappears completely with an environment change.\\
For example, I have a disability that makes it so I cannot drive. I can change my environment to a city with good public transit and mitigate the need for this. If I was rich, I could hire a driver, but regardless I will never be able to get around entirely on my own even if I wanted to. On the other hand, Squibs can change where they live and hold productive lives. They can provide for themselves, travel, and communicate. That isn't to say it would be easy, but the challenges would have more to do with fixed mindsets rather than a physical or mental barrier they are unable to overcome.
