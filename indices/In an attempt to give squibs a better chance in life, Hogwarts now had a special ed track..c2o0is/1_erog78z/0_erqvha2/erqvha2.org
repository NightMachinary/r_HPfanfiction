I mean there are plenty of write arounds for that. Runes, arithmancy, astronomy, care of magical creatures don't necessarily require a wand....even potions sometimes. And for the parts that do, you could have a "programmable" wand that heats a cauldron or does a specific set of tasks or something.

Like wands for people whose magical energy was...stunted.
