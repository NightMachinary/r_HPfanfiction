I guess I see your point but I've also assumed that most things require some activating or latent magic or something. It would still be hard to sell me on the fic concepts. I suppose that such "technology" as programmable wands" could be written but even if it is written well, I'm not sure I could buy a story where a character wants to stay in their culture as a third class citizen when they don't have to.
