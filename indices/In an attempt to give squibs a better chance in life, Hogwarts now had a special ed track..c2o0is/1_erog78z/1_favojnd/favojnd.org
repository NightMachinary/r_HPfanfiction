In England and Scotland, pupils in special education classes can be exempt from the curriculum. In fact, where I am it is entirely acceptable to teach zero typical education skills (e.g., a target of following time table and accepting adult direction could mean only playing their favourite games for a year). In fact, we are asked to consider whether we are making things overly 'education' looking unnecessarily, for example if you're teaching fine motor then handwriting sheets are boring and unengaging.

Some children will be in special schools (separate schools) that have greater resources, but many will be in resource bases attached to a mainstream school. These pupils are not treated as third class citizens.

I think the difficulty with squibs and the muggle world is that in many cases they may never have seen the muggle curriculum until they reached 11, when no letter came. Some squibs may adjust well, but for others the magical world has their family and their culture. To exist in the muggle world, they would have to lie.

In England, especially the muggle curriculum for primary is hardcore these days for English (especially grammar), maths and science. (In the 90's, not quite so much.) In Scotland, the curriculum is more broad but that would mean that the squids would need a wider range of information and decent grasp on Burns' poetry (I jest, mostly).

I think there could be space for extra classes for the wizards too and that, if nothing else, the squibs could travel via Hogsmeade for stuff like muggle studies. It needs a revamping anyway!

Arguably, it could be a bit like Deafness. If everyone was Deaf and spoke their national sign language, then there would be no barrier. This is why many Deaf people don't consider themselves disabled.

Squibs could do many paperwork jobs in the magical world that they're just not given access to. Similarly, they could be shop owners, radio broadcasters.

Whereas leaving would be like being forced to move country, despite being an otherwise rounded person.

It's something I've pondered many times and I suppose the answer would be on a squib by squib basis. The logical thing would be for the Hogwarts letters to go out earlier, or a dual education schooling (Hogwarts or elsewhere) where pupils took a mix of muggle core subjects and do-able wizarding subjects for the first couple of years. It's typical for English pupils to pick their subjects in the year their turn 13, with another round of picking at 16.

I could imagine a class such as 'Arithmancy and Mathematics'.

So a squib COULD get away with English, Maths and Science (though job hunting, English and Maths is all that will be asked for) for GCSE. Though 5 minimum is preferred (I did 13 subjects). Potentially with the other two as electives. Then 3 subjects for A Level (usually pupils do 4 for the first year and drop the weakest, but some do 5 the whole way through).

Wales have a less threatening but similar approach to England. They have Welsh GCSEs.

In Scotland, although it's expected that you get 5 Standards to do Highers, universities accept that you can progress straight to Highers. So, in theory a squib could do a mixed education and not need to study for exams until the 16 - 18 phase. Probably need to start a bit earlier to get the background in.

Alternatively, they could do SVQs or apprenticeships. Potentially doing mixed until 18 and then joining muggle only but this would require them to have a back story which would be more challenging.
