SPOILERS

â€‹

The first few chapters of The After Life have some of the most well articulated Weasley-bashing I've ever read. And I loathe Weasley-bashing. There's this gut-wrenching scene where the Weasleys meet Hermione's parents in Muggle London and they come across as smelly hobo tourists laughing at the 'quaint' Muggles. Hermione is embarrassed and her mum and dad are incensed. It's pretty good stuff.

Aaaaaand then about chapter 8 or so Ginny becomes homicidal and the Weasleys are secretly dark and there's soul bond phoenix magic wank with NO TAGS to indicate any of it. It's a shame because if the fic had just focused on the emotions like it did in the early part it could have been great. Instead it ends with Hermione dueling Ginny in a cage match in the Great Hall. And the Weasleys get sterilized. And Arthur is a traitor who's been selling info to the Muggles. Stop.
