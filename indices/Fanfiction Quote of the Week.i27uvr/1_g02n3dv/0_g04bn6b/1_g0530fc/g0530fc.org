Sort of?

Its absolutely hilarious, top tier humor fic if you have a passing knowledge of D&D. However it goes /completely/ off the rails in the way that makes me think the writer bit off more than they could chew and the solution is to /keep stuffing their gob/.

It's one of those fics where it's fine to give up once you lose interest.
