  It's 1841. Jackson Overland - intelligent, gentle, and lonely - struggles with his humdrum existence in his small Norwegian town. One night, he sees something he was never supposed to: a creature shrouded in mystery that brought fear to his village ever since he was young... and Jack can't keep away, for he discovers the being is capable of communication, understanding... and love.
