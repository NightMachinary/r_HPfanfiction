Have you read the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, then? It's a somewhat different take on Sirius raising Harry from age eight, book five is still in progress. No pairing for Harry yet, although there was an interesting fake-dating subplot and the canonical (though earlier) failed relationship with Cho. I quite like it for making everyone just people; no /deus ex machina/ Black family magic, no character bashing, Harry simply gets a flawed-but-caring parental figure.
