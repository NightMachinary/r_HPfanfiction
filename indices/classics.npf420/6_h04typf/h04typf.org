My favourite fanfiction is probably "A second chance" by Breanie, and that's because Harry and Sirius are my favourite characters and THEY DESERVED so much better so I like reading fanfictions with Sirius raising him and being a father figure. It's still a WIP and I'm like 100 chapters behind but I'm reading it very slowly when I'm in the mood for it.

(I mainly spend time reading fanfictions with this trope)

I don't know if you like reading Dramione, but "The fallout" was probably the fanfiction I was the most emotionally attached to. It's a canon divergent story that focuses on the war against Voldemort and where the OOTP is actually active (not like in canon). It's quite heavy though because it focuses on Hermione's mental health and how she copes with everything (she's NOT like canon but has more realistic troubles). I still need to re-read it but can't get myself to do it because it's an emotional rollercoster and Everythursday's (or sage) writing style needs you to really focus into what you're reading.

My personal favourite (although I don't know if you could consider it a classic? ) is "Blood Binding" by SphinxScribe. It's about James and Lily somehow combing back to life after the graveyard scene. I love Jily and really believe the marauders deserved so much better (aside from Pettigrew). Plus Harry meeting his parents is so wholesome I just wanted to read more, but unfortunately it only talks about 5th year. It has an "open ending" so we never really know what happens next.

Edit : If you like Sirimione and Time travel then maybe try reading "Sands of destiny" by amidtheflowers. It's a WIP though and wasn't updated since 2020.
