Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is definitely old enough to be a classic, and is one of my personal favourites, unfortunately incomplete and only very occasionally updated (about once every three years). FFN deleted it for bogus reasons; the only place to get chapter 43 now is the community-maintained PDF/eBook [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/latest][on Github]].

Adult Harry finishes off Voldemort after thirteen years of war, but every other character is dead and everywhere is destroyed, so he gambles his life on an experimental technique to send his soul back in time. Where he sets out to make things go differently this time around. As well as having a good balance of foreknowledge with unexpected "butterfly of doom" happenings cropping up, I like the way it's very character-focused; instead of wrapping things up with a quick Horcrux hunt, it has Harry rebuilding his relationships with his friends and preparing them. (After all, taking down Tom may be his special mission, but Voldemort was merely a catalyst for existing forces. Even if they can take him out early, there could still be a war.)
