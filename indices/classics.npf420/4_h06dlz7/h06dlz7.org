In my mind, the classics are those that actually built a reputation big enough that people were faking them as bootleg copies of the actual books.

For example: "Harry Potter and the Phoenix Order" and its sequel "Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients". The author of those stories was really creative but he was probably also writing for the first time. "Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent" was a bit of a shock for my eleven year old mind because I didn't expect sex scenes in a Harry Potter book when I fell for it in my awaiting of OotP. I believe the original Mary Sue who was transferred from a different school and had magical creature blood was the protagonist from a story called "Veela" which was surprisingly well written given the theme.

In terms of stories that can still be found today on ff:

- LogicalRaven's Harry Potter's years 6 and 7 and their sequel;

- NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series;

- Vekin87's Albus Potter series;

- War is Over was really popular about six-seven years ago but people sort of forgot about it;

- The Red Dragons Order saga.
