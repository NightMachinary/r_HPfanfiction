I agree with the other comment suggesting playing Hogwarts mystery, your little avatar thing interacts with him a lot and it's a really neat aspect of the game imo. As for fanfics, Order of Mercy on I think ff.net is a solid pick, percy, bill, fleur, and an oc are the main stars. It focuses on percy, bill, and fleur's personal quests and activities during the war and is very moving.
