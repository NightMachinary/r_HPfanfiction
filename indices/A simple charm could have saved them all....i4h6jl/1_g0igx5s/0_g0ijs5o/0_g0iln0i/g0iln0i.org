You are right, after checking. But even so, the cup was intended to be a portkey by the organisers and why would it even cross any of the champions' minds that they should check if the cup was a portkey? I'm sorry to say but your prompt just doesn't make much sense and seems more like pushing a character to do this instead of this because /you/, the writer, knows the plot point while the character doesn't and possibly couldn't know.
