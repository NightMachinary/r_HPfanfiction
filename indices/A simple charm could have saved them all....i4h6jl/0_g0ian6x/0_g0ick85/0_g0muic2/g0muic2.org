I always assumed the cup was meant to be a portkey that brought the winner out of the maze. It'd explain why portkeys were allowed to work and why it went there when Harry used it to escape.

If the portkey were merely two way or intended to deposit Harry's body in the maze so it looks like an accident then it's go back to the middle.
