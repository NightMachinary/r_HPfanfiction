/Portus/ is the charm that creates Portkeys.

Casting /Portusrevelio/ presumably reveals nearby Portkeys, much like casting /Homenum Revelio/ reveals nearby humans.

Arthur Weasley and Amos Diggory are amused by their children having to aimlessly search for the Portkey, and thus do not mention the spell's existence, nor do they cast it, as a little prank.

However, had they mentioned or taught it to Cedric or Harry, they /might/ have thought to cast it on the Cup (after all, it would be totally in-character for that -ed up tournament to booby-trap the Cup), and then triggered it without touching it to see what would happen. Alternately, they might think to check the Cup immediately after ending up in the GY, and /perhaps/ might have used it to return before Pettigrew could murder Cedric and Stun Harry.

Had they done so, Voldemort's plan would have failed and at the very least, his return would have been delayed.

Considering Amos' heartrending grief over his son's corpse, one can only imagine the if-only guilt he would feel should he come to follow the above chain of thought...
