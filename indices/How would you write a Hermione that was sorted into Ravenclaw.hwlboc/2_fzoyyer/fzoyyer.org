In one sentence, happier, with more friends, even more of an overachiever, possibly a bit of a "Queen Bee", but also more status-conscious and less eager to rock the boat.

I get the argument that early-canon Hermione's poor social skills are going to be damaging to her prospects in any house, but consider:

- Harry and Ron's (mis)beaviour really did bring out the worst in her; she would be a far more tolerable around people with whom she had something in common and who wouldn't push her buttons; and there would be more such people in Ravenclaw.
- In Ravenclaw, all it would take is one or two classmates with whom she could nerd out, and her social circle would expand from there---even while her social skills improve with practice. Notably, her actual socialising with Harry and Ron is very limited, and she would get a lot more practice in Ravenclaw.
- Hermione is a valuable friend to have for a Ravenclaw, and that is something that would become apparent very quickly.
- Hermione's personality type is not uncommon, particularly in Ravenclaw, and so Ravenclaw as an institution---home to creative types and paper-pushers alike---would know how to integrate people like her.
- Hermione is, in fact, a very gifted child who is fortunate to also be a very disciplined and persistent. This means that even if she inspires jealousy from others in her year, there is little they can do but learn to live with it and try to ride her coattails.

I think it's a mistake to draw parallels between her and Luna. They are completely different people, opposites in most ways, with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Luna is flighty and imaginative; Hermione is grounded and knowledgeable. Luna is generally content to keep to herself; Hermione is actually quite outgoing (even if she is bad at it). Luna passively accepts bullying; Hermione tattles or retaliates. The social difficulties, if any, that either would face would be categorically different.

But, at the same time, having friends to whom she can relate---and no Gryffindor habits or imperative to stand for what's right---would also make her far more reluctant to rock the boat. While she will probably retain enough righteousness to refrain from bullying Luna personally, there is a good chance that she won't take steps to protect her. (If she does try to take Luna under her wing, she will regret it, because she and Luna /will/ clash, but it could make for good comedy.)

She might also be more careful about advocating for House-Elf rights, unless she can convince her friends to join in in earnest. On the other hand, she might just have a bunch of long debates with her friends about the issue, and they would the come to some sensible consensus.
