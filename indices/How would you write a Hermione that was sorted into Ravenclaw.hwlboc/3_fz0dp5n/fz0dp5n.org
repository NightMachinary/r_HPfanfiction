Depends on the context, the viewpoint character(s), the AU elements, etc.

Hermione's major character flaws (at least at the start) are her obsession with following rules & authority figures, and a very strong belief that "true fact" = "written in a book". Those can variously clash, fit in, or be irrelevant to the other Ravens depending on how you characterize her yearmates and the house as a whole.

At the same time, if Hermione outshines her peers hard enough, she might have to deal with jealousy from them (as they presumably have Invested a good part of their Identities with "academically excellent")

How Hermione develops from there can vary wildly as the butterflies accumulate...

Also, we might have to assume headcanon about how canon Hermione felt in Gryffindor to generate the changes (for example, we could assert something like "Hermione had a lot of trouble connecting with her female peers in Gryffindor, as they had too little in common (well, the male ones too, all she had to bond with Harry and Ron was shared trauma). As such, she was very isolated (even after befriending them). In Ravenclaw, she is not so isolated (so, for example, the first Halloween might not end with her crying alone in a bathroom, even if Ron still belittles her for helping him).
