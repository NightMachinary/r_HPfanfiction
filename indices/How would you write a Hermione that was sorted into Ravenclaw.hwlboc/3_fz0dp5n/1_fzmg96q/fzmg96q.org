Mate, you need to read fewer Indy!Harry Manipulative!Dumbledore fics.

Early-canon Hermione only looks obsessed with following rules and obeying authority next to Harry and Ron, who are pathologically incapable of either, even when it's a very good idea. For example, "Don't wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night over a matter of preadolescent honour" is a great rule, especially since you might run into a hungry cerebrus. Hermione, on the other hand, actually thinks about the consequences---such as being expelled from the only place where she, a Muggleborn, can learn magic.

When the situation calls for it, whether it's setting a teacher on fire, petrifying a classmate, or brewing a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients in order to abduct and impersonate three of your classmates in order to question a fourth one, Hermione is downright eager.

On that note, an authority-worshipper would fit right in Ravenclaw all too well: perhaps nominally it's a house of creativity, but in practice, all the magical innovators we see are Gryffindors and Slytherins; and Ravenclaw is largely a house of paper-pushers, with Luna being the odd one out.
