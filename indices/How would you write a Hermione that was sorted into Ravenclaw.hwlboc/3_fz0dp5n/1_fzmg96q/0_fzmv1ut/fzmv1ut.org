I... have read very few such fics, as they tend to contain other tropes I don't much enjoy.

That which I said more or less represents my initial feelings about Hermione when I read the books for the first time, which went on to form the basis of my primary reading of canon.

Also, by sheer chance, I read books 1 and 3 prior to 2, and those two far more often than 2, which also skews my primary perception of Hermione.

That said, even in book 7, she was far too unwilling to steal and kill for my taste.
