Your complaint about Hermione being unwilling to steal and kill applies just as much, or more, to the rest of the trio. I would have /loved/ to see her written as the anti-hero of the group---more so than she already is---but that's not the story JKR wrote.

Basically, Hermione is just as willing to break the rules, but she is not as impulsive about it. Say, Harry is angry, so he uses the Cruciatus. He is about to be discovered by a Death Eater, so he casts the Imperius. Draco is about to cast the Cruciatus on him, so he casts the Secumstempa. But, he doesn't, say, practice using these spells ahead of time. Ordinarily, he is /too/ moral and merciful, to the point of refusing to use the Stunning Spell on a broom-riding enemy because they might be under Imperius.

Hermione, on the other hand, weighs the consequences before she breaks the rules---whether it's kidnapping her classmates, organising a militia in a school, disfiguring a classmate, or jinxing a Quiddich player. Her most impulsive act of violence (that I can recall) is sending the birds to attack Ron.

Hermione does /talk/ about the rules a lot, but, well, it's good to know what the rules are before you break them.
