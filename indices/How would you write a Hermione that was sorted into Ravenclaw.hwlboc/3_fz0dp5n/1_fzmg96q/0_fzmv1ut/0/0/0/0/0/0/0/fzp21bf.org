Thanks for elaborating! I think I get where you're coming from, and I take back and apologise for the insinuation that your view of Hermione was tainted by fanon.

I think that Hermione's reaction to Ron's words was very situational. In general, Hermione is outspoken and aggressive about what she views is the right thing. She ran off crying because,

1. What Ron said was true.
2. Ron didn't actually intend to bully Hermione; he sincerely didn't expect her to overhear. In fact, he was understandably reacting as a child would to being harrased by a classmate for two months.
3. Hermione had, in fact, been thinking that she and Harry and Ron were friends of sorts. Hectoring and unsolicited advice is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship; and if she hadn't been thinking of them as friends, Hermione wouldn't have assumed that refusing to talk to them would be any kind of punishment.

Ron's words rapidly disabused her of that notion; Hermione had been shown in that moment that instead of befriending Harry and Ron, she had antagonised them. Worse yet, she didn't have the insight to even begin to understand why. This would be particularly intolerable to someone like her, who would have been accustomed to breaking down problems and systematically planning and executing solutions. Here, she didn't even know where to start.

And *that's* something to cry all day about.
