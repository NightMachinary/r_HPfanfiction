I deeply distrusted authority figures, especially educational ones. Until proven otherwise, every teacher and administrator is assumed, at best, to be incompetent and indifferent.

I had a terrible temper, I'd have attacked Ron (Levitate him, bashing his head against the ceiling repeatedly springs to mind) rather than running away to cry (then and now, I love teaching and have a tendency to lecture that is even greater than Hermione's). Probably Snape too, although his more subtle sarcasm would have gone right over my head.

I'd very possibly have literally tried to kill in blind rage both Malfoy (mudblood comment in 2nd year at latest) and Snape ("I see no difference"). I'd probably have, unfortunately for me, succeeded, too, at least in Malfoy's case.

As I've said elsewhere, if 11-year-old me was SIed into canon Harry Potter, I'd be dead or in Azkaban by Halloween.
