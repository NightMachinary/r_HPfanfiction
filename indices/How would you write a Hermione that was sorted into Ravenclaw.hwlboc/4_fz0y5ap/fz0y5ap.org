Unfortunately for you, I can refer you to the existing one, linkffn(Hermione in Ravenclaw by snow42). You would have seriously different dynamics in between The Trio, snow42 is right, that they may get together a way later (no troll), and the relationship would develop a way slower (not enough contact).

Yes, she would be probably be extreme loner, but on the other hand, it would be probably more acceptable among Ravens (there is nothing wrong in being introvert there).
