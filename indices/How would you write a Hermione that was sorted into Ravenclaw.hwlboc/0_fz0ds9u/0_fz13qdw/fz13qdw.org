Yeah, I've never bought into the idea that Ravenclaws would be super jealous of a talented peer anywhere between Percy/Hermione talent to Dumbledore/TMR and it's my biggest gripe with HP and the BWL.

It would be her personality that causes her to be an outcast, specifically social ineptness and smugness. And while that made them avoid her in Gryffindor, canon and Pottermore suggests it would put a target on her back Ravenclaw.
