I'd like to see this too- I've seen fics where most muggles are depicted as uncaring or cruel- mostly harsh abused harry fics- fics where harry comes down against muggles or muggle borns for some reason or another, but never a good Voldemort was right fic- but from his point of view, maybe he was right.

It's been implied in a number of fics that he may not have been born evil, that his trophies burned by Dumbledore were from people that bullied him- that the suspicion and distrust from Dumbledore, being a halfblooded- presumed for a while muggle born in slythern all lead to his choices- to torture the pure blooded slytherns while killing the muggles and muggle lovers- and his hate of Dumbledore who kept sending back to the abusive muggles in a time that England was in turmoil.

The only fic that I know of that implies any of this that I can remember is a short oneshot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], which despite the short length I highly recommend.
