Early on I decided not to default on naming chapters 'Chapter One', 'Chapter Two', etc., instead having a chapter have it's own theme. During the planning, if I found that some related activity might fit within a chapter's theme, I might try and rearrange the timing of events so that their recounting would fit together. In several cases this ended up working better than if I'd left the events to occur as originally planned, and in some cases changed how important a character became in the later story.

A pitfall I've run into is where an event /has/ to happen at a point when the rest of the chapter is on a different vibe. At times I would have to rethink the plan, but it typically added to story rather than detract. Aside from that, I find that you have to make potpourri chapters to collect a mess of unrelated but necessary plot elements, usually just when approaching a major conflict- it helps if the messy chapter is quickly forgotten (style-wise) by the awesomeness of the big event chapter.
