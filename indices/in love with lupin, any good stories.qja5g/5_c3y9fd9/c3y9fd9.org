It's probably inappropriate to recommend M-rated fics here, where there are bound to be lots of under-18 readers. Unfortunately, this cuts my list of possible recommendations considerably. :-)

But here's a T-rated Lupin fic a few of us on this subreddit really liked: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2984737/1/Midnight_in_the_Owlery][Midnight at the Owlery]]. (Warning: implied slash.)
