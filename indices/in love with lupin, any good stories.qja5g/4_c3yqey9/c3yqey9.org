I'm a huge Lupin fan too, and I've read a ton of fics based on him. My list isn't any where near complete, but I've posted some of my favorites that I think are worth recommending on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nknx2/a_collection_of_fics_for_remus_lupin_fans/][this post]]. You're sure to find at least a few you'll really enjoy.

But I'm always looking for more too, so would you care to list a few of your favorites for us? Maybe you know of some good ones we haven't come across yet.
