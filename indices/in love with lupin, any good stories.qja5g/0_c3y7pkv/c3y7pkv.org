Aye! I could do with one as well. :) I've been reading one on hpff, it's not particularly well written, but the ideas are quite interesting. It starts off with Harry giving Teddy his father's set of diaries, starting with his life at Hogwarts. It's a WIP, so currently it's up to about the 6th's book (Dumbledore dying and Snape's 'betrayal')...one thing though, not to purposely ruin it, but in this fic, Remus has a crush on Lily (I noticed you said you don't want any Remus/Lily or Remus/Sirius ships)...Anyways, if you could deal with the crush, I think the author stays relatively close to the books, and you're interested in reading the fic, I'll link you. :)
