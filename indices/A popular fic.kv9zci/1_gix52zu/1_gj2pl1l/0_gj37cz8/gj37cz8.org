If I recall correctly there are mentions of rape but most of those are concerning the destroyed universe world that Harry leaves (voldemort and he fought to a draw each killing everyone else). There is also a rape discussed in the new universe and Harry is pretty brutal in achieving justice. The story is 288K+ words but it's been a while and I don't recall/think any of them were descriptive instead I think they were just statements that it happened.
