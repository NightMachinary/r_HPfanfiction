This is probably most easily explained by the fact that the medium of writing just isn't suited to large menageries of creatures that the author will have to describe in detail and also the reader will have to imagine properly from those descriptions. The amount of people who have both the skill to write good fanfic /and/ do justice to imaginary creatures is staggeringly low.
