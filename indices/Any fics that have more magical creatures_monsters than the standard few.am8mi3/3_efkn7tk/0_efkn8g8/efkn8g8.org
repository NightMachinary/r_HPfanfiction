  “And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer, because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit.” --Shane Koyczan, “To This Day”If someone told Percival Graves he'd spend his fortieth year as a fugitive on the run from MACUSA, in the company of an Obscurial, a smuggler, a Legilimens, and a No-Maj, he would've put them in an institution. But now, after a near-miraculous survival of captivity at Grindelwald's hands, he's become a wanted man because he can no longer in good conscience uphold the laws he'd once vowed to protect.This is the story of a man on the run, haunted by more ghosts than he cares to count, on a journey that will span an entire continent. This is the story of how Percival Graves saved Credence Barebone from execution; how he fled New York in Newt Scamander's suitcase; how he got something he never thought he needed: a family. Complete.
