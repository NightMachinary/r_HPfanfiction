I read this really good book on Wattpad called "Silently Falling" where the main character can't talk due to trauma. It's not fanfiction but since you said you're interested in books with characters who use sign language I thought I'd mention it. I've reread it a few times since it's so good.

  "Sunshine, what guy do you know has a weird fetish with sign language?"

  She's the aftermath of a high school party nightmare. Tragedy robbed her of her innocence and stole her voice before she had the chance to speak out. The court called her a liar, and the guilty was set free. Now memories plague her mind and trap her in solitude.

  She was forced to learn sign language, struggling to find a way to voice her silence.

  He's the definition of the boy she tried to stay away from. The epitome of harsh rumours and hopeless fantasies. The source of lies and blame. He's analyzed, misunderstood, and utterly mysterious.

  And he may be the one to find her voice.

  When they meet, she gets accustomed to his arrogance and he gets accustomed to her silence. An essay is what brings them together, but what happens when he starts asking too many questions?

  Will her past continue to drag her down, or will he save her?

  Fate has a funny way of bringing people together, but it doesn't always work how it's supposed to.
