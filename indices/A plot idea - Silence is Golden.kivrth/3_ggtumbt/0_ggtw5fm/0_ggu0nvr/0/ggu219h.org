You've pretty much nailed it, that's why people would be unsure around her at first.

I also had an idea for a scene where she is learning to do magic. One of her professors (it was Flitwick in my head) has noticed that she struggles due to being non-verbal, so is giving one to one tuition.

The method Flitwick uses is to have Daisy hold her wand while Flitwick uses it to perform a Lumos spell (so both are holding the wand). In this way, Daisy is encouraged to learn the feel of the magic for spells, and can eventually learn to replicate it herself without saying the incantation aloud.

In this way, it would be much more of a struggle for her to learn magic, but when she has cracked it she's at an advantage because literally all her magic is non-verbal.
