I think this is an intriguing idea and I'd love to read it. It kind of reminds me of the premise of Ella Enchanted... and her character arc was that she had to undo the spell herself.

Imagine how frustrating it would be to not be able to get people's attention except visually... I think it would make a person feel almost invisible. I think that people would start noticing the eerie silence around her... no rustling, no breath, no shuffling, no cough or sneeze... a void of noise.
