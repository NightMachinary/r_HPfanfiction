I'm glad you like the concept!

In my head, the silence extended to anything where she would be directly making a noise. Therefore, if she were wearing shoes, it would be silent since it's attached to her, but beating a drum (to use your example) would probably make noise, since she's inducing something else to make the noise. Same applies if she drops something, glass for example. If she was to tap the glass, silence. If she drops the glass and it shatters, people notice.

Whatever rules that apply, they'd have to be consistent.
