I'd love to read this! Sign language has always been a bit of a special interest of mine so I love reading about characters that use it haha

The specifics of why she's silent sound interesting too! I can imagine how unnerving it would be for her classmates never hearing her approach. I wonder, how far does this reach? If footsteps are silent, does that include when she's wearing shoes? If she was holding a mallet, would it not make a noise against a drum? If that's the case could she silence something by touching it? How close to touching something could she get before it stops making noise?

Sorry for the textwall, this is just a fascinating concept to me!
