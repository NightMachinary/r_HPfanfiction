Wizards still wear glasses -not just Harry - this means they still hadn't come up with something to help with vision issues.

So, it's clear that, for whatever reasons, they hadn't solve everything yet.

So, a character can be born mute or deaf and wizards hadn't find the fix.

That being said, I think it's a moot point for this particular prompt, since I found very interesting to explore the full effect of not making any noises. Not even clapping or footstep or anything.

Which Daisy here use to play pranks, but could be both very useful in other ways, but also not so great. How she gains attention from someone that can't see her ?

Say, Hermione is coming her way with a tower of books that block her vision, for some reason Daisy can't get out of her way. Someone abled would just say stop. Someone mute could still clap or make noises to avoid the collision? What does Daisy can do ?
