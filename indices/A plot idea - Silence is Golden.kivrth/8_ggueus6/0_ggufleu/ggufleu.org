That's a really interesting idea about using signs to create spells. Perhaps a specialist tutor could be brought in to teach her.

I see your point about the cerebral nature of the story. However, I think there may be ways she could learn to communicate with others. There's always written notes (she could use something similar to the paper airplane memos at MoM), or perhaps if it's set in a time where Dumbledore is alive, he can teach her to use the same "ribbon" conjuration he uses to display the lyrics to the school song in PS. That could give her the option to have her own personal subtitles.
