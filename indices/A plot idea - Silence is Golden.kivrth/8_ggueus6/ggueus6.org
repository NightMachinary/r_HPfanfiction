One thing that could be interesting to explore is using sign as the starting point of a new casting system. Honestly, the words aren't even necessary, as shown by everyone being required to learn silent casting in 11th grade (6th year). Everyone! (Well, those taking wand-related classes, anyway.) So, basically the words are just a crutch for the apprentice caster, and that kind of crutch could be replaced by hand and arm gestures, like the somatic component of spells in games like D&D. She'd need to figure out how to handle both gesturing the "words"/feelings/whatever the spell needs as well as the casting motions, but even those are also not really necessary. She could combine the wand movements with her own brand of pseudo-sign (similar to the pseudo-Latin used in the books) to make her own casting system that would be difficult for others to understand or counter.

The only big problem I see with such a story is that it would be really cerebral, very inside her head, since a bunch of 11-year-olds aren't going to learn how to sign just to talk with her. Hell, not even the teachers would. So unless she also gains some form of telepathy (basic Occlumency plus basic Legilimency?), which might scare the crap out of people, she's going to be very, very alone. And that's kinda boring to read. No interactions in a school setting for kids doesn't leave a lot of room for plot.

Oh, and she could also concentrate on the "witchcraft" part of the curriculum, the part that doesn't use wands. That's more than half of the classes! Only three require wands. So if she specializes in potions, herbology, creatures, history, astronomy (and maybe rituals?), arithmancy, runes, etc. she won't even need a wand.

And for communication, while she can't use a transcription charmed quill, maybe a thought-transcribing quill could save time?
