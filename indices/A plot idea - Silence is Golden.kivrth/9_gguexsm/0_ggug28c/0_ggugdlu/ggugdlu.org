I really like the idea that Daisy turns out the best essays, which stuns her classmates since she doesn't talk.

I see your point about Houses, but I do think that if she were in Slytherin, she may get a bit more in the way of bullying.

I think this is an absolutely great idea. If I weren't so devoted to my KH fanfic (320,000 words and counting), I may try this myself.

Oh, and one more question! You mentioned that Daisy likes sneaking up on her dad. Does he ever try to sneak up and try to grab her? Or is her hearing really, really refined?
