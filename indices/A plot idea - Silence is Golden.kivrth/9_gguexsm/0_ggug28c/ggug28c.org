You're right, she would certainly be able to excel in the less spell-based subjects. Essay writing would probably come easily to her.

Regarding house, I can see an argument to go to all four really. You mentioned valid reasons for Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Hufflepuff may be an option as they are the most accepting of all the others, and would be least likely to ostracise her because of her condition. Slytherin would likely see the enforced silence and it's inherent sneakiness potential as a boon too.
