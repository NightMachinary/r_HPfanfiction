Fascinating idea! I would love to read this.

So Daisy is non-verbal, but it's all she's known. She's never going to speak. There's a lot of things to explore with this.

She cannot speak, so some branches of magic--Charms, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts--would be very difficult for her, regardless of how sympathetic the professor is.

Other branches--Astronomy, History of Magic, Herbology, and to some degree Potions--would not be more difficult. At least at first--more advanced Potions does appear to require incantations.

So right off the bat, you have a potential for Daisy to connect with the Herbology professor. Whether it's Professor Sprout or Neville, I think there's something to explore there.

On the flip side, depending on when this is set, in her Potions class, Professor Snape may find her quietness as deliberate disrespect. If Snape is cruel to Daisy because of this, it may be interesting if Daisy is reduced to silent tears.

If she's constantly writing, she's probably reading quite a bit as well. She could be an excellent essayist, especially if she's taken to writing her essays as epistles. You could have her be able to get higher marks on the written exams and papers than Hermione--but Hermione could be dismissive since /"Daisy can't actually cast magic."/

What House would she be in?

Her playful sneakiness seems awfully Gryffindor-y, and I think she'd get along well with Ginny if she offers to help prank the Twins.

On the other hand, given her closeness with her father, becoming friends with Luna, who also adores her daddy has a certain sense to it. Two odd birds of a feather in Ravenclaw.

Keeping in mind, she's non-verbal, Daisy may well be the target for bullies. If they do something to hurt her hands--say, a Stinging Jinx, for example--then there's no way for her to communicate with a professor who did this to her.
