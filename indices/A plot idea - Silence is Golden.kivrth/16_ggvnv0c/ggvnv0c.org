I'm DHH (Deaf/Hard of Hearing) I was born hard of hearing but with in just enough residual hearing to use hearing aids since I was a baby. I was also mainstreamed in a hearing school in a rural area with few specialized resources using my hearing aids, a tool called an FM system where the teacher clips a microphone as close to their mouth as they can, usually on the top of their shirt, and their speechius directly transmitted into my hearing aids. It was the 90s so my side used a mixed of the made up systems signed english and SEE 1 and 2, which are made up by hearing people and no where near completely full native languages like ASL or spoken English.

Deaf and dute and such use of signed language is usually dint in a pretty stereotypical way to DHH people and against our cultural norms. People mean well byt patronizing and infabtilizing DHH people is just as destructive as blatant discrimination if not more so.

This can be well done but please be aware of these things and Deaf cultures to start off kn the right foot. Too often I see unrealistic and patronizing results.

If you or anyone has questions about this Deaf/HoH/deaf mufe, it characters that use a real po sign language like ASL or BSL let me know and hopefully I can help some!!
