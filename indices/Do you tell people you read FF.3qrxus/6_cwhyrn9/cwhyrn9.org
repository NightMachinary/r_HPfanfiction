Oh yes, I'll talk about a good piece of fanfiction like I would a good book. I've actually met a surprising number of other people who also read fanfiction that way! It's a great thing to bond over, especially when you can say you know the person who wrote a particular story.

Both my parents also know that I like to write fanfiction, and I've shown my mum my stories because she's interested. She's always been super enthused about reading them.

So the OP asked how do people react when I mention fanfiction? Honestly, the worst is just a 'huh' and it's ignored. The best reaction was mentioning it to a colleague whom I worked closely with and finding out that he reads fanfiction too! We nerded out over Game of Champions by Lamora, and from then on at work I had a buddy I could talk about good stories with.

Usually, people just seem interested in the novel conversation topic, and ask some questions about it. It's easy to see who has tried it before - the ones with the strongest negative reactions are really going to be people who have tried it and never found a good story. Then you can laugh with them about the hordes of bad stories out there and explain how the bad is godawful, but the good is /amazing/.

I used to feel like it was something to be embarrassed about, when I was younger! But why should that be the case? There's a lot of stories out there that are absolute gems, enthralling or poignant and so very worth the time to read. I trust in my own tastes enough to think that whoever I'm talking to would agree with me, if they were to read the story themselves. So how could I be ashamed of that?

Ultimately, fanfiction's been a huge part of my life for eight years now - and I've met many of the best friends you could hope to have through it. So, yes - I talk to people about it. If my opinion can encourage anyone else to try it, that's a plus in my book.
