I once made the mistake of telling my mum I was reading fanfiction online. Later that week we went to visit my grandparents and the topic of books came up, Mum told me to explain my "online story thing" to everyone. So, yeah, that's how I ended up having a conversation about Snarry with my 86 year old grandmother and half a dozen other assorted family members.

Keep your smut to yourselves, kids. Or, at least don't share it with family.
