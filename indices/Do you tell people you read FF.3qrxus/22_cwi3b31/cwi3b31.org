I was first made aware of HP fan fiction back around 2003. At the time, my understanding was that it consisted of entirely Harry/Draco slash. So I didn't look into it because that's not my cup of tea.

About 1.5 years ago, I got into fan fiction. My sister is an avid reader, and mainly ships Snape/Hermione.
