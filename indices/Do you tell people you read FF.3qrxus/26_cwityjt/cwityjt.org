Conversation between my brother and me when he was visiting last weekend. "What chu writing?" I close my laptop lid slowly. "Nothing." "Is it Harry Potter fanfiction?" "...Maybe." /dies a little inside/ "That's cool. I'm re-reading PoA at the moment. I forgot how awesome it is" Harry Potter conversation ensues. Delighted!
