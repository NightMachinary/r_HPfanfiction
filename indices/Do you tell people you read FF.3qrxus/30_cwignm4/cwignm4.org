I'm pretty open about it. If people ask if I like any particular pairings I usually say no (true to an extent) because I favor non pairing independent!harry. I basically say that I read the stories that veer off the books, alternate realities, etc.

Most people I know don't care too much but they might think me bizarre anyway so fanfiction is hardly a drop in the bucket.
