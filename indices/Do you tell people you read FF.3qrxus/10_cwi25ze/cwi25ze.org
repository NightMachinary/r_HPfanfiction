I'm in graduate school to be a mental health professional, so everyone in my cohort is super validating and supportive. I don't go super into it, but if they ask, I answer. Everybody's got their thing: some people play fantasy football, some rewatch Gilmore Girls for the umpteenth time...me, I read and write fanfiction. I think it's pretty well known that there are higher caliber fanfictions out there, especially in the Harry Potter universe. There are quite a few published authors who readily admit that they started out as fanfiction authors...and I'm not just talking about Fifty Shades of Gray. I like to use Naomi Novak as an example. I want to actually publish something some day, so if people ask me what I'm writing, I usually say something along the lines of: "Oh, just a story based off of Harry Potter. I'm waiting for the perfect story to come along, but until then, I just write fanfiction. That way I can practice writing and still have fun." Most of my friends think it's a pretty cool hobby, and if they don't like it, they've never said anything to me.
