I used to hide the fact that I read fanfiction but being visibly trans changes how much you care about what people think of you.

If they ask me what I've been doing or what I'm reading I sure do.

Couple people didn't know what fanfiction was, some people ask me which fandoms I'm into (those are the best), a few people make a derogatory comment or two and most people say something like "Oh, thats cool..." before moving on to another topic.
