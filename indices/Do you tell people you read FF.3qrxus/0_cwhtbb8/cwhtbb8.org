I will take the secret to my grave being into FF instantly marks you as a teenage girl or a raging pervert (possibly both).

Honestly FF is its own worst enemy in this regard seeing as most of it is a poorly writen attempt to sleep with the characters through writing usualy slash or severus snape (or again possibly both).

edit just thought of an analogy it's kind of like being overwieght and into anime only worse (disclaimer not into anime)
