I used to hide it, but I tell all my friends now. No shame. I wouldn't tell people at work though.

The thing is, if I get a chance to explain why I like it there's no problem, but if I don't have that opportunity then people draw their own (usually incorrect) opinions, and that isn't all that great.

The problem with colleagues at work is that conversations are much more typical and it would seem odd to explain in detail why I read hpff.
