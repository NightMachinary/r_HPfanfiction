Im 22F in graduate school and I will usually tell people. I might brush it off if it's someone that I don't know well and they're just asking to be polite, but I'm generally fine engaging in conversation about it. Most of my friends are into fandom stuff and most of the people I'm in class with, I can point out the interesting cultural implications to. And if people think I'm just SO weird (which I don't think has happened since, maybe, high school) aren't generally worth my time.
