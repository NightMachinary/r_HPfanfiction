A few weeks ago, a new friend to our group let it slip that he enjoys fan fiction (we're in our 20s). So I let them all know that I've been reading it since I was 13; the stuff I read might be considered a little dorky by some, but it shouldn't surprise anyone who knows me and my love for Harry Potter.

Edit: it may help that my friend group is a bit quirky as it is
