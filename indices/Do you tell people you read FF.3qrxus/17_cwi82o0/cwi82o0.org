If they ask me, I'll them them. But its not something I'd use as a conversation starter since so many have no idea what ff actually is.

I do not think its "ultra gay" as you put it. Its a legit way to spend time and if someone judges me for doing so, I'll at least have a good grasp on that persons character.

Also, kindly refrain from using gay in a derogative way. It makes you look like an utter imbecile.
