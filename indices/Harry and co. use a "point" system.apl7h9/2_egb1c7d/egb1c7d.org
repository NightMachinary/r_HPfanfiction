Gave me an idea.

They make a point system for whenever someone does something like one of the other Houses.

Obviously, it can get to the point where the trio has the most points to the House the fandom thinks they are, but then Cormac gets "Dumbass House" points for every stupid thing that he does (remember when he said he ate Doxy eggs for a bet? 50 points to Dumbass).
