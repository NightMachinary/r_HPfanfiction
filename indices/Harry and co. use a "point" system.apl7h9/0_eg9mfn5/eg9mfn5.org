That is linkffn(The Brightest Black) by Enigmaticrose4

From the Author's note: Points of change -- 1) Sirius did not go to check on Pettigrew and find him gone, he got assigned on patrol instead. 2) Bellatrix got a hankering for some bloodshed and randomly picked the Grangers from a list of muggleborns she was given.
