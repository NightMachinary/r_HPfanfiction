Keeps Ron and Ginny as the great people they are too.

Harmony fic where Harry and Hermione grow closer while working on an extremely dangerous case for Department of Magical Enforcement. Epilogue-compliant. Trust me, this is one the GREATEST Harmony fics written. You'll regret it if you don't read.
