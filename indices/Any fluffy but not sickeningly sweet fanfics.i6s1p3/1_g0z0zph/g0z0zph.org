Northumbrian does a lot of post-Hogwarts slice-of-life fics that might suit you. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is about Harry and Ginny and their young children moving into a new neighbourhood in the countryside, written mostly from the point of view of one of their Muggle neighbours. There's a background plot about Harry's work as an Auror, but most of it is just fleshing out how a wizarding family would live, with the interesting twist of seeing how it looks from the outside.
