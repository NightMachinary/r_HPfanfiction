It's a plot point in the "Perfectly Normal" series linkao3(5121464). Harry gets Lockhart's help with answering his fan-mail and does things like inviting to a school match the manager of a Quidditch team who sent him complimentary tickets.

There's also a slightly disturbing bit where he gets some of Voldemort's mail (addressed to the Heir of Slytherin).
