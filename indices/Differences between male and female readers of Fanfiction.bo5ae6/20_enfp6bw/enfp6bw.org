I'm fairly ship-focused in HP, but from the perspective of One True Character rather than One True Pairing. I multi-ship, and in fanfic I'm more interested in character studies than plot - not that I avoid plot, but it's not a requirement, and if the characterization or writing style bother me, no amount of plot will keep me from bailing.

I can enjoy romantic fics if they're beautifully written and bittersweet, but I gravitate more toward angst, odd pairings, age gaps, enemy ships, unhealthy passions, intensity, and strange bedfellows. I like UST and smut, but not if it's one-size-fits-all Ikea sex; it has to serve a purpose and fit the characters.

Wit, style, complex characterization, veins of poetry and pain, magical inventiveness, clever dialogue, eroticism, and moral ambiguity are all more important to me than pure plot or worldbuilding. Ships tend to be the vehicle for that.

Possibly relevant: my fannish preferences don't reflect my non-fannish tastes in fiction at all.
