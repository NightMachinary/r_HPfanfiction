I am a woman and I go through different phases while reading.

If I'm simply reading to pass the time, I go for gen fics which are Harry centric - kid!Harry, canon divergences, or post-war Harry being a Professor, Healer or simply a father to Teddy, and so on. I still filter out ships I don't like - I cannot stomach Snape being romantic with anyone.

If I'm feeling sad, I go for a fluff marathon. This is usually pairing specific, even if the characters aren't exactly canon compliant. I tend to read more slash than het in the HP fandom... but that is because I don't like the lead female characters in HP other than Luna.

On other days, I worsen my bad mood by reading angst fics. Pairings don't matter much because the ones I choose would be about character deaths.
