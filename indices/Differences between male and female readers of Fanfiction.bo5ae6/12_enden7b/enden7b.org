Guess I'll be the odd one out. Ships are #1 for me. It's how I'll filter fanfiction and then I'll find a good plot within those filters. Every once and awhile I'll branch out and find a new ship I'll enjoy but it's rare.

eta; Am woman. Should also add that I don't read the "romance" genre, the story still has to have an actual plot outside of the ship.
