One more representative for the female side here. Generally I don't care about specific pairings; if and when I read a story that has romance in it, what matters to me is that the romance develops organically, that I can look at the characters and the situation and it will make me go “yeah, I can see that happen”. Yes, I do like emotional stories quite a lot, especially fluffy ones, but romance ... honestly, a lot of stories that have romance have it written in a way that makes me feel that it's forced, and I'd rather read a story with a pairing I would have never expected but written in a believable way than a pairing that seems like a good match but is written poorly.
