Same for me, but the exact opposite. I hate gen and usually read for the ships while being male. Actually, no, that's not 100% accurate. I don't care much about the ship, unless its slash or H/Hr or H/G, which I hate. I only care if there is romance and if its well written. My fav fic all time is Grow Young with me, which is an OC.
