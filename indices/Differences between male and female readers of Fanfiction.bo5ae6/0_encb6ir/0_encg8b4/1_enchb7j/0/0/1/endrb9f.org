Adding my 2C to this: In my experience women tend to flesh out their bios a lot more than guys, they have lists of favourite characters, ships, tropes e.t.c. While guys tend to keep it minimal with just basic info and updates on their schedules.

Again, there are of course exceptions, but in /general/ that's what I find.
