As a male, my first question about a fic usually boils down to ship. But this is mostly so I can avoid fics with ships that I prefer to avoid. Otherwise I care little for what, if any, ships a fic has. The only exception is less, which I may read due to the ship alone, at least until I exhausted the list of popular FFN/Ao3 fics with this ship.
