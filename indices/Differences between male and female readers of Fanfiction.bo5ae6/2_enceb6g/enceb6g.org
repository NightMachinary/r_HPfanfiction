I don't think it really matters that much to women in general. (Or I'm so self-centred that I take my own experience and that of my friends' for the Gospel, I'm never sure eh).

Usually, there is mostly two type of stories. The ones where all that matters is the plot. The stories where there is a mystery/adventure/things happen/lot of research etc. And for these fics, I and all of my girl friends usually filter by ships in so much as « ships that I absolutely can't stand ».

And then, there is the fluff fic (or angst, tbf). Where it's mostly cantered around a ship/love stories/emotional stories etc. And there, indeed, it's all about OTP.

But overall, I really don't think that girls are all that much more interested in OTPs. Maybe we're more open about enjoying fluff fics, though (it feels a bit like « romcom are for women/only liked by women », even if it's just something we'll consume from time to time etc).

(And I have no idea if what I wrote makes any sense at all, sorry !)
