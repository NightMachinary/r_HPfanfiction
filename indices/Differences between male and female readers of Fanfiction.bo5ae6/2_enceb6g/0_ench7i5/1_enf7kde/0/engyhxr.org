  not really. you're constantly tested on your knowledge if you're a woman into tech or cars, &c. ''oh but are you really into tech? do you know about a c b x y z.'' as a woman you can't be casually interested in male-coded things, you have to know everything about it, too, otherwise you're just basic or trying to signal something or w/e.

ok, i'll admit that cars is something that DOES get y'all undeserved flak, but i've never seen tech people try to do that before. compsci major, for what it's worth.

  ngl fanfic has some of the better writing i've seen in popular 21st century media.

Same tho.

  lol this is my fav genre.

i find that most of it is poorly-written, tends to fail the "show, don't tell" rule, and authors almost universally slip their own personal kinks into it. (it's also depressing to me but that's purely for personal reasons)

  idk this feels v. male centric. romcoms are more misogynistic than the reverse imo. when women talk to other women in them it's almost always only about men, women are still commodified the same way they are in normal patriarchial culture, etc. the exact same systems are reproduced.

the "almost always only talking about men" thing is something that i don't actually quite know what to call? like, is there a trope name for that? I don't remember one offhand. you are correct that it is a problem. on some level i have to wonder if it's partially a self-sustaining cycle; hollywood depicts certain categories of people a certain way, people from that category act that way to emulate their idols/role models, hollywood uses that as justification to depict people from that category in that way.

I think there's probably more than one subcategory of romcoms, though, and we may have seen different instances. I can definitely believe that there's a lot of them that are primarily misogynistic, particularly when they're aimed at more than exclusively female demographics. if the stuff aimed just at you is ALSO misogynistic, then... i don't even know how the hell they're profitable.

i guess some of the tropes i mentioned are more prevalent in "Lifetime Movie of the Week" (again, see TVtropes) than in romcoms, but the "Men are generic, women are special" is a really nasty one seen all over that's sexist towards everyone involved.

side note: where i'm at, most of the people who complain about "the patriarchy" are misandrist lunatics with massively overinflated egoes and a sense of entitlement miles long, who think the world owes them literally everything and will play oppression olympics at every available opportunity. it took me a moment to realize you weren't just talking out your ass here. could you elaborate on what you mean by "commodified"?
