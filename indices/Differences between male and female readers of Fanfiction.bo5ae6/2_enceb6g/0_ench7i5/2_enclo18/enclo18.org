I like to avoid Rom-coms if I can. I mean I'll read one if it is highly recommended, I'll favorite anything if it has a unique, interesting element of the story, but I'll avoid them. They're usually freaking teenagers.

Those tropes you listed above tend to ruin a story for me. I will always favorite a story where female against male violence is subverted with punishment (I usually don't like reading the inverse, because male against female violence is almost always a bad plot device). I always thought a realistic story would have a Harry who a dates a few people a bit throughout his later years in Hogwarts and settles down in his 20s. Would widen the cast a bit, and I think most of them would remain friends with Harry.
