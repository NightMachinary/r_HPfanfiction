as a dude, romcoms are okay if they're not cringeworthy or sexist. as it turns out, a lot of the so-called romcoms i've read have ended up being incredibly sexist towards both men AND women (see "all women are prudes", "all men are perverts", "men act, women are", "double standard abuse: female on male", "men are generic, women are special", and "the unfair sex" TVtropes pages for more details on the most common pitfalls).

that said, most romcoms are pretty obviously aimed at women in the first place, because guys "aren't allowed" to be into that kind of thing without getting slammed down by the awful sorts in our society ("wow, you like people talking about their feelings? what a [slur]"). but since women "are allowed" to like male-targeted works, obviously works targeted toward women aren't going to be as popular as works targeted toward men, so they shouldn't bother wasting funding on them (or so say the publishers and tv network executives). this leads to the "girl show ghetto" where media aimed at girls is just lower-quality all around. fanfiction gets around this part by dint of not being funded like that, but the stigma persists.

fluff can be pretty good, but there are a few common pitfalls that it tends to land in. One is "love solves all their problems", which no it fucking doesn't. Another is "he's a bad boy but he's absolutely perfect to me", which is incredibly unrealistic and probably leads to a lot of abuse when people try it IRL. Another is "not even gonna try to explain how these characters got here", and another is "here let me cram these characters into these little molds made out of my own ideas about what a perfect relationship is, no matter how much i have to bend their characters with no explanation or development".

also, anything tagged "lewff" or "fluff and smut" is generally actual garbage.
