i like plot heavy with a really great ship. ships r really important to me i read pretty strictly only pairings i like. but it can't just be a ship bc i like novel length fics 100k+ and i need more than a ship to carry that. (i'm female). i agree that my first question after being told a fic is good is “ship?”
