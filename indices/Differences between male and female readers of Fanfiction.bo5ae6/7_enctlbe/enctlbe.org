I don't really care about the ship unless it's completely unrealistic. I care more about plot, worldbuilding and action.

I prefer fics like linkffn(Divided and Entwined) where there are more scenes of Hermione blasting Death Eaters to pieces than scenes of Hermione dating Ron and Harry.

I'm also totally alright with fics that don't have any ships at all. Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them) had great plot and worldbuilding without any romance and it's one of my favorites.

I also especially enjoy fics where pre-Hogwarts Harry discovers magic on his own. Those tend to not have much romance in them due to young age.

Dramione fic where 90% is descriptions of Draco and Hermione kissing? Nah. Dramione fic where both are double agents, have to deceive Voldemort at the Christmas dinner in Malfoy Manor and Dumbledore while in Hogwarts, learn difficult Dark magic and assassinate their enemies? Fuck yeah!
