This is just my POV, I could be wrong. The shipping issue (for both genders) is possibly a fan fiction only thing - there's a huge element of wish fulfillment in fan fiction. People in the LGBT community want better representation in the stories they read, people don't find the canon ships believable even though they are only 5% of the plot (HarryxGinny vs Harryxanyone else), or people want the character they find most attractive/worthy to end up with the MC. This then forces fan fiction readers to pay attention to ships only so that they avoid the bad/forced ships (everyone's opinion is different on what those are - I hate HarryxBellatrix, others are really into it).

Personally, sometimes I'm in a mood for ships and sometimes I'm not.
