i think the reason shipping is allegedly a ~silly teenage girls~ thing is because of 1. misrepresentation by Hollywood of what the average teenage girl is like (followed by teenage girls mimicking those hollywood idols), 2. because historically-speaking Most Fanfic Writers Are Female (that's no longer true, but it was in the earlier years of the internet), 3. because guys "aren't allowed" to be emotional or romantic outside of a handful of contexts or else they're "[slurs]" (which is bullshit, but as a dude, i get HELLA judged), 4. because Ship-To-Ship Combat, Broken Fanbase, and SRS BSNS!!1! types have exaggerated the expected attitude toward shipping (particularly teenager-written bash fics).
