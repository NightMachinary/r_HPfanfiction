I'm a girl, and ships have a lot of importance in what I read, but it's not because I specifically like romance fics more than others.

For me, when I'm reading a fic, I primarily just want the characters to be as as happy as possible. If I know a fic has a sad ending I'll refuse to read it. And my ships are usually just people I think would be happiest with each other, have good chemistry/compatible personalities, or would make for an interesting story if done well. I also never have ships where one character is oc or near oc (Daphne, Susan, etc).

So with Harry for instance, I only really ship him with Ginny Luna or Draco. (And even then I really mostly prefer Ginny, to the point that if I do read a Luna or Draco fic, there's a high chance it's a poly fic with Ginny still part of it.) And so I don't gain any enjoyment reading Harry/narcissa or what have you, because the whole time I'm reading the fic, in my head I would just be thinking "but his best possible match is right there, so why is he wasting time with Narcissa?"

So when I'm looking for fics to read, I rarely have any specific requirements in terms of plot or genre. It could be pretty much any plot or setting you could think of, but as long as it's got a happy ending and a focus on one of my ships, I'll give it a try. Sometimes even if everything about it is shit I'll read it solely bc my ship is in it.

To compare to, it could have the most interesting plot ever, but if it doesn't have a happy ending or any of my ships, I'll most likely never pick the fic up.

So many people treats shipping as this very superficial unimportant thing for ~silly teenage girls ~, but in the real world romance and pair bonding is more or less* a vitally important part of life as humans. We are naturally social creatures, we go to so many lengths to find the one we want to spend our life with, is it really so unusual for people to value that in the media we engage in as much as in our own lives?

*less in cases such as ace/aro/demi/etc
