Male fanfiction reader and sort-of writer here, if you have any questions I have nothing better to do today (except keep writing and i'm not in the right headspace to write anyone trying to interact meaningfully with Moaning Myrtle right now, especially when they kinda fail).

Shipping-wise, I made a more complete post in another reply in this thread discussing what makes so many romance stories fall flat. Quick summary is twofold:

1. lots of them are sexist to everyone (see "all women are prudes", "all men are perverts", "men act, women are", "double standard abuse: female on male", "men are generic, women are special", and "the unfair sex" TVtropes pages, also "damsel in distress").

2. others hit "love solves all their problems", which no it fucking doesn't; "he's a bad boy but he's absolutely perfect to me", which is beyond stupid; "not even gonna try to explain how these characters got here" and "here let me cram these characters into these little molds made out of my own ideas about what a perfect relationship is, no matter how much i have to bend their characters with no explanation or development".

also every now and then you see a romance-ish fanfic where the author very obviously has a certain kink and it's visible in the story because they couldn't fucking keep it out.
