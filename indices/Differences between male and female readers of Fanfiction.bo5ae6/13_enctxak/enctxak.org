I'm a female reader, and I do like ships, but not as the main focus. And I won't go ballistic if the ship isn't my OTP. I'm okay with the canon ships, but if a different ship is done well, sure I'll read it. I'm not picky. I personally prefer romance be kept in the background.

But I am quite curious about the population of male fanfiction readers, if you can tell me more about that...?
