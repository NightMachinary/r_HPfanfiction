There's more than one thing I could make this post about, gonna try to summarize all of them. I may be atypical, between Aspergers' syndrome and trust issues.

The premise of the fic is important, I tend to skip over anything with a premise that doesn't really interest me. In particular, if a fic's entire premise is "it's all about this ship", or if the tagline implies that it's all about this ship, those tend to exclude almost everything that isn't directly related to the ship, which leaves a lot of plot holes and unexplained background.

Alternatively, if the entire premise is built on relationship drama I will not read it. For example (and I literally pulled this tagline from "newly posted stories" on FFN) "Christina Miller is a mortal on Percy's Olympic Swim Team. Percy invites his team to a pool party at his house, so Christina who has had a Crush on Percy for a long while goes over, what will happen when she meets Annabeth?"

See, that implies that /literally the entire premise of the fic/ is built on relationship/crush drama. (Also note that they should have put parenthesis around "who has had a Crush on Percy for a long while" and also not capitalized Crush). Me? I hate how complicated people make things like romance. Who has to do what and when and where and why and how.

A lot of it is believability and mood/tone. If the characters are acting out-of-character, there'd better be a good reason for it. (Longer works have a lot more time to build up character development on that front). Worldbuilding is good, and I really appreciate fics that get the character's "voices" right (stuff like word choice is critical to that, speech patterns really help a character feel more like themself.)

Combat and action scenes... ehhh. Combat works a lot better in more dynamic mediums, particularly video. Written words just don't really do a very good job of capturing the chaos that is actual combat in almost all cases. Occasional action sequences are fine, but don't make the whole thing an action sequence because it WILL fall flat (and at some point I'll go "holy shit what are your enemies Imperial Stormtroopers? How are you not dead yet?")

I absolutely refuse to read kill-em-all fics, and bash-fics are quite annoying to read because of the exaggerations made to the characters to support the author's personal beliefs about the characters being bashed. "Look at how awful and evil I made this character act! Isn't he/she so awful and evil all the time?" Total bullshit circular logic. Likewise, I don't want to read the Draco In Leather Pants fics that glorify the "bad boy/girl" because honestly people who think it works that way are going to set themselves up for abuse IRL. Bad boys/girls DO NOT make the best marriage partners! God damn idiots.

I don't like grimdark - if the setting is grimdark, someone had better be doing something about it and not failing horribly at every turn. I hate reading "being ___ is suffering". "___ the Master of Escalation" stuff has to be really well-written to not be awful (and if it's "___ the Master of Escalation who Despite Going Full God-Tier Cannot Get A Happy Anything Ever" then I'm noping right out).

One of the things I do is I tend to look for long fics. Thanks to my trust issues, I like to have a lot of time to get to know someone. I like lots of detail, I like a world that explains things in the background and works on a consistent internal logic (even if it's incomprehensible to the characters). Short stories aren't really my thing, because there isn't enough time and material for me and my trust issues to warm up to the characters and get emotionally invested in them.

I've learned the following from experience browsing AO3 and FFN: Any fic with a wordcount-per-chapter of less than 1,000 is almost guaranteed to be too sparse (no detail AT ALL, probably just a summary pretending to be a story), disjointed (jumping from scene to scene and snippet to snippet haphazardly and rapidly and leaving no time to explore anything major), or low-quality (seriously [author name redacted] are you even TRYING?) to bother with. Anything with a wordcount-per-chapter over 5k is usually at least okay. Anything with a total wordcount of over a million is either absolutely fantastic (written by an extremely dedicated author who is utterly driven to write the best possible story and puts in their whole 110% to make it as good as they can) or absolute crap (written by an idiot who can't even spellcheck and thinks all criticism is "flaming" and is too socially oblivious to know when to stop), because nothing that's "so boring it's average" can keep the author's interest long enough to get that long. Stuff between 100k and 500k tends to be the very high end of where "so boring it's average" stuff lands, in my experience. Anything with a wordcount of less than ten thousand is too short for me and my trust issues to get involved in.

Edit to add: As for "fun", I do like a good "shenanigans" fic if it can be pulled off believably, but most of that ends up veering straight into Crackfic territory. Adventures are good, overarching plots are good, exploring implications is good, examining how things work is good.
