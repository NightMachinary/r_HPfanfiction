For me it's more about world building and believable and consistent characters. I dropped many fics where it just turns out to be Post-War kill everybody in the gruelest way possible fics. Stuff like prince of slytherin or futile facade are way better. Or even Prince of a dark kingdom. Or one of the best fics ever: A long Journey home. As I said before I dont mind pairings but I can't stand them if they are all there is to it. And I have yet to find a harem fic which does it's characters justice.
