So I'd expect most (again, most, not all) male readers to be less into romance/feels and more into fun-and-explosions action. That true? What does the average guy look for/write in a fic (I write sometimes, so this is good info for me too)? What is your criteria for a good fic (beyond good formatting/grammar)? I don't want to sound ignorant/insulting, especially as a female reader who likes said fun-and-explosions better than romance...
