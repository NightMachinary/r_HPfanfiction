Ships are pretty important to me in a story. Even if they're not the man focus, generally speaking I don't read stories with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Harry and I never read stories with Harry getting involved with Death Eaters (sans Draco) unless there's a dang good explanation.

Mostly, I read Harry/Ginny or Harry/Multi stories where Ginny is either with Harry or, at the very least, isn't bashed (it's a huge turnoff for me). Pretty much every other ship is allowed, as long as it's good enough.

When it comes to slash, though, I am particularly picky, with most of the slash stories I like being Seamus/Harry. Anything with Deamus in it is also an instant turnoff for me, unless it's a really background detail in the story. I'm also picky about fem!Harry stories, but I usually like fem!Harry with Fred and/or George, Draco, or Theodore Nott (who I also ship with plain old Harry).

Oh, and I identify as female by the way.

Hope this all helps with your survey!
