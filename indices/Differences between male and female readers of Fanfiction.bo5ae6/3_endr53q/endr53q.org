Generally I don't care about ships, my interest in fanfiction is in AUs and canon divergences, focusing on the question of "what if things went differently from canon?" In those kinds of fics, ships and romance tend to take a backseat, if it's present at all. So I don't have a preference for what ships come up in those stories, it could have fem!Voldemort/Harry and I would not mind as long as the entire story was interesting.

The exception to this is Harmony (Harry/Hermione). It's pretty much been ruined for me after years of fanfics. I don't particularly dislike the ship, I think both the Ronmione and Harmony ships have valid points, but in my experience, 9 times out of 10, Harmony goes hand in hand with Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. And not in a good way either, it's the same old Weasley love potion and Dumbledore manipulation plot that's been done so often the proverbial horse has been resurrected and beaten to death several times over. So I steer clear of those simply because there's nothing unique about it and I have no desire to read the same story remixed over and over again.

tl;dr- am dude, ships are secondary to plot
