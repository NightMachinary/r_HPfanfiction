I have read Daft Morons and there representation of Harry is one of the most annoying I have ever seen. It looked like the author decided that "Harry must be completely perfect, anything he does must have been touched by God, yet let's also make him completely clueless about girl because 10 years cooking family meal is enough to "chef" but years in co ed school and in a male dormitory not enough to know what's inside a girl knickers. Despite his gap in knowledge, he must be a perfect gentleman (thought he sounded cringy to me often) and a perfect lover able to make an adult veela loose her shit the first time he ever does it".

Between that and the heaver bashing, I have problems with this fic.
