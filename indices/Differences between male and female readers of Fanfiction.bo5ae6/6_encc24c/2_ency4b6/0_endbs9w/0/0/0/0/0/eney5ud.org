  Percy's eyes snapped open. He was no longer in the throne room... He wasn't even on Olympus, he was pretty sure. He was in the back seat of his mom's car, and he was shorter. He looked around himself, Thalia and Annabeth were soundly asleep, on either side of him, and his mom was focused on the snow covered road. The weird thing was, all of them looked younger. [Perzoe/Thalianca]

  Pure blue. The first thing Percy noticed about the girl that came out of the tree was how bright, brilliant, and blue her eyes were. They cut through him like electricity through water. In that moment, he knew that something had irrevocably changed in his destiny. Fate had a plan for Percy Jackson, and Thalia Grace just became a part of it.

  On the day of his mothers death, an 8 year old Percy commits a life altering act and is introduced to the world of the Olympians. Found in the forest by a Naiad, how will he cope when he is thrust into the life of a demigod, a world he'd only heard stories about, and a great prophecy. Review and tell me what you think. Disclaimer: I don't own Percy Jackson, Rick Riordan does.

  Percy is given the gift of the Gamer turning his life into a video game with levels, dungeons and skill points. Now Percy, armed with this amazing ability, sets out to prove himself to the world of the gods and humans by becoming the best at he can be and fulfilling his destiny. And eventually maybe even find love. Swearing, OP Percy, oh and REVIEWS!
