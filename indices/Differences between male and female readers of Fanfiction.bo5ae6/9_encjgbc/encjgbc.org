I'm a female, but I tend to focus less on specific ships than on relationships as a whole (platonic, etc). I'm not that interested in romance, but I'll read it if it's not the focus of the story. I do have specific ships I prefer, but they usually just align with canon (unless I find it problematic). Mostly I just read fan fiction to fulfill my headcanons or things I wish would happen. I'm not a huge fan of romance and I refuse to read PWP. I guess it aligns with my personal life as well, since I'm not really into relationships beyond the platonic.
