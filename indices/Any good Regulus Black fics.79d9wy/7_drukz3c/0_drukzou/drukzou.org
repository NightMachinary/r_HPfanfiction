  When Regulus volunteers Kreacher for Lord Voldemort's mysterious task, what he expects to be a vaulting honour crushes his world at its very foundation. Throwing himself into a whirlwind of research, he learns of the dark secret that changes the course of his life in more drastic ways than he ever could have imagined. Faced with death if he leaves, or death of self if he stays, Regulus makes a choice that shapes events to come, over a decade later.
