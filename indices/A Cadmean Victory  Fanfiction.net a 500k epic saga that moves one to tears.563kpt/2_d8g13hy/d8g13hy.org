A fairly well written fanfic that peters out towards the last third. Compared to other FanFiction its fairly Well written, about the standard of most 'good' fanfics however it's characterisation and the plot itself are fairly lacking. It had a pretty big following here back when it was being written because it was updated so frequently, interesting to see it presented as some masterwork to a group of people who largely followed it while it was current and largely agree that it's more or less a mediocre piece of reasonably well written fiction
