I read up to 22 and felt the rest wasn't going to be worth my time so I read the last two chapters and was right. The mere mention if a vorpal blade head me doing a Seinfeld, and the rest of the [[/spoiler][Neville/Ginny stuff plus Hermione essentially becoming a phoenix, then all the religious shit... it took 1.3m words for Harry to get his dumb head out of his ass. I was tired of it after 10 chapters. Then the fact that it's not even half over? I can't imagine what sort of bullshit the author is going to pull in order for them to defeat the entire fucking church then all of Voldemort forces, and finally take back the British government, nor could I possibly stand waiting another decade for it to finish, if ever.]]
