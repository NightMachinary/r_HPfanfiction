I never said that I can't read long fics, i just said that some of them get boring after a while. That's probably because I chose bad fics, not that I mind reading long fics. I've read several good, long fics that I enjoyed. It's just lately that I found some long fics that got boring and I wanted to make sure that this one didn't got boring.
