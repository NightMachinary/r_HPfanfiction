I completely agree with you. I get very dubious of fics with 600,000+ words because the author typically is just writing fluff chapters after the first 100,000 words and then throws an ended on it.

Some of my favorites that don't follow that trend are Prince of the Dark Kingdom and The Firebird Trilogy
