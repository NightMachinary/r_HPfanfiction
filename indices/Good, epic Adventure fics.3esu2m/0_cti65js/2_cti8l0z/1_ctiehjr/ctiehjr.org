It is the typical Portkey fanfic -- Harry is Hermione's bitch, Ginny plots with Malfoy to slip Harry love Potions, Ron is a caricature of his canon self, super helpful Goblins, evil Purebloods everywhere, twu luv etc. It has some interesting elements, like the Harry/oc romance, but is it worth spending a couple of weeks on? I think not.
