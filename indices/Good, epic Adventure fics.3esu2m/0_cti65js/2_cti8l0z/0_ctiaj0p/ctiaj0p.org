Well, it's HHr, so if that's not your thing, stop there. However, it's not HHr throughout. It does a lot of world-building, particularly in terms of how Britain relates to other countries. There's also a heavy Goblin emphasis. Voldemort is clever. Dumbledore schemes for a reason. There's a lot of explanation of how particular types of magic work. There's a fair amount of description of sex, but it's not overly smutty - if you're from the US, think AMC instead of HBO or Showtime. This is also heavy on romance, but, like I said, there is still more adventure than there is romance.
