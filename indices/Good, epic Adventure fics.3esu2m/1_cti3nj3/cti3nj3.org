linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction) is truly the best. My review [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=814217&postcount=19][here]].

Others:\\
linkffn(Wastelands of Time) -- Almost 300k words.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels.\\
linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) -- over a million words, /epic/ certainly fits it well.
