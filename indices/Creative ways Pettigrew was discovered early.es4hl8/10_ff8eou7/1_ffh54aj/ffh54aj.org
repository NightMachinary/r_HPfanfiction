Pettigrew helped create the map. I'm sure the map treated Marauders differently than it treated other people. It would have made sense for it to be designed to show Marauders only to other Marauders, so if it fell into the wrong hands, it couldn't be used against them.

In the books, only Lupin sees Peter's name on the map. In the movie, Harry saw his name, which led to the fandom wondering why Fred and George didn't see him too.
