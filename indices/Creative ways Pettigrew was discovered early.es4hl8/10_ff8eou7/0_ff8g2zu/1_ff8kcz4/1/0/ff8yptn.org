  Why would they care where their brother slept or what he did?

They enjoyed pranking him, so that is good justification for why they would track his movements, routine or habits.

Moreover, his full name was shown on the map. Even if they did not know who that was, they should have been suspicious on account of the fact that Pettigrew's name would have been intermingled with Percy's for years, unless he did not carry Scabbers around with him. And if he did not, then one must question how they did not notice that this Peter "boy" spent all of his time in the common room or the dorms, despite them never having heard the name.

Trust me, in a shared dorm of no more than 50-80 students, it is impossible that the pair of them would not come to know the names of everyone there.
