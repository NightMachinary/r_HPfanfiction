- They used it to sneak around and play their misdeeds and pranks.
- They are typical teenagers - meaning short attention span and living more in the moment
- Why would they care where their brother slept or what he did?
- Not all of the map is visible at once. I remember it having numerous folds and such (sorry been long time). So not that easy to notice unless specifically looking at certain part of the castle.
- There were literally hundreds of students, teachers and whoever else on the map.
- They were kids when Pettigrew "died". And was massively over shadowed by Voldemort's demise. Even older people were not all that aware. Why would they?
- People having similar names has obviously never happened before ...
- I may be wrong, but on the map his name would have been "P. Pettigrew" ... so it could be easily Paul or Patrick or whatever.
- And finally why would they expect dead man to be on the map? To them even if they did notice it would simply be another name they would not care about. Not a prefect, professor or head boy.
