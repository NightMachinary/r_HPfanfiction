The map literally named Pettigrew! I mean, unless they opted not to prank their swotty older brother Percy by using the map to track and prank him. By the way, why didn't they say anything about Ronald sharing a bed with a boy named Peter Pettigrew that they would know wasn't sorted that year (because apparently only like 40 students were Sorted that year)?

Or were they just blind as shit?
