Also true. Though there could be a magical breed of rat that lives longer, like krups are basically dogs.

For the latter, I definitely agree that's a significant... error, and 'there are hundreds of people here and we just didn't notice because it's hard to notice anyone you're not looking for specifically' is a bit of a lame-duck explanation. It's why I like that fic where they try and express support for what they assume is Percy's homosexuality. It's just an interesting and mildly amusing way to cover for that massive plot hole.
