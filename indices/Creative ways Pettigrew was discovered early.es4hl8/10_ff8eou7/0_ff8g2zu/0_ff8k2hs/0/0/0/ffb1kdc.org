So for starters: "crup". Sorry, that was just gonna bug the shit out of me.

Second, how do we know that magical variants of animals live longer than their non-magical counterparts? We only have humans as a base and that's because they have potions and spells to cure illness and injuries that would normally kill Muggles. Even if we take Dumbledore as the average oldest (about 150), then that's only about an extra 50% of the average Muggle's lifespan. If that remains true for all magical variants of pet animals, that means your average magical brown rat lives to the ripe old age of.....3 years old. Now, there are some that might live up to 5, but not 12 years.

I actually would have loved to see a conversation between Fred and George telling Ron basically "hey, so, we don't judge, but why are you sharing a bed with a guy named 'Peter'?".
