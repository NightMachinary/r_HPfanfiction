It's with a C? Damnit fanfiction. You had me convinced. I've apparently read it misspelled so many times as 'Krup' it's gotten into my head.

And we don't! That's why I said 'could'. Rowling's complete lack of information on that matter means we just don't know! Magic-Dogs could live to be a thousand years, or twenty minutes old. It could be perfectly normal for magic-rats to live longer lives. By 'magic-rat', I mean a different magical species that's basically a rat like Crups are dogs with two tails.

It's technically just under double, since the average age of a Muggle in the UK in 1990 was 76.

But either way, that explanation of Rowling's makes no real sense - the one about their increased lifespans being due to better medical practices, I mean. I'm in mental health and not physical health, but to the best of my understanding, aging isn't really something you can combat with medicine. Aging-related conditions, yes, but aging itself, no. Unless you could slow aging, your lifespan would still be the same as each cell is replaced by older versions until they're replaced by a version that stops working. Unless you could put every important organ you have on life support, you'd still die at about the same time as most humans. I could be wrong - again, mental and not physical health person here - but that's my best understanding.

I don't have a link to the fic, unfortunately, but it's utterly hilarious. All the delicious and terrifying awkwardness of coming out to your family, but from the perspective of the family instead of the closet-ee.
