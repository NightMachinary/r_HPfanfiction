This is something that really interests me about the Rowling-Magical World. Our modern instinct is to say that everyone would know because our media never shuts up about the litany of psychopaths that populate our planet and do bad things, but would the Prophet cover that shit properly? And would people ever go back to check? Would a self-study history course elicit more checking, or less?
