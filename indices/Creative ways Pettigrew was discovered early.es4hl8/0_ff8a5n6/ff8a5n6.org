I read a headcanon before where Lupin taught in 2nd year already. Ron tries to transfigure Scabbers into a cup but it just won't work. McGonagall blames it on the wand, walks over and tries to transfigure Scabbers into the cup. However, it wouldn't work for her either so she starts subtly casting spells on Scabbers, thinking that it might be a magical rat when the spells show her, that it's an animagus. She gives Ron a different animal to work on, telling him that he has a very special rat and as soon as Scabbers relaxes, she conjures a cage around him and calls Lupin and Dumbledore. Together they manage to get him into human form and the rest is history.
