A bit of self-promotion, not sure if it's creative enough for you but it's at least logical. Also, it's a crossover, but of the form "character X from another setting ends up at Hogwarts". If you're curious, Pettigrew is discovered because Iruka borrows the Map as a way of watching for the fugitive Sirius Black, but as the students are coming back to the castles after Christmas he spots a different name that shouldn't be there.
