I remember reading one a few weeks ago where Harry found Scabbers on his bed in the dorms, assumed it was a wild rat rather than a pet, and immediately killed it. He sends the corpse to Sirius afterwards to check if it's Wormtail. Two years later, Sirius starts teaching at Hogwarts, and he has a taxidermied rat on his desk.

I'll have to try and find it again to get the name of the fic.
