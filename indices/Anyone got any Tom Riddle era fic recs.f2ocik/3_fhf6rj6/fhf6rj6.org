Check out The Broken Victory, linkffn(505654). The only issue is that it isn't canon compliant with the later books, since it was completed in 2003 before 6 & 7 came out (and was started in 2001, before 5 came out), so I don't think it covers all those stations of canon.

linkffn(5957304), Memories, is written in Slughorn's POV with him reflecting on Tom during his years at Hogwarts, and has a bit of the descent into darkness/framing Hagrid/whatnot.
