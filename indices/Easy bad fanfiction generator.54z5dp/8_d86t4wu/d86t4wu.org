Hi!

My name is ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia and I work for the NATO organisation. I am not the boss of NATO - thats Steve. However I am pretty important and normally Steve does what I say. Theres also my best friend, Jill, who also works for NATO. But they arnt in this story.

One day we were all called to the meeting room at the top of NATO's biggest tower.

"Hi" I said.

"I have called you all here today because I discovered something important" I continued. "It seems someone is trying to find the secret Horcrux and are going to use it to take over the world. We have to stop them!"

"Thats bad...but is it the NATOs responsibility?" said Bob. He was always saying stuff like that to get out of work.

"Yes. Of course it is. Because someone has to do something about it and we are an organisation that does stuff. Stuff that has to be done" said Steve.

Everyone cheered his speech. He was good at speechs ever since I taught him to be. (I am also the speech writer for the president,btw)

"I have found new information" said I.

"It seems NATOs arch-enemy, Illuminati, is upto their old tricks again. They are the ones after Horcrux!"

"omg" said everyone.

"We will have to send in our best secret agents" said Steve. "Thats you, of course, ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia" (I was also a secret agent,btw, but I told everyone as it makes the story easier)

"I will assemble my team and leave tomorrow!"

When it came to assemble the team tomorrow I knew just who to pick.

"Potter"! I said. (The bespacled boy had started working here recently, as he had a change of heart recently and decided it was their true calling)

"Hay, ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia" said The green eyed boy. "Thanks for picking me!"

"No problem" I replied. Potter was the obvious choice for this job. I then told the team to assemble in the planning room so we could plan the mission.

In the planning room we evaluated the data we had.

"Ok, we know that Illuminati is trying to find the Horcrux. This is probably so they can use it to dominate our friends and family"

"Now I have called our friends at the Friends of the Earth and they have narrowed the location of the Horcrux down to Brussels."

"Cant they do better then that?" said ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia

"No, its only Friends of the Earth""

"-sigh- stupid Friends of the Earth."

"yeah.NATO always has to keep bailing Friends of the Earth out of trouble..

"Well, I guess we are of to Brussels!" said Harry.

So we all leaped onto our NATO Reliant robins and went there!

Once we got to Brussels we decided to split up, with me and Potter finding where the Horcrux was hidden and the rest doing something which doesn't mater for the story.

Me and Harry explored the town, checking out all the nightclubs and skyscrappers in Brussels. Eventually, after I had done enough teamwork, I found where the Horcrux was hidden.

It was inside a new church in the dead center of Brussels.

"Look! Its the Horcrux!"

"But Voldemort is here already! whats going on?"

At that moment Voldemort spotted us and came over.

"Mahaha it was me! I was Illuminati all along!"

"What?" we said in shock..

"While you and your goody-two-shoes NATO were being all 'la-de-da' "we are good guys" la-de-da', I was being Illuminati! And now I have the Horcrux there is nothing you can do to stop me! Even with Harry to help you! your powerless"

Voldemort grinned evily at me.

"oh, noees ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia, what will we do now?! " said The gryffindor.

"Dont worry, we still got time. Activating the Horcrux takes time. If we both Singing together we can take Voldemort/Illuminati out! "

"On the count of 3! 1 2 3 GO!"

With that we both Singing together right into Illuminatis face.

Illuminati stagged backwards. "Nooooo you cant!"

"Again quick! while they are stunned".

So we did it again. "Bam! Pow!"

"Noooo!"

With that Illuminati died.

"We did it! Illuminati is defeated once and for all! Thank you ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia!"

Me and Potter celebrated are victory. But it was only the first of many more to come. As there was more evils in the world then just Illuminati and they will all be coming after the Horcrux now.

So consider this the end of part 1 of ErenityDarkmoonRavenphia and The bespacled boys adventures!
