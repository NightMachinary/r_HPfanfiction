Harry stopped and gazed into space.

Oh no.

It was happening; He couldn't help thinking about Malfoy again. He tried not too. Desperate to avoid the thoughts that could not be, no, - would not be- held back. But like dozens of unstoppable manticores they came creeping forward till they filled His brain;

Malfoys smile shined like water, as impressive as a saturn, it filled the farmhouse and The chosen one was helplessly but willingly absorbed into them.

Malfoys eyes were like hamsterballs.If you rolled them they would go quite far.

Malfoys legs were like a diplodocus. Straight and tight.

Malfoys chest was like a Manticores. Powerful and impossible to ignore.

How could The gryffindor not be helpless in the face of that?He wanted to hug Malfoy so much, and maybe, just maybe kiss Him one dayon the cheek.

** The Brunet snapped out of it. But the thoughts of Malfoy would be back. Would He be able to resist next time?

Interlude:

** Harry was finding it really hard to concentrate at this movement his thoughts kept trying to think of Malfoy. Despite what was happening, it was hard to focus!

And then, at the worst possible moment. It happened. Again. Harry Potter gazed at Malfoy. It was impossible to resist this time. Like a mini The chosen one was pulled towards Malfoy. It was a like guerilla tactics in a war. It was a like a wand piercing through His heart. It was a like magnets. There was No resisting. No mercy. No longer anything else mattered.

Malfoy looked shocked and then...and then...not shocked. He had known all along. Of course. How could Harry Potter have been so stupid? Those long looks at eachother,the times they gazed at the stars together, the candle lit dinners. The tender hugs.. It wasn't just friendship. It never was. It was more and Malfoy had known all along. "I knew" Malfoy said. "oh" Potter said, realizing all this for the first time. But there was more...Malfoy wasn't pulling away. He was pushing tighter. Holding The chosen one like a wild whale. At some point their clothes came off. They got ripped in the process of the pashioning He didn't care. This is what He had needed for so long. too long. Solar Day. maybe more. But this was now now. The seeker and Malfoy together at last! They canoddled like lovers and just kissed..

They cuddled a lot and then held hands. Afterwards they looked at eachother as if for the first time and had a cigarette. But they knew they must leave. They didn't want anyone to see. Their forbidden love must remain hidden for now. Perhaps forever. The bespacled boy took one last look at Malfoy. "Goodbye my snuggly one" "Love you too, my one and only The Brunet"

And then they departed.
