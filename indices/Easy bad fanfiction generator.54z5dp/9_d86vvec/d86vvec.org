Well, I did ... something, and the end result is a story from ... someone's point of view (I presume Harry, since, you know, main hero), where ... she (I have no idea what happened since I've left him male) works as a telemarketer and was trying to sell a horcrux faster than Voldemort who works for a rival company. No character other than Voldemort is mentioned, though for some bizarre reason the company Harry works for actually had a name, and in all-capitals at that.

I have no idea what the fjord.

Edit: Also, it got named “Harry Potter and the Educational Stone”. There just aren't enough words.
