I don't think I'll top the first one I made with this -- a reader-insert story with Voldemort as the love interest. It is a thing of beauty and horror. Why, how could it not be with characterization like this:

#+begin_quote
  So you wanted to find Hermione Granger. After their adventure, you and Hermione had been spending a lot of time together. You kind of started to like her.

  So you went to the witch and told the whole story. She listened to you without saying a single word.

  Then she said: "WTF, this is sooo big"
#+end_quote

Yep, it nailed Hermione's dialogue. But wait! -- there's more.

#+begin_quote
  You were confused. You didn't think that memory would be in there, and yet it was there, burning like the heart of a newborn star and the centre of the earth. We now turn out headlights to full beam in order to gaze forward through the mists of time.

Amazing. Do go on. I think I hear Voldemort speaking to our heroine. What does he say?

#+begin_quote
  "Do you remember that thing that happened 10 years ago? The one that seemed like it would split us apart forever, but instead brought us closer then ever? That brought us.......to each-other?"

  "The time with the Horcrux?"

  "Yes!"

  "Oh, yes right"
#+end_quote

I pretty sure now that Ed Wood has come back to us. It's far better (worse) than the above quotes let on. Thanks for the link, OP. This shit is wonderful.
