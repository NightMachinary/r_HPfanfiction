First and foremost, I'm a writer myself and so I always try to think of what sort of review I would personally like to receive when leaving reviews. And I do see reviews for fanfic as being 100% for the author's benefit (as opposed to reviews for actual paid products which are for your fellow consumers).

This generally results in me leaving truly MASSIVE reviews for the fics I really enjoy since I want the author to know absolutely everything that I liked about the fic - characterization, plot, the actual writing itself, you name it. I'll often copy & paste lines as I read so that when it comes time to write a review I can remember what I want to talk about. And I do try to review everything I read, no matter how old or how many reviews it already has, unless I find that I just can't write a review that's generally positive. I don't want to leave anyone a review that boils down to "I didn't like this," after all.

I don't generally review each chapter if a multi-chaptered work is complete (and I almost always read complete works) but I try to review each update and I usually do review more than once for longer fics. It honestly depends on how much I have to say. I've often maxed out the AO3 character limit for comments, so if it's a really long fic that I really like I might do every 3-5 chapters unless the chapters are like 10k monsters or something.

I don't generally offer criticism unless the author really wants it, though I might point out a typo or two. And if I re-read something, then I review it again!
