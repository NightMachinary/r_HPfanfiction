Nope, no format or anything for me. I will say that I never leave a negative review. If I don't like a story, I'll just stop reading it. If there's a particular thing that I feel could be improved upon I may leave some constructive criticism within an otherwise positive review. But mostly I just tell the author that I enjoyed the story or that particular chapter, mention some part that I really liked and why, things like that.

One thing I do is thank the author for writing/posting the story, though I usually only do so at the end of a long completed fic that I really enjoyed.
