I try to leave reviews for pieces that I enjoy that may not already have a lot of reviews... Usually I won't leave a review if a piece already has a couple hundred of reviews. (If I do, I leave it at the very end if it's already completed.)

It really depends on the piece to be honest. I will never write a negative review. If I don't like it, I will just stop reading it and move on. If their characterization bothers me, I'll move on. If they make it ridiculously fluffy or unrealistic without probably building it up for me, I'll move it. It's not my place to publicly say something negative about a piece of writing someone has dedicated hours of their life to.

I try to leave encouragement and let them know that somewhere in the world someone else has read it and enjoyed it. If there are particular phrases or scenes that catch my attention, I'll definitely comment on why I enjoyed it so much or how well they captured the moment. If I know the author very well and we have a good relationship, I may or may not do a lengthier review and sort of break down the chapter bit by bit, but I don't do it frequently. It takes a lot of time, some people might take it the wrong way, or some authors may not even appreciate it.

The only time I have said something slightly negative was when an author blatantly asked the readers at the end of a latest chapter how we felt about something. I liked the story well enough, but I wasn't fond of a small plot development. I didn't say anything bad, I just said that it wasn't my cup of tea personally. Well, as fandom is, I got a crap ton of flack from the author at the end of the next chapter and from other readers. Needless to say, I unsubscribed from the piece and haven't gone back since.
