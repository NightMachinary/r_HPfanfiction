I generally try to write out a few sentences saying what I liked about the story, sometimes I'll write my reactions to certain things, especially if it's an ongoing story. I only ever leave concrit if I know they would appreciate it. I don't really have guidelines to when I review, I try to because as a writer I know how much reviews mean. I'm not the greatest at always reviewing. I'll try ever couple of chapters with ongoing stories or leave a review after finishing a completed one. Often times its when I'm moved by a story or impressed by it.
