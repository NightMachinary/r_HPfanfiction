First of all, I honestly despise reviews of the "great update" kind. What am I supposed to do with this one-liner? It's not a review, it's a comment. For that reason, I strive to never write such reviews myself.

From here, it depends on the story. If it's a short one shot, I may not have much to say. If it's a novel-length epic, chances are I'll compile my thoughts into a wall of text.

I don't keep myself to a particular standard like, mention five good things and five bad things. If I enjoyed the fic, I'll probably focus more on what I enjoyed and be willing to forgive more. If I'm feeling let down, I may be merciless.

In short, I always make sure I have something substantive to say. If I don't, I don't review.
