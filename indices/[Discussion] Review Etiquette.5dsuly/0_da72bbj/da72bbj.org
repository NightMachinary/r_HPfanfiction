I usually leave constructive criticism with compliments on what I thought was done well. I don't hesitate from leaving comments on what I thought was done badly, but if I think I'm going to come off as obnoxious or rude, then I just don't review.

I feel its important for every reader to remember while giving criticism that the person who wrote the story spent /hours/ worth of time on the story. Sometimes dozens of them. Even if I didn't like a fic, it is important to respect that effort.
