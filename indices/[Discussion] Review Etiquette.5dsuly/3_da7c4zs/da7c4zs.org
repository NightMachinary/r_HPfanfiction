I don't leave reviews unless I think some constructive criticism would improve the story. When I do review, I usually spend half an hour discussing the major issues I see and sharing how I would address them. I used to be more sarcastic in my reviews but I've reined in my snark (when I talk to strangers anyway) and it's greatly improved my responses- they used to be split between writers effusively thanking me for a long, constructive review and writers telling me that I was the worst flamer they had ever had.

I do try to end on a good note and mention at least one thing that I thought they did well. It helps that I don't review fanfics that are irredeemably bad so there's always something to compliment.
