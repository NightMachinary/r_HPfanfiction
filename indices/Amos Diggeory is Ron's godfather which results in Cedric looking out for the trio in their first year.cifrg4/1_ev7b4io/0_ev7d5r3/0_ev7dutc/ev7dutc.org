Thing is, there's only so much looking out a kid can need. If Cedric, being further removed from Ron, can still find ways to help where his three brothers failed, chances are said brothers weren't being very attentive in the first place.

But hey, it's fine. Making the older Weasley brothers a bit inattentive is hardly bashing, many older brothers are like that. Plus like I've already said, I'd like to see more Cedric in fics beyond him competing in the TT.
