It would be straight fucking sad for a boy with three elder brothers in his own house (one of which a prefect) to need a family friend in a different house to look out for him, but certainly Percy and the twins were never mentioned to be very helpful to Ron at any point.

It sure would be nice to have more fics involving Cedric tho. He seems like such an underused character, even in fourth year fics.
