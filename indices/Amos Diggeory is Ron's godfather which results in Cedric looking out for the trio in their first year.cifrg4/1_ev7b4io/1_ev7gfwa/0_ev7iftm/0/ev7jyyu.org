  But I think you're missing the point: I'm not saying that it would be implausible or anthing, I'm saying it would be sad. All three of them, hardly paying attention to the littlest brother? Sad.

You've never had a cousin who was nicer to you than your siblings, or that you confided in instead of going to a sibling? Ron doesn't need anyone to help him in the literal sense, he's a decent student with decent social skills, he needs someone to give him attention his older brothers don't have. I don't think it would reflect badly on his brothers at all if Ron were to go to Cedric instead for help. The very fact that Cedric is not his brother is the balm that Ron needs in this scenario. That's something none of his brothers could provide, for obvious reasons.
