This question has been bothering me as well. But I was afraid to even ask. But we are in the third year now, I bet I'll still be reading that fic when I'm in my 30s. It's that prequel I've been waiting for, JK can decide never to write a word about those four and I won't be very sorry. But it does bother me a bit that Remus and Sirius have such a close relationship in that fic, I just can't bring myself to believe this. But I should stop, because I'm rambling. Anyway, thanks for posting this question here :).
