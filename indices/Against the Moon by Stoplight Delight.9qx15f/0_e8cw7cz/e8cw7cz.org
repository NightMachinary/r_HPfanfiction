Nope, not abandoned. From what I understand, StoplightDelight has a chronic illness and can only update when she feels well. She's also a “chase the muse” kind of writer, so she's currently posting a Star Trek fanfic. This has been since the summer, and she's already on chapter 50-something because she writes crazy fast. No idea how she does it.

She's been working on AtM for an extremely long time, so you just got to sit back and wait. She goes through spurts where she'll write like 50 chapters at a time (e.g. last summer).
