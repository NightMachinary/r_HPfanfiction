Hmm, no idea. It's kind of one of those long-haul fandoms. I've been following the story since 2014. In that time, she's only had one period of frenzied updates (last summer). It was originally posted in 2011. She's in a Star Trek phase, but she still says that she will update AtM when the urge hits her. I don't really care for Star Trek, but I think her story is pretty popular there as well.
