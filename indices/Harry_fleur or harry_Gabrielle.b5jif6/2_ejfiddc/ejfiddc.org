- /Taking Umbridge/ by E.C. Scrubb is a very good H/F, but is ridiculously slow at updating. Worth reading though. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8604692/1/Taking-Umbridge]])

- /Vitam Paramus/ by TheEndless7 is the only realistic H/Gabrielle story I've ever come across. Like most of TE7's stuff, it's a character-driven story. I very much enjoyed it. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus]])

- /Letters/ by TheEndless7 has already been mentioned as a H/F fic. But I'm going to mention it again because I can. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]])

- /What You Leave Behind/ by Newcomb is a good H/F fic, but is seemingly abandoned. There's still hope in the community that the the author with one day return though. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]])

- /Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time/ by joe6991 has a H/F subplot. You'll want to hold on to your hat before you jump into this one. It's a doozy (in a good way). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]])

- /The Lie I've Lived/ by jbern is an older H/F story and very engaging. Sadly, the promised sequel has never materialized. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]])
