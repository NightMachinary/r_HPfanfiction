I find that when it comes to introducing OCs, you should spread them out over a few chapters. Maybe introduce 1-3 in one chapter, use them frequently (but not too much that it becomes irritating) over the next few chapters. Once the readers gets used to them, you can repeat the process again for more OCs.

Having some OCs can spice up the story with good interactions between characters, but too many OCs can also make it too jarring for the reader.

Flashbacks works, but consider integrating them into the plot in a way that flows well... eg Harry narrating what happened over the past few years to someone who he haven't been in touch with for a couple of years. You can also use this as a way to integrate a character's new personality at the same time (a lot can happen in a year or two while they haven't met)

Do take these ideas with a pinch of salt. I'm not that great of a writer, but I do read a damn lot xP

Side note: Great job so far! There's definitely a lack of certain pairings in the fandom, and Harry x Gabrielle is definitely one of them.
