  AU: Dorea and Charlus Potter are still alive when their son and daughter in law were killed. They take in Harry- but he's not their only concern. Desperate to know if the boy they took in really betrayed their other son, the Potters are determined to secure a trial for Sirius. And they aren't the only ones- Arcturus Black is also eager to free his grandson...
