I saw one that was eventually a Lunar Harmony story where Harry was rescued from his cupboard by a Potter family house elf. He was then returned to one of the ancestral Potter properties, and raised under the tutelage of portraits of his paternal grandparents.

For the lift of me, I can't remember the name. I think it may have been started pre-HBP, as I remember there being no mention of horcruxes.
