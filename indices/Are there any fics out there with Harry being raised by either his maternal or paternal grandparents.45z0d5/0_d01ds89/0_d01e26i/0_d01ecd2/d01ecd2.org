I also remember:[[/spoiler][Luna & her parents, Sirius, Hermione & her parents all came to live at the same place. Luna had some sort of mystic vision in which she, Harry, & Hermione got together, and drew a picture of this for Xeno, but couldn't spell Hermione so she left it captioned as Luna, Harry, Her. Because of events I don't remember, both Xeno & Mr Granger die, and Sirius winds up formally marrying either Mrs Granger or Mrs Lovegood, don't remember which. They only attend Hogwarts part time, primarily for classes that neither Sirius nor Mrs Lovegood are capable of teaching. They attend a muggle high school for the rest of their days. The final fight with Voldemort involves him attacking the high school while it's in session.]]
