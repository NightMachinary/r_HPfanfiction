I appreciate the suggestion, however I don't believe this one is the one I'm thinking of. From what I remember of the story you linked, [[/spoiler][Harry/Hermione/Luna were all abandoned at a young age and essentially raised themselves while under threat of starvation, whereas in the story I'm thinking of, they were under adult + grandparent portrait + house elf supervision. Furthermore, in the story you linked, the climactic battle against Voldemort involved H/Hr/L returning unexpectedly from something like a time bubble to fight, whereas in the one I'm thinking of, the trio all went to a muggle school for a majority of the time, and formally re-entered the wizarding world by starting part time at Hogwarts in what would have been canon Luna's first year.]].
