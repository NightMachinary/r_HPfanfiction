7 is actual more of a gamble/luck number. If you throw two six-sided dice the most likely number is 7 (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1) compared to all other numbers 2(1+1), 3(1+2, 2+1), 4 (1+3, 2+2, 3+1), 5(1+4. 2+3, 3+2, 4+1), 6 (1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1), 8(2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 2+6), 9(3+6, 4+5,5+4, 6+3), 10(4+6, 5+5, 6+4), 11(5+6, 6+5), 12(6+6)

so while it make sense as a lucky number, it never made much magical sense.

The magic number was always 3. Things happen in 3s is a common saying. 3 times is the charm. And all it close relatives like 9 (3*3) and 6 as the turn around of 9

then you have numbers like 4 that is a death number in the Japanese language/ culture.

The 8 with it closed bond and similarity to a Moebius band and in its form of an hourglass, nevermind that you just have to put it on its side to create infinity.

I let some of my characters discuss this in one chapter for Aritmantic homework once.
