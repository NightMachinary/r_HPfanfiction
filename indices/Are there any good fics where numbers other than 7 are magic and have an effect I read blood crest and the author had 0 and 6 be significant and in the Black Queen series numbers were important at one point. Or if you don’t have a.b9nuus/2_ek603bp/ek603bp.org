/Time is the Fire/ by Oddment Tweak has a section where it goes into the importance and meaning of numbers in arithmancy in relation to Pythagorean philosophy. It's by no means the focus of the story, but I thought it was done well. The numbers that were discussed were 5, 7, 3, and 1. I think it all takes place in Chapter 15, but there could be more elsewhere.
