linkao3(The Two Body Problem by Tozette) is supposed to be the origin story for a dark lord!Hermione. It mainly stars Hermione and diary!Tom and touches on the nature of dark magic. I like it a lot and it's not very long either, but Hermione doesn't really do much evil in the story itself beyond torturing Tom.
