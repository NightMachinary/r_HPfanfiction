/Spent an hour looking around my follows and favs list and found these. Take a look and see what you think./

--------------

One of the best examples I have of a totally new magic system is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]]. This fic also does some moderately heavy technomagic.

Be warned though, this a crossover. Also, I hate it.

It went off the rails later on and simply lost me. The author seems to be obsessed with her OCs (which aren't even from either HP or the crossover world), and she seems to get some personal issues involved, including religion. Also, /maybe/ some minor and passive homophobia in the world building. Yuck.

But still worth a read until it goes to shit if, for nothing else, to see the unique use of magic in it. And for Sherlock Holmes solving every Hogwarts year's problem in like thirty seconds, once he actually learns about it.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/12/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] is an oddly spelled example of a character getting early information and then trying harder. Has some stuff on what that might be like, and some good magical gadget use too. Worth a go, but right on the edge of what I'd recommend, quality wise.

--------------

Ultra long, ultra sappy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] sets the bar for both fuzzy and innocent Snape and Harry Feels, but also nails Super Healer Harry perfectly. Lots of healing magic, mostly "Parselmagic" style stuff. Good enough writing, but nine-out-of-ten dentists suggest brushing and flossing after reading.

--------------

Speaking of Snape: nothing like a good Slytherin Hermione with Mean Mentor Snape fic. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]], she has to learn about magic quick to survive, and this leads to some interesting moments of discovery. Not super-heavy on the magic, but a lot more than canon.

--------------

Harry has an odd time travel accident and does some magical training to fight Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. The time travel mechanism is well done and logically consistent, and the world is well worked out. A well-done, strong Voldemort counters a powerful Harry in the pre-Hogwrats days ('91) setting. Some new magic and how it might work to actually train to fight with magic is the main reason I include this one on the list. Also, it is a good story.

--------------

A serious take on goblin magic in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] makes it one of the most unique fics out there. Doesn't make goblins simpering morons or heroic underclass superheroes like some lesser (/cough/HarryCrow/cough/) fics. Unfortunately, likely abandoned by now. Sad. Still, a good read.

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] is a D&D crossover fic (Hey wait! Where are you going?!) where two different magical systems are explored in detail. Painful, powergaming detail. Not quite a crackfic, as it has some very, very serious moments, but not exactly sober either.

--------------

I'm not sure if I want to recommend this one. But then, I always think that. And I also end up recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evens and the Spiral Path]]. This fic is /dark/. Not silly-power-fantasy "dark," like the kids write nowadays. Really black.

The world is not a friendly place, evil things happen to normal people for no reason -- or worse, cold, unfeeling reasons -- and everyone is screwed no matter what the hero does. Rape, abuse, and body horror are the bread and butter of this fic. And again, it is ultra-mature (almost more so than you'd think FFN would allow) but it is done professionally. King, Romero, or Craven would be fitting comparisons to Wordhammer's style, but also Hitchcock. Apparently, I want Wordhammer to have my creative fiction bab- OH GOD NO, THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!

Original (and horrible) use of common canon spells, and also some new bio-magical stuff that just...ugh. You were warned, but also recommended.

--------------

On a slightly lighter note, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], Hermione plays with time magic. Original use of runes. Fun. Not ever likely to be completed, but interesting still. My vote for best use of rational time travel in a fanfic.

--------------

Still keeping it light, next comes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage]] -- a total crackfic. But it is still fun. A comic book approach to magic, because it is a crossover with Marvel, specifically Ironman. A fun little fic, and still updating.

--------------

Look. If you know about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] and hate it, say no more. If you haven't heard of it before, you really should read it and form your own opinion. It has, unsurprisingly, the most rational treatment of magic out there, including an original take on Transfigurations. Hate it or love it, MOR is the most popular currently updating HP fanfic out there, and arguably the most widely popular fanfic /ever/.

--------------

/And that ends my list. I'm sure I missed some obvious ones, even ones I've got on my favs list on FFN, but that should do to start. Lots of authors have in/ their /favorites lists fics like the ones they write, so that would be a good place to expand on from here. Good luck./
