Anything with "harder" rules than the canon was what I was looking for. Something with internal consistency. Incorporating runes or some other new form to the magic is absolutely alright with me, as is their absence. I just want it to make more sense.

I'm sort of the opposite of those people you talked about. I don't really want or need everyone equal. They're all clearly not. Tom Riddle was doing things as a self-taught 11 year old that wouldn't be possible to a lot of older wizards. Hell, he wouldn't be such a threat if he wasn't better in some way. So what I'm trying to say is, I think I'd prefer a system where everyone /isn't/ equal.

And the plot doesn't really need to center on learning magic, but I'd prefer it if the magic stood out as more...finished than canon, if that makes sense. And yeah, I've been looking, but it seems most people have a cool idea, then burn out relatively quickly.

Thank you so much for all your help.
