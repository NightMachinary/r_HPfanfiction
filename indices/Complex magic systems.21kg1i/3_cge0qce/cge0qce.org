Can you say more about what you want to read about?

Do you like people talking about runes? Linguistics of magic? Will to power stuff? Spell building? Discovering old magic over again?

Magical cores (by any other name) are a big point of contention, as they suggest a lot about how magic works. It boils down to, can you cast forever, until you run out of energy to talk and wave a wand? Or are there, for lack of a better term, "magic points?"

Systems exist in the middle, including: it uses up mental energy to cast, so it is like doing really hard math problems in your head to do magical spells correctly. And you simply stop being able to concentrate after a while. But that means people like Dumbledore and Hermione, who are mentally head and shoulders over others, and Harry, who gets...intense sometimes, still have an advantage.

Some people don't like the idea that magic isn't perfectly egalitarian. They will fight violently against any system that tries to limit or power-categorize magic. So what's your expectation?

I've seen it all, but it sounds like you're looking for something specific, where the plot revolves around learning about magic. I'll look through my lists and see what I can find. But most magic-focused stories seem to not be very long, and often aren't complete.
