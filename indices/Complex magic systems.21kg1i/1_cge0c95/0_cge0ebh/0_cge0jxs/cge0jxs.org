Heh, I was worried you would have already read most of the things I had posted.

In case you haven't read it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Joe's The Wasteland's of Time]] is considered one of the best fics out there, and for good reason. The magic system in that is clever, engaging, and fractured. That isn't to say it is missing in places like in canon, it is elaborated on and consistent, just not told all at once.

Finally, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][Miranda Flairgold's series]] is a bit dated, but the magic system in it is still incredibly different and well put together. There's a whole new magic school, as well.

Sadly, it is most definitely abandoned, and it is so far removed from canon it could probably be reboxed and sold easily. Two books in the series were completed before it got abandoned.

Check out the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter Library]] by the way. The fics in there that get featured are well written, and quite a few have in depth magic systems.
