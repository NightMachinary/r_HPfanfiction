I could never get into Firebird's Son, but just about everyone seems to love it. Is this a personal failing of mine, or does it get a lot better after the first half-dozen chapters? They seemed a little cheesy and also, somehow, bland.

I think what I read of Firebird's Son is like bland cheese, is what I'm saying. Am I missing something here?
