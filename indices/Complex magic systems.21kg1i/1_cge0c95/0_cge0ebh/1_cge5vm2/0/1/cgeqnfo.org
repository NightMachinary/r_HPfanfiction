I found a lot of the early chapters to be almost entirely exposition. McGonagall literally sits down the parents - along with the audience - and explains aspects of the magical world.

After that though, it does get much better. In my opinion, it drags in places, but the plot is in general pretty solid. The world building was definitely the best part.

I bloody hated the Quidditch though. It was probably the best written Quidditch I've read, but jeez there were so many games of it.
