Yeah, I think the same. I read the whole thing recently, as far as updated to in Book 2, and it really feels too OOC / OC for me. Obviously a lot of the characters are going to be different if a lot more of them are girls, but even so, it just feels like fanservice most of the time. And it's fic- by definition, it's already fanservice. I don't know. It might be that it's just not my thing. :)
