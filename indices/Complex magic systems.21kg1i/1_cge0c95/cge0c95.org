[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope][Wizard of the Kaleidoscope]] was already mentioned, the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8545947/1/Fractal][author is doing a rewrite, here.]]

I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] had a decently interesting magic system, though it is so far removed from canon is might as well have been its own book.

Shezza's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian series]] is one of my all-time favorites, and the magic system definitely gets interesting later on. It borrows heavily from the Dresden Files' magic system, but no prior knowledge is really necessary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][The Firebird series by Darth Marrs]] both does and doesn't fit your criteria. Magic is definitely changed in a different direction, though I haven't seen any actual, in-depth explanations.

Actually, now that I think about it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe]] fits a lot of your criteria. The magic in it definitely changes from canon, and it was in general very satisfying to read and see the rather unique ideas. It might be abandoned though, or the updates are just very slow.

I'll let you know if I remember any more, OP.
