  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

Focuses heavily on Alchemy and the Magnum Opus. Pretty interesting.

Written before Order of the Phoenix. Includes a bit of Latin American and Native American magic. It also introduces Calligromancy, which works kiiiind of like a computer language, and the concept of magical mines.

Both are Harry/Draco.
