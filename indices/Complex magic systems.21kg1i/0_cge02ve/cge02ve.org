Okay, so my first suggestions was Sacrifices :P but seeing as you've read that one, then my next suggestion would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]. While it's often recommended, it definitely deserves that right and fits what you're looking for. It is very long, very detailed look at a world where Voldemort won. Voldemort becomes Harry's mentor and uses his extreme intelligence to teach Harry lots and lots about magic.

Only caveat to this suggestion could be considered a spoiler, but it ends at the end of chapter one and it has made many a people (including myself) quit or almost quit. The very beginning has Heinrich-Harry. It's honestly just Harry trolling his family. It won't go past the first chapter. There are reasons, they are explained.

Sorry if this is ramble-ly or not clear, its late and I'm not thinking as clearly as I should. Just wanted to get this posted before I forget about it.
