[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]] is one of my favorite fics purely because of its magic system and its Hogwarts. However, in 100k words it managed to just barely make it to Halloween, first year, before being abandoned. Thus, the plot doesn't really go anywhere.
