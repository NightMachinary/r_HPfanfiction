[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]] is an abandoned fic that explores pure-blood culture and magic.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi, is another abandoned fic where Harry excels at magic. Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but your question made me think of it.
