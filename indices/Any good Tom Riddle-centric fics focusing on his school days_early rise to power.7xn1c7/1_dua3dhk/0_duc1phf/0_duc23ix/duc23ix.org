I actually don't remember the hissing part, maybe it was figurative? I don't know. But I agree, the whole Slytherin house hissing at each other is kind of ridiculous.

It has been a while since I've read it and I am kind of reluctant to reread it because I might find lots of faults in it. Perhaps it hasn't aged well... At the time I considered it one of the best takes on "harry going dark", since it's done very gradually and consistent with the things that happen to him.

Sorry, it didn't work for you.
