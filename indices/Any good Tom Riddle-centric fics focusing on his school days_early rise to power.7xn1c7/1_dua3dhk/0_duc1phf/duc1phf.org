I started reading this one, and I /wanted/ to like it, but I just couldn't go further than a few chapters. I mean... Harry says that he was sorted into Slytherin because /he became a worse person/ (AKA all Slyhtherins are Evil, and not, you know /cunning and ambitious/?) and the Slytherins don't even bat an eyelash to Harry's stealing (which, ok, he only talked to the Death Eaters, so that might be why). I could even accept that and every bad thing Harry says about snake house, since he basically admits that he was taught to be biased against all Slytherins, but... The Slytherins hiss in displeasure. That's a thing that they do. They /hiss/ when they disagree with something and Harry acts like that's a normal people thing to do, if you're a Slytherin. I mean, if Tom Riddle hissed when he was about that get dangerously angry, that would be one thing, because he's a parselmouth, but the other snakes? /Noooooooo/...

So, anyway, I actually really liked the story, specially the portrayal of Tom's character, but the third time a Slytherin hissed at Harry, I just... I couldn't.
