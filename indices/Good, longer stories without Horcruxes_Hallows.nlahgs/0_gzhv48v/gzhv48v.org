If you're ok with AU I suggest A Girl Can Be More Important Than A Firebolt.

Voldemort dies (for real) trying to kill Harry and Harry lives with his magical aunt. Story starts in 5th year(?) summer holidays.

Cute story but definitely romance rather than adventure. Still one of my favorite takes on the magical world
