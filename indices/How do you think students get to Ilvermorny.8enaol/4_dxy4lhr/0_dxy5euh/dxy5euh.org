IIRC, there were some Native American students at Ilvermorny in the early years, though I'd think by the 1860's they'd stop associating with non-Native wizards, on the account of white people being complete dicks.

I think most wizards outside of the east coast would be homeschooled, but if they were muggleborn they'd have to be taken to Ilvermorny, to prevent Obscurials from wreaking havoc.
