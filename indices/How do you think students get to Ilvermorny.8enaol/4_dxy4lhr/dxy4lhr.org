So apparently nobody knows you are asking about the 1860s...

Before the advent of the train, I've thought carriages were the likely use for people, including wizards, to travel. Perhaps having them be thestral-drawn they were equipped to fly which would certainly make it much faster and, importantly in the U.S., able to cover a lot more ground.

I also think the vastness of the U.S. was not much of an issue for wizards in the 1800s. I imagine most of the Ilvermony students were based on the east coast. While the country was expanding west, I imagine the wizarding world was not as eager to move west (many western expanders were moving because they had no opportunity in the east; wizards I imagine found it easier). I also think there were some territorial beefs with Native American tribes seeped in magic that may have tampered down the wizard expansion to the west. For those that did move west, I imagine many of those wizarding families were explorers and nonconformists who were more likely to homeschool their children.
