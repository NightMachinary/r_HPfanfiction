Hike, take a bus, ride bicycles -- just look like a hippie and be sure to pick up any strays on the road if they're wearing cranberry with blue. Travel like tourists in the Berkshires, gathering at the War Memorial tower atop Mount Greylock. When you arrive and are ready to go, stand in front of the tower where a grumpy short guy will take a photo with an unusually bright flash -- and then you're gone.
