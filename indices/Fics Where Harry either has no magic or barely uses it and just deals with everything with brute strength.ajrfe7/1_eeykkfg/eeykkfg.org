Damn, I've been looking for a witcher/HP crossover that I read last year that is along these lines but I just can't find it. Harry is the older brother of the BWL and a Squib. Squibs in this world often have some form of other power instead of magic, a number of them joining the witcher orders to hunt dark creatures and wizards. If i remember correctly harry's power is related to increased physical strength and his master is Letho.
