- “Flowers by the Wayside” by TalaRae linkao3(23090008), except it is really not about a suicide, that's just a vehicle to get the story moving
- on the other hand, “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s)]]” by Amaru_Katari IS about a suicide (and its consequences) and please all relevant warnings apply. If anything triggers anything for you, then it is this story.
