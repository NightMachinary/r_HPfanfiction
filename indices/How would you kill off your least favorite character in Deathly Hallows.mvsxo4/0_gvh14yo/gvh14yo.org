Was just reminded of a fic where Umbridge was raped by the centaurs when she was carried off by them at the end of OotP. I can't think of a more fitting end for her than to die because she was carrying a centaur foal that was just too big for her body to handle. Maybe even twins for that extra twist of evil---she manages to birth the first one but can't take the prolonged labor when there turns out to be a second. Or maybe the second is breech. (Horses take a full year to have a baby. Since this is a magical animal I can easily justify a longer pregnancy rate, to delay it long enough to take place during DH instead of at the end of HBP.)

Ooooooooor, maybe acromantulae are parasitoids (insects that lay their eggs in other insects, and the larvae eventually eat them). Using that same scene (centaurs carrying off Umbridge) as the beginning of the story, the centaurs took her to Aragog's nest, and they implant eggs in her, while she thinks she was being "stung" by them. She doesn't understand why the "stinger" wounds don't heal properly, but doesn't want to see a healer and admit what happened so she's self-treating. All those hungry baby spiders eat her when they're born.

Dammit, and you're making me want to actually write these stories, when I've never written anything like this. I really hate Umbridge.
