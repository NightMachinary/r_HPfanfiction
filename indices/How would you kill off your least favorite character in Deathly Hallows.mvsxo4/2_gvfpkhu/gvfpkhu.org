I would like Runcorn to actually be accused of conspiring with the Muggleborns after Harry impersonating him helps them escape from the MoM and get killed by the Death Eaters. He seems like a shitstain who turned in innocent people when he had the power to protect them and we know too little about him to love to hate him like in the case of Umbridge. Besides getting killed for rescuing Muggleborns by the people to whom he reported them seems like a fitting and ironic end.
