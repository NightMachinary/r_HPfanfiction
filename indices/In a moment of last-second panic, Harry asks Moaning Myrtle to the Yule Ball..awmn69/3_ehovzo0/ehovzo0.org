That'd be great, I'd definitely read that.

One of the things I really dislike about Harry is that he has the spine of a flobberworm. He gets forced to do all kinds of shit, and he doesn't even go Capslock until the 5th book. Forced to live with the Dursleys, forced to be in the Tournament, forced to do the ridiculous "weighing of the wands", forced to open the ball, and he just takes it. And takes it. And takes it.

It's time someone introduced Harry to the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance][malicious compliance]]. Does his partner have to be female, or human, or alive? Ask Moaning Myrtle, or Winky, or /Peeves/. Ask someone from the outside, like Tonks or Mrs. Weasley. Hell, ask Narcissa Malfoy, that should piss off a lot of people. A blow-up sex doll might also satisfy the stated requirements. Perhaps Griphook can be rented by the hour.

Or just show up alone.

"Where's your partner, Potter?!"

"I don't have one. You've forced me to be here, and here I am, under protest. I will now do my utmost to make a mockery of this ball, this entire tournament. You will /rue the day/ you forced me to participate."

I never understood why he tried to win.
