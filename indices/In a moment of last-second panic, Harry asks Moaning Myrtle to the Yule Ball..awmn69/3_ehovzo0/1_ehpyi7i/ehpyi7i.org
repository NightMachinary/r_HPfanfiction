He actually never tried to win, I don't think. He turned down two opportunities to win - waiting to save Gabrielle, instead of winning the second task, and trying to let Cedric take the cup first. He won because Bagman and Crouch Jr wanted him to win, and did their best to help him. He had it very easy in the lake and in the maze, and in the first task, just wanted to stay alive.
