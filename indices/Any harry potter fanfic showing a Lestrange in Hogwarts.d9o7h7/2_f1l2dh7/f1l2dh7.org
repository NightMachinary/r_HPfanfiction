Delenda Est has Harry go back in time and teach at Hogwarts briefly. He interacts with a Hogwarts-age Bellatrix Lestrange (she was a Black at the time but she's a Lestrange for most of canon so I figure it counts.) It's also a romance between Harry and Bella but one of the good ones. Fair warning though: it gets kind of weird about halfway or so through the story but it's great before then.
