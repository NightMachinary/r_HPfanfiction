  What if Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange had had a daughter during the first war, who had to grow up without her parents, living among the winners of the war as a child of the losing side? This is the story of Cassandra Lestrange, a girl with the fierceness of her mother and the determination of her father, lovely and lonely, who belonged only to herself. "Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: therefore be of good cheer; for, truly, I think you are damned."
