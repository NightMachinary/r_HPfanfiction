[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's Boys]] is a really great story that features Gryffindor!Draco. And except for the epliogue there weren't really any pairings between the children iirc, but I haven't read the fic in a while. Time to do it again, it's really worth your time as long as you can live with the concept of "Good Dursleys". ;)

  A very AU Severus/Harry mentor fic with Lucius as a friend as well. Petunia dies and the Dursley's flee Privet Drive along with Harry. They end up hiding in an unexpected place when the Hogwarts letter arrives.
