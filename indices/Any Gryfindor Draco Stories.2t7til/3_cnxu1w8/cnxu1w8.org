There is a very good fan fiction where The Twins prank the entire school by messing up the sorting in Harry's (and then later, Ginny's) year.

Resortings include: Crabbe and Goyle in Gryffindor, Draco and Harry in Hufflepuff, Neville and Hermione in Slytherin, and I think Ron in Ravenclaw.

I really wish I remembered the name of the fic though, it's frustrating the hell out of me
