I like the relationship between Regulus and Sirius in the "Different Path" series by Moonybird and dtill359 on Ao3.

It's a Snape/Lily fic, but after the first few chapters, their relationship is mostly background. The Marauders grow up a lot in this series, and that includes Sirius working on his relationship with Regulus (who's a major character).
