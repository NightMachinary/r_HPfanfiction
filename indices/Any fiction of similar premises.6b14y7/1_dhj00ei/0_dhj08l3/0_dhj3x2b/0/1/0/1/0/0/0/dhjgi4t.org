Ah! The typical quote one thing and leave everything behind. it's laughable because other it doesn't match with how rules were established in canon.

Normal wands didn't change loyalty after 'disarm'. Why should Elder Wand change it's loyalty with disarm when it wasn't even directly disarmed.

Draco disarmed Albus, Snape killed Albus. Harry disarmed Draco's normal wand. Normal wand doesn't change loyalty after disarm. How does HP become owner when he didn't even disarm EW from Draco?

--------------

My 2nd point was: Elder wand serves anyone who carries it, regardless of how he came to acquire it. you and I agree that death of previous owner isn't required for loyalty of EW.

So if Voldemort is carrying EW it means that he defeated every potential EW owners and acquired it. Thus he had loyalty of EW. EW served his call by shooting an AK at HP. HP knew he would die, that's why he shot 'expelliarmus'.

And the most terrifying and powerful wizard dies because 'prophecised' child shot a 'disarming spell' at him.

That's the problem with 'prophecy child' trope and cliche fantasy stories. They always win!
