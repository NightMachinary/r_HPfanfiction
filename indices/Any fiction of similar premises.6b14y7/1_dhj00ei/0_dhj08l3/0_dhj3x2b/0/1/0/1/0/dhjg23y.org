Harry became elder wand's owner because he disarmed Draco's normal one? That's laughable.

Elder Wand belongs to one who is carrying it at the moment. It's ownership isn't defined by normal means. A normal wand has to be disarmed, and even then it doesn't change it's ownership completely.

Elder Wand changes it's owner by any mean. Theft, murder, disarm etc. It faithfully answers call of anyone who is holding it at the moment spell cast.

It shot AK toward HP, and it was a powerful AK. But then HP pulls another one of those absurd plot armors and shoots an 'expelliarmus' that fights with AK.

Elder Wand never has a true owner. It serves anyone who is holding it, regardless of means with which he acquired it.
