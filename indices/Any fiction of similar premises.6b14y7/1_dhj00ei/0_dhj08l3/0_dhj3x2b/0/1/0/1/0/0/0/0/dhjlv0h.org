The Normal wand does Change Loyalties as that's what Harry uses during the entire final battle, infact we have Olivander state that Harry Won it's Allegiance as a fact. You lost that point from the start. You also lose on the fact that a single Disarm can't change the allegiance of a wand.

You also failed at properly reading source material as Voldemort even states that the wand doesn't work properly for him so your whole "EW works on Who holds it" fails the EW not working properly is the grounds on which Voldemort had for Killing Snape! So to ignore the EW's qurks like you have, you leave no reason for Voldmort to Kill Snape

You Argument fails
