  Harry became elder wand's owner because he disarmed Draco's normal one? That's laughable.

No, that's canon. It fits exactly with what little we know about wand allegiances. If that's the part that you find unbelievable in the entire magical world, I'm afraid that is your problem.

Just because people /have/ killed the past owners of the Elder Wand doesn't necessarily mean it has to be passed down by killing. To begin with, it's probably a better indicator of the kind of person who hunted down the Elder Wand. If anything, Draco's case might well have been the first time the true master of the elder wand wasn't its wielder- which is down to Dumbledore being probably the most benevolent owner of said Wand.

Again, this is canon. My 10 year old self understood most of this perfectly fine. There are plenty of plotholes in HP, but this isn't one.
