Reflected killing curse? Reflected by what? A disarming spell?

Wands don't work that way. Wands don't know the spell that are casted from it, not the target. It either works or doesn't when a wizard uses it.

Since Voldemort was able to cast killing curse it means it worked for him.

The only thing that reflected it was 'disarming spell'.
