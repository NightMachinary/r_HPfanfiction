Ad hominem?

Defeat how? By disarm spell? The disarm spell taht was casted agaisnt normal wand of Draco. The same normal wand that doesn't change loyalty after disarm spell?

Remember those training sessions in 'Room of Requirement'. Everyone was disarming each other. None of the wand change loyalty.

How is it that EW change loyalty even when Draco wasn't carrying it? The defeat that's meaningless against a normal wand which doesn't care about anyone disarming it's true owner.

Linking a free spirited wand's loyalty to loyalty of of a wand that never changes it's loyalty and then claiming that EW became HP's property because HP disarmed Draco's normal wand.

Not to mention the fact that since Voldemort is carrying that wand he beat HP in race to acquire and use EW. EW even shot a killing curse against it's own 'supposed' owner.

I know 10 year old you 'accepted' things without questioning them. But Mature you don't have to adhere to concepts that your 10 year old couldn't puncture through. Normal people do tend to become more intelligent than their 10 year old self.
