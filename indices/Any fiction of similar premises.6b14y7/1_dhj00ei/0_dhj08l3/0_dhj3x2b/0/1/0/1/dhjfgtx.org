Firstly, you're applying the principles of normal wands to the Elder Wand. We have significant evidence that the Elder Wand is unlike any normal wand. We already know wands are semi-sentient; we know the Elder Wand is more sentient than a normal wand.

Secondly, Harry Potter was, at that moment, the Master of Death. Whether or not collecting all three of the Deathly Hallows actually had any part in it is unknown, but it's still a point to be noted.

In any case, if I could understand the logic at the age of 10, then I'm not entirely sure what the problem is. Harry is the true owner of the Elder Wand. Voldemort tries to kill Harry with the Elder Wand. Harry's Disarming spell is basically negligible - with or without it, the end result would be the same. The Elder Wand will not kill its own owner, and the spell reflects and hits Voldemort.
