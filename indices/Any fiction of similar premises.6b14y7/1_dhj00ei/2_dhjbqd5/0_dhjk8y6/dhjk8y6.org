True. Might be interesting to kill of Voldemort (or so they assume) in the first chapter and instead focus on James, Lily and Harry trying to become a sort-of functional family.

Wouldn't be sunshine and daisies as each would have to come to terms with what the others have done and become in their individual universes.

Meanwhile you could have Dumbledore stressing himself out on how to deal with the scar-horcrux. After all, how would two magically powerful but emotionally unstable parents react to reuniting with their son only to find out he has to die (again) to permanently deal with Voldemort.
