Psychology would rather be burning question. I don't see James or Lily forgiving Albus so easily as he left Harry to Petunia's door or didn't do enough to rescue Sirius in 1981. And by no means, I think they would forgive Snape. Especially after his abuse towards Harry and Neville and causing their death in naive universe. Snape's proclaimed love for Lily would go out of the window in a single moment.

Considering they appear in canon world during OotP, Questions will be how three of them cope with themselves. A lots of dynamism possible.
