That would be my focus of this story. The three might decide to overthrow the existing Wizarding establishment after neutralizing Voldemort.

With things getting very different after the DoM battle, Dumbledore most likely would not have been hurt by the Ring horcrux, so he would be their primary target after Voldemort.

But there had to be disagreements between Harry's gang and the Three. Maybe Harry and Neville had to get rid of their mad 'parents' after all.
