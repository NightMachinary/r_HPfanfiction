I can totally see pureblood families watching each generation born less powerful (some even squibs) and looking at some muggleborns come from nowhere and feeling threatened, then plotting to discredit them accusing them of "stealing magic", being unnatural and not belonging to their world. Pureblood families conspiring to get rid of muggleborns rather than being upstaged by them certainly sounds right.
