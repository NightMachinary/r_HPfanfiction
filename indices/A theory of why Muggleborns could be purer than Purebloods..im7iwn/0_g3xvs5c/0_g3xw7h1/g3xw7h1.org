One an indigenous fic sounds great, but I won't write one. I had put a Native American in one of my fics and some people found it to be out of place and didn't like it. I tried to do research to make it fit but I don't have personal experience and I feel I would muck something up and offend people.

Yes blood and magic is a moot point but I guess I thought of it more for a possible comeback in a fic.
