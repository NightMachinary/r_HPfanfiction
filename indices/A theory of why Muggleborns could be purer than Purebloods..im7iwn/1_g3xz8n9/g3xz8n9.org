Some canon support for this: the Gaunts. They weren't shown to be particularly weak magically (bar Merope, but that was due to a use rather than actually being a squib), but they were definitely showing the signs of generations of inbreeding. The Merope rapes a Muggle and out comes Tom Riddle, arguably the most powerful wizard since Dumbledore. Yes, he was a deranged sociopath, but that could very well due to nurture rather than nature, and only worsened when he split his soul apart.
