Maked a lot of sense, magic definitely has to come from somewhere, whether it be genetics (the magical gene would've had to have mutated at some point in the past giving way to the first generation of witches and wizards) or a gift bestowed upon a few who then passed it on to their children and so on. Besides the fact that some Half-bloods are regarded as extremely powerful (i.e. Voldemort, Dumbledore) it is possible that the influx of fresh magical blood strengthens pureblood lines and results in more powerful children, specially with the amount of inbreeding that has occurred within pureblood society which, in relatively small wizarding communities like the British, is even more alarming; we now basically most pureblood wizards are related to each other at this point, if not all of them.
