Rome was founded 753 BCE, it was one of the many central italian kingdoms for the next two centuries, then started to expand as the Roman Republic from 509 to 27BCE. The *Roman Empire* was only founded in 27BCE.

London was founded around 43 *AD*, yeah there were small settlements there before, but no city. It definitely wasn't around in 650 BCE. (And it would never be called Loandom, the various language shift rules preclude that)

The languages that are mentioned are at least doubtful. Briton celtic languages probably differentiated somewhere in the last two centuries BCE, Latin would not be even a trade language. If you try a trade language around that time, you'd try Greek, Phoenician or maybe Carthagenian. Norse didn't exist either. *Proto-Norse* whatever they called it themselves was spoken around the first century *AD*. Whoever may have lived in Scandinavia definitely didn't speak any germanic language.

And so on.

600AD would actually almost work. It would still be wrong, but not as terribly painful.

As I said, I'm not a stickler for details, I never even checked the details of "The Long Journey Home" because it didn't clash with basic history. But when every single named detail is wrong, well, there's the closebox.
