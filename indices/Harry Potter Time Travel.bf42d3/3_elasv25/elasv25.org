Well, there's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][Hero trilogy by joe6991]] (I think part 2 features this) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home by Rakesh]] (fem!Harry), but I don't think either of them is the specific one you're looking for.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth][Wizard from Earth by Morta's Priest]] is kinda similar too.
