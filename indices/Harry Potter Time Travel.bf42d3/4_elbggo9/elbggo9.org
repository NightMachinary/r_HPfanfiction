I liked linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell), though it's abandoned, its final chapter is x-over with smth, and if you type any other name instead of Harry Potter, it's still gonna be ok. But I still like it and recommend it. It's a very interesting read. (maybe one day one great person will adopt this story and finish it?..)
