I recommend [[https://hpfanfictalk.com/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290&ageconsent=ok&warning=3][Detox]] - it's the only other actual Draco/Astoria fic I have bookmarked besides On the Other Side. I found Astoria's character in Detox a refreshing change of pace (most fics I read have a different pairing as their endgame so she isn't explored much beyond being Draco's ex).
