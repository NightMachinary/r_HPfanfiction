That's one of the issues with prophecies.*/You need a time limit./* Basically anything is possible if given enough time. Saying that there will be a tornado landing on that exact spot is an impressive prediction unless it doesn't happen for 300 years at which point it would have began to be unlikely that it wouldn't happen.

A prophecy must be precise, have a time limit, be unguided, and be significant. I'll explain why in that order.

- It isn't a prophecy if I say that sometime somewhere someone will do something. That's guaranteed to happen and is so vague that anything that happens can be called fulfilling prophecy.

- It isn't a prophecy if my predicted event doesn't come true for centuries when I never gave a time limit. Improbable things aren't improbable if given enough time.

- Unguided means that people aren't actively trying to perform it. This is also intertwined with self-fulfilling prophecy. People are actively trying to make the prophecy true which makes it trivial if said people make the prophecy come true.

- It also isn't a prophecy if I order a medium rare steak in twenty minutes and my waiter brings me a steak. That's a completely mundane thing. Sure, it was specific and on a time limit, but it was so normal that it isn't a prophecy. It is also a bit of a guided one as the waiter was actively trying to fulfil it.
