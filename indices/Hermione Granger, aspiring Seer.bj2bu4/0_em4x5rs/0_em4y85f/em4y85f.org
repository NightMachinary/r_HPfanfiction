That's exactly what Trewalney did in PoA : "What you fear will happen the 16th of October". Unless Lavender passed had the most perfect day ever (so full of Felix Felicis), anything even remotedly bad that would have happened that day would have fit the prediction, from Broken Nail to bad grade. By doing very vague prediction, you don't even have to draw the bullseye around it, the client will do it himself.

That also works with the prediction made to Parvati "Beware the red haided man". Considering the school is British, we can suppose there is not a shortage of red heads, but even with the Weasleys alone you had 4 red heads just in her house. Some people say the prediction worked because of how Ron treated Padma during Yull Ball (more than a year later), but with how vague it was, anything would have fitted from Ron puting his foot in his mouth to a bad Prank of the twin, even Head Boy Percy berating her for something she did worked.\\
It's like saying "It will rain" in the future and acting all proud when it does.
