It really isn't for everyone. Harry is basically left alone in the woods and decided that normal boys aren't just left in the woods so he must be an elf.

He gains a basic control over his magic, which only furthers the idea of him being an elf, and just wonders around Britain doing elf stuff. It's a nice short story and I think the author tried a sequal but it's really not built for a lengthy plot.
