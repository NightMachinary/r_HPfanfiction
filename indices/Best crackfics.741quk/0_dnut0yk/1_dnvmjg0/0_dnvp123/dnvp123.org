It kinda follows the old british axiom of making horrifying stuff light-hearted. Like abandoning a child at a park.

Harry goes around in forests, meeting various magical creatures and sometimes humans. He gets a bit of a reputation granting "boons" (magical trinkets he figures out how to craft) further cementing him being a forest elf.

Subverting logical consequence, he doesn't actually die horribly.

The writing is solid & clear, lacking angst and with a slightly satirical, whimsical tone. It works well, if you don't take it too seriously. The sequel gets a bit more serious & dramatic.
