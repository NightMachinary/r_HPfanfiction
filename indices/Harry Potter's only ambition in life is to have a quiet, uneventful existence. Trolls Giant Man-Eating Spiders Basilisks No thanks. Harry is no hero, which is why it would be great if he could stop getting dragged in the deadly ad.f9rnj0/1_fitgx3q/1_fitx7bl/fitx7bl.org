What's left of Harry? Plenty, I think.

Harry in canon never wanted the scar and all the attention made him uncomfortable. He also spent most of Year 5 and 7 and a little of Year 6 angsting about how he just wanted to be normal and everyone he loved dies and fuck the prophecy and really, why couldn't Voldemort just leave him alone?

Canon!Harry had no drive either. Despite what Fanon may says, he was as lazy as Ron and he only ever studied because Hermione nagged him into it or because he needed it to solve a problem related to his yearly near-death experiences. When asked what he wanted to do after school, his answer is along the lines of "If I survive Voldemort? Well...an Auror, I guess..."

+ Canon!Harry was an emotionally stunted orphan raised in an abusive home who had no friends for the first eleven years of his life. He believed that his life was worth less than the lives of others and was okay with dying for The Greater Goodâ„¢.

It should go without saying that a Harry raised by his parents in a loving home with a twin is going to have a *significantly* different outlook on life compared to his Canon counterpart.
