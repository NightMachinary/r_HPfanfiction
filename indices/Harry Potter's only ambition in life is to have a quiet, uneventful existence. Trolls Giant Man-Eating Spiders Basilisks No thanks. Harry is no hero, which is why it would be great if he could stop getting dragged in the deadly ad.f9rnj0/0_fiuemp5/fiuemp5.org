My name is Harry Potter. I'm 15 years old. My home is in the northeast section of Godric's Hollow, where all the wizards are, and I don't have a girlfriend. I attend Hogwarts as a student in the hufflepuff house, and I get back to the common house every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink a butterbeer.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of pumpkin juice and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any rubbish, like dark wizards or tournaments, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
