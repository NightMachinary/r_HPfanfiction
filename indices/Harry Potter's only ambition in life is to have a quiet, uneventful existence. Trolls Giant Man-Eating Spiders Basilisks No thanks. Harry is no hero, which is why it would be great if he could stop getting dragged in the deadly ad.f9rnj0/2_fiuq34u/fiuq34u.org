He was rubbing tight circles on his temples and trying to even his breathing. He would be able to do so for about three deep breaths then his brother's face fluttered behind his closed eyelids and his chest started to rapidly move once again.

He finally opened his eyes and turned to Hannah, who was in the process of creating a wizard version of the Tamagotchi. "Hannah, you're my friend right?"

"It's a trap," Ernie hissed as he passed by the couch in the common room.

"I'm aware," She deadpanned but looked up at Harry anyway.

"Can you just off me?" He pleaded, "A stray spell would work. Just shrink my lungs until I can no longer survive. All I ask is for you to cry at my funeral."

"No."

"I'll pay you."

"Mmm, no."

Harry scoffed turning back to his potion essay, "Some kind of friend you are."

"Ask Susan," Thomas a fifth-year suggest through bits of a pumpkin pastry. "With her Aunt being head of the Aurora department she could probably get away with."

Harry looked thoughtful before Hannah kicked his hip, 'You ask Susan to kill you and I'll mention to Sprout that you need therapy again." Harry cut his eyes at her but she already returned to her project.

"I just can't do this," He hissed throwing his hands up and leaning back, "I don't want to be part of some stupid tournament where people get killed. I just want a quiet and relaxed year, is that too much to ask for?"

"With your brother? We saw the memories, I'm pretty sure you'll be safer in the tournament then within five feet of your brother."

"That is my brother you are talking about," Harry reminded.

"Am I wrong?"

"Well, no. I should see if my parents had any luck pulling me out of this death trap." Harry stood and stretched before rolling his essay up and shoving it into his bag. "Want me to hit the kitchens and grab you something on the way back?"

"Carrots sound good," Cedric remarked behind a book about dragons.

"Anyone else?" Harry asked as he stepped through the portrait. When no one responded he shrugged his shoulders and started the climb to the Owlery. As he passed several students they gave him sad looks or stopped him to share condolences . Apparently, them seeing how he got drug into preventable situations if his brother just listened, made them more inclined to believe he didn't actually put his name in the goblet. On the other hand, no one really believed Daniel when he said that he didn't his name in. They had seen him run headfirst into danger with a smile. Harry was usually several feet behind them calling him and his friends idiots and trying to convince them to use the slab of meat that sat between their ears.

"And where are you off to, Mr. Potter," Professor Snape drawled as he descended the stairs to the third floor.

"Off the Owlery. I'm either going to send post or jump headfirst out the window, haven't decided yet." He intoned waiting for the flight of stairs to swing his direction.

Snape stopped and narrowed his eyes at the boy, "Do I need to talk to Pomona?"

"Hannah already used that threat," Harry relayed as he stepped off the platform.

"That does not fill me with confidence," Snape walked away and Harry knew that he was more than likely going to send a letter to his mother. Apparently jokes about suicide aren't a healthy coping mechanism. At least that's what his parents and therapist have told him.

Hedwig was happy to see him. She landed on his shoulder and ruffled with his hair before pecking at his ear. He laughed and pushed her beak away presenting her with two letters. One for Remus Lupin, asking for more defense books, and one for his Parents. She happily took the letters and disappeared into the night.

After procuring several peeled and wash carrots he made his way back into the common room. He dropped the snack onto Cedric who thanked him. Hannah had disappeared from the couch and in her place was Susan.

"Hey Susan," he cheerfully stated with fake enthusiasm.

"Hannah already said I can't kill you."

He sniffed, "Well, Hannah's a bitch."

"Excuse me?" Said friend yelled from the stairs.

"I SAID HANNAH'S A BITCH."

"Them fighting words, Potter."

For the first night, since his name flamed out of the stupid cup, he laughed. This is what he wanted in his life. He wanted to worry about homework and exams. He wanted to banter with his friends and dormmates. He wanted something stress free. Harry wanted to able to do his own thing without having to burst in at the last minute and drag his suicidal brother out of harm's way. Thankfully, his small little family in Hufflepuff knew this and kept the tournament out of the dorms as best as they could.

Dropping next to Susan, "So wanna go over your flashcards again?"
