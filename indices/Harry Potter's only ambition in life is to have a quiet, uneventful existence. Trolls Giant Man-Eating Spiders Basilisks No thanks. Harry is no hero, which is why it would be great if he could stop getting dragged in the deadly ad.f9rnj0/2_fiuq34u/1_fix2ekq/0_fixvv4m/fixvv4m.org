Harry dropped his bag to the stone floor and slapped the pass that Professor Snape handed to him in the hallway on to the table. He climbed over the bench and started grabbing one of the bowls of mixed fruit while Hannah snatched the pass away.

"Do you mind?" He asked before ripping it out of her grasp.

"Therapy?" She wondered while picking a grape off the boy's plate. He slapped at her hand.

"Yeah, Professor Snape floo called my Mom last night," He muttered.

"Must suck having your professors being friends with your parents." She replied with a smirk.

"Stop enjoying my suffering."

"Hey," Terry called behind the two, "Did you finish the transfiguration essay yet?"

"Yeah, I wrote mine on the effects of metal," Harry confirmed after shoving a piece of pineapple in his mouth. "Why?"

"I'm two inches short."

"Just bullshit a closing paragraph that's what I always do. It recaps the essay and prevents from just a sudden stop." Harry wiped his hands on a napkin before turning his entire body around to face Terry. "Let me see yours."

It didn't take long for Harry to skim through the essay. He mentioned to Terry the few spelling mistakes before handing it back. "Just say something like, /In conclusion, this essay provided examples to support my/ blah blah blah. Works for me."

"Thanks, Harry."

"Herbology with the Slytherins today," Susan announced as she appeared to the left of Harry.

"Let me guess you're pairing with Hannah and letting me hang?"

"You know me so well," She laughed reaching for some toast.

"Ugh, I'll see if Daphne has a partner," He mumbled before scooping his bag off the ground and flung it over his head. Rearranging it on his shoulder, he grabbed the pass from the table and stuffed it into his front pocket.

He had to walk around several groups of idling students just to get halfway down to where Daphne was sitting between Blaise and Pansy. Some Slytherins looked up at him before looking away, others waved slightly, and a few just sneered at him with disgust. He ignored him, most of the ones who didn't like him were because of his idiotic brother.

"Daphne," Harry voiced grabbing the attention of the blonde, "Do you have a partner for Herbology today?"

"Yeah, I'm actually working with Blaise."

"I can be your partner," Pansy spoke up. The left side of her short hair was pinned behind her ear allowing Harry to see the dangling diamond earrings.

"Sure. Is Draco being whiny again?"

Pansy rolled her eyes which confirmed Harry's suspicions. He worked with Pansy before, they worked fluently together. The only time they worked together, though, was when Draco had either annoyed Pansy or upset her. He guessed it was a combination of the two this time around.

"We can head there now."

"You guys coming?" Pansy asked after standing and straightening her outfit. She always wore patterned leggings with her skirt. This time they were black and gray with a floral pattern winding its way around her legs.

The two didn't answer only grabbed their belongings and followed out the door. Once at the end of the hallway, the group heard thudding footsteps and saw Hannah and Susan huffing after them.

They nearly made it outside the school before they were stopped. It was Daniel and Hermione. They had called to Harry, the entire group stopped and watched them run-up to the messy-haired Hufflepuff. Daniel's Gryffindor tie was loose and lopsided and his glasses were crooked on his face. Hermione's frizzy hair was pulled back into a tight bun at the nape of her neck.

"What's up, Daniel," Harry coolly asked.

"I think we should use Dad's cloak to get into the restricted section. We are both at an advantage and I-"

Harry stopped listening at that point and the frustration that had been building in his chest since Halloween seemed to burst out of him. Before he knew it, he was speaking.

"No. No! I'm done. I'm done with the sneaking around. I'm done with the detentions. I'm just done. You want to go out on some half-ass idea? Fine. Leave me out of it. I'm sick and tired of telling you that there are better ways to deal with things just to ignored and be proven right at the end.

"Take the cloak and do whatever you freaking want with it but I refuse to aid you. You are me brother and I love you but at this point, I don't want to be anywhere near you."

Harry's ranting had attracted a crowd of students and several teachers, but he just couldn't stop himself. He was so frustrated from the past years of being dragged around. He wasn't a puppet.

"Stay away from me right now. Hannah was right, every time I'm around you, I seem to be in danger. I want a quiet and normal life and if I keep following you into god know's what, I'll never have it. So just leave me out of it."

Part of him regretted what he said seeing the twisted look on his brother's face but a bigger of him was relieved. He had been ignoring what he wanted for so long just to make sure his brother would stay out of trouble. He was done with it. His brother had to know he couldn't put his life on hold just, so he could go off on a half-baked plan.

"Come on guys, let's get to class." With that, Harry pushed passed the loitering students and out towards the greenhouses.
