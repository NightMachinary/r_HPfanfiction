  considering that no Weasley grandparents are ever mentioned and she seems to have inherited Fabian and Gideon's stuff, it seems fairly likely that her parents died either before, during or shortly after, as well.

I wouldn't say we know this. The Weasleys seem to have loads of family members running around, and just because we don't meet her parents doesn't mean they probably don't exist. I also don't think her having her brother's watch means that she has everything. It's normal for the sibling of the deceased to keep a few things with sentimental value, even if one or both parents are still alive.

Molly gets a bad rap in fanon. I mostly like her. She's not a perfect parent, but she's got a lot on her shoulders.

I know linkffn(8941789) is supposed to be good.
