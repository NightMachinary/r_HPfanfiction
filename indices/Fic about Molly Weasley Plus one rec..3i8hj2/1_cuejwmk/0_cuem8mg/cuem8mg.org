Oh, you're completely right that I'm making assumptions. That's why I said "fairly likely". It just seems a reasonable guess to me based on grandparents never even being mentioned (aside from Ron's chess set) and what we do know of Molly. But yes, it's [not canon and I hope I didn't give the impression I was trying to pass it off as such.

Thank you for the rec! I will give it a read.
