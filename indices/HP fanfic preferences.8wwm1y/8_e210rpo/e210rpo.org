I like to read fan fics that have as little to do with anything Rowling ever wrote about, in terms of plot, characters and place as possible. Only the magic is worth writing about. Nothing else.

I read Harry Potter. I don't need more of it. I read that story once. Rereading it a million times over in slightly different variations won't make me happy. Reading completely different takes on the same magical world will(in terms of characters, plot, style, culture, place, time, etc).

I don't like when the author forces down my throat plot repetitions from the canon, such as other variants of the Marauders, or overly-sentimental prose about the past done in fact poorly and in bad-taste. It quite literally disgusts me.
