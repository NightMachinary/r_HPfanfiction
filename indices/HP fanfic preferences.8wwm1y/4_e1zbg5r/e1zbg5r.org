Don't like it when things follow canon too closely, especially when any number of the minor changes should have rippled out to a vastly different worldstate. Lazy and vexing.

Every good fanfic should have decent grammar, spelling, punctuation, and layout. If I see a wall of text five inches long, generally nope.
