My preferences:

- Well developed original plot, the less canon rehash, the better.
- Canon characterizations, although I expect logical character development under different circumstances.
- Competent, smart heroes and villains; I especially hate dumbing down characters to force plot and manufacture drama.
- I don't mind non magical settings, but if magic exists, then I expect characters to USE MAGIC to solve their problems.
- Basic correctness in grammar, spelling, and cultural background (no smartphones in 1995!).
- Trio, Ginny, Sirius, Luna, Astoria(!), Fleur, Lily Evans, Dumbledore are preferred main characters, although Voldemort, Bellatrix, Lucius Malfoy, Victor Krum, Percy, and any other well developed ones will do.
- Speaking of Dumbledore, finally give his due and don't turn him into a dumbed down plot device like in canon.
- Speaking of Voldemort, don't turn him into an compulsive-obsessive idiot with an excessive reliance on the Unforgivables.
- Speaking of Fleur, I have yet to find a good, completed one that doesn't turn her into an object of male sexual gratification.
- Speaking of Astoria, I do like the name a lot and I want to see her more instead of her sister Daphne.
- Speaking of Lily, I want to see a good ass-kicking Lily in action, not Harry's bad tempered parent who is basically an useless bystander.
- I hate wanks of all kind, whether it's Harry power wank, Muggle wank, or Pureblood wank. Unless you are going for crack or curb stomps, balance of power is essential to have an interesting story. Good guys should be proactive, while bad guys should be subtle.
- No "Good guys don't kill" trope
