I mean, once you get Harry away from the Dursleys (by whatever means), some sort of shopping trip is necessary. The clothing he got from them is described as atrocious. However, that trip can be summarized in a paragraph, and not take up an entire chapter.

I have two longer fics on FFN, both have a shopping trip. One is a couple sentences, one is around 1k words but has quite a lot of character building/development and the actual shopping is just a paragraph in total.
