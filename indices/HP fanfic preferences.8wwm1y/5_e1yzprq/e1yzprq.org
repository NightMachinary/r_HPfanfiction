I'll stay positive and give you what good fanfics need as there are far too many red flags, most flags are rather apparent; usually graveyard scene or a poorly written harem.

Every good fan fic needs 2 things: Originality and Magic.

Originality: Unique Ideas that set it apart and make it memorable. Firebird Trilogy is my ultimate example of this; you instantly know what fic I am talking about and it does something bold and new that no other fics have done. This can be expressed in worldbuilding of an AU, unique characterizations, or a whole new/altered magic system.

Magic: Too often fanfics focus on mundane things. Do you honestly thing wizards need to brush your teeth? Don't focus on events that in a /magical/ world would not occur. It is easy to write what we know which tends to be a pitfall as we don't know about the magical world, we are muggles after all. This especially is prevalent in romance fics, which although focus is on the relationship it isn't a Harry Potter fic if there is no magic.
