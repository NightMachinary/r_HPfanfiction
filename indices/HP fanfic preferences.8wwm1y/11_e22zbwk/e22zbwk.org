A bit late, but I thougth I would try and give my two cents.

One thing I noticed just the other day, is really badly written interactions with self inserts. The one I had found was ok from a grammar perspective, but the more I read the more wrong it felt for some reason. I had an epiphany when the protagonist, who is a 20-something in a 11 years old body, checks out a woman, she notices and she's shy about it. Like she has a crush on SI, who is 11. And this doesn't just happen once.

Also, 11 years old harems are disgusting, especially in SI stories (it's the same goddamn fic too, it was just a disaster)
