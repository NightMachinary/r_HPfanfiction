She has her own 'verse which encompasses all of her 23 stories. The First Day (set right after DH) is finished, but the rest hasn't been updated in over a year. Questions and Answers (the last fic chronologically, set in James/Albus/Lily's time) was updated pretty recently though, and there is 3 or 4 more chapters than there was when I read it a year ago
