Linkffn(10709411) Is kinda like that, only it's temporarily immortal Harry (something like 2350 years) and he goes back in time from the present to the distant past, and his past self in the present interacts with his future/past friends and enemies. Similar with linkffn(10182397).

Warning: Basilisk Born contains a really OC Dumbledore, who is not the greatest. At all. Best to give it a go, and see if you can stand it.

Nightmare Man is proper Evil!Harry. Not Dark, or grey, he's just evil. And sometimes really wholesome.
