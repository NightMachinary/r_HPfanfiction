Do you know, is it much like other fics by this author? I've read Harry met tom and enjoyed it(kind of) but sisyphus bored me pretty quickly. I found the depiction of death!lily unique but i felt like her character wasn't going anywhere.\\
And what's up with the pairing? If not a threesome, is it first one pairing then the other?
