LOL yeah I seriously doubt that most groups of straight British guys are as homoerotic as One Direction... It's well known behind the scenes that at least one, if not two, of those singers are actually gay. YMMV on whether they're secretly dating each other like half of tumblr thinks.

If you're looking for fanfics with very close platonic male bonds, check out Marauder fics. I've heard good things about the Shoebox Project. Remus/Sirius fics would probably be good ones to check out for a mix of homoerotic humor and platonic friendships with the rest of the Marauders. I don't read much Marauder era fic so no specific recommendations for flamboyant friendship fics, sorry.
