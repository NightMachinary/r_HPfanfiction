Not to that level though. While there are odd examples here and there of really close friends, the average group of 4-5 young British men are more concerned with acting as straight as possible - or at least the ones I've met have been. I feel like the Inbetweeners is more representative! (half joking)

More to the point, it's just a bit annoying that a heavily marketed boyband is being suggested as an example of British culture. Bo Burnham's 'repeat stuff' comes to mind.

EDIT: I'm probably dismissing you too quickly. You may well be right. I haven't seen it myself, but it's probably true that HP fics don't show Harry and friends goofing around in the same way most boys there age do, and i would probably include a few jokes like that.
