I think if you went to public school your experience is likely to be far different to the majority of the country's, unfortunately! You're right that once alcohol is in the mix it becomes different though.

I haven't followed 1D, but, without going into detail as to how, I know a lot of the marketing behind celebrities, products and experiences marketed to young women. There's a reason slash writers tend to be young girls.

It's interesting that the OP is looking for a fic that's not slash, but is displaying the same level of homoerotica that they see from 1D. I'm not sure how easily that could be written, rather than shown visually, but perhaps speaks to the fact that the HP series was written by very little sexual tension despite mostly being read by teenagers by the end of the series.
