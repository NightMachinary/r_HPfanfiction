I'd recommend a song by Bo Burnham, repeat stuff, which is all about how young male singers are targeted and marketed to teenagers. If you have some background in that area you may find it amusing.

Onto the point of homoeroticism without homosexuality in fiction or fanfiction, I can kind of understand your point. It is far easier to convey on a visual medium such as television, and conveying body language in prose is a sticky wicket at the best of times, lest a touch be misinterpreted as something more.

It could be averted I suppose by just having the two main characters be straight, although that may have broke back mountain vibes.

Just one more point may I inquire why you assume that most slash writers are young girls? I assumed the same, but would welcome your view.
