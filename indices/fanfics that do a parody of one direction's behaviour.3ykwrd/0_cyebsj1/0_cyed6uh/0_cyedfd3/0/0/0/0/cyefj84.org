Haha, I literally recommended it up thread! Love that song.

I think without the visual medium it either becomes rather forced and fake sounding or outright slash, which is why we probably don't see it more - it requires a writing skill we tend not to see in fanfic.

I think there has been informal "research" (i.e, half-arsed surveys) regarding fanfic authors who tend to be women, although it's more balanced here on reddit. Also, if you've ever shown slash to an LGBTQ person it becomes glaringly apparent that, just like the stereotype of virgins writing unrealistic smut, you have straight people writing unrealistic and painful sounding slash. For young women, slash offers them an opportunity to explore sex and porn without the societal shame of female sexuality - it's "safer" and more accessible, in a way. When it comes to boybands like 1D, it allows them to be both accessible to girls (in that they are not dating other women they would have to compete with), while still portraying them as sexual beings in a fun and loving way. Think of how Harry Styles, commonly written in slash fanfic, is described as hot, cute, sexy by girls who are only just entering their sexuality. He's safer and friendlier than a more stereotypical beefed-up stud.

I probably have't explained it that well but I've been enjoying the last of the Christmas baileys. Essentially at one point of my life my work involved marketing to teenage girls, before I couldn't block out my screaming conscience anymore.
