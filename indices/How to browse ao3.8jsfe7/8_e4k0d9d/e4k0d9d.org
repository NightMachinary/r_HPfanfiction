What I generally do for Harry Potter fics especially. First search for a character or ship Tag. Then click filters not edit your search just filters. Then depending on what I want I select tags. Like for example picking a relationship selecting the characters i want to see or types of stories. I dont use the exclude tag much if I select a romantic relationship unless said romantic relationship isnt popular. Then I exclude the more popular relationships so the relationship I picked isnt a side pairing. Or to filter out relationships I don't like. If I picked characters but not a relationship. And then filter through word count. I personally like longer fics and in my experience the longer ones are better written on average than shorter ones.
