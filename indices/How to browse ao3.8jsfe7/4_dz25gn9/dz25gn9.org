I usually just hope for the best or attempt to look at the reviews if they're any. Or ask around for recommendations. Otherwise, it's a gamble to look up fics on ao3 yourself because you would actually have to read a fic to tell if it is a decent fic that you would enjoy.

Sorry if there's no better way to browse. If they're are any, I am at a complete lost when it comes to that.
