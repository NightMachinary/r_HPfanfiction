With Ao3 I tend to avoid the HP fandom, it is so big and there is just so much terrible stuff it is a lot easier to let other people do the sifting and rely on recommendations. The only way that I find manageable is to sort by specific pairings, there tend to be a lot more rare pairings on the site, just a shame there is so much garbage. If you really want to look yourself, you can use the searching function to remove specific terms/pairings or you can limit to a maximum/minimum word count.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/329]] is the guide to searching in Ao3, best of luck, you will definitely need it, those stupid stories with more tags than words are unfortunately common in every fandom on the site.
