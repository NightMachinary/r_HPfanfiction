[[/u/Annerbhp][u/Annerbhp]] (the author of The Changeling and The Armistice series, annerb on FFN and AO3) posted these filters about using AO3 for Harry/Ginny:

-filter_ids:23931 -filter_ids:497930 -filter_ids:9159 -filter_ids:928562 -filter_ids:10760 -filter_ids:99 -filter_ids:1600 -filter_ids:2390 -filter_ids:18224 -filter_ids:12235 -filter_ids:107826 -filter_ids:9510 -filter_ids:20822

All these filter ids go in Search Within Result tab and exclude Drarry, Snarry, and other ships that the Harry/Ginny tag is full of. Authors tend to tag most of these fics with Harry/Ginny and so this is a good way to remove those.

Of course, if you are not looking for specific Harry/Ginny, that doesn't mean this isn't a useless method. The way she did this is by doing a basic search, then identifying what she didn't want and keeping track of those filter-ids, so you could potentially do the same for whatever you are looking for and tailor it to your preferences.
