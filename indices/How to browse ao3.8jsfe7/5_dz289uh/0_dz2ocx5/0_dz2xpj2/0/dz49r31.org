I think there probably is, but not one that I have ever looked at. I think one of my lingering annoyances is that there is no distinguishing between a ship tag and a 'former' ship tag. Like, the tag for Harry/Ginny and Past Ginny/Harry are the same ID tag. But very different fics depending on what you are looking for!
