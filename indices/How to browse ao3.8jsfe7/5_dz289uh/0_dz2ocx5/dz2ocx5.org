Here's the actual filter codes if anyone wants them. You can pick and chose the ones you want to avoid, and put them in the Search Within Results box with this format: -filter_ids: The specific number you wish to not see in your search results goes after the colon. And if you want to find the filter ID of additional ships that are not here, all you do is click on the ship tag and then click the RSS feed button. If you look at the URL of the page you were redirected to, the number will be there. (For example, the URL for Harry/Ginny is [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/3548/feed.atom]] So if you want to avoid Harry/Ginny, use the filter ID 3548 to filter out those stories.)

Harry/Draco (99)

Hermione/Draco (10760)

Harry/Snape (1600)

Hermione/Snape (2390)

Harry/Voldermort (18224)

Hermione/Sirius (12235)

Harry/Salazar (107826)

Harry/Hermione (9510)

Harry/Tom Riddle (20822)

Harry/Original Male Character (928562)

Harry/Cho (9159)

Harry/Lily Luna (497930)

Scorpius/Harry (23931)

Harry/original female character(s) (1148693)

Ginny/Luna (6643)

Harry/Hermione/Ron (5536)

Harry/Ron (1241)

Harry/Luna (12954)

With all of these it would look like:

-filter_ids:23931 -filter_ids:497930 -filter_ids:9159 -filter_ids:928562 -filter_ids:10760 -filter_ids:99 -filter_ids:1600 -filter_ids:2390 -filter_ids:18224 -filter_ids:12235 -filter_ids:107826 -filter_ids:9510 -filter_ids:20822 -filter_ids:1148693 -filter_ids:6643 -filter_ids:5536 -filter_ids:1241 -filter_ids:12954

Seems onerous, I know, but you only have to construct your filter ID code once and it makes searching for fics by specific pairing so much easier. Happy AO3 reading!
