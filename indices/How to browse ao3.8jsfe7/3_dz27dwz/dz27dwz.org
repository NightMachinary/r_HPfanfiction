The exclude function is the feature I use the most on that website. Usually my "Search within result" field looks like this:

#+begin_quote
  -"m/m" -Malfoy -Snape -Voldemort -Lupin -Weasley
#+end_quote

Unless I am looking for something with Ginny, then I'm manually excluding her brothers.

That way, I won't stumble across the shitty Death Eater ships or the "Happy Weasley family". I know that this method leads to a lot of false positives due to the excessive tagging, but it's still better than scrolling past pages upon pages of slash and the +Nazis+ Death Eaters did nothing wrong.
