Closest I have is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][*/The Revelation Of Harry Forrester/*]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in Boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Due to a charm Sirius put on Harry during the chase he doesn't get discovered by the American magical authorities until he has a big burst of magic during a concert.

Warnings: Mild manipulative (but ACTUALLY well meaning) Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing. Is like half musical theory.
