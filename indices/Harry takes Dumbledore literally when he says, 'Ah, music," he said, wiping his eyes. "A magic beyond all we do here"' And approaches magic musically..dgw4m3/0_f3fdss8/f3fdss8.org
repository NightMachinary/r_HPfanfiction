Generally, there is just crazily little of music in the HP universe. I remember when I was the age of the HP heroes I was completely obsessed with music, swapping tapes with friends (yeah, that marks my age) etc.

There are some song stories which are mostly ridiculous, there are linkffn(3912184;4236594), which have at least something (“[[https://youtu.be/bx1Bh8ZvH84][Wonderwall]]” will never be the same after reading that story). Probably music in linkao3(373224) is one of reasons why I like the story so much.
