I'll look through some fics because I can't remember the name. But a few instances come to mind such as Harry himself (being a pawn, being evil, being mediocre, etc), his friends dying (I think this was a time-travel fic), Vernon, and Lockhart (year 2 plot was not canon but I won't spoil it in case you read it). I'll let you know if I find them but I don't have high hopes because it tends to be a small part of the story. Though hopefully some other people remember these stories. You'll probably find this trope in a lot of Harry returns to his younger body stories.
