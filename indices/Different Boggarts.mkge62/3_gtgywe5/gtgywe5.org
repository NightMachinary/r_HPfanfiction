I can vaguely remember a fic where Harry's Boggart is himself but weak- he had broken glasses and he was cowering. Unfortunately I can't remember the fic name- it might have been a mentor Voldemort or a Voldemort/Harry fic (don't come for me lol), and he saw himself as someone Voldemort wouldn't care about, someone who could be easily abused by the Dursley's.
