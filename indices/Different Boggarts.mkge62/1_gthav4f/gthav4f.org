Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Harry's Boggart is himself having gone full Smaug - gigantic, greedy and dangerous.

For bonus points, Neville's Boggart isn't Professor Snape either (because said Professor has been toned down significantly, so Neville has no real reason to be scared) - it's Bellatrix Lestrange.
