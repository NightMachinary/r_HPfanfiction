I know of two of those; Riddle in the Dark by LeeASherlook linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13372427/1/Riddle-in-the-Dark]]), The Boggart by hypotemoose linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894532/1/The-Boggart]]).

In the first one he sees Tom Riddle and in the second one he sees himself.
