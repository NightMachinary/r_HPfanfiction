In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's massive canon compliant postwar series]], the new Magical Britain has adopted a lot more Muggle inventions, and its Ministry is working much more closely together with its Muggle counterpart. For example:

- Arthur Weasley got off rich by inventing a magical version of the cell phone, called "MirrorPhone". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10113994/1/Research-and-Development][Research and Development]], linkffn(10113994), depicts the process.
- Magically enhanced cars that can fly, go invisible, have expanded interior, and travel through portkeys are common in Wizarding Britain. Harry has a fleet of such Land Rovers for his Auror office, and Hermione has one such Austin Mini for herself. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers of Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), often goes into that.
- They have a Muggle detective OC named Roberta Beadle among Aurors. She first appeared in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]], linkffn(9992917). Later she became of part of their Muggle Interface Team (MIT), working together with Susan Bones and Lavender Brown. This author has written 7 short fics dedicated to their adventures.

In my own little one shot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), Harry briefly mentioned Hermione creating a knowledge repository based on the concept of Internet:

  HJP: Actually, the concept came from a Muggle invention called the Internet. The Muggles have millions, no, billions of computers connected together in order to share information and knowledge. They are all indexed and can be searched. Hermione had complained for a long time that Hogwarts Library missed a catalog, an index system. So during her last year at Hogwarts, she began this project with Professor Flitwick and a few other students. The idea of using advanced Protean Charm to communicate with the Repository came later. It took her several years to get it right. At first, members were writing commands on parchments, now it's all MirrorPhone. But I personally prefer parchments.
