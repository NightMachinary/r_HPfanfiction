You are not my customer. I am putting this out at no expense. I owe you nothing. This was a hobby project to further my own understanding of AJAX, CORS, and DOM traversal.

Leaving 4 comments describing no issues you're having, yet complaining that nothing works, is not helpful.

I've personally tested this in every modern desktop browser as well as multiple mobile browsers across 3 different devices, so I'm fairly confident that it works correctly.

Keep in mind that you will need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, as it is a JS app.

If you believe that isn't the issue, you will need to tell me what the status messages are OR access the developer console tell me what errors you see.
