First and foremost this tool looks really nifty and I'd like to thank you for your contribution.

Would it be possible to add the following sites?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/]] which is the primary site other than FFN

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/index.php]] is the site for Harry/Ginny

[[http://fictionhunt.com/]]

Overall this tool looks very useful and I'm certainly bookmarking it. AO3 would be the priority of the above, as it is the only real competition FFN has.
