Negative 8 downvotes for telling the person who posted a custom website for downloading fanfics that their fanfic downloader doesn't work like they said it does? Why doesn't Zuddsy or anyone else actually respond and HELP ME get it working, the whole point of its existence? Because otherwise it's just worthless and does nothing. I would think Zuddsy would WANT to know that their website isn't working for someone. Why did all of you people downvote me for wanting customer support for a website not doing what it was advertised as doing?
