I could also see this going as "Harry knows Tom is in his body, is constantly trying to kill him in order to prevent him from having a second crack at taking over the wizarding world, everyone just interprets this as Voldemort trying to murder Harry." There could be some really interesting role reversal. What Harry does with inherited death eaters and how he treats them. How Tom navigates being one of the "good guys" and what he can accomplish from that position while still trying to ensure his immortality and take over the world. I would be pretty interested in a "two perspectives" story like this.
