Thanks for getting back to me.

I'm looking for Heavenly Creatures. I tried the wayback machine, but it turns out that they couldn't run java at the time when the site was crawled. All of FA's R rated fics aren't viewable through them ---- folks get stuck at the page where FA verifies age.

There was an error message when I tried to send Anise a message on FAI, but I just submitted a ticket. I didn't realize she was still active there.
