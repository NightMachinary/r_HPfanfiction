For a first, comparing any other magical region with magical Britain isn't entirely fair. Britain had 3 wars in one century. Compare that to some other countries on this planet and you'll see that the rule, not the exception, is that the country will be "backwards" compared to nations with longer peacetime.

We already saw comments talking about the tyrannical hellhole magical America was in Fantastic Beasts. Immediate executions without trial, extreme separation between muggle and magical,...

Modern magical USA may be a completely different case. I would imagine that the american magicals would enter a similar sort of upswing after the Grindelwald Wars and benefit from an exodus of muggleborn and halfbloods from the first Blood War out of the UK. I see no reason why the Americans should lay off their extreme separation between muggle and magical. It seemed to work fine for them - or at least good enough. However, I would think that something akin to a "magical Silicon Valley" would be interesting.

But in any case, you can swing it however you want. Just keep in mind that every culture /ever/, had its problems and hurdles to overcome. A society without problems and darker sides is boring and mostly annoying. The term 'murica-wank was coined because of it. Nobody wants to read about the perfect american utopia where all wizards, centaurs, wendigos, whatever are free and everybody likes and respects each other and also the schools are way better. No. Thats boring, annoying and for a lot of people a good reason to stop reading.
