Of course, things could always dramatically change, given how badly Grindelwald had shaken up the Magical World.

It could be possible that Magical America did a 180 degree just like its Muggle counterpart with Isolationism in face of WW2. Since Grindelwald cheated like hell and was on the verge of victory, Magical America had no choice but to join its European allies in fighting.

Taking control of UK's nuclear weapons would probably be a first step. But Voldemort surprisingly fell from power after only 10 months, so all plans for a military intervention were scrapped.
