It is possible, but detailed backgrounds with reasons for changes to the American wizarding world are usually not given. The fics I've read are just another excuse to portray America as great without any nuance. They're mostly Avengers x HP crossovers, and thankfully the look into the American wizarding world is often minimal.

There was a good one pre-FB though that created a new wizarding school on the west coast that combined wizarding and muggle school subjects.
