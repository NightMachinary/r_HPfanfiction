I figure most of the anti muggle sentiment was anchored on the east coast and as you move west it lightened, maybe not legally but socially. I also think their would be a lot more magicals as we see blood purism still practiced in the HP books so it was probably much worst even a few decades ago so in my head canon U.S. was a haven of sorts for muggle borns or half-bloods fleeing Europe and with this probably came more wizarding areas presumably most of the native american tribes and southern/central american empires had access to magic who probably have their own school where surviving practitioners teach and Hawaii would probably have their own separate school, maybe a big Polynesian one? They probably use the galleon, I figure that Gringotts is the central bank for most of magical Europe and the Americas I also would like to believe that magical Americans could dress a bit more like muggles, but I don't really think so. You know the stereotype of American tourists just being extremely stupid? I imagine something similar with magicals trying to dress as muggles, it may not always be true, but for the majority I believe it
