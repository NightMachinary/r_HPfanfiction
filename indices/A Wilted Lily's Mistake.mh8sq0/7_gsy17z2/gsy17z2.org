It's a very interesting plot and pretty well shows what would happen if Lily burst. I'm not sure if that is what the canon describes, but many people think that when she was angry she was really scary, now imagine her taking advantage of it and becoming more powerful as a result. Definitely Voldemort, he wouldn't have had a chance to kill Harry, as they say love is warm but just as cruel. If Lily had taken advantage of this and hated Riddle with all her heart for killing her baby, Tom's chances were really bad in his eyes.

I think it would be the most interesting to see a Canon! Harry is dealing with this situation. Would he join Lily and find his way home at the same time, or would he rather join the Order of the Phoenix in a desperate attempt to stop his mother, and then /a Force that the Dark Lord doesn't know/ would have a whole new concept. Harry could convince Lily that what he was doing was wrong and take her with him into his universe, but if he joined the Order at least for me, the unknown /Force/ would be purely symbolic. Harry wants to lay down his life trying to help his "mother" regain sanity. We don't know if he would have succeeded. His best chance was to stay with Lily.

You can weave some interesting things into it, like individual chapters from the perspective of Severus, or maybe a single person of the Order or her own followers.

Honestly, it all depends on you, but this is one of the most interesting story sketches I've read in a long time and I'd love to see it when you publish it, so I'd like to ask if you do, link to it.
