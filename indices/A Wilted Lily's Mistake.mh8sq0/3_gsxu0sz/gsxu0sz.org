Interesting idea, but a few suggestions:

  used her emotional agony and pain as strength

But making her more powerful than Voldemort within a few years? That needs a much better development

  Unfortunately, the darkness in Lily's soul/mind affected the ritual she was finishing: the Harry from the reality she took him from turns out to be just as cruel, evil, and horrific as her or Voldemort and her combined: Morgoth levels of evil, not Sauron. She's utterly horrified at seeing what a son of hers became...

Again, the problem here is ridiculous power progression if it involves a teenager Harry. I would keep the plot simpler just having her travel to one world first...
