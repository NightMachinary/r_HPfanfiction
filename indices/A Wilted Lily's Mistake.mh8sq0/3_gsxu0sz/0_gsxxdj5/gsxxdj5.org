Each are a possible route such a story could go in, not all of them part of the same route.

Lily throwing and losing a sanity check, delving into stuff even Tom Riddle avoided in his early years (compared to his later years, when he embraced being Voldemort) straight off the bat? Or disregarding the prices that he was careful in mitigating by doing it slow and steady? I could see it, to be honest.

However, the prices Lily would have to pay... ouch.
