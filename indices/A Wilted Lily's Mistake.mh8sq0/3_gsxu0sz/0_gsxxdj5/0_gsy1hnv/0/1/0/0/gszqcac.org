In Divided and Entwined Hermione herself states that they need to do something about the laws and that they're eerily similar to the laws Jews were subjected to in WW2 before they straight up got sent to concentration camps. These laws aren't there in Lily's time and there's no indication that they will be published - If anything, there would probably be a more positive attitude towards Muggleborns in the general public during Lily's time because of the opposition against Voldemort. There wouldn't be a successful movement like Hermione's one without the right(or wrong, technically) political atmosphere. And I'm quite certain Walburga died after 1981 - Voldemort could easily pressure her into disinheriting Sirius if she isn't already willing to do so, and that's if he doesn't target Sirius himself.
