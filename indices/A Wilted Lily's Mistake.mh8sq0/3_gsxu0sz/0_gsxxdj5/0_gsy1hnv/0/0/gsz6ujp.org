there was this fanfic kaleidoscope of wizard with around 150k words where Lily was the first who awakened a sharingan - that could be used here as well.

for our dimension hoping Lily to surpass voldi , here grief , pain , hatred could do the same -activate a base sharingan , no secret lineage of merlin or slytherin is needed

from there , visiting world tournament duels , help from flitwick , working with the aurors , within 5 years she would be voldemort level in skills and knowledge
