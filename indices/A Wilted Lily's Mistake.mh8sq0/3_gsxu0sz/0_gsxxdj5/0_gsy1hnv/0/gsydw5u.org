Therefore, it's quite impossible for Lily to beat Voldemort with raw power, and fics that go this route are not really more credible than those Indy!Harrys with ridiculous power progression.

And it's not raw combat power that's everything either, because even Voldemort's body can not survive a killing curse hitting his back. Others without soul anchors will just die.

To make Lily into a worse threat than Voldemort, it has to be decades long process, then there's time to build up her power and influence. And don't ever assume that a worse threat means more evil! In fact, the worst dark lords in real world all had many virtues, were charismatic and persuasive, and championed a cause that many followed.

This dark Lily might not be able to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight, but she would have other strengths that eventually killed off both Voldemort and Dumbledore. There are many good options how this could be done without powerwanking her.
