Yeah, I read it: the Snape worship in it was a bit off-putting, to be honest. I mean, I understood why -- he was her friend and his death occurred before the fallout they had in canon could occur -- and I could see the parallel to Snape's canonical obsession with Lily, but... eeeeeh. It was disturbing, but for the wrong reasons the author intended.

...I kinda want to see a riff on this now where James moved on, had "Harry" with someone else, and come his Hogwarts years Lily/"Professor Evans" finds herself looking on Harry with a bittersweet attitude. She'd have the reverse of Snape's situation where she couldn't stand to look into Harry's eyes (given they're his mother's) but not his face (given he looks like a mini-James).

Man, the angst would be delicious -- especially if James and her still see each other on occasion at various events.
