I did not mean that force= magic, but force as a separate form of magic. Kinda like the difference between dnd magic and chakra magic. One where you take magic from outside the body and one where you create energy from your body.

That was what i was talking about. I remember that there was a fanfic where harry had crossed over to the star wars universe and magic was completely separate and existed like a void in the force which was unsettling to the jedi.
