Yet that still has the Magic and Force as being related to one another, and it still buys into the cringey trope: even "magic" in Star Wars is just a branching of alchemy and Force usage channeled in a different way (see Witches of Dathomir and Sith alchemy/magic). HP magic is completely different: it's like liquid and oil in a universe where oil shouldn't exist. Also, Lovecraftian Abomination Harry in the SWU is always fun to read: I know the fics you're talking about by rough memory, and I loved seeing how the Jedi (and to a lesser extent, Sith) freaked out.
