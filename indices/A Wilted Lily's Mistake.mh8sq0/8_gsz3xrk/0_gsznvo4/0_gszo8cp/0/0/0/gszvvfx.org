Tropes are tropes, and sadly enough the sheer amount of tropes in fanfic has become as fresh as two year old cheese exposed in Death Valley.

Originality is key now, otherwise new fics are just often recycled rehashes of another with a sprinkle of seasoning.

The Force = Harry Potter Magic is just another moulding trope.
