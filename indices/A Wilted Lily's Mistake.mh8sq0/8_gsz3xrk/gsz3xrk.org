Maybe crossover with star wars and Lily accidentally gaining the dark side of the force, instinctually learning the various methods of using it.

Maybe include a dimensionally travelling Harry instead, with both of them emotionally scarred and broken, supporting each other and recovering. It can be very touching but please no incest. If romance is needed take an alternate universe where Harry and Hermione married but Harry and her child were killed by some ancient dark lord.

And then Hermione, in a John Wick Style kills the dark lord with common spells. The dimensionally travelling Harry can be a pert of the sequel where they recover from trauma from their respective worlds. Just for drama, maybe include Harry coming from a screwed up fanfic world with a bashing trope thrown left and right, but the Harry is his canonical self. No Lord Potter type please.

This could be fun.
