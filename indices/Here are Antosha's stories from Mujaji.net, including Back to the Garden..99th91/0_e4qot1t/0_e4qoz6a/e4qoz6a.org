Yes, it's all Harry Potter. Mujaji was the website the author posted their stories to I guess. I don't know anything else but that because I only went there for a couple of this author's stories.

I haven't read all of the stories so I don't know what they're all about. I didn't make this post to recommend them, just so that if anyone wanted these stories they could have them since the site went down. Someone asked me to upload them.
