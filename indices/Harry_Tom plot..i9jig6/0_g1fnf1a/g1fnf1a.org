There's always Grindewald to act as the antagonist. I recommend you to make Harry someone who can stand on his own; truly equal to Tom.

I can't stand seeing Harry as weak and Tom as a perfect charming wizard because... Let's be honest, do you thing someone as him would be interested in an unremarkable Harry? No way.
