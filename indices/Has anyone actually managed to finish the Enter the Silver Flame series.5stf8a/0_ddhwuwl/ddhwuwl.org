I haven't finished for two reasons: 1) the amount of unnecessary writing for everything (including the sex scenes) and the sheer graphicness of some of the scenes (sexual and violent).

But from what I have finished (after 1st years winter break), Harry is a top tier Necromancer because he found a multi-dimensional magic tome. The tome presented him with various schools of magic to learn from, and as long as he sticks to his chosen field, the tome will continue to teach him. If he gets greedy, the tome will move on to another dimension.

He becomes a massive drug (potions) and sex trafficker (willing and clean girls only), and murderer (of undesirables), from when he finds the tome (at 8 years old, I think). Hermione is a devoted follower/slave, along with two OCs (that are both one year below in age), as well as actual characters like Tonks (who is only 2 years old then him), Susan, Hannah, and P. Clearwater.

The actual point of the fic from the little that I have gathered, is that he is learning Necromancy because he wants to resurrect his mother, so that he can spend meaningful time with her. And I think he also wants to get massive revenge on Voldemort for killing his family.

One of my biggest issues with this fic (besides that the fact every character exalts Harry countless times, some times in the some scene) is that Harry is shown having sex, but then is at the same time, in his head able to push the pleasure aside to work on a magic problem. I find that fairly unbelievable and a bit ridiculous.

Even though kids having underage sex is a bit squick for me, the actual Necromancy part of the fic is pretty cool. The problem is that while awesome it comes around like every ten chapters. And it is pretty funny that NO ONE is normal, the Flemels have live-in slaves, and use the slaves to keep themselves young, and the Grangers are into torture and murdering people (but only those that are criminals).
