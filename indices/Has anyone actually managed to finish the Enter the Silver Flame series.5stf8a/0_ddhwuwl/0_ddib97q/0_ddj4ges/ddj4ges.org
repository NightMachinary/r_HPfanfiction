True, but I don't think about it too much. The literal age of the characters isn't reference all that often. I just imagine that Hogwarts starts later then in canon.

Even though the author has lampshaded their youth, by saying that due to the high level Necromancy they are performing, they have slightly aged themselves. By like 2 years at the point that I am at.
