I used to feel this way but my perspective has changed now that I have to write as part of my job. I don't write fiction (I don't think I'm creative enough for that); but I have to write concise memos and the like, and boy is it hard to find just the right mixture of words to say in the most effective way possible.

Given that most fic writers are obviously amateurs with no one to help them edit their work or give constructive feedback, I give them slack for their description-heavy writing style. My bone to pick would be spelling, punctuation marks, and general grammar; if it's passable on those fronts, I can't complain much.
