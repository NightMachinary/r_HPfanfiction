I gotta admit, I do find those kinds of 'redundant identifier' things funny. I recently read a fic that started with something like:

'Snape, Hogwart's premier potions master, strode through the hall, cape billowing behind him as he moved towards his intended destination'.

And every time, my brain immediately links it to Harriet Jones and answers "Yes, we know who you are." :D
