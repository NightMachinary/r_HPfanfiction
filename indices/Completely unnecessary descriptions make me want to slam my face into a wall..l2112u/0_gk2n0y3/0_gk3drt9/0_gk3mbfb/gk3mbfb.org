Agreed on the school requirements.

There is a conflict of values here: in a fic, you want to describe the scene and every sentence should be significant, short and simple - that makes it easier to read.

However in HS, the teachers want you to demonstrate your vocabulary. In HS, you should acquire as many options as possible in as little time as possible. In fanfic, you choose only the crème de la crème, the best ones that are most appropriate for the given situation.
