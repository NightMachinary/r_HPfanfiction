The part about (s)he is pretty spot on. It is a trap that all beginner writers tend to step into, one that is quite easy to get out of. The mind tells you that having it all over a page is bad and repetitive, which means the reader will surely notice it and hate it, so you switch it up.

I think saying 'black-haired boy' or whatever only works when the character does not know the character and uses their appearance to identify them. Once a name is exchanged, it should always be their name. No idea.

Curious on what people think of (s)he said, yelling. To me, it seems weird, but I still do it.
