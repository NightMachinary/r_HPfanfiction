Albus stepped through the floo and politely greeted the squib he had hired to watch after Harry. He was not a fan of cats and the sheer amount she had kept him making excuses as he swiftly made his way out the door.

Something about young Harry, fire and his eyes. Hopefully the boy wasn't blind of something similar. That would be a shit show of epic proportions.

Petunia was genuinely happy to let him in, that alone let him know something was seriously wrong.

He followed her into the kitchen where Harry was sitting with his hands over his eyes.

After slowly convincing the boy to open them he realized that accidental magic was a truly insane thing sometimes.

The boy had two pools of actual green fire for eyes, and as he ducked to the side, literal killing curse eyes as well. The boy closed his eyes again as Albus wondered if Harry could win in a staring contest with a Basilisk.
