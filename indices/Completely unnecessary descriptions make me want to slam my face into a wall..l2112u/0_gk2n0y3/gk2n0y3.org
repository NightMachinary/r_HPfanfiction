Many young writers feel the need to vary the tried and true “(s)he said” approach. They see (s)he said this or that all over a page and think it's a bad thing, so they invent all these euphemisms thinking they're helping. They're not, because the point of the words is to describe actions and scenes, not make readers trip over Hemiones bushy hair or Harry's piercing laser eyes.

There are times for the prose to shine, but once the character appearances, names and settings are established, it's time to move on to the story. My $.02 anyway.
