It's a mix between some writers not wanting to use names all the time (which even best-selling authors do) and trying to stick to the old rule of 'Show, don't tell'. So they end up thinking that a little descriptor can add some variety as well as have a tiny bit of showing, too.

Blindly following the 'Show, don't tell' rule often leads to things like this, as well as purple prose and the use of things like 'orbs' for 'eyes'.
