"Well, I answered with Barnaby the Barmy for question three, but I think I got him mixed up with Uric the Oddball..." Hermione said.

The former might work, uninterrupted, for a short conversation - but if a conversation drags on, the reader might get annoyed by constant "he said, she said" without anything other than conversation in-between. At some point, it becomes a breath of fresh air when a character twiddles their hair, or takes a drink, or something /happens/ that doesn't involve more talking.

The writer, meanwhile, might only see the "X said, Y said" as the problem instead of the lack of interplay between conversation and, for lack of a better term, non-conversation - hence, descriptors start getting used instead of names.
