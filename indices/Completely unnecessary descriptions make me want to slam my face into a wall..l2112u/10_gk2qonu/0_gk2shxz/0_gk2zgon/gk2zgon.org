It's really more of the same - the comment above you uses examples for '(s)he said', which can often get fairly ridiculous. But the descriptors are similar in that they're attempts to vary up what's being used to describe a character.

It just gets more ridiculous. Physical descriptors are quite popular (hair and/or eye color), which are pretty funny when people try to find ways to do so with uncommon ones (eg: 'redhead' reads fine. 'pinkette' for pink haired characters doesn't to me). Then once someone reads a story that includes a certain type of descriptor, they're also more likely to use it in their own stories down the line
