Amature authors like to avoid using names and pronouns too often, because they fear their writing will sound too repetitive. Unfortunately they take it to the opposite extreme.

It drives me crazy too, especially when the descriptions are just awful, like people who describe Tonks as "the pinkette". Similarly, I once saw a character with blue hair described as "the bluenette" and I died a little inside.
