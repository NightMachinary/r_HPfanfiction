It comes from a desire to avoid repeating "he said" or "Sirius said" or whatever after every line of dialogue, I think. An understandable pitfall, really, although you're right that it's surprisingly grating to read after a while.

The solution as a writer is to simply get comfortable using pronouns and taking advantage of the fact that if you're in a two-person back-and-forth dialogue, you don't need "___ said" tags at all unless you're deliberately trying to emphasize someone's tone of voice. In multi-person conversations, I don't think there's anything to be done but suck it up and get used to writing out everyone's name's repeatedly, although you can still provide some variety via context clues and variable sentence structure.

Ron shrugged. "I dunno. Hermione?"

"It's obvious, isn't it?" she said. "We need to brew an illicit potion in a bathroom."

They stared at her. "Come again?" said Harry.

"I said we need--"

"No, we heard you," Ron cut in. "It's just...blimey, you've changed, haven't you?"

I don't pretend to be a fantastic writer, but hopefully that illustrates how you can spice up dialogue without being repetitive or veering into "bushy-headed witch" territory.
