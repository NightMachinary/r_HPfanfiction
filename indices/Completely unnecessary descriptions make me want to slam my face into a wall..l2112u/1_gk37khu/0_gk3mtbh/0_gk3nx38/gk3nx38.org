The polyjuice incident was just the first plot point I could think of where it made sense for the three of them to be talking together. The real point of it was the way I varied the dialogue tags and sentence structure.

1. Dialogue, dialogue tag.
2. Action, dialogue.
3. Dialogue, dialogue tag, dialogue.
4. Action, dialogue, dialogue tag.
5. Dialogue.
6. Dialogue, dialogue tag, dialogue.
