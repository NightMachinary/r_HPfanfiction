Beautifully done - also what you've exemplified is adding variety not by changing up the names or pronouns, but by changing the /verbs/.

Your dialogue tags aren't all "said".

There's saying, asking, cutting in.

I won't notice if there are a dozen "(s)he"s on a page, but if all of the dialogue tags are "x said", it will be obvious, and frustrating.
