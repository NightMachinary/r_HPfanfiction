I know, I know. It's just so annoying. It feels like there are so many possible options when teaching students that will improve their writing overall that it's just lazy to teach them to not use the word 'said'. For example, cutting out dialogue tags does the same thing, and is a step that writers have to take when writing some point in the future or writing a scene around the dialogue to prevent the robot sound. It's a flow issue, not the word itself. I think someone said it was a conspiracy to make writing worse? I think it's a conspiracy to be as lazy as possible when teaching.
