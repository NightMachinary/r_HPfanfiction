As Mark Twain said: “When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them--then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are far apart.”

These bushy hairs and these red hairs and these messy hairs all drive me up the walls. I have often quit promising fics just for the extreme overabundance of adjectives.
