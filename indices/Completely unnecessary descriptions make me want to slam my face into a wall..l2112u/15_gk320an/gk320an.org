It may be the author's way of tying the story to canon? I agree, am thinking of how Rowling includes descriptions like that only a couple of times. Like in book 4 when they first meet Hermione she comments on Hermione's larger than normal front teeth and then reinforces it when Malfoy puts that curse on her.
