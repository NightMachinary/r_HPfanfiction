Another reason this an overused writing technique is because authors often have paragraph structure that overuses a characters name, like it's repeated twice per sentence, or multiple times in a single paragraph especially with dialogue going on between two characters. Sometimes it's in effort to establish or identify a speaker so as not to confuse the audience. In cases like this it's better to go back and read the dialogue one sided and answer your questions as if you were another person. Restructuring the paragraph this way makes if flow better, and the readers can easier get the difference between two characters talking in a single paragraph without having to have them identified every sentence.
