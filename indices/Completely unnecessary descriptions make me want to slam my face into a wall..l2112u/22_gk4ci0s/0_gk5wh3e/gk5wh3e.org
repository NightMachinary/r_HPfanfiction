I think you have misunderstood my meaning. I don't hate descriptors, but what is the purpose of using the same long winded explanation every time said character speaks. We all know what they look like. I don't need to be reminded every single scene that Harry's deep pools of emerald fire stare into your soul. Or how bushy hermione's hair is. It's the repetitive nature that is the problem. Not the descriptors themselves.
