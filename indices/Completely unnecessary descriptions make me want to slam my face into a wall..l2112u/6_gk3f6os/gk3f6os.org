A lot of people got the lesson of "don't repeat the same words to close to one another". They didn't get the second part of the lesson about what constitutes 'too close'. Because using the same word every other paragraph is perfectly fine.

Additionally, when writing conversations - you can forego descriptors for a while if you have two people talking, or if it's a direct anwser from the previous speaker

#+begin_quote
  "Fuck me", she said

  "Gladly", Harry anwsered

  "Eww, i didn't mean it like that!"

  "Oh, ok then"
#+end_quote

Though i'd reccomend taking a lesson out of filmmaking and making sure your coversations actually mean something, and that something happens - so it's not just two people talking and staring at one another. Because chances are, if they do, the conversation isn't relevant or you'd do better writing a paragraph of exposition instead of trying to make it a convo.
