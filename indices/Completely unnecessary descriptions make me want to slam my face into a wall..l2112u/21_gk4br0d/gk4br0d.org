I'll admit I've probably done this myself, however as others have mentioned, it's the whole 'show' vs 'tell' which people often swing from one extreme to the other on. It seems to take a number of stories written to find a decent balance point, and even then you tend to tweak as people say things.

I've found it's actually more useful to pull in descriptors for someone's look when introducing them to the scene unless they're doing something to draw attention to that body part and instead vary up the 'he/she /said/' bit a little by either adding descriptors for their tone or changing the word for what they're doing, or adding actions besides the speech.

People will ask, question, respond, reply, snarl, joke, laugh, growl, deadpan, whisper or say things (among other descriptors for speech) with a variety of tones and expressions, and no you don't (and shouldn't) repeatedly change things up, but if someone growls instead of says then you get an idea of how they're responding, however, if someone's got a growly/scratchy voice they're not going to be constantly growling, they'll speak normally for them it's just a rare descriptor to show that the person speaks a certain way that can be added.

The same can be said for accents, it can be useful to throw in a few descriptors or phonetics where needed, but you don't need to repeat it every time the character says something. A good point might be when their accent drifts or thickens due to something whether external or them putting things on.

Honestly, while 'the bushy-haired witch' is fine as long as it's not repeated too often, what would be better for a reminder might be something along the lines of 'Hermione ran her fingers nervously through her bushy hair' or 'she grimaced, fidgeting with her hair nervously'.

Job or ability descriptors... those can be a little more odd-ball depending on where the context is. Easy ones to bring up are those that involve titles that can be used, like 'professor' or 'sergeant', giving a minor descriptor such as what they teach or some detail on looks/habits can be useful, once again, depending on how often it comes up. We don't need to know that McGonagall is the Transfiguration Professor every other paragraph, but it might be something to throw in at points.
