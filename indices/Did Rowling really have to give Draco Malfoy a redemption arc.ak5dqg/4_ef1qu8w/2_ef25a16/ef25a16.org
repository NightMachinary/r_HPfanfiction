He had countless chances to change from his own initiative. Every exam where Hermione scored higher than him was indisputable proof that pureblood supremacy was BS. Every time Harry bested him, every time Dumbledore walked into the Great Hall.

He could have asked Dumbledore for help. He could have attempted an escape together with his mother. And yet he chose violence, he chose to attempt several assassinations. He had countless chances to change and he pissed them all away. He didn't stop when he almost killed Katie Bell, when he poisoned Ron and nearly murdered Slughorn. Those were his second, third and tenth chances.
