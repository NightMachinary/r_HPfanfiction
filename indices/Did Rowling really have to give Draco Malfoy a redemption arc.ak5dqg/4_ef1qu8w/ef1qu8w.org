Draco's behavior throughout the books is terrible, he is just a brat who's been soaking up all the pureblood bullshit, his parents were so in love with. So it his actions make sense, but in the end he is just a dumb kid that was force fed with dumb ideology, so considering what happened with Voldemort and how he was forced to do his bidding and how it almost got his family killed, it does make sense that he'd reevaluate everything he was told, and it does make sense that he would let go of it. Sure it would just be as plausible for him to become some embittered blood purist, who just doubles down on his believes, it wouldn't work themewise though. The way I see it, he was a dumb kid and dumb kid should get a second chance, especially when they're parents are mostly worthless.
