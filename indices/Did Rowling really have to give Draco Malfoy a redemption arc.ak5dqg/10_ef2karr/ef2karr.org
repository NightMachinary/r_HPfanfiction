I don't think Malfoy from books 1-5 had the qualities to be redeemed as a character, but Malfoy from books 6-7 definitely did. He was a product of his environment (Sirius aside, I doubt many could have been brought up by the Malfoys without absorbing at least some of their privileged, racist mindset), and he never really questioned what he'd been taught until he became a Death Eater and realized he was in over his head. Throughout book 6 he becomes increasingly torn between his views and his reluctance to become a killer, all while knowing that his family is going to pay a price if he fails.

So yes, book 6 Draco was definitely open to that path, and I think Dumbledore's mercy gave him the first push in that direction.

As for whether or not he actually had a redemption arc... we never really get that moment where he officially redeems himself, and that's fitting imo, since he's not going to unlearn everything he's been taught overnight. To me, though, his refusal to identify Harry and Hermione - when that would have won the war and saved his family - is a sign that he didn't want Voldemort to win after all, and I like to think that after the war he was able to change his views.
