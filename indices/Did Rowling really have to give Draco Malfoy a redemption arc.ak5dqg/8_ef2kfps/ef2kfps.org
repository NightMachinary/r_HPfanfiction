  as if Rowling owed the readers this plotline and without Draco the books followed only a black-white ideology.

I wanted Draco to have a redemption arc, not because the lack of one is unrealistic, but because it's /depressing/.

I like to judge children's fiction partially based on what message they are sending, and I think letting kids know that just because your parents are racist doesn't mean /you/ have to be racist is a better message than whatever it is we actually got. That some people are terrible and you should just avoid them, I guess - which is valid, but again, depressing.
