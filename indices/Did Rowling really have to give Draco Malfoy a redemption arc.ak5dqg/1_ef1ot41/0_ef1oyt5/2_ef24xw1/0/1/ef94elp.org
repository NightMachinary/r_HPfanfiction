Narcissa still shouldn't have been given a pass for that tho. I think if the story tried to be a bit more realistic, when it came to punishment, Narcissa would have gotten off scott free for her complicity and Draco would have served a few years in prison and then house arrest...but Lucius would have rotted in prison for life.
