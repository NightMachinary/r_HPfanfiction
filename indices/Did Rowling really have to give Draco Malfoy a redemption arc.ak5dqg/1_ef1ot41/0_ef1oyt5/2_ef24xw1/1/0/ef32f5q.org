Do you really want to use the epilogue to measure character worth? The epilogue where Ron assaults a muggle with mind magic to commit fraud? Even then it proves nothing because his father also looked to be well integrated ten years after a war, and look how that turned out.

The British law does not apply underage sentences in case of crimes like murder or attempted murder. By carrying them out the offender proves that he is not a child. Coercion also is not a factor because it only is valid if the threatened punishment is worse than the crime committed. Again, attempted murder cannot be overmatched in that regard.

And the Hague convention has no exemption for being underage. If you are fighting a war, you are responsible for your actions. And given how vocal Malfoy was before his forced service, it wouldn't stick either way.

Narcissa's actions are irrelevant for determining Malfoy's punishment.
