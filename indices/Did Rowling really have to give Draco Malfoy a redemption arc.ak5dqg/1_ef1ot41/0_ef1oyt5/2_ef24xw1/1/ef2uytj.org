Age is not necessarily irrelevant in these circumstances. There are all sorts of international conventions that address children and teenagers (under-18, under-16, etc, depending on the agreement and circumstances) involved in war and hostilities, be it as combatants, material support, messengers, spies, etc.

In most (virtually all) cases, neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment are on the table for minors. A combination of rehabilitation and reintegration is more ideal, though imprisonment is sometimes also involved.

I don't think it's unrealistic to think that Draco, who (despite already being a bigoted bully) was pressed into service under coercion at about 15 or 16 years old. He did some terrible things - and he was always a pretty shitty individual - but he also backed down at times he was compelled to kill (see: Dumbledore), his mother offered some (highly self-serving) support to Harry in the Forbidden Forest, and the entire family walked off when they were reunited and the opportunity presented itself. We have a pretty good sense in the epilogue that Draco wound up being safely reintegrated into the Wizarding World.
