Naming his kid after him and the whole "he was the bravest man he ever knew" totally made it seems like he was redeemed. I don't think anyone would ever prop up a nazi scientist to that extent who turned sides and spied for the allies in those type of terms, and that's pretty much what Snape was.

Would have been better imo if she had Harry argue that Snape deserved to have a memorial plaque or be buried near Dumbledore, rather than the whole schtick and insisting his portrait as headmaster go up.
