I don't generally think authors /have/ to do anything. Ultimately, it's up to them and the story they want to tell. That being said, as a fan of redemption arcs, I'm all for it. Draco didn't have much in the way of compelling traits throughout the first several books, but he did have the benefit of being a child/teenager with parents who instilled a certain amount of toxicity. That's an easier sell than a fully grown character espousing the same beliefs and attitudes. A more dramatic shift could have been done. Whether or not it would have been better or worse than canon is hard to say. Personally, I probably would have enjoyed it more than Snape's, but that's just me.

Regardless of Draco's redemption or lack thereof, I generally find Rowling's statements on the subject to be incredibly condescending. Enjoying Draco---or similar characters or redemption arcs in general---is no more or less unhealthy than most other fictional preferences.
