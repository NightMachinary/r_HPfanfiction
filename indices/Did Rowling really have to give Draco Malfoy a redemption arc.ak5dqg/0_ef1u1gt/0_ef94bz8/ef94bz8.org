Yes, I actually would have found Draco's redemption arc more interesting than Snape's. Draco was raised from birth to think muggles were horrible, likely never met a muggle, etc. He was basically brainwashed, and it would have been interesting to see him "shake it off" and become a better person. His childhood isn't an excuse, but it makes his actions more understandable than Snape's imo.

I can't ever sympathize with Snape that much, because he knew there were good muggles (Lily had loving parents) and he had exposure that not all muggles were his dad, etc. He wasn't brainwashed (not that it is an excuse, but at least it provides some context). And he "still" decided to join a hate group hell bent on eradicating muggles and muggleborns.
