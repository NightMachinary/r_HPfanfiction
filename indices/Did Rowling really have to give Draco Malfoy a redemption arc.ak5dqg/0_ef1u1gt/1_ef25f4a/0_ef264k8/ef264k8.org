A redemption arc generally requires the character to have done something which warrants the possibility or need for redemption. I'm not sure what Cho or Lavender have done that would be considered such. Being teenage girls? Having feelings? I'd love to see more stories about either or both of them, and they're certainly capable of having wonderfully written arcs and development. However, neither would be my first choice for this specific type of story.

I'd also note that going to prison and having a redemption arc aren't mutually exclusive. One can certainly involve the other. Canon may not have gone in that direction, but that doesn't mean fandom can't. I'm personally open to stories where a character finds redemption separate from the, perhaps, realistic legal consequences, but that's not the only option.
