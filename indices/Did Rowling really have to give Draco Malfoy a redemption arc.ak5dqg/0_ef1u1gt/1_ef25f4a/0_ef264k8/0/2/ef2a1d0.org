Honestly, that's fair. It's been a while since I've read OoTP, so while I did recall Cho's stance on Marietta, I couldn't and still don't quite remember the order of things and how much information she would have had regarding Umbridge's worst traits. That being said, loyalty to a friend who fucked up in an awful way still isn't the type of redemption arc that appeals to me personally. I prefer characters who, for various reasons, really hold awful views or do genuine harm. It makes the character growth which can stem from that point all the more rewarding.

In terms of Lavender, I'm not terribly surprised by the fandom. She's got a combination of traits which are pretty prone to being... badly reacted to. That being said, I've got no problem with her. If we're throwing redemption arcs to the good guys, she'd probably be one of the last ones I'd think of.
