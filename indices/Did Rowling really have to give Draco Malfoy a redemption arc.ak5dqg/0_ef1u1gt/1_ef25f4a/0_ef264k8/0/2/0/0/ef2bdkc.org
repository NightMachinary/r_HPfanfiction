I don't disagree. It was a pretty wretched belief to have and I'm sure it could be used to motivate some interesting development. However, Cho is largely portrayed as a decent person who made an error in judgment. That's going to be a significantly different style of redemption arc than a character who has been a genuinely terrible person and who made active choices to commit to the wrong path.

If the former is what you enjoy, that's awesome. My interest lies in the latter.
