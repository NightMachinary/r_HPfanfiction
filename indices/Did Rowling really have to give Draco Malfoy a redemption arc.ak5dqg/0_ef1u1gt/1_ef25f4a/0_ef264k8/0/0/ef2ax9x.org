Marietta was a teenage girl who probably led a fairly sheltered life. To draw a modern analogy, consider how big a role ISIS plays in the life of your average American high school student (let's call her Mary). For Mary, ISIS is a distant threat seen only in the news.

Then Mary's classmate from NYC (who was at Ground Zero for "bring your child to work" day) starts up a defense club teaching other students how to fire guns and defuse IEDs in case ISIS comes back. She goes because all her friends are going, but never really considers ISIS to be a serious threat- that's what the military is there, right?

One day a member of the President's cabinet shows up at her school and tells her that she can either turn in her friends (who joined an illegal weapons training class without adult supervision or oversight) or her mother will lose her job at the DMV. When Mary does, one of the club members tracks her down and carves the word "SNEAK" into her face.

Hermoine doesn't look so justified now, does she? Marietta was a girl forced to chose between her friends or her family, and she chose her family- and was permanently maimed because Hermoine wasn't mature enough to realize that the world isn't black and white. Can you truly fault Marietta?
