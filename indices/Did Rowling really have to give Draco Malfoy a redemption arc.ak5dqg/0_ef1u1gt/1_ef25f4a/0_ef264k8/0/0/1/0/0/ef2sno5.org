Not to disagree with your assessment of Marietta (quite the opposite), but Harry does see Lee Jordan cradling his hand after a detention, and suggests murtlap essence to him.

Also, ignore Hellstrike when he goes like this. He's very excitable, almost like a teenager, and blows things way out of proportion, although he has toned his Marietta angle down somewhat. Last time he talked about her, he was all for trying the girl in a military tribune for high treason or something along those lines. All for snitching her schoolmates to a school teacher.
