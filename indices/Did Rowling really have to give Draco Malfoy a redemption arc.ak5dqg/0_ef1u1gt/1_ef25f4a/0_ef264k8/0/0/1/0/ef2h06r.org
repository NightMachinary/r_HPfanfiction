While I can't argue with the Cedric Diggory part, Umbridge was not a supporter of Voldemort during OotP. /At the time/ she was a high ranking member of the official and lawful government of magical Britain. Furthermore, we have no indication that Umbridge used a Blood Quill on any other students besides Harry, and Harry did his best to hide it from his friends. Name one atrocity carried out by the Ministry that Marietta would have realistically known about, given that she was a member of the general public who lacked the information and perspective of our protagonists.

Furthermore, she was a child. Let's disregard the "strong independent teenager with plot armor" fantasy and look at the situation realistically. None of the Hogwarts students should have been involved in the war effort to begin with. Expecting 15 and 16 year old children to pick up arms and lead a resistance movement isn't a brave and noble thing to do, it's a war crime.

For Marietta (and most of the DA) it was a way to pass their OWLs, not a life or death thing. Sure, her classmates said Voldemort's back- but the government and her parents were saying that he wasn't. Even Hermoine fell prey to the "adults know best" mindset in earlier books- but Hermoine had the experiences as Harry's friend to shake her out of that mindset, where Marietta didn't.

If you look at it from her perspective instead that of the protagonist, or the perspective of an omnipotent reader who has an external view of the situation (and possibly several years of experience and maturity on Marietta) I think you'll find that Marietta can be pretty easily forgiven.

People often seem to forget that there are /three/ sides in any civil war, not just two- the government, the rebels, and the civilians caught between them.
