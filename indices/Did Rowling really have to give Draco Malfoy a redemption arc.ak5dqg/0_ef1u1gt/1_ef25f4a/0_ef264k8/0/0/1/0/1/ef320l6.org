No one was expecting the DA to lead the resistance. It was a self defence training and Harry made it clear that fighting Voldemort is suicidal. I mean, they learned the Patronus charm, which os clearly defensive magic against a creature.

And unless Harry wore gloves 24/7, people would have noticed scars on the back of his hand. Then there was Lee Jordan and it seems implausible that others didn't suffer the same fate. And even disregarding that, the educational decrees were clearly power plays and severe violations of basic rights. It was clear that they were not about improved education.

Lastly and most importantly, Marietta was in her 6th year. So no OWLS or NEWTs for her.
