Cho picked Marietta's side, who just had completely sabotaged the DA, got Dumbledore booted out of Hogwarts and took away the one chance they had at learning how to defend their lives. She not only collaborated with a woman who tortured and maimed children and considered the Cruciatus an acceptable disciplinary method. Marietta also did more to further Voldemort's cause than almost anyone short of actual Death Eaters and Umbridge. And Cho saw no fault with that, she even defended her.

Lavender needs no redemption, but the fandom loves to shit onto her for being overly affectionate. I like her, but that is not a popular stance in the fandom.
