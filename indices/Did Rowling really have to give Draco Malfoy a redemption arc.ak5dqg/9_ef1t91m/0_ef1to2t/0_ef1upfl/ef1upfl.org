In Season 1-2, Zuko is arrogant, foolish, and consumed by his quest to capture the Avatar. The point is (and the analogy I'm making), is that Zuko has a plethora of faults that he later overcomes /which makes him into the compelling character he is/. Draco, in much the same manner, has that same plethora of faults...but no arc to overcome them.
