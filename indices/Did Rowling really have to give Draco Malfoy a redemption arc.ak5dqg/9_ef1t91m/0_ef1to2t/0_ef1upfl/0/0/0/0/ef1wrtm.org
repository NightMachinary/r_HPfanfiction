I agree with you regarding Azula. Absolutely tragic character, loved her story.

And there's the similarity with Draco. Zuko tries to conform to his father's demands and expectations -- that's what sets him off on his quest. Draco is the same, just more indoctrinated into the culture of prejudice that surrounds him. But Zuko is given the chance to cast off his shackles, while Draco present a pitiful parallel. And yet, despite all that, even Draco manages to give us a glimpse of bravery in the moment when he refuses to turn in the captured trio. That is really the killer here -- it shows that Draco does have the /potential/ to become better, but is never turned down that path.
