Draco is heinously abused his father -- and grandfather, just not in a direct manner. It is /their/ choices that steal his own, that lead to a 16-year-old kid taking the dark mark and having the threat of his family's death hanging over his shoulder while being given a suicidal quest.

Regardless... I understand the point you're making. They're not perfect parallels. But they do happen to be characters with major flaws... one of which overcomes them (and this greatly adds to his character) and the other just pitifully waffles by. And this is what I'm lamenting. That Rowling had such an opportunity and then just completely let it pass by.
