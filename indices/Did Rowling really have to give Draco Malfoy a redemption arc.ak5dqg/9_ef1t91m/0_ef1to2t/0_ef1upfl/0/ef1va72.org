  n Season 1-2, Zuko is arrogant, foolish, and consumed by his quest to capture the Avatar

while still being brave, willful and concerned about his honour

i know the point you're making. i'm arguing that zuko and draco have actually little in common, past 'they were flawed teenagers who became better'

zuko was a compelling character before season 3. the blue spirit and backstory reveal in particular were well done
