The lovely thing about reading books is the freedom to interpret any action of any character; that even though we read the same words we still reach different conclusions and end up liking or relating to characters for different reasons. Our experience of the world of Harry Potter is highly subjective, so is it that hard to believe there are people who like Draco Malfoy and think he deserves a second chance?

It saddens me to see an author failing to notice (or more often choosing to ignore) the good sides they, intentionally or not, had given their characters. I'm not claiming Draco Malfoy was misunderstood or that he had a heart of gold or anything - but he certainly wasn't an evil incarnate that many fans make him out to be. As fanfiction writers/readers, we are often more intrigued by villains than we are by heroes, and I think that has a lot to do with their potential for change. Draco's (canonically established) moral ambiguity gives us something to work with.

Tbh, I don't think Draco's popularity in the fandom has much to do with him having redeeming qualities but rather his huge potential for character development- it's quite a challenge to pull off and is almost always satisfying in the end. We like being surprised by characters and seeing one do a 180 is fascinating, whether from good to bad or bad to good.
