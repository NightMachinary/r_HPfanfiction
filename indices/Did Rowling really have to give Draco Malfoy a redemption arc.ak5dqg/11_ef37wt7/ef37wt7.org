Like @solarityy said, authors dont have to do anything. They dont owe their readers custom plots and stories just because a lot of them enjoy /fan theories/ and fanfiction. And as Draco was just a kid, I could see a redemption arc going well for him.

That being said, it really rubs me the wrong way that Rowling thought it a good idea that war criminals not only dodged prison /twice/, but also retained their wealth and political capital. If they were trialed at Nurenberg, they would have hanged faster than they cold say /pureblood/.
