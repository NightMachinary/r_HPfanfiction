  what's compelling about that?

I'm sure plenty of people would have their own take on this. For me, though? It's those negative traits you mentioned. Particularly the cowardice. He's not a misunderstood anti-hero or a genuine villain with a change of heart. He's just a brat and a bully who got in over his head. It's not brave or admirable but I find a good break the haughty arc just as (or more) interesting than a true moral redemption.

In the end, it's all subjective. Though he doesn't do much for me as a character, it can't be denied that Snape is fascinating and certainly one of the more complex aspects of the books.
