no. i've argued several times on this sub that draco isn't evil, because he just isn't, but i don't get the hype. i don't hate him, but i don't find him interesting. he's a coward, weenie and spoiled ex-racist. what's compelling about that?

snape is the best character in the series. the character arcs described in that post are typical. draco lacks the initiative and courage necessary to actively oppose voldemort/his parents. snape is one of the most unique characters in children's lit. period, imo
