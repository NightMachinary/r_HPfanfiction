She didn't have to do anything. Throughout all of the books, JKR showed that she's all about redemption. Almost all the bad guys except for Voldemort were redeemable. It's what makes Dumbledore so damn frustrating. In many ways, Snape is the same as Malfoy. JKR redeems Snape simply because he loved Lily Potter. He didn't actually have any redeemable actions in Canon. He actually sent Harry to his death, which somehow leads to Harry naming a child after him. Malfoy even as late as the last chapters of the last book was still trying to kill Harry and his Friends. There was no redeeming of him at all, he just escaped all punishment as we saw in the epilogue.
