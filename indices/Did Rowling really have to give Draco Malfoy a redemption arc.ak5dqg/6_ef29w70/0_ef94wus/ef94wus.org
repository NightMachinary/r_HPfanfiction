I think what's frustrating is that she basically boxes Snape in towards his actions with Dumbledore and Lily, and leaves out that he was a marked inner circle death eater before he turned. If we go by canon, he undoubtedly did some terrible shit to get up that high---it's not like he had Malfoy type money to get in close with Voldemort. And yet no one wonders about his other crimes, it's all forgiven....

I wish Dumbledore, or McGongall, for once called him out. Said sure, James Potter was a shitty bully towards you as a child, but he grew up and stopped. You never stopped bullying, you bullied children as an adult which is far worse. And judging by your guilt over Lily's death, you know you had a role in the Potters death. So helping to orphan his son and having a role in his death is far worse than whatever James did to you, so you have some nerve to keep harping on the wrongs he did you while he's long dead, and complaining about bullying when you bully children.
