I highly recommend the series "We must unite within her walls or crumble within," which takes another look at background characters and their flaws from a sympathetic standpoint. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2330390][Ugly: In Defense of Pansy Parkinson]]" really stands out in this regard.

  Let's talk about how Pansy Parkinson was a bully, how she sliced and cut with words, how she lied, cajoled, and taunted. She probably left some scars that never quite healed.

  Now let's talk about James Potter.

  Let's talk about James and his carefully rumpled hair and his cruel entertainments. Let's talk about how McGonagall wept for him, how Hagrid bawled, how Lily loved him and Harry stood tall in his image.

  No one wept for Pansy Parkinson.
