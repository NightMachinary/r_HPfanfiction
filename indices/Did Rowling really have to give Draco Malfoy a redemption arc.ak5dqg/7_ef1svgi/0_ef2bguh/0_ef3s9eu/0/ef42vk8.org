I found that story ridiculously frustrating. James was bad, no doubt, but at his worst, he still wasn't a pureblood supremacist or willing to sacrifice an innocent person to save his life. It's as if the author was incapable of seeing any complexity and nuance in their determination to make a point on misogyny. Whatever Rowling's faults, Pansy Parkinson of all people not being redeemed wasn't a mistake.
