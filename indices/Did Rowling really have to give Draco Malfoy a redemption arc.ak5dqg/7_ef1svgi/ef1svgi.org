I've had to re-write my post 7-8 times already. Yes 1-5 had seen him not really being active in regards to the Death Eaters yet spouting their ideology because thats what he grew up with. Year 6 had him take an active role and had him realize that this life required a lot more than he expected. Year 7 even has him slowly breaking away from his previous life. So I say that he already had his redemption arc, as internal as it was.

I'd also like to point out that books 1-5 were very black and white in regards to morality (Sirius being a good guy from a bad family) yet in book 6 things became a lot more grey for a lot of characters. We learn that Regulus, a death eater and tried helping to destroy Voldemort, Dumbledor is fallible, Snape while still an asshole tried to do something good, and Draco learned that being a Death Eater is a lot more of a precarious position than he realized.
