I mean, did he really get a redemption arc? Yeah he should have gotten in trouble for what he did with Ron and Katie and stuff like that, but I wouldn't call him getting a redemption arc or redeemed either.

In my mind a redemption arc is where you realize the errors of your ways, help others out and in turn those people you help out realize that you weren't quite as big of a jerk as they thought.

He still hates Muggleborns, and likely still hates "blood traitors" and similar stuff, but he wasn't a killer, he was given the option of killing Dumbledore and he couldn't go through with it.

Doesn't mean he was redeemed. If anything I'd say that Harry still mistrusts him, Ron still hates him, Draco is more than likely trying to keep his nose clean and not do any more damage, than what was already done; nothing more and nothing less.
