would you say he was redeemed? I hear ppl saying that all the time, but I don't see it. I think a redemption arc would need like, visible growth and change over a period of time. all Draco gets is a few scenes where he like tries to commit murder but doesn't have the stomach for anything other than manslaughter :/ (I'm oversimplifying ofc, but that's the gist)

he doesn't display much change in canon, and not being okay with killing ppl is a very low bar for ppl to be setting him. I agree, I don't think a redemption arc was necessary there. there were other characters who reflected that, like you said.
