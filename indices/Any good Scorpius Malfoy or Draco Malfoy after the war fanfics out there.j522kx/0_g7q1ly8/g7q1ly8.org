Dirty Little Secret by JustAudrey07 is a great Drastoria story that focuses on their relationship but also both of their quests to forge their own paths after the war. Just as a heads up it starts off pretty smutty but becomes much more plot-heavy as the story progresses. It deals with Draco's struggles with his parents (especially father) and his desire to re-establish the Malfoy name and fortune while facing a huge amount of hatred as a former Death Eater, as well as coming to terms with his own internalized biases.
