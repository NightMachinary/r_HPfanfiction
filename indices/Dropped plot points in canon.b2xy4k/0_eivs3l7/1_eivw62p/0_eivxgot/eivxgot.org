I feel like there's definitely some internalized misogyny in the books. Well, not nearly as much as "fat people are disgusting monsters" constantly played for laughs, but I think it's still in there.

Think of the female characters that get the most screen-time: described as shrill, simpering, overly strict schoolmarm, super mom, bossy, generic popular mean girl, psycho girlfriend, etc.

Maybe she is trying to show how much more complex characters are /beyond/ those stereotypes, so it's not really misogynist. But someone much smarter than me who actually has a humanities degree should figure this out, and then I'll read that essay ;)
