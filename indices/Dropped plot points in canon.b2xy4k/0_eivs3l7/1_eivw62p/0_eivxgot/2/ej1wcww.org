I couldn't point you towards it now, but I did at some point see a great post about how Madame Rowling proves with what she's doing that she's not capable of portraying minority problems, including simple discrimination, properly. The person who wrote it did make an argument about her either letting Hermione be turned black or even enforcing that change based on her inability to portray Hermione's difficulties stemming from being a non-obvious minority (i.e. a muggleborn) and thus deciding to make her minority-ness more obvious.

Considering her comments about certain other minorities, negative comments that you could imagine stemming from ignorance (possibly wilful) rather than hatred, I can easily see there being internalised sexism and not only that.
