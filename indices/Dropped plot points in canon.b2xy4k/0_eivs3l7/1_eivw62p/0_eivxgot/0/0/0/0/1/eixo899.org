  What was she good at (besides Potions as Slughorn consistently repeats)? What were her dreams and aspirations? You could argue that she is not alive in Harry's world and therefore not truly a character anyways yet why does James Potter and the rest of the Marauders feel more like real characters?

Because she's dead and we never interact with anyone that close to her. While we have 3/4 of the marauders around 2 of which get serious screen time.

All we have of Lily is people who knew her as a gf of their friend, or their crush who rejected them.
