Yep I definitely see your point! We know Minerva didn't like the Dursleys so perhaps if they spread the word around the order, its members could present a really good opposition to Dumbledore. But for all we know, perhaps she did write to him or Minerva and was ignored or rebuffed.

I love Mrs Figg and I wish she had more scenes in the books - the reveal in OOTP was a thriller for me!
