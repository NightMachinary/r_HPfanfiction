What do you expect Mrs Figg to do though? She does her assigned (Order member) duty of keeping an eye on Harry and reporting to Dumbledore. She's a Squib, she can't really help guard him or make his life easier by magical means. When she babysits him she tries to be nice but knows the Dursleys will not allow her to see him anymore if she's too friendly. Nobody can change Dumbledore's mind about Harry's placement in the Dursley home, but she does try to help where she can.
