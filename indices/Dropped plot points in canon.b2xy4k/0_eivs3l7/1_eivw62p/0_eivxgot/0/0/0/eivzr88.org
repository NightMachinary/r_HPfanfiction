Ah, yes, Cho Chang.

  ‘Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, ‘we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'

  ‘I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly.

More often than not, I lament the way so many female characters come off as one-note compared to the male characters who are depicted as more complex. Lily Evans Potter is the angelic savior's savior, and her beauty and love goes forever untarnished. An admirable ideal, but James Potter, for as much as he shows up on-screen, comes off as much more three-dimensional. He was a rich boy, a pureblood who didn't swallow the ideology, he was a spoiled brat, a bully, a braggart. He was a loving father, loyal to a fault to his friends.

Start counting off the major male to female characters and you realize how many of the ones with actual fleshed out personalities skew to one demographic.
