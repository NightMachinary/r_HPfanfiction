This interpretation seems too simplistic, as it assumes the POV of the story is the author's real opinion. Young Hermione has a crush on Lockhart, but that doesn't mean Rowling herself is presenting Lockhart as some sort of masculine ideal. Rowling is accurately presenting Hermione's flaws. When various female characters hold Fleur's beauty against her, again, that's Rowling showing us the flaws of these characters. She isn't telling us that this prejudice against beauty is justified.
