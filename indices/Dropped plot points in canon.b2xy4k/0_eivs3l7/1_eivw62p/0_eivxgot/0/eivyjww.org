There was a good [[https://old.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/ap3964/as_i_get_older_the_writing_of_lavenders_character/][thread on r/harrypotter]] on JKR and how she portrays femininity in the series.

I found the way Fleur was treated by Hermione and Ginny as pretty awful, and read it as the author's criticism of feminine/girly characters, which was shared by Hermione's (a self-acknowledged author avatar character, and JKR's favorite according to interviews between her and Steve Kloves, the screenwriter behind the movie series and creator of Flawless Movie!Hermione) disdain of Parvati and Lavender, and her dismissal of their interests and hobbies as shallow.

  ‘Fleur's not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,' said Harry.

  ‘Not you as well!' said Hermione bitterly.

  ‘I suppose you like the way Phlegm says /“‘Arry”,/ do you?' asked Ginny scornfully.

  ‘I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?' asked Parvati, smirking.

  It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

  ‘Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. ‘I've never really liked horses.'

The majority of thread responses write off these recurring moments as "teenagers being teenagers" rather than being a manifestation of internalized attitudes on the part of the author, which was kind of disappointing. Reading the series today, I feel it's pretty obvious that some of the writing shows its age, as a product of the early 2000's.
