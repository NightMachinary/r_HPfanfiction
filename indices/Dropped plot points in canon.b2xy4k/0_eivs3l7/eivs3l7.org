The door where love is locked away in the Department of Mysteries; every mention of it makes it seem like Dumbledore expects Harry to be the only one able to open it, and that it'll be necessary if they are to acquire the final weapon against Voldemort.

Don't get me started on Tonks- JKR invented this really cool character with awesome abilities who should have been central to the Orders strategy to monitor and undermine the Death Eaters' infiltration of the Ministry, and she's either stuck on babysitting duty, blubbering about because of a guy, or sidelined with a pregnancy. It's like 'We have Wonder Woman on our side. She's a great cook. I love her souvlaki.'
