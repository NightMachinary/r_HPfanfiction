Really good points on Tonks! Infuriating when you lay it all out like that.

I'm willing to give the Department of Mysteries stuff more of a pass because it's nice to get a glimpse of "the magical world is wide and mysterious" but still sticking to the plot. Plus if Harry literally opened a "room full of love" it would be tough to write that in a way that didn't read like "the Care Bears defeat Voldemort!"

I think Lupin also got the short end of the stick in books 6 and 7. You see him risking everything to evangelize to werewolves and that has 0 results. Obviously not everything characters try should be successful... but come on...
