  The door where love is locked away in the Department of Mysteries; every mention of it makes it seem like Dumbledore expects Harry to be the only one able to open it

I didn't get that impression at all. Isn't there only one mention of it? And I would've been amazed if JKR made Harry open up an actual door to love. It'd be hilariously on the nose.
