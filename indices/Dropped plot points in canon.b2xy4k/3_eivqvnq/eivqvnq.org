The opening chapter to HBP ("The Other Minister") really seemed to suggest that 1) muggles were going to somehow be involved more in the plot, and 2) Scrimgeour was going to be pretty important.

Instead we never see anything really more about the muggle perspective, and all Scrimgeour manages to do before getting killed is scramble unsuccessfully to get Harry to play nice with the Ministry, arrest people like Stan Shunpike, and play unconvincing executor of Dumbledore's will.
