It's funny cause I started the books with book 6 (I was like 8, the only series I had read before was Narnia and Magic Tree House where order didnt matter much) and never realized how important that chapter would've been. Very nice. Also love that chapter for having the two ministers together. Almost felt like a Batman/James Gordon scene.
