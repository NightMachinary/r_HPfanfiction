Wand ghosts was explained, though. If I recall correctly, they were the result of a priori incantatem. The ghosts that come out of the wands are not actually ghosts, but echoes or representations of the people killed with that wand. Think of them like holograms with the ability to act and talk like their original counterparts would, but to a limited extent. Kinda like magic portraits do.
