*Book 1*

- Goblins - a powerful inhuman species that has repeatedly clashed with wizards, sounds interesting.

- Hey there are centaurs in the forest, that seem important.

- Fluffy, how did you get here and where did you go?

- So Lily's protection makes Harry able to sense Voldemort's presence, burn him with a touch, and spell resistant!? Imagine if he picked up a book containing a portion of Voldemort soul.

- So the Flamel's are a married couple of ~600 year old alchemists with unlimited money who owe Harry for protecting their source of immortality and wealth. Seems like that will be important later.

*Book 2*

- So there is another sentient species at Hogwart's called house elves that enjoy the kind of work the Dursley's force Harry to do? Seems like a great cover for more misadventures, especially since the Dursley's have literally starting imprisoning Harry over the summer.

- Deathday Party, neat. Can you tell us more about the HP afterlife?

- Hey there are sentient giant man eating spiders in the forest, that seem important.

- Are mandrakes sentient!? They throw partys so that seems like it should be a higher priority for Hermione, especially since she owes them her life.

- So what other secret's are in the Chamber of Secrets?

- What happened Lockhearts other victims?

*Book 3*

- I have so many questions about Dementors.

- So why did Lupin get to go to Hogwart's, and why isn't there any other werewolves at Hogwarts.

*Book 4*

- Veala, leprechauns, and a sphinx; are any of these going to be relevant?

- So there is merfolk village in the lake, going to do something interesting with that?

- How easy is it to create new magical creatures? Hagrid apparently creates a dangerous new species over the summer.

- Eternal Glory? So are triwizard champions going to be important somehow? What about Krum, he seems important.

- A Death Eater put multiple classes under the Imperious Curse, I have concerns.

- Wand ghosts remind us we still need an explanation of the HP afterlife.
