  ‘Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?' asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. ‘The man who ran---'

  ‘- the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?' Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. ‘He used to give me free ice creams. What's happened to him?'

  ‘Dragged off, by the look of his place.'

  ‘Why?' asked Ron, while Mrs Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.

  ‘Who knows? He must've upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean.'

  'Talking of Diagon Alley,' said Mr Weasley, ‘looks like Ollivander's gone too.'

  ‘The wand-maker?' said Ginny, looking startled.

  ‘That's the one. Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.'

The biggest one I can think of atm is the Mystery of the Ice Cream Guy. Unlike Ollivander, there wasn't a good reason given for what happened to him or why he was targeted. From JKR's meta-commentary, apparently he was supposed to have something to do with finding the Diadem Horcrux, but the expotalk NPC job was given to another character.

That dangling thread is still left unfinished in the book, though.

I don't know if this one counts, but Hermione altered her parents' memory, and this is never addressed in the book after that mention. I thought there would be a subplot of the trio going to fix them and bring them back, but it never happened, and JKR said post-release that Hermione did it off-screen.
