I love all the stories that address this by just saying Voldie really loves ice cream. It's too funny. Also makes sense if you think about it. If I had to lose my nose and deal with meddling 17 year-olds I'd also want a pint of cookies % cream.

I think the Hermione one makes sense because it happens after the event of the actual book and way before the epilogue. No easy way to fit it in. Although if she'd chosen to show that instead of the epilogue, it would've been cool.
