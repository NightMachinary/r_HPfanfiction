For my stories, I made Florean a secret Death Eater who had assisted Voldemort in designing his Dark Mark loyalty-enforcing brands. Being an 'early-adopter', he had less vulnerability to his master's mind arts than the later inductees. Most of his job during the first rise was as a spy in the center of the busiest commercial district of their society.
