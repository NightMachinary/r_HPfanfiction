I'd argue that Hermione's parents are kind of a dropped plot point from Book 1. They suffer from "it's a kid's/YA book so the parents can't really be in the picture so our young heroes can shine" syndrome.

It's been addressed thoroughly in fanfic, but in canon, Hermione's parents never react to being constantly abandoned to spend vacations at school and at Grimmauld place, and all the dangerous things that happen to Hermione (or at least Hermione's guilt about covering up incident after incident).

Either they've always had a distant relationship with Hermione and they don't care that she's drifting away from them at such a young age, or they are heartbroken. Either way you'd expect Hermione to be conflicted about that relationship on-screen at some point.
