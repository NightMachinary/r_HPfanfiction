She does have some negative traits. Arrogance -- when she thinks she's right it's very hard to convince her otherwise. On the other side of the coin is her insecurity about her intelligence when she isn't certain. That only really comes up around exams though - failing to a boggart, excessively worrying etc.\\
I mentioned before a drive to prove herself, and that does manifest negatively in the early parts of book one, at least. She's always raising her hand in class, sharing her opinion or knowledge about something out of the blue. It's what brings about the conflict with Ron. I guess it lessens after that, I'm not actually sure

That could all stem from a distant relationship with her parents. The problem though, for Rowling, is how to show that.\\
Rowling prefers to show, rather than tell. And it's a story about the wizarding world, so dedicating scenes to the muggle world wouldn't really fit her style i don't think.\\
Perhaps the general lack of anything about her parents is the manifestation of her relationship with them. They don't do anything, they don't have any relevance, and that could show that they aren't interested. Their entire lack of relevance to the plot could also demonstrate their lack of relevance to Hermione's life
