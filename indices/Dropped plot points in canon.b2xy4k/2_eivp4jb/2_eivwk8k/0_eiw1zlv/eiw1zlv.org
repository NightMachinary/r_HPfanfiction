Fanfic always seems to want to portray Hermione as having a loving close knit family with absolutely no issues. There's no indication of that at all in canon. I've always figured that her parents were 'career parents' who had a kid because that's what's expected and then went on with their careers.\\
Hermione would have grown up under the eye of a nanny, not exactly neglected but hardly under close supervision. Perhaps books were plied on her to keep her quiet/away from being underfoot. Her constant need to excel and prove herself might well have started as an attempt to get her parents approval, and just ended up being a personal drive.

She certainly didn't seem to complain about gradually spending less time with her parents, even skipping off very early in some of the summer holidays to be in the magical world. In book five she abandoned a skiing vacation in the Christmas holidays when she got wind that Harry was being a mopey lad.

I'd say there was just a lot of emotional distance between Hermione and her parents, and when the cultural distance joined in to help with that, she just let it happen.

Obliviating her parents, despite that, would have still been an emotionally troubling thing, but honestly i couldn't imagine her doing it if she had been as close to them as fics like to say.
