It felt like plain clue-dropping as someone who's used to the way JKR sets up her foreshadowing. Usually there's a payoff or a reveal the end, even if it turns out to be a red herring. Ollivander was kidnapped at the same time, and his disappearance was fully explained. This one got nothing.

JKR confirmed it was a dropped plot in post-release commentary, so it qualifies as an arbitrary meta-disappearance too.
