Hagrid should've been slightly annoyed that Dumbledore let Fudge arrest him and send him to Azkhban when he had no qualms with resisting arrest in OotP. I know it goes against the boner Hagrid has for Harry and Dumbledore but Jesus Albus, not anyear later you gaveHarry a bloody turner to save Sirius. Does Hagrid not rank as highly as that?
