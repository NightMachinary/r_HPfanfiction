I have no Idea where this fanon comes from. Harry isn't anti-killing he kills multiple death eaters in the Battle of the seven Potters and during the Battle of Hogwarts, and the entire point of the Horcrux Hunt was to kill Voldemort. The only time Harry said something about killing was when Remus called him out for not killing a civilian under the Imperius.
