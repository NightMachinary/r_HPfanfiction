When Crabbe and Goyle try to kill Hermione and Ron, you know the two best friends he's ever had, Harry responds with fucking Body binding curses instead of exploding curses or beheading curses.

I'd say that's pretty anti-killing to me.

Not to mention the sheer number of other instances where he decides he's too much of a pansy, like in Totenham Court Road, or the Ministry with Yaxley and Umbridge.
