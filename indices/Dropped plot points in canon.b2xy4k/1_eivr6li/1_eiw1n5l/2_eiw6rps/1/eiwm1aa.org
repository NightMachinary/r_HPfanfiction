Because he chooses not to murder people he's a pansy?

Are you joking?

Even in war you can't just murder people. There are rules to combat and like it or not Harry is a GOOD character. He isn't evil. He isn't dark. He only wants to stop people from hurting others. If he doesn't need to kill them it another charm or curse would do the same job why wouldn't he do that instead?
