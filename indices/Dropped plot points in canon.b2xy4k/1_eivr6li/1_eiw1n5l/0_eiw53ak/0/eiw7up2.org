  Out of desperation.

He doesn't hesitate, and at no point says regrets it or even thinks about disarming them, that is when facing real Death Eaters.

#+begin_quote
  Possibly. He definitely curses a lot of them and they go down but it's never explicitly stated that any of them died.
#+end_quote

Seems pretty obvious to me here.

  Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.

and about your other points

  On the other hand, we have

Harry stupidly deciding to spare Dolohov and Rowle in the cafe, Death Eaters who went on to kill people later, including Lupin.

He doesn't do it not out of mercy, but because he didnt want to give his position away, it were Hermione and Ron who didn't actually want to kill them. Also there is a difference between being against killing and not wanting to murder incapacitated prisoners.

#+begin_quote
  He stuns Greyback at Malfoy Manor instead of using Sectumsempra or some other lethal spell.
#+end_quote

Because that is the most likely spell to bring your enemy down(except for the killing curse, but we dont even know if Harry can even cast it), we know form Snapes memories that even if you hit your enemy with it, they can still attack you back and defeat you, like James did against him.

#+begin_quote
  He again attacks with stunning and disarming spells against Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle who were throwing Killing curses around.
#+end_quote

Harry only uses a single Expelliarmus, its also the only successful spell in that entire battle, and literally incapacitates Goyle as enemy.

Just to be clear Harry kills when he has to, but disarming and stunnig your opponents still still a much better way to take your enemies out, being willing to kill doesn't mean you should kill when its stupid.
