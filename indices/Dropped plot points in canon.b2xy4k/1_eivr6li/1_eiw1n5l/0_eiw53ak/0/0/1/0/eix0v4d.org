  It was some cutting curse, it was around the time Snape invented Sectumsempra, he literally marks it with for enemies, Lupin mentioned that Sectumsempra always was Snape's specialty, its obvious what curse was used.

It's very possible it was in the early stages of being created so wasn't powerful enough to do to James what it did to Draco, or it could have only nicked James' ear and so he returned fire with Levicorpus.

In the quick battle in the cafe/diner, Harry and his friends had the jump on the Death Eaters and could have hit hard and fast and landed killing blows. Even then, they restrained the combatants that were then freed and went on to kill more people between then and the final battle at Hogwarts.
