  He doesn't kill deliberately, ever.
#+end_quote

​

Harry deliberately killed Voldemort, he spent the year rendering him mortal, and entered the duel with the intention of killing him. It definitely counts because the curse rebounded because of Harry and Harrys goal was to kill him.

​

#+begin_quote
  Which jinxes and curses exactly? It sounds more like the stampede killed them, not Harry.
#+end_quote

​

Harry was the one who caused them to be trmapled by the crowd, the crowd is entirely blameless in that situation, he could easily guess thats its going to happen before he started cursing every death eater he could see.

​

#+begin_quote
  How the fuck would he give his position away? Canon just states that but gives us no justification about how that will happen. They can transfigure the corpses and dispose of them in another location.
#+end_quote

Death Eaters were sent to a location because there were People saying Voldemorts name, if afterwards the Death Eaters disappear, its obvious that they were killed by either the Order or Harry.

  Where does it say what spell Snape used?
#+end_quote

​

It was some cutting curse, it was around the time Snape invented Sectumsempra, he literally marks it with for enemies, Lupin mentioned that Sectumsempra always was Snapes specialty , its obvious what curse was used.

  Harry casting /Sectumsempra/ with one wand did enough damage to nearly kill Malfoy
#+end_quote

​

Because Harry managed a good hit slashing Malfoys face and chest, but you cant count on those, a stunning or disarming charm would work on literally any part of the body.

  They are genocidal enemy combatants/terrorists in a civil war, your legitimate government has just collapsed and you have absolutely no means of holding prisoners. One of those two has escaped prison twice already and is a convicted murderer. Ron is literally staring at his uncles' killer.
#+end_quote

​

Just because they had a reason to murder them, doesn't mean that they would still be okay with killing people who unable to defend themselves.

​

#+begin_quote
  In war, there are times when you may have to kill the enemy to permanently neutralize them.
#+end_quote

​

Sure, but Harry judged the situation not to be fitting, he is literally the only one in that scene who doesn't show any actual problem with the idea of killing them, but judged it to risky. At worst you can say he was stupid, but it wasn't the killing itself he had a problem with. On the other hand he totally judged that Voldemort had to be killed to be permanently neutralized.
