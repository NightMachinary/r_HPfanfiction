No, it would have been execution. A much needed execution, an execution that saves lives. There's is a big difference between murder and executing enemy combatants that you have no way or desire to secure as prisoners.

Murder is killing random civilians, murder is attacking a family in their home when they have done no wrong. Killing enemy combatants, even when neutralized, is not murder. It's war.
