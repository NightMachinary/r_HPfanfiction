Theres a massive difference between killing someone in the heat of a battle and executing someone after.

If he'd have killed them in the cafe after they'd already disarmed and knocked them out it would not have been self defence or in a battle. It would have been straight up murder, no matter how evil they were.

Of course he had to kill Voldemort and knew that but he still chose not to damage his soul by casting an unforgivable. Harry is not anti killing in a battle. He's not a murderer. There is a massive difference between the two.
