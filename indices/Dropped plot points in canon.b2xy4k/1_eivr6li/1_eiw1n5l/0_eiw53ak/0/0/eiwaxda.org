  He doesn't hesitate

Again, /out of desperation/ in the middle of the fight. He doesn't kill deliberately, ever. I'll be the first person to agree that /Harry was right to disarm Stan Shunpike because he was innocent/.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd
#+end_quote

Which jinxes and curses exactly? It sounds more like the stampede killed them, not Harry.

#+begin_quote
  he didnt want to give his position away, it were Hermione and Ron who didn't actually want to kill them.
#+end_quote

How the fuck would he give his position away? Canon just states that but gives us no justification about how that will happen. They can transfigure the corpses and dispose of them in another location.

#+begin_quote
  Also there is a difference between being against killing and not wanting to murder incapacitated prisoners
#+end_quote

They are genocidal enemy combatants/terrorists in a civil war, your legitimate government has just collapsed and you have absolutely no means of holding prisoners. One of those two has escaped prison twice already and is a convicted murderer. Ron is literally staring at his uncles' killer.

  most likely spell to bring your enemy down(except for the killing curse, but we dont even know if Harry can even cast it), we know form Snapes memories that even if you hit your enemy with it, they can still attack you back and defeat you, like James did against him
#+end_quote

Where does it say what spell Snape used? Harry casting /Sectumsempra/ with one wand did enough damage to nearly kill Malfoy and required immediate healing. Guess how much damage the spell would've done with 3 wands.

In war, there are times when you may have to kill the enemy to permanently neutralize them. This isn't a war between two legitimate governments but one against a terrorist organisation. Harry's inaction cost lives.
