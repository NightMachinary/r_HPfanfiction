  he kills multiple death eaters in the Battle of the seven Potters
#+end_quote

Out of desperation. The battle was a shit piece of plot anyway, that shouldn't have ever happened.

#+begin_quote
  and during the Battle of Hogwarts,
#+end_quote

Possibly. He definitely curses a lot of them and they go down but it's never explicitly stated that any of them died.

#+begin_quote
  and the entire point of the Horcrux Hunt was to kill Voldemort
#+end_quote

Voldemort basically commits suicide coz Rowling wanted to write wizarding Jesus.

On the other hand, we have

- Harry stupidly deciding to spare Dolohov and Rowle in the cafe, Death Eaters who went on to kill people later, including Lupin.

- Then he later decides to *stun* Umbridge and Yaxley who were engaged in committing genocide instead of ending them which immediately loses them their safe house.

- He *stuns* Greyback at Malfoy Manor instead of using /Sectumsempra/ or some other lethal spell.

- He again attacks with stunning and disarming spells against Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle who were throwing Killing curses around.
