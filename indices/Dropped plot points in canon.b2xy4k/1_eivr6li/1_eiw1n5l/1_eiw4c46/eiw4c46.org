I have written a response to some issue similar but I can't find it right now so I'll type it out again.

The issue with Harry being pacifist is, that while he kills in the Battle of 7 Potters he does so by mostly using Stupefy and similar non-dark, relatively harmless curses.

In every battle 1on1 he uses only stunning or disarming curses even against Bellatrix or any other good fighters. He teaches much more harmful curses in the DA like Reducto, Bombarda, the cutting curse or Incendio. But he still does not use them in battle.

He even kills Voldemort by using the effin disarming curse! If I would face the guy who killed my family and friends I would be trying to harm him.

Harry being pacifistic is, while fanon, grounded pretty solidly in canon as well.

Edit bc words are hard.
