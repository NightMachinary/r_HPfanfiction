  Him trying to disarm Voldie is stupid as a tactic.
#+end_quote

Its not, It was literally the best shot Harry had. Its the spell Harry was most proficient in, using less than your best against Voldemort would be stupid. Harrys plan was to kill Voldemort from the start, if Voldemort ended up disarmed just for a couple seconds Harry could have easily killed him.

#+begin_quote
  To win a fight you disable the enemy. We know that Voldie is extremely powerful. To disarm him might get Harry an advantage but doesnt mean an end to the duel. If Voldie is killed by any means it's over for good.
#+end_quote

Disarming him gave Harry the best chance to kill Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, Harry doesnt kill the DE's being trampled. The crowd does.
#+end_quote

Thats no argument, Harry definitely kills them, its like if you push someone in front of a buss, its still you killing them not the bus driver. Harry also saw the crowd and kept firing anyway, he could reasonably assume that they were going to die, but kept firing anyway.

#+begin_quote
  But still there are points in canon which can be seen as him being anti violence or pacifistic.
#+end_quote

Not many, you cant be considered anti violence or a pacifist just because you prefer not to kill.
