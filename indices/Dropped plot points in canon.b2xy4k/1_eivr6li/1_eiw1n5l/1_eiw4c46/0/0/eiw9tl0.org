The fact that there are no non dark curses is true.

Cited from the HP WIKI: "A curse is classified as a Dark charm, which is primarily defined as any spell that affects the object in a negative manner, usually associated with varying levels of discomfort. A curse is the worst kind of dark magic intended to affect the target in a severely negative manner."

Under that category fall all curses, for example Confringo, Flagrante, Full Body Bind and others that are taught and used as early as the First Book.

So that's a technicality and an error on my part.

But dark magic doesnt make my point of "Harry being a pacifist is grounded in canon" any less true.

He might be using curses etc in canon but there are still many points that could be seen as him being a pacifist in the sense of "No long term harm and/or killing.".

Him trying to disarm Voldie is stupid as a tactic. If his charm is blocked, he is dead. If Voldue summons his wand back, he is dead.

To win a fight you disable the enemy. We know that Voldie is extremely powerful. To disarm him might get Harry an advantage but doesnt mean an end to the duel. If Voldie is killed by any means it's over for good.

Furthermore, Harry doesnt kill the DE's being trampled. The crowd does. We dont know if Harry was using Confringo or the Full Body Bind, both of which are curses. One is most likely deadly and the other is just freezing you. The doesnt aim to kill them most likely.

Your point is that Harry is not a pacifist. That I can agree with. But still there are points in canon which can be seen as him being anti violence or pacifistic.
