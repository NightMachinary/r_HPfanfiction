  The issues with Harry being pacifist is, that while he kills in the Battle of 7 Potters he does so by mostly using Stupefy and similar non-dark, relatively harmless curses.
#+end_quote

​

Not using dark magic wouldn't make him a pacifist if he still uses magic to knowingly kill his enemies, he even mentions later how in that situation a stunning charm was the same as a killing curse. And its also not true, he literally kills one death eater by using a blasting curse on the sidecar. Also there are no non-dark curses.

​

  In every battle 1on1 he uses only stunning or disarming curses even against Bellatrix or any other good fighters.
#+end_quote

Firstly its not disarming curse, curses are dark magic, Expelliarmus is a charm, secondly Harry totally does use harmful dark magic against enemies, what did you think he was doing against Snape and Carrow, and the only spell Harry ever used on Bellatrix was the Cruicatus Curse

​

  He even kills Voldemort by using the effin disarming curse!
#+end_quote

That is literally the Spell Harry is best at, why would he ever use something worse than his best when fighting Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  If I would face the guy who killed my family and friends I would be trying tp harm him.
#+end_quote

what do you think would have happened if Harry successfully disarmed him, Harry would just have killed him, that was his goal from the start.

​

Also

#+begin_quote
  Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.
#+end_quote

​

Here Harry uses dark magic on Death Eaters and they end up dead.

​

And there is tactically absolutely no reason to not use a stunning charm in a fight since it literally brings down the enemy, while a cutting curse doesn't have to. It doesn't make him a pacifist.
