Ended up here after searching for discussion on Turning Times lol.

If what you liked about that fic was the twists and turns where Harry kept making stupid (but IC) decisions that made you wonder “I can't believe the author wrote that. I mean, it makes logical sense why the character would do that, but haven't they written themselves into a corner?! How are they going to get out of this!” then you might like:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] Plot-heavy, unique, and quite funny at times for the sheer ridiculousness of some of the situations Harry finds himself in. It also has some great worldbuilding and manages to explain its magic system in a believable way that makes me think it could be canon (but is way too thorough to be canon). Also has Harry and LV interaction. No time-travel, but I feel like this is the closest in “spirit” to Turning Times.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644/chapters/32183310][Resurrect the Living]] is a time-travel fic where Harry goes back to the start of canon for reasons. Not as much written yet, so difficult to say how plotty this will become, but still thoroughly entertaining. Fair warning: it's also labeled as HP/LV though nothing has happened so far in fic and I get the sense it's be verrrry far off if it did.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] features a Harry that can speak to and interact with the Horcrux living in him. Very long, seems well-plotted, already a sequel. This Harry doesn't really make stupid decisions though. Tom rubs off on him a lot. I mostly put this fic here for the HP and LV interactions and the tone, which is serious and slightly angsty at times.

Some time-travel fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts]] is one of the fics I'm eagerly waiting for updates. It's a time/dimension-travel fic, which features post-war Harry, plus the gang of Ron, Hermione, Luna, Draco, and Blaise getting transported to a dimension where Harry's parents are still alive, Voldemort is operating in the background, plus some other surprises I don't want to mention. It's got interesting interactions between the characters. I didn't think I'd like reading about this particular grouping, but I really like the dynamics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String Down]] is one where Harry gets thrown back to the First War with Voldemort. I haven't finished gotten far, so can't speak to plottiness but it is interesting so far. This Harry is more like Turning Times in that his baseline to start isn't super impressive. I don't think there's gonna be much LV and Harry interaction beyond fights. Also slash.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est la vie]] is a time travel fic where Harry gets sorted into Hufflepuff instead. I read it some years, so my memory's a bit spotty, but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it. The only thing is it's not as plot-heavy and it's very much a “fix-it” fic. So actually not like Turning Times except for time-travel and Harry getting to show off.
