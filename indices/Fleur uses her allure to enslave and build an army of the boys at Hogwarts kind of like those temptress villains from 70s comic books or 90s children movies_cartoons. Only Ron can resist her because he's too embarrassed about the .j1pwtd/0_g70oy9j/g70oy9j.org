Ron was the true prophecy subject all along.

#+begin_quote
  /The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.../

  Ron is the only one who can vanquish Fleur, the actual Dark Lord.

  /born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies.../

  Molly hated Fleur. Under some calendar, the Yule Ball invitation happened as the seventh month dies.

  /and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not.../

  Fleur marked him as her equal when she rejected him. Why else would she reject him? She wants to take an inferior to the ball, after all. The power the Dark Lord knows not is public humiliation.

  /and either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives.../

  Only Ron can save everyone from the Dark lady Phlegm

  /the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.../

  Something from the department of redundant redundancy departments

Voldemort was the real red herring of the books.
