Fleur does a lot better in the Tournament than she would've otherwise. She entrances first the dragon and then the merpeople and then Cedric - overpowering Crouch's Imperius curse on him and inadvertently preventing Voldemort's resurrection.

Or, well, she /would've/ prevented Voldemort's resurrection, except it took a bit longer than she thought to overpower a full Imperius curse, so Harry still had time to grab the Cup first and get portkeyed to the graveyard. Oh well; Fleur didn't really care about the Tournament anyway. And a Dark Lord would've been distracting. Besides, if those tales she heard from Madam Trelawny are true, the Dark Lord is immune to all forms of love. (Or - the thought briefly flickers through her mind - did she mistranslate the prophecy from English? Is it rather that he doesn't know the power of love, so only a true Veela can show it to him?)

But now, with a nod of her head, she sends Harry off to learn more about Defense. Really, it was all too easy to give the Boy-Who-Lived that idea (after what he'd seen with the Dark Lord); the hard part was motivating him to actually do something about it. Gabby would be throwing fireballs at her big sister if she ever learned how she'd been dangled as hypothetical distressed damsel so soon after being a real one.

Fleur still isn't sure whether he's going to the library or to his bookworm friend... oh well; either one, he'll probably do some good. And then, if she has anything to say about it, he'll be teaching others.

Really - it was a fun challenge to recruit English boys into an army; it looks far more difficult to teach them to fight!
