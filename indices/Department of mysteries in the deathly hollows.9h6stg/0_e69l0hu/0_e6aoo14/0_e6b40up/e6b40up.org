Dangerous doesn't necessarily equate with easily weaponizable tho. To make a RL comparison, think nuclear physics: there's an abyss between knowing how an atomic bomb works in theory, and being able to build and */especially/* deploy one.

Besides, Voldemort would be the first person trying to suppress the spread of really dangerous stuff, lest it's used against him.
