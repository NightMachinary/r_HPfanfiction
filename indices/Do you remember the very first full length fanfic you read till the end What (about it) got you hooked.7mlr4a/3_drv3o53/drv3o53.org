Not 100% certain which one it was -- either The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville or Gabriel by Shikatanai (unfortunately unfinished).

Both were the 'Harry is rescued from the Dursleys' premise, and were written very well. Gabriel had a totally different take on the trope, while The Best Revenge introduced several new plot ideas.
