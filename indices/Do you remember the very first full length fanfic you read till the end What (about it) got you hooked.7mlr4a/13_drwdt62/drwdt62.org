Mine was Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter. I found it by Google searching "Who would win in a duel: Tom Riddle or Hermione Granger?" which popped into my head when I was reading The Half-Blood Prince during a study abroad. It's a Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger romance. Even though I'm not into that pairing, it remains my favorite story I ever read on FF.
