Ugh I had to look up the title but, as embarrassed as I am to say, it was "The Greatest Scandal in Hogwarts History" the big clusterf/@/ where Harry gets Ginny pregnant at Hogwarts and it becomes this epic journey with unconditional support from all the professors, parents and other adults who are 110% on-board with teenage pregnancy for some crazy reason. I can't believe I'm still a fan of H/G and Ginny overall today, after subjecting myself to trollop like this, and worse convincing myself I liked it.

In my defense it was first posted back in 2001. Canon was only up to Book 4, which had been released the summer before, and the first movie premiered right after the fic had started to be posted. I shared an old desktop with my entire family and our rural area still only had 24k dialup. It could take a good 30 minutes just to get online and upload the newest chapter. There wasn't much in the world of HP fan fic, the fandom had yet to really develop. I was also still in middle school and still wrote SI fics of my own, so my taste left something to be desired.
