Complete or are incomplete but abandoned fine too?

Because if they are fine too then mine was “Realizations”. As to what got me hooked, well ... a tale of Harry finding a true place for himself, I don't think I need ot elaborate on that.

And if those don't count then “Oh God Not Again!”, and the reason I got through it is because it's an over-the-top comedy.
