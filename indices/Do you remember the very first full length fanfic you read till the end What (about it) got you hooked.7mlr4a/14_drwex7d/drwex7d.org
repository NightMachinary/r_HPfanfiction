"Geheimnisse der Vergangenheit" by Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Its the first in a trilogy (just checked... he finished the third one a few years ago? I think I have to read the whole series again now!) of fan fics. The main characters are OCs one year younger than Harry who are in Slytherin and Ravenclaw. What pulled me in was that I wanted a story with a "good" Slytherin, but did not want Harry/somebody else romance. Then I fell in love with the characters.

First English language fan fic? "Living with Danger" by whydoyouneedtoknow. I wanted a story where Harry was rescued from the Dursleys and got a happy family. I think I read a lot of those stories at this point, but most others just did never get finished.
