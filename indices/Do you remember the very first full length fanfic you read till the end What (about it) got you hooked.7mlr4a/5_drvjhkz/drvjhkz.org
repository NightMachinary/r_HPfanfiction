I didn't start reading fics until after HBP because I needed something to get me through until the next book. The first real Fic I really remember is a Fic where Severus and Dumbledore faked his death and Dumbledore was like a bumblebee. I'm not sure it was even ever finished. It was on like mugglenet I think way back when it was a forum based place people posted fics at. You had to scroll through comments to get to next update.
