R trilogy by greengecko. The third story was only like 30 or so chapters in at the time, and I never really did go back to it. The story had a lot of interesting concepts at the time, some of which are still pretty neat today. That being said, my opinion on these that type of story hasn't changed, as I think it would be much better without any of the Snape stuff.
