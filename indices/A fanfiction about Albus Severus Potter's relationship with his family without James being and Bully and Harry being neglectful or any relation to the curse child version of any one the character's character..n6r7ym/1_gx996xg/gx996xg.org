G. Norman Lippert's James Potter series has a supportive and functional Potter family. Harry doesn't give a damn about the fact that Albus is sorted into the green and silver and James' freak out is clearly motivated by love as he thinks Albus only agreed with the Hat to spite Scorpius (who is sorted into Gryffindor) and is now under the influence of an upperclassman who James considers dangerous.
