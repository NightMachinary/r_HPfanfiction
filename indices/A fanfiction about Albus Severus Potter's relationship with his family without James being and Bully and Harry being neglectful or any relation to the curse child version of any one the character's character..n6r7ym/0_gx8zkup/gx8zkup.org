Dudley's Memories and its sequels have pretty realistic family dynamics - James and Harry are often at odds because James is 17 and a little too much like Harry, and their conflicts reminded me a lot of the conflicts between Harry and Sirius. At one point James steals (and crashes) Harry's broom and Harry goes mad at him because he's freaking out that James might have been very injured, for instance, and James gets very upset at the reaction.

Harry and his interactions with all his children, and his wife, are pretty true to character and there's no random ousting of children for being in the wrong house at school. At one point Harry mentions that he “likes having the set [of Hogwarts houses].”
