I'd have to trawl through a bunch of fics, and I'm in the middle of something equally unimportant but significantly more interesting (Victoria's Secret/AMAgeddon). If you read an hp/nt fic, 91% of the time Charlie was her former boyfriend and made her hate men. I think chesleyb's fic was one. Halfblood Auror I think.
