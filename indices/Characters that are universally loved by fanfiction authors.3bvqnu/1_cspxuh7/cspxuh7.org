Hagrid - while completely befuddled by the Headmaster's awesomeness, he is nonetheless a decent and heartfelt man of little guile and much humor. Bash-authors don't trust him but they don't vilify him either.

Charlie Weasley - as cool as Bill but isn't competition for any harem-building Harry with his eyes on the best canon-confirmed hottie. His absence is his innocence.

Tonks - like Hagrid, would be assumed to be loyal to the Headmaster but without nefarious intent or actions. For that matter most Hufflepuffs are safe bets, with Zacharias Smith the exception- he's an obvious blowhard to be shoved into a sea of fire for the comedy.
