While Bellatrix moved around Hermione, knife in hand and an evil grin in her face, Luna cleaned and charmed the Erumpent horn she had gathered from her late fathers house.

"What're you doing there, luv?" Bellatrix asked, never letting her eyes wander off the disgusting mudblood before her.

"I'm preparing our playball for Hermione to run around the yard with. I'm certain it will be loads of fun." Luna answered, her voice as ethereal as ever.

"Now, why would you do that?" Only a slight fading of the mad grin on Bellatrix' face betrayed that, once again, her plaything had surprised and subsequently confused her.

"You see, beloved." the blonde witch started, her eyes full of mischief. "I was wondering how one would turn the Tripping-Hex into a lethal spell. I have found the solution."

Hmm... this could truly be an interesting thing to try.
