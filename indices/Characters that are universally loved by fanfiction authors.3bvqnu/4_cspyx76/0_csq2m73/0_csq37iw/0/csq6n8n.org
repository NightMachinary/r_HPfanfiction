Doesn't seem like Luna, though.

"Mrs. Lestrange, what are you going to do with Hermione Granger?"

"We're gonna have a little chat- girl to girl!"

Luna looked at Bellatrix. Eventually the lack of verbal reply annoyed her, so Bellatrix glanced over at her new pet. Luna was Looking at her. Looking. Very sternly.

"What? You want me to save this piece of filth? She knows something and I will have it out of her."

Luna replied, "She doesn't have much imagination. If she says she's never been in your vault, I'd believe her."

"You'd believe anything, my pet!"

Luna replied with much patience, "I don't believe that you understand. There will be no cutting. If you think her blood is filthy, you shouldn't leave it spilling all over your sister's house. And what did we agree about names?"

The madwoman let out a whine. She loosed her grip on Hermione's arm and trudged over to stand directly in front of Luna.

Luna stared.

Bellatrix drew her wand, but stopped.

Luna stared.

Bellatrix swung her arm out, ready to backslap the slight-framed witch before her. Then she took a breath and her arms slumped to her sides.

Luna whispered, "What did we agree?"

"I'm the pet."

"There you go. Now, you can slap that uppity Granger a few times because she needs to know you're scary, but that should be enough."

"I thought you liked this one," Bellatrix muttered.

"She was quite rude to me on several occasions. I won't enjoy watching it, but hurting her a bit does seems fitting."
