It's not nearly as harsh as bashing in fanfics can be, but in Santi's /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/, Flitwick is neglectful of Harry (who is sorted into Ravenclaw), refusing to help him learn more magic outside of class, being unaware of how other Ravenclaws are treating Harry, and whatnot. It's a significant influence on why Harry decides to transfer to Durmstrang. But Flitwick is later regretful of his actions, and I recall he's treated somewhat sympathetically here, so maybe this isn't the best example. Even when being bashed, Flitwick gets off lightly.
