That's not being bashed. Bashing is when the character is made OOC, mainly by grossly exaggerating the negative points of their character while getting rid of the positive points of their character, in order to make a character that the author dislikes in canon to be so bad that everyone who reads the fic will start to dislike them also.

Commonly, it is coupled with the character becoming so mind-numbingly stupid that Harry can beat their plans with ease, theoretically making Harry look bad-ass.
