Actually, I would argue Percy is even less likely to follow the family, as shown in OotP. However, he is so detested by the vast majority of the fandom that he is unlikely to get a sympathetic edit in a Weasley bashing fic. The twins are the right combination of rebellious enough to not follow the crowd and fun enough that people want to write them in a positive light. People can imagine themselves being friends with the twins, while Percy seems like a giant stick in the mud.
