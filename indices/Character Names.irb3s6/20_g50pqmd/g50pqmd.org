Misspelled names bother me quite a bit, but I have a solution. There is a Chrome Extension called InteractiveFics, that allows you to change words in fics. It was made for reader insert fics I think, but can easily be used for this. I use it to change Lilly to Lily, just because I prefer it that way.
