I always get a laugh when the name "Luscious Malfoy" comes up because the author doesn't know how to spell Lucius. I mean, it bothers me, but it's also hilarious for a guy we know has a lot of arrogance and pride to have his name misspelled as "Luscious". Kinda makes me think of him doing his own shampoo commercial.
