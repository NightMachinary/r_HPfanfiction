I think it says they died of dragonpox, which I always found as an shit reason since there must have been a huge breakout of dragon pox, Euphemia and Fleamont died of it, Abraxas Malfoy died of it. So many wizards who although have much longer lifespans than humans randomly died of dragonpox in their 60s, 70s, etc to help facilitate the plot of them not being there.

I mean I get JK is shit at math, but she needs to at least come up with a better excuse than Dragon pox for every character that somehow randomly died in their 60s/70s even though wizards have an average lifespan of 134 yrs. I mean I get for the plot it's convenient to have every Black killed off but the three black sisters and Sirius, but it's just lazy then again it is JK.
