there's a minor plot point in “face death in the hope” by lullabyknell about this which I thought was rather entertaining.

minor spoiler: Charlus went to America and got involved in the magical side of WWII, after which he and Dorea faked their own gruesome deaths. It becomes a Black family legend and the currently living Potters are the only people who know they're alive.

minor-moderate spoiler: as it's a time travel story, Harry's origins are initially unknown. James thinks that he's Charlus & Dorea's grandson, and the continued existence of that branch of the family is why he's not saying where he came from. A fun nod to how common that is in fanfiction
