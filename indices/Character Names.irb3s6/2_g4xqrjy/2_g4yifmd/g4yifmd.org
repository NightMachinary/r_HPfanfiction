I generally prefer Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents because if they aren't, and we know that Potter is a generally uncommon name in the WW, what happened to them? Where were they when Harry was orphaned? Are they unrelated to Harry (which seems unlikely as Sirius says all purebloods are somehow related, including he and James), did they not know or care about Harry, or are they just dead, in which case what happened? Before, it was pretty straightforward that if they were Harry's grandparents, they died before Harry was orphaned. Fleamont and Euphemia have just raised a lot of questions that JK will more than likely not be answering because she gives us info about things we *never asked for* and ignores what we want to know.
