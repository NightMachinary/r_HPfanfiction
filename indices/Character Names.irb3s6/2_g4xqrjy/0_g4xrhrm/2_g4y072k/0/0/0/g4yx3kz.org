[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/official-final-version-sm.png][All we know is that Dorea Black married Charles Potter, they together had one son. Dorea is only 5 years older than Sirius mother, so she's in the age range to have been James's mother. She would be on the older side, but it would explain ehy James is so spoiled. Dorea died in 1977 which explained why Harry had to live with the Dursleys. We never heard about another Potter that died during Voldemorts first war, so people just assumed that James was the son that died.]]
