My thing is that I want consistency within the work itself. I can overlook Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents as long as the author is consistent with the information within the story. Same thing with Harry being named something other than Harry; in this case I simply wish it was Henry, which I've seen used pretty rarely.

You also have to keep in mind that some of these stories - probably not all, but some - may have been written before some of this information was available. For example, the whole reason that Charlus and Dorea Potter were thought to be Harry's grandparents is because they were the only Potters of that era that appeared in canon. These days I find it less excusable, but still that case might turn up.
