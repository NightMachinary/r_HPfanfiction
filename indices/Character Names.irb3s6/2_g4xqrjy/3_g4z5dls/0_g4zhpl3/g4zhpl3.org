I think it comes down to if it's important to the story. For example, in situations where Harry becomes the heir to the House of Black, Dorea being his grandmother lends legitimacy to that claim. However, if you're merely mentioning who his grandparents were, I'd prefer that you stick to the established canon. Basically at this point, you need to establish why Dorea and Charlus Potter are Harry's grandparents in the context of your story, because even though there is debate about the level of canon that Fleamont and Euphemia's relationship to Harry encompasses, it is still canon. Once you establish it, though you're golden.
