The most egregious to me is that all these characters' first names are in the FFN character tag drop down list, and even when it's one of the story's character tags it'll still be misspelled. So they refuse to even take fifteen seconds to check, or are so supremely confident that even when they tag the character it's still misspelled.

I'm an insane level of detail-oriented most of the time so I literally can't imagine skipping at least basic proofreading. My grammar might not be perfect, but like hell am I not going to misspell something even in a dumb internet comment. I even spellcheck myself when I'm drunk for fuck's sake (i.e. right now). So all the wrong names like “Delores” and “Hadrian” and etc hurt me, though I'm mostly numb by this point
