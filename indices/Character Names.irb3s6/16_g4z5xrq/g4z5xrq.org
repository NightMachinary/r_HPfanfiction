I get really irritated when people misspell another's name (or simply just /words/) and I can't tell you how many times when I've come across someone saying Harry's "real" first name is Hadrian. Sure, it's a wizarding world sounding name, but I really dislike Harry as short for Hadrian if you're doing it that way. Wanna give Harry a fake name in a time-travel or cross-dimensional fic? Sure, Hadrian Peverell sounds good. Just not Hadrian Potter.

Now if you want to expand Harry's name, Harrison is fine depending on the circumstances. Harold is one I'll hate simply because I hate the name Harold and Hank is typically a nickname for it anyway. And saying that Draco's name is Draconis in some instances is fine (say, for a very posh wizarding political fic where Draconis Lucius, heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Malfoy is a thing), just not for most fics.

For the messed up family relations, I actually prefer Charlus and Dorea being Harry's grandparents and Fleamont and Euphemia being his great grandparents. It just helps more if you're doing a fic where you want Harry to have blood relations to the Black family. In Lord Potter-Black fics make his grandparents Charlus and Dorea, but in a Drarry fic make his grandparents Fleamont and Euphemia so they aren't blood-related, no matter how distant.

As for things not being canon, it's fanfiction for a reason. We're allowed to omit certain facts in canon. Take the Cursed Child, for example. Everyone hates it and no one believes it to be canon. We're allowed to nitpick canon and choose what we like and what we don't like. It's a part of fanfiction.
