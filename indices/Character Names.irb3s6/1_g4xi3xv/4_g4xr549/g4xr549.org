"Blaise Zabini is a girl" actually has a very good reason (for us, at least).

He's mentioned in the first book but without anything to identify his gender. Now, in English you can say "Blaise Zabini went to Slytherin"/or whatever that sentence was without being gender specific... In my language no. Our translator did an amazing job, and has invented some brilliant terms as translations (for portkey, dementor, auror...), but when she bet on the sex of Blaise - she got it wrong. Who knows, maybe even JKR didn't know that Blaise was a boy back then.

Edit: I googled it. Blaise is a French name that is traditionally used for boys, but nowadays is also used for girls. Which raises another question - why do everyone (JKR included if it's canon and not fanon) say he's Italian?
