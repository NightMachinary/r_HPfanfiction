Usually Blaise (in Fanfiction) is from Toscana or Lazio and speaks Italian as his mother's language (which could open a new discussion about Google translate in fanfics), but I take your correction about Valle d'Aosta :)

About the father I kinda disagree... I mean, if JKR bothered saying he's Italian (and I honestly don't remember if it's canon or fanon), why not say that he's half Italian and half French? He could always be an immigrant, though, I suppose. However, I think it's mostly lack of care by fanfic writers/JKR, something like: "I've filled the 'quota' of the 'foreign dude', who cares if it's correct/fits/makes sense".

I'm defending this point quite passionately, considering it never actually bothers me when I read... XD
