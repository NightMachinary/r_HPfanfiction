There are some parts of Northern Italy which speak French (Aosta Valley has it has one of its official languages). We also don't know who his father was, He could have been French (making Blaise half-French/half-Italian). I don't think we even know if Mrs Zabini kept her maiden name and gave it to her son or if she kept her first husband's name for some reason, so Blaise's biological father could be the Italian one and his mother the French one (I actually read a fic that portrayed Mrs Zabini has being French/living in France). Zabini is also a surname of Italian and Portuguese origin.
