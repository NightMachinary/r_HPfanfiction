If magical Britain uses the names it shares with the muggles the same way they do (William and John for males, Susan and Irma for females...) I don't see why magical France wouldn't do so, especially when the two named characters (Fleur and Olympe) are very female names.

Plus the most famous French Blaise would be Blaise Pascal, the philosopher that lived in the XVIIth century, before the statute of secrecy.

.

But then I'd be more then willing to accept Blaise as a female name if there was an explication to it, whatever it is and if it wasn't the only name to have this treatment.

Tl;dr: if female Blaise exists then male Susan do as well.
