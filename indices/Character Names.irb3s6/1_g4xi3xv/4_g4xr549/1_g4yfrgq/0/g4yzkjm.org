  Where is it in use for girls ?
#+end_quote

I just googled "is Blaise a name for a girl or a boy?"...

#+begin_quote
  Plus I doubt that parents would be allowed to name a girl such an obviously male name.

For me it's not a very obviously male name. I've never heard it before HP and I doubt our translator did. I also doubt she googled it back in the 90's...
