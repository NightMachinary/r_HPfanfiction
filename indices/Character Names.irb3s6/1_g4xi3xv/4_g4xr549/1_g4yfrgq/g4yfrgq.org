Where is it in use for girls ? I [[https://www.parents.fr/prenoms/blaise-36682][checked]] and while it was only given to a handful of boys each year in France, they didn't have any occurrence for a girl named like this in the past few years.

Plus I doubt that parents would be allowed to name a girl such an obviously male name.
