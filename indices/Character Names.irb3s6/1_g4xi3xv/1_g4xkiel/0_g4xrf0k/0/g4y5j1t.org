That is, in fact, where the name Dolores comes from. It's derived from 'Maria de los Dolores' - usually rendered in english as Our Lady of Sorrows.

And Delores is one of the variants that cropped up with the name migrated into the anglosphere. As errors go, it's not such a big one, although in the British setting of Harry Potter Dolores would be /much/ more likely. And usually betokens at least some Irish heritage. Naming your daughter for the Seven Sorrows Of Mary fits with the old tradition - no idea how prevalent it is nowadays - of giving kids extravagantly religious names. (Personal favourite: from the late 50s, family member of mine was at school with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Gonzaga][Aloysius Gonzaga]] O'Leary, who she remembers to this day.)
