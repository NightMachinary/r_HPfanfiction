Honestly, the one that I hate the most is 'Delores Umbridge'. I have no idea how it came to be but I've seen multiple authors make that mistake and while I love reading about Umbridge getting what she deserves this mistake takes it from satisfying revenge to 'uuhh umbitch bad'-bashing.

Then there's 'Hermoine' - instantly dropped, and 'Blaise Zabini is a girl' for no other reason than wanting Harry to have a Slytherin GF who isn't Daphne. Oh and also Macgonagall. Makes me wanna cry
