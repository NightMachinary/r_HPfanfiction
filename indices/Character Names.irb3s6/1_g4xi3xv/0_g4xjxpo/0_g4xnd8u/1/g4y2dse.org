There was a female Blaise starring in a book published around the time of the first book - that's why I assumed he was a she.

(It was one of the earlier Night World books by LJ Smith - the same author as The Vampire Diaries.)

  Could have been looked up, even back then. Oh well.

The internet in the mid nineties was a vastly different place than it is now <.< Looking things up wasn't really what it was used for (and teenagers during the mid to late 90s were even discouraged from doing so). When HPB was published in 2005, wikipedia was only a couple years old and google was still rather new to the 'most popular search engine' crown.
