Yes! And the hilarious thing about the librarian getting cranky about what we were doing on the internet was... it wasn't like we could use it for school work. Typing up essays was barely a thing (and wasn't even required yet!) and we weren't allowed to use online sources. So like <.<

I read my first fanfic in the middle of the night when I snuck onto the family computer (basement computer + upstairs bedrooms = nobody heard the dialup whistle LOL) Still remember what it was too, and funnily enough it was for the Night World. ([[http://www.angelfire.com/ma/EnterAtRisk/staria.html][Staria's story]]. Also, angelfire still exists? I thought it was gone just like geocities.) Though, there was a set of Cassandra fics for Highlander that were a pretty close second. Those ones taught my young self a lot about the aftereffects of abuse, actually.
