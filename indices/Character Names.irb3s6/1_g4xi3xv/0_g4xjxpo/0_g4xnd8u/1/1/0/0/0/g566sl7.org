Honestly, I didn't read all that much back then - and I think Quizilla was after my time? When in high school, I only read a handful of stories. The Night World one because it was a potential ending, and a few Highlander (TV) ones that did wonders for my historical nerdy self... and I think all of them were on random personal websites like Angelfire, Geocities and Tripod etc. And honestly, other than the Hope Saga by Parda (Highlander) they were all pretty bad and my teenage self knew it. It's only been about five years or so since I got back into fanfiction.

Once I got to college I no longer had internet "at home" (or a computer), and the college was rather tiny - there were only two computers in one of the student lounges for my program (we had our own building), and residence had six. Total. There wasn't a computer lab. So I didn't really even have the access to keep reading, and after a while it stopped being something I thought about. Although, I do remember sitting around in the student lounge playing neopets?
