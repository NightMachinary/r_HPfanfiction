This was my thought! The idea today that you couldn't just look something up is so foreign. Late 90s you were still dealing with dialup ðŸ¤£. I now read fic on my phone. Even in the early 2000s I had to sneak onto fanfic websites in the school library before the librarian saw and told me that wasn't what the computers were for, and print out each new chapter so I could read it at home. I didn't have my own computer until i left for college. The family one was for my parents work and our schoolwork. "Research" for fanfic was often either not possible or just very discouraged a lot of times. Then fandom developed and some things just became accepted.

Yes, I know I sound like an old person telling the kiddies about "back in my day..." ðŸ˜„
