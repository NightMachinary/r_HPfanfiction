Yeah :D The one with a witch talking to a snake LOL

That was the first time hearing it for me too, and looking back I seem to remember going "huh, that's a /girl's/ name?" and then going "okay" and moving on. By the time I started reading Harry Potter, my thought process was - one Blaise was a witch so this other one must be too.

As an aside, I loved that series /so much/ and I'm still bitter that we never got book 10.
