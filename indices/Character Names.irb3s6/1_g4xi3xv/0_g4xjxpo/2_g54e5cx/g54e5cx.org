Yep, this is early fandom because it's a gender-neutral name and there was no textual evidence either way. Actually, because there were several obviously male Slytherins in Harry's year, the guess that Blaise was a girl wasn't all that unreasonable. Even now, Blaise is fun for fanfiction because of the lack of concrete information about him. He's more flexible while still staying technically canon.
