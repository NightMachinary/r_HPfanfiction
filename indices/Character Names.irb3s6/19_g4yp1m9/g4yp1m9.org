Disagree on the names Harold and Henry. Many people called Harold might shorter their names to Harry, and one of the (formerly) most popular Royals in the UK is Prince Harry, but his name is Henry. If a person's fic wants to expand on "House Potter" or something, a posher name makes sense. Harrison is bad and there is no greater sin than Hadrian.

As for names where it's not spelt the same way e.g. Alastair for Alastor, I think it's fine as long as it's consistent. There are lots of variations of a name like that (Alastair, Alistair, Alasdair, Allister, Alister, Allaster), and I don't think it's that big of a deal if I'm honest, just as long as the characterisation is right. If you think someone's gotten it wrong accidentally, just comment about it if it's still being updated, an author who cares will be grateful. Purposely spelling it wrong and you can get in the bin.

Making names up for characters who don't have names is fine, just look them up to see if they don't. Pick something that fits with the character and the world.

I don't care what Harry's grandparents are called, just as long as there is consistency. Charlus and Dorea were his grandparents to those who read and write fanfic when they were the only potter's there were. And it kind of made sense, how quickly Sirius got on with James. Some people don't like the new stuff or what's in the EU and don't consider it canon (and this happens in so many fandoms) and that's fine.
