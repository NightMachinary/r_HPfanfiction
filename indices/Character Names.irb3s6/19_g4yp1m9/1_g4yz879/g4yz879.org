  y. If a person's fic wants to expand on "House Potter" or something, a posher name makes sense. Harrison is bad and there is no greater sin than Hadrian.

it depends on how far back they want to place the Potter Family in the history of the world, honestly. the origin of the name Henry is French. Hadrian is Latin/Roman. Harald or Haraldr would work if they wanted to give the Potters Norse ancestry. you know, having a tradition of using certain names within the family.

Harrison i'm largely indifferent to, but isn't really a big deal for me, either.
