-Anything where Harry is leaving Magical Britain behind and they add "with a special someone" because it almost always means Draco Malfoy and people have realized that a lot of us don't like him and don't want to read about him as a main character, so they try to sneak him in by not tagging him as a character or mentioning him in the summary.

-"See inside for the full summary."

-"Things happen."

-"Will change the summary/title at some point, I promise."

-If every sentence int he summary ends with an exclamation point, I lose my patience and won't bother.
