Yeah Sherlock/HP crossover fics are one of the only crossover that I like, there's so much possibilities for detective work and great murder mysteries. I haven't checked the new ones in a while though, but I definitely will soon. Though a lot of the existing fics are a variation on « Sherlock rescues Harry from the Dursley and adopts him » (sometimes the Dursley die, sometimes they just abandon him, etc.), I haven't read any of these ones. I did read a few entertaining Hermione/Sherlock fics, can't remember any names but some were nice, if a bit short.

Another crossover that can be interesting is marvel cinematic universe/HP, I haven't read many but there's so much potential, Harry and co could be recruited by Shield, etc. I know there are a few Hermione/Loki stories where she's recruited to heal him, or to help keep him captive, because his magic makes it hard for muggles to do that.
