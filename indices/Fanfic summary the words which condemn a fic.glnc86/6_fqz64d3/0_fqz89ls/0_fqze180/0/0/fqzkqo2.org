I've never seen a Marvel/Harry Potter crossover that I found interesting, but I guess MCU could work if done right. Helps that the MCU is mostly set after Harry Potter, and that in that universe, most people become aware of superheroes when Harry would be in his late 20's/early 30's. That could lead to a world where people wouldn't be as freaked out by magical powers, especially after Scarlett witch became widely know, thought there would of course be the same problems of fear of those more powerful. It could lead to the loosening of the statute of secrecy as magic is interpreted as super powers.

Edit: Forgot to add that it being set when Harry is an adult means that the existence of superheroes doesn't fundamentally change how the Harry Potter series plays out, because it definitely would. The Wizarding World would have changed in response to any revelation of the existence of superheroes, and any fic set during Harry's time at Hogwarts would have to reflect that.
