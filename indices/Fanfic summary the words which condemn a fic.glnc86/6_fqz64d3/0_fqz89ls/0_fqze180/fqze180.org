Honestly, the idea popped in my head and I knew it had to exist. Thanks for passing it on, too bad it's abandoned. Just found out there are over 400 crossover fics on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] between Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes, most of them with the TV series Sherlock (modern setting helps), but a few with the books or the recent moves. Heck, there is one crossing over with the series Elementary but it's in Spanish. I'll check on the one you linked and look through other crossovers for what I'm looking for when I feel like reading it.

The version I'm imagining would involve Harry as an Auror and initially involve conflict between them before allowing Sherlock to investigate. Could be followed up with sequels where Sherlock is consulted on murders or other crimes that are difficult to solve. Heck, thinking about it I'd loved to read a fic where Gringotts brings in Sherlock after the Philosopher's Stone is stolen from their vaults.
