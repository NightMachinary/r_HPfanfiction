Bashing, any sort of phrase purporting a story to be the real story, betrayed (harry by his friends, a random death eater by voldemort could be good), Dramoine or Draco/Hermoine, Hadrian.

Anything describing the story as being slash or femslash as a main focus of the story (I'm a straight dude and prefer straight romances, but don't mind if other pairings are slash or femslash), or describing the story as taking part in a game or being a crossover.

I can only think of a few crossover that I might find interesting, like Sherlock Holmes investigating the death of someone who had been AK'ed and finding his way into the magical world somehow (please let me know if this exists) or if Harry (or Voldemort, especially him) was pulled into the world of Fate/Stay Night as Caster (honestly, if FSN was more popular with fanfic writers, it could be the king of crossovers). Too many crossovers just take characters from other stuff and throw them into Hogwarts, or take HP characters and throw them into other universes without an interesting justification. And while I know it is fun for some people to see their favorite characters interact, it's not my thing.
