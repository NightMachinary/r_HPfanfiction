Frankly if I see a pairing - any pairing - that the author has felt the need to highlight in the description, then I'm significantly more likely to avoid it. I'm willing to read most any pairing. If it happens in the story. If the story happens in the pairing I'm not interested. I'm not reading fanfiction for "the best pairing" or "what should have happened". I want to further explore and enjoy the world and alternatives to the story. Telling me the pairing in the summary means that I'm exploring a pairing.

And man, some people get /obsessive/ over pairings
