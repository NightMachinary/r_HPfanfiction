In my personal experience, I got attacked A LOT by people for 'not warning them' about the pairing even when I tagged the eventual pairing from the beginning. Even if it looks like this, [X/X] to signify that it is a pairing in the fic, people don't pay attention for some reason? So I will usually add at the end of my summary a small A/N: [Ship name] to warn people. If someone attacks me over the ship despite it being tagged and coming RIGHT AFTER THE SUMMARY, then it is their fault for reading.
