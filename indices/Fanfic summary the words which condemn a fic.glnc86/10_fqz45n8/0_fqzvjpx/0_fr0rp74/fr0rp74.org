Honestly I'd just chalk it up to their fault from the start, if they have any problem with a pairing simply for not being their favourite. But I get that it's a different when you're the author getting bombarded with arseholes vitriol over something small you can avoid with a small note.

I get that avoiding stories like that will lose me some stories that don't fit the mould. Chances are I might end up reading the decent ones eventually - if I see something coming up frequently, like recommended here with a more detailed overview then I'm more inclined to ignore the pairing part. But for the most part it just makes it easier for me
