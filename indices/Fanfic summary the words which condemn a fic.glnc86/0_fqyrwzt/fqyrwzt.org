"Character bashing" (Weasley or Dumbledore most of the time) is usually enough to not make me click on a fic. Granted I prefer reading it in the summary rather than discover it chapter 3 when Ron first appearance show he has been replaced by an orange piece of shit.

"Manipulative Dumbledore" is also a nice representation of a fic quality.

Basically anything that hints toward "Lord" or "Nobility".
