Snape/anyone. (Except for his canon unrequited fixation on Lily Evans). I don't mind stories about Snape at all, but any Snape pairings just cannot be parsed. I love a good Snape-mentors-Harry fic, but I loathe "Snape is secretly Harry's father" fics.

Fics with self-inserts or canon-modifying OCs. At all. Even if it's well-written and all, I just do not want to read them.

Fics where Hermione becomes an all-knowing powerful badass and Harry is marginalized for her greater glory. "Harry may be destined to defeat Voldemort - but it is Hermione who will lead the wizarding world afterwards!"

Anything with the next generation.
