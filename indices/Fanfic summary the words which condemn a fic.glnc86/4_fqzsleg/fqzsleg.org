'Better than it sounds', 'Not your usual', or anything in a similarly self-aggrandizing tone. Just tell me what it's about, let me judge the quality.

If it has more than one or two characters listed for bashing, I'm likely to not click. Minor bashing I can put up with, but anything beyond that just bothers me. I far prefer complex characterizations, and bashing usually means simplified to an idiotic degree because the author doesn't like them and can't be bothered to even try.
