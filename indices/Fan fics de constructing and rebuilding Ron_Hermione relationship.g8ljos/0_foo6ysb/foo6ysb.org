  I feel like people are ignoring Hermione's violent reactions to Ron and Ron's insecurities.

My recs?

Anything by Pinky Brown. They've written humour, angst, and more, but my favourite is linkffn(Six Foot of Ginger Idiot by Pinky Brown). Best Ron POV I've ever read. Faultlines and Biscuits, A Love Story are also good.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/]]) is another good one. Alternating Ron/Hermione POV.
