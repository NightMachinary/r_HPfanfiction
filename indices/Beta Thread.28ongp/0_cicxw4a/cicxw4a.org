Hello, I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eseigio][Seigio on ff.net]] (please disregard the story I've already posted, it makes me feel physically ill) and I'm looking for a beta.

I'm looking for someone who can help me out with story flow and specific wordings, not so much spelling and grammar, though those would also be appreciated. Punctuation would also be a great help, as I feel that I overuse commas. Don't worry about coming off as too harsh; honestly, the harsher the better.

It would be helpful for a beta reader of mine to be familiar with The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. I'm writing a crossover of the two, though knowledge of The Dresden Files is not required as I will be explaining the terminology and magic system as it goes.

--------------

The genre is *Action/Adventure / Mystery*, and the story is written in the first person. There is no pairing as of yet, but if one comes along later it will probably be with either an *Original Character* or *Luna*.

The Summary:

At the start of his sixth year, Harry Potter put both magic and home behind him to seek his own destiny. His life in New York, while not ideal, is filled with freedoms and few worries. That is, until a Warden of the White Council showed up at his diner. Now Harry's life and freedoms are on the line as he races to find out what's changing everyone around him, what's killing people, and just why the Warden seems so interested in him.

Either reply below or send me a PM if you're interested. I'm also available to beta for any stories, with a focus on spelling, grammar, and plot. Thank you.
