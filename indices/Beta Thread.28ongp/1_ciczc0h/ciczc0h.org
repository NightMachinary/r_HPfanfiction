I don't write, but I can read an obscene amount in a day or two. Grammar isn't my strong suit, but I can spot basic errors, sentences that don't quite gel, and typos. I'd be more than happy to beta any stories you guys want, but if you don't want to upload yet, you'd need to send them to me, I don't have home internet.

I think I'm pretty good at HP trivia and history too, so if you need someone to power through fifty chapters of novel-length, I have all the time in the world.
