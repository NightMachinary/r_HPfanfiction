I'm looking for a beta that will go through the chapters of my story (length roughly at 250k+) and edit the previous chapters for me. I've always been in a dire need of one and currently seek someone who can spot grammar mistakes, awkward verbiage, and general smoothness.

Feel free to PM me or respond if you're interested.
