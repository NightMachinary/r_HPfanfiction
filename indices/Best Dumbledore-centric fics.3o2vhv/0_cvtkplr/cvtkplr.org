Depends on your definition of "Dumbledore-centric". I've written two stories where he is quite important.

In "Uncle Quentin's Spy", he gets to cut loose in combat a couple of times, handles politics and intrigue to keep two factions fighting Voldemort instead of each other, and does his best to keep his students safe from Death Eaters, their spawn, and corrupt evil teachers. linkffn(11102515)

He's a central character in "Patron" too, but focused more on leading there, countering a smarter Volemort's plans. linkffn(11080542)
