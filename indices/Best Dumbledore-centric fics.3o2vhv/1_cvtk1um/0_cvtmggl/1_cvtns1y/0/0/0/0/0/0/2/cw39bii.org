  Ironically, before this conversation it wasn't abandoned. It was simply at the bottom of my list of priorities. But the comments here have persuaded me to abandon it.

...really? I find this incredibly immature/petty/ridiculous. A few random redittors complain your fiction isn't complete (which you even admit) you defend this by saying you're done with the fic (but not listed it as abandoned and/or completed), and then this? I mean...what? Just say you want to abandon it, don't blame comments here, because that's a blatant cop out. Call people out on their rudeness if you want, but you control your writing, not us - don't put your apathy to finish this story on them.
