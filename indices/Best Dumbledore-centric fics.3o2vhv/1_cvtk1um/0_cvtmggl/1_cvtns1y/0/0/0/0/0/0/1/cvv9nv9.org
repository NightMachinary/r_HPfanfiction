You've decided to abandon it after positive comments? Well thanks for letting me know not to read any of your other fics. If you just drop a fic for something as petty as someone saying you don't know where to go with it or that people want you to write more, how can I trust you not to abandon any fic at any point? Why would I let myself get invested in anything you write when you are likely to drop it at the drop of a hat?
