You are doing yourself, and your readers a big disservice by just abandoning this fic. Please reconsider. I know it's rude to push a writer, especially if he feels he doesn't need to carry on, but please at least think about it. You may not feel it needs more, but a lot of people do. Does that not tell you something?
