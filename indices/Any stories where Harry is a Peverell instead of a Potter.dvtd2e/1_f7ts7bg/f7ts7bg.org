Well I Think that /Out of the Night/ by Raining Ink should respond to the criteria : Harry Potter and Hepheastus Peverell are the same person and Harry becomes more Peverell by being a Dark Wizard in the wizard Culture developed by the author. Sadly Discontinued, this fanfiction that was developed on Dark Lord Potter can be found on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] by RemeberFics. linkffn(12723942)
