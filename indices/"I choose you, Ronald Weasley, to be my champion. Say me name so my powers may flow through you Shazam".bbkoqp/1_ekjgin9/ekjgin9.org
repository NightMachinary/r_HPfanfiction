You know I have been thinking the same thing, but with Neville. You know mystery element on what happened to his parents and he would move into the Weasley household and befriend Ron who loves the story if the BWL.

It is interesting at the possibility of it. Snape could be Sivana when you think about it, butter young boy rejected by society and eventually his only friend. Voldemort as Black Adam eventually. Dumbledore as the wizard Shazam.

Harry would obviously be the Superman type, like if you have seen the movie. As for Hermione I have no clue. Wonder Women? Supergirl? Batgirl? Any of the Lanterns?

Draco is an obvious fit for Booster Gold if you know him or Reverse Flash.

Again if someone wrote this I would willingly pay money because the possibilities are endless.
