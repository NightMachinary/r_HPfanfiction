Honestly, I wouldn't tell anyone anything for fear of making things worse. Instead I'd just try and stealth my way through until after the triwizard tournament then reveal myself to dumbledore as having "visions of the past and future" that I'd done my utmost to prevent. Step one would be murdering Pettigrew in his sleep during first year (Ron would be upset, but I could live with that), step two would be to get a rooster and go kill the Basilisk as early as possible, step three would be to find the diadem in the RoR and use the dead Basilisk as a source of fangs to kill it with, step five would be to destroy the vanishing cabinet in the RoR. Step six would be to spend as much time as possible politely and quietly inquiring into friends of Harry's parents to "find out" about sirius. Step seven would be to try and arrange a visit to Sirius in Azkaban (this will take a long time to accomplish) and after being "surprised" by the way he acts in prison to see about getting an investigation opened into him to try and get him freed. All the while I would be spending as much time as I could trying to learn curse breaking so I could hunt down and eliminate the various horcruxes without anyone knowing. Eventually I hope to find some sort of exorcism ritual to remove the scar in Harry's forehead, thereby completely eliminating Voldemorts anchors without him ever coming back.

But you say, "that sounds like a good thing, aren't you supposed to mess stuff up as much as possible as per the prompt?". "yes", I answer, "and that is exactly what I am doing". The thing is, one evil man does not an evil society make. Even Hitler needed an entire political party backing him to be able to do the things he did. And although the Nazi party was no more than five guys in pub backroom when Hitler joined them, all the people that he would go on to recruit were still out and about in society.

On a net historical scale, Voldemort was probably a good thing. The reason being that he was able to gather together nearly the entirety of Magical Britain's bigots, sadists, racists, murderers, monsters, and amoral mercenaries under a single banner. Which conviently put them all in roughly the same place at the same time which allowed them to utterly decimated by the end the second blood war, which paved the way for sweeping reforms and an overall restructuring of magical british society.

Magical Britain was already deeply sick, cancerous even, voldemort was simply most dramatic symptom. The second blood war was the purging fever that got rid of the illness. By eliminating Voldemort before he has a chance to gather together his followers you allow those same bigots, sadists, racists, murderers, monsters, and amoral mercenaries to go on slowly poisoning Magical British society unchecked, and most importantly, /undiscovered/. A whole society of cancer patients, none of which even know that they have tumors. Yes, I'd say I ruined Magical Britain quite nicely. And the cherry on top? I did it by doing something that is indisputably morally good. I doomed magical Britain by killing its worst monster.
