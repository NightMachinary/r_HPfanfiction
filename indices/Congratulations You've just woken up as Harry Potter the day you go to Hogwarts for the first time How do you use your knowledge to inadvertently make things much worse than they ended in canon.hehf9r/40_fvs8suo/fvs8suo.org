(Wait I'm Harry potter or I'm like a background character?) Ima be honest I've always wanted to punch Quirrell in the face when we first meet him in the leaky cauldron. He just looks punchable. But besides that, I'd threaten the sorting hat to put me in Hufflepuff and I'd just fuck up everything. I'd pet McGonagall when we first see her in transfiguration class. I'd prolly pick up and hug Flitwick, and last but not least Snape. I'd prolly tell him that I remember him that night and just mess with him for my 7 years at Hogwarts.

But if I was a side character I'd thwart Harry's move that progresses the everything. I'd put the answers to the questions Snape asked on parchment and slip it in his pocket. Harry's about to find the mirror of Erised nope he sees nothing. Ima throw the mirror out of a window. I'd take Norbert and put her in the room under fluffy as protection. Harry has flying lessons for the first time, nope, ima break his leg before he goes so he can't join the quidditch. Harry and Ron are about to go save Hermione, nope, they'll see her mangled body and will have to live with the fact the it's Ronalds fault that she's dead.

And this is jus the first year
