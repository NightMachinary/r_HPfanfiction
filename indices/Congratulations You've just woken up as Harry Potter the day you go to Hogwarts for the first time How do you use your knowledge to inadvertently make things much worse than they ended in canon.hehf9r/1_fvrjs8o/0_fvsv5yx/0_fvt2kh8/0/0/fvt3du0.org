He could only get the stone if he wanted it for a pure reason, it was a trap that was impossible for him. He couldnt take it if he wanted to use it. Quirreldemort would have been found out after tripping through every trial. He doesn't really have to get chased down by a few 11 year olds this time to get found out. Honestly expecting the most troubles year 1 to come from trying to get into Quidditch with my dexterity and keeping Hagrid from committing suicide by baby dragon.
