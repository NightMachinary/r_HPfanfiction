Solid point, the lurking threats would really just be Voldies horcruxes. The diary wreaked a good bit of havoc early on, just nab that somewhere around the beginning of year 2 to keep things safer. Probably should just let year 3 play out but maybe keep a closer eye on Pettigrew so that he might not escape this time. That should keep the worst aspects of year 4 from coming to pass at all. Keep an eye on Moody just in case. Shouldn't have PTSD in 5, might make it easier to protest against my abusive DADA teacher, seeing as everybody wont be labeling me a nutter. Maybe I can get Dumbledore to figure out the horcruxes connection earlier in year 6. We shouldn't have to deal with any dark lord plots so it should be mostly reasonable to find them, especially with my basically seer knowledge of where they all are, how to obtain them, and how to destroy them (and what curses may be released as I do) Itll be nice actually getting to study through year 7 and be properly entered into the world. May have to deal with Voldie at some point. Magic KKK still might feel like bringing him back somehow and potentially find a way but he wont have his horcruxes at least so maybe I'll just carry around a pistol. That would definitely piss him off if I killed him with it.
