I do literally anything and canon falls like the card house it is. For real, though, I think preventing some catalyst situation from occurring would do the most damage.

For example, before the first flying lesson, I would shuffle the brooms. As a result, Neville doesn't fly off and doesn't drop his ball. Draco doesn't throw it, and I don't catch it. I don't become seeker, don't get a broom, and canon is destroyed.
