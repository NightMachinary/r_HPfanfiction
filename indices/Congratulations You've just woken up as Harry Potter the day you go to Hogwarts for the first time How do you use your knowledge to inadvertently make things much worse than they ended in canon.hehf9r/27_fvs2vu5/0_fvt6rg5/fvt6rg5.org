Safest bet, though you probably should not make assumptions of character. I would play the field and see how dumbledore or important people on the chess board respond and adjust accordingly. If dumbledore is dumbledork the evil get the fuck outta their I know when I'm out matched and there's no way anyone will get the jump on dumbledore even with fore knowledge. If dumbledore is a good person as he is portrayed to be then i would probably do what you did.
