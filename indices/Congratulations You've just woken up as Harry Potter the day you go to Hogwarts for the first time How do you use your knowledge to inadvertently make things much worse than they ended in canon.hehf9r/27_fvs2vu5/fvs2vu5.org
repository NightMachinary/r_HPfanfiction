I've read a lot of answers, and I have to wonder if I'm just in the minority with: Confirm that I'm in canon, meet Dumbledore as quickly as possible and spill all of my knowledge from the books.

We'd see if he couldn't track down and eliminate all the horcruxes, gather the +dragonballs+ hallows, and kill Voldemort (sorry Quirrel) during a staff meeting or something.

Then I'd spend the next 7 years (really?) learning magic and getting addicted to aging potions, since there's no way I could stand being in a child's body all the time, hanging around children.

I'd probably send some amount of my fortune to a little family of No Maj's in America, but I wouldn't want to throw off that kid's life too much.
