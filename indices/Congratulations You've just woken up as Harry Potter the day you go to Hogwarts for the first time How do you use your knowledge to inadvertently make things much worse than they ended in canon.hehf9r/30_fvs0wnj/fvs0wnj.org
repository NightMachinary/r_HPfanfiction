You mean I'd want to make thing better, because my knowledge of canon, but it actually makes everything worse?

Pettigrow is a big one, of course. But I think I would try to go directly to Dumbledore to explain about the Horcruxes, and where they are, and how to destroy them. Which he destroys.

However, it makes things worse because Voldemort is not back yet, and he can't kill Harry. So, I'm still an horcruxe, and would be for life. (If anyone else than Voldmort could kill Harry, then the horcruxe would have been destroy in year Two when Harry was bitten by the Basilic).

So Harry spend his life as an Horcruxe, which doesn't seem fun at all, and Voldemort is still looming over there. Unable to return. And the wizarding world spend decades in fear of Voldemort's return, never at easy.

Especially since Voldemort would still make many attempts and I would have to live in fear and parano√Øa all my life. Or in Hiding.

Also Death Eaters such as Malfoy would be pretty active for a long long time, if more discreet and less murderous, but enough to shift the political balance at some point. Especially with how Fudge was corrupt.
