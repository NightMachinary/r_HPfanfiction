I've just woken up in HP's body! Yay! As one can only assume that the soul of a wizard is where their magic is (hence why Harry can do some of the magic that Voldemort can) and their personality/identity is (removing the soul leaves just the husk of a body behind) then I've just made Harry Potter a Squib.

He's sent home from Hogwarts in shame, becomes depressed, turns to drugs to cope, and spends his teenage years high until one day a Death Easter looking to have some fun with Muggle scum tortures and kills him.
