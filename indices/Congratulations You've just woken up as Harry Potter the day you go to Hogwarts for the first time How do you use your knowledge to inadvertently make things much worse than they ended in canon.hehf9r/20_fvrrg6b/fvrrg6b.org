R I G H T!

I'm stealing the Philosophers Stone and (at some point) the contents of the Restricted Section (I'll let Quirrell take the blame, he'll be dead who's going to check). I'm selling anything of value from the Room and unleashing a flock of roosters in the Chamber of Secrets.

I'm staking out the Chamber of Secrets and mugging possessed Ginny for the Diary (store all the Horcruxes and books in my vault) and I'm stealing some dickheads wand as well (perhaps several wands).

I'm then, either at Christmas or Summertime, sneaking away to Little Hangleton and (using that stolen wand) using the Imperius on any Muggles I need to in order to get the ring. To throw off the Trace, I'll take a trip to Diagon, Knockturn or Hogsmeade for an adult to be my "fall guy".

If I need a wizard, I'm hunting down Mudungus Fletcher or using my spare wizard/witch or waiting to see if I can get Dobby or (later) Kreacher to do it for me.

Assuming the Muggle world is the same as ours, I'm converting some of my Galleons to invest in Muggle businesses whenever/however I can get away with it.

I'll probably Imperio Malfoy so he doesn't take Care of Magical Creatures in the first place (that will hopefully save Buckbeak) and I'll cage up Pettigrew at some point in third year and make it look like Crookshanks killed him. Whilst I'm here in third year, I'm not taking Divination.

Now. I'm going to use the Imperius (and if I can steal it, Hermione's Time Turner) to let Dumbledore and Fudge etc. see Pettigrew but still allow him to escape and join up with Voldemort. Fingers crossed, that allows the events of Goblet of Fire to continue as they should. This should exonerate Sirius whilst still keeping things predictable.

I'll let Crouch put my name in the Goblet of Fire and allow events to continue as normal, the only thing I'll change is going to the graveyard alone. I'm going in guns blazing, AK's all the way. The plan being to kill Pettigrew AND Nagini whilst still keeping Voldemort alive. As insurance, at some point I'll fleece either a Basilisk fang or Godrics Sword (whichever is easier to obtain) and sneak it into the final task as an alternative.

Then, I'll keep Baby Tom in a box until I've tracked down and dealt with the other Horcruxes. And when I've done with them all... mwahahaha!

I'LL SMASH IT WITH A HAMMER!

It's brilliant, Brilliant, BRILLIANT!!!

Then, probably retire somewhere with my riches, the world entirely unaware that it had been in danger in the first place.
