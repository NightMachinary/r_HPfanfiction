Basically warn Voldemort first year that I'm (Harry) is a Horcroux. He leaves me alone he's safe. I'd then mention how come Dumbledore protected Snape unless he gave something up. I'd mention it's weird my parents and the Longbottom family went into hiding. Basically try to get Snape killed year 1. I would uncover Pettigrew and when question ask if there's a spell to check if a animal is real and why all pets aren't registered by the ministry and through Hogwarts for children.

Year 2 after the Pettigrew incident I would have no reason to save Ginny. If the Weasley family hates me after year 1 the save Ginny and make it public who opened the chamber. If Pettigrew is killed year 3 wouldn't happen regardless if Sirius is free or not. Year 4 hopefully convince Crouch Jr that Voldemort is no enemy of mine but Neville doesn't like him. (In the case Voldemort still needs convincing or Crouch wouldn't go rogue) Really any of the champions could be the sacrifice. Year 5 is simply siding with the ministry. Year 6 and 7 are up in the air if Dumbledore knows about the Horcrouxs or not. Dumbledore wouldn't be killed as there is no reason to punish Draco after the ministry fiasco. I'm curious on what Dumbledore would do if he believes that Voldemort would go after me. After year 7 I would simply move to America and transfer any and all money to the American wizarding bank. What's the requirements to get citizenship in wizarding America. I'd do what I can to not be forced into returning to England.
