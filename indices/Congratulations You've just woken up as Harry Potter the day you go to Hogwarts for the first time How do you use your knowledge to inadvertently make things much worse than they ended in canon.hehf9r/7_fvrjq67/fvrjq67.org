On the train ride I'd befriend Draco Malfoy and make sure I get into his good books. At the start of the year, I fish out the Philosopher's Stone by teaming up with Quirrell, and make sure that Voldemort is back a few months into the first year. Second year, when I'm invited to Malfoy Manor for the summer, I'll nick Riddle's diary, and give it to Luna Lovegood, just because it's the most evil thing I can think of. Let it loose and make sure the Riddle in the diary materialises. Dumbledore is sacked by Fudge for incompetence, and young Riddle becomes senior undersecretary to the minister, because I have killed Umbridge, and I am now on the run but I join Lupin and Sirius and we travel to the Seychelles and have fun after killing Wormtail. There are now two Voldemorts, one with political power and the other very pissed off with the unexpected Riddle, so a war with the Ministry and the Death Eaters begins. Is that horrible enough?
