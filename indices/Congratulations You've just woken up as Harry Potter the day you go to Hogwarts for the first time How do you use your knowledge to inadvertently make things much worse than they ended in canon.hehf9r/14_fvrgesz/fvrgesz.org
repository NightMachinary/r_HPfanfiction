Knowing that magic runs in families and that all muggle borns are actually just pure blood descendants from a long time ago I join up with Voldemort arguing that Grinderwalds Magic is Might/right and Wizard Superiority being what he should advocate with Castse for Humans with Magic Potential ie Muggles on the bottem above them you have Squibs and/or Non Humans and at the top Magicals. I assume he agrees and I join up which means that Eventually All the governments get toppled and we have Magic Hitler Fascist Dystopia or Nuclear Armegedon, If the former happens I expect a creation of Aparation Free Countries/Island to exile me to and give Voldemort peace of mind. In the latter case, eh
