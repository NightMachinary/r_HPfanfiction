- Ignore the plot hooks from the books and just be an average wizard.
- Use knowledge of the series and living in 2020 to have the Goblins invest in successful companies.
- Ruin Britain because I flooded the economy with gold.
- Voldemorte returns, offer a peace treaty to leave friends and family alone until I can move everything to another country
- Wizards exposed because Voldemorte is an idiot.
- Laugh as the Statue fails while I retire to a lovely penthouse by the beach while my investments make me billions.
