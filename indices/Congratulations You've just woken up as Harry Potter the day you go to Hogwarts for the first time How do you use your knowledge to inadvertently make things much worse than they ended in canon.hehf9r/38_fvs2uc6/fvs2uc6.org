Hate and love my new body. Harry is a scrawny nearsighted underfed orphan. I have good eyesight, a broad build and am far from underfed. There's some wacky nonserious stuff wrong with me physically (legs that function, barely, but there is all kinds of weird hijinks.), but those are things I will miss. Harry does get ''tall'' eventually but getting used to glasses or contacts is just :////

Tall has a different perception across the globe. I don't view slightly under six feet as tall. Harry will barely reach that.

How about no.

Miss my family, which while self-admittedly messy, is loving. Probably clash immensely with the Dursleys as a younger, different body would mean my temper flares up again. Nasty accidental magic, here we come.

Probably get sorted into Slytherin and get really good at potion making, as that is just my kind of thing.
