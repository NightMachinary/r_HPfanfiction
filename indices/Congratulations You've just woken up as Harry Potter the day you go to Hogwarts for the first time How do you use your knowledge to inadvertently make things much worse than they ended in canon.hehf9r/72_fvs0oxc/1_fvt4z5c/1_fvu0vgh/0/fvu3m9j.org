At least you can agree that yo were being very unfair to Ron. I will ask though, why haven't you said anything about my stance on Molly, or the key. I still doubt Luna would listen to you, she is a little mad, but who knows with her.

I highly doubt you can trick the mirror to get the stone. It's magic that was cast by Dumbledore, and was giving Voldemort himself trouble. Voldemort didn't want to use it at that time, and he couldn't get it, so I doubt someone with very little magical education such as yourself can.

I think fanon has twisted your perceptions on how easy it is to escape the Dursleys, and how much your underestimating Dumbledore, or overestimating yourself.
