No. It doesn't, but it does make it pretty damn close. Also I think it was confirmed somewhere that Dumbledore purposely made it easy until the mirror to either test Harry, or give false hope to Voldemort. That way when Dumbledore goes down there, they're far away from children. I could be wrong though. Also, you still couldn't the stone, since you still want to use it. Sure, later, but you still want to use it.

Yes, it is unlikely she'd forget, but as i've explained already. It's something parents do to help encourage kids to remember. Also, who's saying she's breaking the statue. How do you know there isn't a charm around the barrier making people not notice(which there has to be. How else do you explain no-one ever noticing people disappearing through walls). How can you prove to me that Molly was after Harry in the first place?
