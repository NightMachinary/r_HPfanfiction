I will address every point you have made.

Ron spends half the time slacking off or playing chess. If I am to fight in a war and defeat the dark lord then I need reliable soldiers and true friends. Ron is great I suppose but his jealousy is not something I want to deal with. I would rather have Neville who arguably just needed a better support system to be arguably one of the best in his year. Ron would still be a friend but he would certainly not be one of my best friends.

As to my finances, I am (as far as I know) the last of the potters. I wont have my fortune able to be accessible to a old dude who I dont know.

Freeing Sirius is as simple as researching the spell that reverses the animagus transformation and using it on "scabbers" in the great hall in the presence of albus Dumbledore. Hell I'd go as far as asking Ron to see scabbers for a moment. Ron would probably ask why but not put up much of a fight. Then walking up the the headmaster and using the spell. Boom Peter revealed.

Luna as a first year will probably go along with it if I simply tell her the nargles told me to tell you that you should insist on GRYFFINDOR.

As to the Honeys. A magical castle filled with hormonal teenagers and empty classrooms. You do the math.

The conditions set for the stone to appear are as long as you want to save it but not use it then you can get it. Well all I have to do is want to save it from Voldermorts clutches and not use it at the time then it should appear.

Leaving the Dursleys is simple, hold my wand up and boom knight bus. I have a invisibility cloak that was once possibly used to hide from death itself, and I seem to recall that the protection around the Dursleys states that as long as harry considers it a home than the blood wards would function. But harry arguably considered Hogwarts more of a home so were the protections even active? Also a family as rich as the potters would probably have a few properties right? Grimmuld place is also a option. As I know its location so technically I should be able to get in.
