Well you certaintly have a fanon skewed view of Harry Potter don't ya. I also feel you're only a movie watcher, since the books actually have half the shit Hermione did in the movies be from Ron. Also what Molly did asking about the platform number, it's actually something a lot of mothers do to help their kids remember stuff.

I agree about the key thing. In this situation, you are, mature enough to handle your finances(i'm assuming you're an adult here, not some kid). In the book though, it was smart for Dumbledore to hold onto it. Harry just went from 11 year old kid with "dark, and horrible/lonely years(or however that quote goes)." to having enough money that he could live quite comfortably off of it, if he was mature. Which knowing the Psychology of someone like that(which I can actually do with my minors in Psych), he would either be very, very frugal(which can be dangerous), or he'd blow it all since he's a child who doesn't understand how expensive shit like houses, cars, living, etc... is.

Checking for love potions is actually a solid thing you should do. You're the most famous wizard alive, I'm surprised it didn't happen more in the books.

No, Hermione, and Ron are both Harry's truest friends. There were problems(Hermione not telling Harry about going to Mcgonnagal, betraying him. Ron neing stubborn in fourth year about the goblet), but they're children growing up, I guarantee that most kids have had these problems, if less magical.

Freeing Sirius earlier will be difficult, but doable.

Good frigging luck convincing Luna to argue to the sorting hat about her house when she knows jack, and shit about you. Not to mention her unstable mind(which it is, no matter how much fanon like to play fast, and loose with it).

Smashing all the "honeys" is impossoble, but by all means, use your fame to grab all the hot chicks you can. Just don't be surprised if it bites you in the ass.

Asking Hermione, or Luna to the dance is possible now, as long as you've actually cultivated their friendship.

Keeping the Philosophers stone is something that is nigh-impossible to do as an 11 year old Harry. How the hell are you gonna hide it from Dumbledore, and do you even know how it works?

Again, how are you gonna leave the Dursleys when you have Dumbledore "insisting" on it, and are the most famous Wizard since Merlin.
