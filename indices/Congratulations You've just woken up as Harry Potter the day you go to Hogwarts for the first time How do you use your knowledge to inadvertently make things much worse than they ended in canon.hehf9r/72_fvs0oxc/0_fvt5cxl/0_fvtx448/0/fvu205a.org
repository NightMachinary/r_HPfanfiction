Are you basing Ron off fan fiction or canon because while Ron was envious of Harry in some ways, he never spent half the time resenting Harry. If he did Harry and Ron's relationship wouldn't work, I don't believe he could resent Harry to that point and then still be friends. A portion of the fourth book yes and the 7th book, 4th year is just friends feuding which happens to all friends during school, it's natural, 7th book is quite obviously the horcrux corrupting Ron. Does Neville not have any friends? Like none in 7 years? His self esteem issues stemmed from his grand mother not because he didn't have friends. He saw himself as a failure and unworthy. He's not socially inept, I know because I suffered from social issues when I was a kid, so no while good friends could help him, it's very much up to him to help himself. Just telling him he's not a failure doesn't help him, it really doesn't.
