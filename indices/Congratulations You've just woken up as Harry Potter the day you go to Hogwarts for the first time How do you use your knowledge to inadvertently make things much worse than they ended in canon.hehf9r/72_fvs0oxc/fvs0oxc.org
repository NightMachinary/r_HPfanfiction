If I wake up as 11 year old harry on the day hagrid arrives I do the following 10 things. 1. Ask Hagrid for my key to Gringotts as Dumbledore having my key means he has access to my money. 2. Avoid molly weasley as that entire interaction feels planned in hindsite. How did a women who went to Hogwarts for 7 years and has multiple kids attending suddenly forget the platform number in front of Harry Freaking Potter. 3. Constantly check for love potions. 4. Hermione is arguably Harry's truest friend so I avoid Ron and focus on Hermione. If a golden Trio must exist then Neville is more deserving. 5.Free Sirius Immediately as I know who peter is. 6. Seek Luna out and get her to ask the hat for Gryffindor or Hufflepuff . 7. Smash all the Honeys lmao 8. Ask Hermione and/or Luna to the dance as there is no limit to the amount of partners you can take. 9.Keep the Sorcerers/Philosophers stone. 10. leave the Dursleys and Live Elsewhere
