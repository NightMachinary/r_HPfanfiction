Some people are doing "cool" things like a responsible adult would do in that situation.

Me?

Well there is no criminal empire in cannon, so welcome to the Potter Family Mafia.

Twins are the negotiators, Hermione will make you pay your debt with your life, Ron building connections and taking care of problems, Ginny a spy and me the head.

I'd out bribe Lucius so if Voldemort comes back Lucius and his friends wint have financial backing, and by then my corruption would have Mad Eye as Auror trainer.

Then I'd play some chess with Dumbledore.

Or more accurately I'd try to get a harem in my second life.

Isekais are the perfect breeding ground for harms tbf.
