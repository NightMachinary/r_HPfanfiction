If I was Harry not much would change but I'd be even more careful and paranoid.

But yeah, I feel like Dumbledore is better equipped to deal with Voldemort than 11 year old me.

Things that could go wrong: Dumbledore for some reason doesn't listen about the ring and get cursed. By second year Dumbledore is dead

Or: Fudge doesn't like the scandal about Sirius, has both him and Pettigrew kissed before the news can find out

Etc.
