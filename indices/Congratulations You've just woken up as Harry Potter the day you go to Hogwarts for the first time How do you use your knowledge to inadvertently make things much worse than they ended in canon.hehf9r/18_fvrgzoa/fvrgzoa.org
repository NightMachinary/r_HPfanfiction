Edit: misread the post

kill Pettigrew quickly so Sirius won't get his proof of innocence

send a letter to Quirrel warning him about the prophecy and that Dumbledore knows about his Horcrux (a lie to make him move everything or create new ones)

Trick Dumbledore into finding the Horcrux ring early and having his death be several years early

Original comment:

I've talked about this before but basically wait until I arrive at Hogwarts, avoid Snape and Quirrel's gaze and try to get a meeting with Dumbledore as quickly as possible.

Convince him I'm telling the truth and tell him about: Quirrel, Pettigrew, Couch, the Horcruxes, etc

Warn Dumbledore about the ring

Canon Dumbledore is powerful and careful enough to deal with everything

I'm doing this because even if Harry won, Voldemort was still in power for a year and I don't want to have to deal with being under that regime. Also my knowledge could avoid the death of many

Finally, Harry won through a bit of luck, and I wouldn't be surprised if my presence was enough of a butterfly to change things badly

Afterwards I would just enjoy learning about magic and live in the library forever
