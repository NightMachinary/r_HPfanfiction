  I'm doing this because even if Harry won, Voldemort was still in power for a year and I don't want to have to deal with being under that regime

Well, you also have too look at it the other way around. Voldemort gaining so much power and influence was what lead to the swingback after his fall. All the pro-house elf legislation and abolishing Azkaban and stuff wouldn't happen if the status quo wasn't violently disrupted. Instead you'd be stuck with Umbridge's werewolf genocide and Malfoy's slow crawl into power.

The way it went in the books might be the best case in the long run..
