The internet is almost definitely still magical. You just have a callous view of the world, and your universalism isn't at all accurate.

No joke, I had someone try to tell me that apparating is the same as driving a car the last time we had this discussion on the subreddit. It just isn't. Magic could never get boring, just like how Minecraft or Skyrim or Garry's Mod never get boring.
