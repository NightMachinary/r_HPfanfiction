Honestly, I could see myself practicing magic, or thinking about magic, or challenging myself with magical work near constantly, even as I was having a walk around the castle, having a meal or simply having time to kill. Of course there will always be some occasions when I can't, such as socializing and others, but it doesn't matter.\\
The simple reason being I would want to get good at magic. I'd be willing to work harder than anyone else to achieve this.\\
I'd probably learn by solving problems or making stuff as much as possible, and I would practice my spells until I reach an insane level of mastery, even if I had to pull thousands of hours to do so.
