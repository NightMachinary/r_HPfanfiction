The Internet is magic whenever you stop to think about it even for a second.

Having said that, I don't think learning to code is a good comparison for learning about magic. The study of magic (at least at Hogwarts as we see it) is about what you can /do/ with it.

A better comparison between the Internet and magic would be to say it's like using the Internet to end up down a Wikipedia rabbit hole at 3am, trying to find out exactly who first thought of chewing on some gillyweed, or pulling hairs out of a unicorn's tail.
