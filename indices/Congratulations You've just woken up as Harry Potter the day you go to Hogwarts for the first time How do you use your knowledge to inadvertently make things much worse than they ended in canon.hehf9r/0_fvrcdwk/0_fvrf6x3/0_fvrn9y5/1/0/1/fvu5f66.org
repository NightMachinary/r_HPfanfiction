The internet is still magical to me, but after basic HTML script you could actually write in a .txt file wasn't the online standard anymore I stopped learning the more complicated forms. That said, as a nineties child I know my way around the DOS command file. I have been raised with the values of creativity and cradle to cradle.

If I suddenly found out I woke up in the Harry Potter world as a magical kid (and finally managed to stop grieving never seeing my loved ones ever again) I would probably start working my ass off, in the hopes of becoming a magical handyman that can run their own magical croft farm and never having to rely on anyone ever again.

I'd probably try to learn to enchant objects for a hobby (magic mirrors, pensieves etc)
