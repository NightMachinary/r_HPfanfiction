There are people who can spend hours a day studying chess for most of their lives, I don't see why we couldn't do the same with magic.\\
Not everybody is lazy.

Most likely he would have fun learning the lumos in first year, then he would have fun learning the patronus charm or any other difficult piece of magic later in life, then he would have fun breaking curses or mastering difficult transfiguration or devising spells nobody came up with before.\\
Honestly, Magic seems broad enough one could study it for several lifetimes and never get bored.
