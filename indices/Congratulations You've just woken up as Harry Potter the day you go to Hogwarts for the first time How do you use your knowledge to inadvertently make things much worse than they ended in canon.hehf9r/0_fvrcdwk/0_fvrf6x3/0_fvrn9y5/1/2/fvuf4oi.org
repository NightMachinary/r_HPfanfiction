It would be just like spending a lot of time on the internet, only without the convenience of it.

Sure, i might not be learning how to do every single little spell and such, but the amount of knowledge, trivia and entertainment contained within the library of Hogwarts would definitely make enough of interesting material to read on and sometimes practice.

I mean, if i can spend day after day reading and watching stuff on the internet (and occasionally regular books, or playing some games and whatnot) i could definitely pull the same reading books about magic, magical fiction, some other books, watching Quidditch, playing chess, socialising and trying to do magic. There is just a slight change in the convenience of the medium that i'd use.

It's not like i'm going 'OMG this internet stuff is so amazing' and sit starry-eyed looking at the google starting page, i find something on one page or another and spend my time on it if it's interesting enough. It would most likely be the same being let loose in hogwart's.
