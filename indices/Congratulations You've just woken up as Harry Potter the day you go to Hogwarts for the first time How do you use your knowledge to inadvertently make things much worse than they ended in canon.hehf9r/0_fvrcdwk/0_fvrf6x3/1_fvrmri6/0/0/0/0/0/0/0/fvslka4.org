So, I partly agree and partly don't. I agree that by the time you've completed a higher degree, you've learned how best to learn. However, your brain also most definitely slows down and you learn less quickly (albeit more efficiently), and your knowledge base specialises and loses a lot of the breadth.

I'm in the latter part of my PhD and have two masters degrees on top of my bachelors, but the idea of going back to the range of broad subject examinations we had in 4th, 5th and 6th year of secondary school back in Scotland, particularly if it were new subjects I hadn't chosen to study at the time (so not a recap), is something I'd find quite daunting.

On top of that, magic has a level of practical skill beyond just understanding of theory, and learning a new practical skill (or multiple of them) is a completely different thing to an academic education. Charms even gets compared to an art, which implies more than just something you eventually gain muscle memory in. I personally think this would make it just as tricky to be an educated adult brain in an 11 year old body starting Hogwarts as an actual 11 year old, if not harder, because you might also be driven slowly and surrounded by actual 11 year olds...
