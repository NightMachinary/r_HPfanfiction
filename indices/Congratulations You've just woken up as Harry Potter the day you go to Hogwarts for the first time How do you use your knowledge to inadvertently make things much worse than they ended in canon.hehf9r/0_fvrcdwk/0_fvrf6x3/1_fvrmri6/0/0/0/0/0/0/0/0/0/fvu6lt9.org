But wandwork would be very different to martial arts. I'm a martial artist, and fairly physically fit, but there's no way that would translate into say learning to paint, which is probably closer to wandwork.

And it's fair to say that you are now 11 and brain aging isn't an issue - but you can't have the best of both worlds, you surely either have the brain plasticity of an 11 year old /or/ the learning and education of someone much older with advanced degrees, not both.
