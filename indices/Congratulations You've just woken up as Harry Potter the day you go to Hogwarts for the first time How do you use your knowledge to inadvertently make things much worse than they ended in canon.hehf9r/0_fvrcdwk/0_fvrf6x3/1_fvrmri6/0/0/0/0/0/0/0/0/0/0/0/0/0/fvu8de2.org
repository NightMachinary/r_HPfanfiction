I might know how to deal with the opposite sex, but I can't deal with kids. Even the new undergrads I teach sometimes baffle me. So that's a clear disadvantage.

And whilst I know what to expect with puberty, the big issues are the hormone fluctuations and the way it affects your emotions. Not convinced it's possible to â€˜think' your way past that - particularly when the experience of transitioning friends has been that the second puberty was just as bad as the first.

Not convinced it would be straightforward at all.
