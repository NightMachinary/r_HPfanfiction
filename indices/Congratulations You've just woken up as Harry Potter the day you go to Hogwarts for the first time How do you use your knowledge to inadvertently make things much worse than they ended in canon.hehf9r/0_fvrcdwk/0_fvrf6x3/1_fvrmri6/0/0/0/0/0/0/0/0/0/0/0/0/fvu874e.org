I've already been thtough puberty. I think I'd manage it far better if I had to go through it again.

It's something every child goes through, anyway, but you already have to deal with it, years of adult experiance to put things in perspective, and a far better knowledge of yourself to help you deal with your emotions. It looks like an insane advantage. You also wouldn't have to go through the process of learning how to deal with the other sex since you already did, you social skills have already been honed...

I probably wouldn't be pleasant, but it wouldn't be as bad as you think.
