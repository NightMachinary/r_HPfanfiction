I open my eyes and instantly, I know I'm in the wrong place.

And my eyesight's gone to shit.

I find a pair of glasses, and something about the way they're held together wit htape, rings a mental bell faintly.

Within a minute, I've worked out I'm a small boy in a scruffy bedroom.

“Boy, get up and get ready!” yells somebody male, english and angry.

I works out where the bathroom is and wash my face. Oh... I'm Harry Potter.

“Get moving we have to get to london to drop you off” yells the man

“Yes Uncle Vernon” I say as politely as I can.

My uncle Vernon really is very fat and definitely hates me.

My trunk is pulled out from the cupboard under the stairs; I get a quick look inside... I see some childish drawings on the walls. Aunt Petunia is... glad to see the back of me.

I cook them breakfast; I might not be Harry Potter but I can fry rubbish.

Uncle Vernon takes me to London by car; I have no idea about the UK and I'm instantly totally lost.

He turfs me out at Kings Cross station and I put the trunk and Hedgwig on a trolley; It's a bit wonkey but I get to the main platform concourse and take off to platform nine.

I quickly poke my arm through the bricks in a likely looking place and sure enough, there's a magical doorway. I get into platform 9and three quarters and I've got half an hour.

Harry/ I am really weak and I struggle to get the trunk onto the train. I take Hedgwig in her cage to the first empty compartment; and they mostly are this early. There's crowd forming but Harry's on the train and in a compartment, there's no way I'm getting the trunk on the overhead rack.

I open it up and get my wand; up my sleeve and gosh it feels like ... magic holding it.

My arm is warm and I feel like I'm more comfortable than I've ever been.

The standard book of spells comes out, and I close the trunk. After stroking Hedgwig for a bit; she seems to appreciate it. I start trying to learn magic.

The writing's designed for children; so that's easy, but I don't understand any of the concepts and it takes me ages to read the first chapter.

Someone opens the compartment door, I look up

“Hello” I say to some red haired boy who's dragging a trunk. “I'm Harry,”

The boy asks “Can I come in?”
