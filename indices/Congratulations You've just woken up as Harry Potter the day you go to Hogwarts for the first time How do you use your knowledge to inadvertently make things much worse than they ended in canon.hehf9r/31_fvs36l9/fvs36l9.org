Just let things play out, avoid the plot and immerse myself in as much magic as possible and try to figure out how to get the horcrux out without dying. the ROR should come in handy for this

Maybe kill snape at some point depending on how true canon portrays him and how much is Harry's perception of him

If Sirius still manages to escape see if he cares more about Harry than revenge. If he cares more about revenge leave him to his own devices otherwise help him get his freedom and leave Britain as fast as possible

If Harry still ends up in the tournament try to be disqualified and if not possible then win, being ready for the trap at the end either to escape or fight Again leave England after tournament and continue to explore magic and laugh as Britain burns from its own stupidity If Tom ever does try to expand to continental Europe then fight him otherwise he has his territory and I have mine
