Assuming I have good Occlumency and that Veritaserum can be beaten via Obliviation, here's the plan:

First night at Hogwarts, when everyone's asleep, stun Scabbers and force him back into human form. Then, obliviate him - same memories until the train, at which point Pettigrew will remember seeing Harry and deciding to kill him that night, before trying to strangle Harry in his bed and being stopped by accidental magic.

Then, stun him again, make a big noise and when the teachers come, plead ignorance - "I woke up and this man was hurting me and I didn't know what to do then there was a bang and he was unconscious please Professor Dumbledore who was that man and why did he try to hurt me?"

When questioned, Pettigrew will explain the truth of his backstory, along with the extra bits I've added. This guarantees he's punished not only for the Sirius thing but also for attempted murder of Harry Potter. He's also revealed directly to Dumbledore, so good odds he actually gets questioned properly.

Second night, while everyone sleeps, grab a rooster from outside and take it to the Chamber to kill the Basilisk. Now I have anti-Horcrux weapons. Go to the RoR and get the diadem, but don't destroy it. Instead, take it to Dumbledore and spin a yarn - "I couldn't sleep because of what happened last night so I was wandering around and then a teacher came so I found a place to hide, it was filled with weird stuff but I felt a strong pull in one direction, and it was coming from this thing. I thought I'd bring it to you to see why I feel so connected to it."

Dumbledore now has proof of Horcruxes, the DADA curse is neutralised and he also has hints of the connection between Harry's scar and the horcruxes.

When Sirius gets free, you can go to Grimmauld for a visit and "find" the locket via the same method. This gives Dumbles sufficient info to begin looking for the cup as well. If Lucius still gives the Diary to Ginny in 2nd year, you can pretend to sense that too and get it confiscated.

The diary, ring and cup's locations are harder to "stumble on", so you'd have to see how things go with Dumbledore to see if you can pull any tricks or when you could find the time to go after them yourself - but as long as you leave Quirrelmort alone to deal with the mirror and fail, and stop Pettigrew being free, Voldemort is no threat for the forseeable future and gives you lots of time to plan.
