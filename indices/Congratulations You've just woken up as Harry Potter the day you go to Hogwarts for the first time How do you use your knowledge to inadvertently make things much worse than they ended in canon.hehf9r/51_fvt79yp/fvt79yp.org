Hermione dies to the troll because of my overconfidence/butterflies. Riddle drains Ginny's soul before i get to the chamber. accidental basilisk interrupt. social graces harry never had makes befriending Ron nigh impossible, he is simply too unlikeable. difference between real age and physical age makes socialising with peers difficult.

capturing Pettigrew will likely fail, he's a slippery bastard, and fate may be on his side depending on how prophecy works. someone might get bitten by Lupin, might die to dementors, Sirius might die, Snape might die, Buckbeak might die. It all depends on the Patronus charm's actual difficulty.

Cedric beats me to the cup, and either Moody or Cedric are used in the ritual instead, leaving me no possible way to know Voldemort had returned, thus the order is never convened.

Might punch umbridge, or at least hex her, which would get me arrested, or expelled.

can't receive training in Occlumency from Snape because of fear of discovery as an SI, thus can't block out Voldemort's visions. cannot reveal visions either, as it would lead to above mentioned discovery. Arthur Weasley likely dies. Sirius wouldn't be at DOM however, so i wouldn't go. Voldemort never reveals himself to the wizarding world, has unlimited planning time.

Ministry will fall unprepared, Hogwarts will not be prepared, so malfoy's assassination attempts are likely to work, killing dumbledore before he can get more than one horcrux.

Dying to the horcrux hunt is highly likely. Won't be master of death. Voldemort will win final duel. more casualties in final battle. Wizarding world will lose to many families, genetic pool will shrink, purebloods breed themselves out of existence.

If they are somehow around come the turn of the century, CCTV will become too difficult to avoid, their lack of muggle knowledge will see them discovered, and either killed or captured for experimentation. The end.

Casualty list:

Hermione, Ginny, Cedric, Moody, Arthur Weasley, Ron? Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, Lupin (Executed for murder?) Every Muggleborn. Every halfblood. Every Pureblood. Everyone. Period. and then global warming won't be solved by magic, so all the muggles will die as well.

Anyone else feeling depressed and frustrated? lets just say i'm not so against the unrealistic wish fullfillment in most SI fics :P realism/pessimism sucks ^_^
