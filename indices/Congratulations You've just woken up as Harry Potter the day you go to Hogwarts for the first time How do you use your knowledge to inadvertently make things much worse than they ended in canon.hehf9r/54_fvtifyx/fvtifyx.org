I probably try and make friends with Hermione instead of Ron first, since I could be pals with Ron later. To keep them safe from the troll incident (and me) I just idk... punch people when they make fun of her on Halloween. Hopefully keeping her from crying when she yells at me for hurting others.

Inadvertently someone else gets killed by the troll. Leading to Ministry eyes in the school much earlier than 5th year. Leading to the Government gaining control of the stone, instead of it being destroyed.

Ohh also I probably try to get chosen for Griffs like Harry to follow the plot a bit.. but I end up a Raven because all I really want isn't to save the world but to learn magic so I can learn more magic... so that probably messes this up really early too.
