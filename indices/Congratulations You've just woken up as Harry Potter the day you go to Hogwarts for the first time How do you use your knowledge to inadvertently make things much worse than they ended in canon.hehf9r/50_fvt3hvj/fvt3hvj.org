Shaking professor Quirrels bare hand at the great feast? Killing a defense professor and causing yourself enormous amounts of pain in front of the whole student body. Would probably derail a lot of people's opinions on Harry as well as utterly scar a lot of preteens and teens.

Elf liberation front. Just become completely fixated on that task alone. After all Harry isn't going to be expelled, so the level of protest could probably get pretty extreme before someone really addressed it. Protests could involve all sorts of aspects, the more disruptive the better.

If I have parselmouth, I could go open the chamber of secrets and encourage the basilisk to roam the wilds and the Hogwarts grounds. Not for any purpose, not with any direction.... Or maybe it could be part of the elf Liberation operation.

Play quidditch poorly. Or better yet, play quidditch poorly and argue with everyone that the role of seeker is pointless and that the game is non sensical. This could likely result in some inter house bullying!

Refuse to help Hagrid rehome Norbert. Hagrids house is burnt down, and he's likely fined for having a dragon.

Personally I'd also take a strong interest in getting child services called about the treatment the Dursley's provide to both their children. That might have to wait until the summer after first year though.
