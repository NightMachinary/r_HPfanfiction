Ok, then, may plan.

If I am to study magic I'm gonna do it well. I would still spend some time socializing with the other kids for people need social interractions to be healthy, but I'd do it as little as I could get away with. This would free a lot of time to study and experiment.

I would spend a lot of time practicing my spells until they become second nature and use a project oriented, hands on studying style. So, find something to do, look up the theory, make it work, make a report, rinse and repeat with something more difficult.

Being the boy who lived, I'd use my status to network and connect with experts of the fields of magic (starting year 6, Slughorn could help tremendeously with this, but I would be getting started far earlier.

As I would now have a lot of money, I'd use it to buy books, potion ingredients and everything else I'd need.

I'd probably wouldn't befriend Ron, nor Hermione (whom I really don't see myself getting along with. I would try to cosy up to the twins, who besides being quite good at magic have a connection to Bill Weasley, who seem worth kowing for someon who intends to get good at magic.

I can't remember if Tonks was still at hogwarts Harry's first year. If she is, convince the wannabe auror to help create a duelling club or something of the sort. Probably no amount of money could convince me to play quidditch. I have better things to do with my time.

Jury's out on leaving the Dursley's.

Then Pettygrew has to go. Too dangerous to keep around. Several ways to do this. I could be innocently working on my animagus revealing spell in the presence of Scabbers and just in front of Dumbledore, for instance. Or I could have "seen" the rat switch to human form by "luck". Barty Crouch Jr, similarly, should be dealt with as early as possible. The other Death Eaters weren't willing or able to seek out ol' Voldie, so it should make things difficult for him.

I'll also use my money to hire private tutors (I do want to learn occlumency/legillimency, and have experienced mentors to help me with my studies).

I do nothing about the stone in first year. Voldie won't beat the mirror anyway, not before Dumbledore is back anyway.

I try to get my hands on Tom's diary year 2. I'm tempted to slip it to Draco along with a compulsion to write in it, but probably not.

â€‹

Which leaves many occasions to mess up.

Most probably, I won't be able to connect with the kids and end up isolated real fast. Even more probably, Voldie will swiftly alter his plans, and there's no way I can compete with one of the most powerful wizards in history standing atop his decades of experience.

I'm bound to attract Dumbledore's attention at one point or another, which could be good or bad.
