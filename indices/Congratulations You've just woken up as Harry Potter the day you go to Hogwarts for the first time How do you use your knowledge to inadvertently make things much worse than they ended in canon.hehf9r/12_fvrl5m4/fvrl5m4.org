At Hogsmeade station, sneak away, run to the village, floo back to London, grab as much money as possible from my bank account, turn it into US$ and pay a random muggle a generous sum to buy me a plane ticket to California. Then write a few anonymous letters to leading biologists encouraging them to take a closer look at the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats in the Streptococcus Pyogenes genome and accelerate the entire field of gene editing by about 10-15 years.

A few decades later when my Amazon shares make me a few orders of magnitude richer than Malfoy I hire the best researchers and engineers the world has to offer, magical and nonmagical, have them develop magic space travel and terraform my own planet full somewhere far far away.
