While I am very smart, and, dare I say, a genius, I still have lots to learn. I just have a higher capacity than most people I've met. (Believe me, if you met the people I knew, you'd be convinced you were a genius) And I also know that, while I am a satisfactory actor, I have a habit of smiling occasionally when I lie or my voice getting higher pitched. It's getting better, sure, but it's why I'd also dedicate my time in learning the mind arts. Both are useful to learn. So my plan would be a long term one.

I wouldn't be able to get everything done in a single year, after all. It would be way too much stress. I'd probably just focus on getting ahead of the rest of the students and then spend my time planning, as well as getting Sirius out of Azkaban. I might even start a newspaper for reliable news---anonymously, of course---but it would take a while. So I'd probably only be able to get Sirius out of Azkaban by the summer after my first year. I'd probably just say I was practising some spells on the rat, and, when I tried the animagus reversal spell, I was shocked to find a grown man and immediately restrained him and took to the ministry---Kingsley Shacklebolt, particularly. He's pretty reliable, and I could see him as an ally in my "grey" side.

Though that's only the early parts of my planning. I'd have a lot of other things to do and consider. Especially considering I would need to make sure that I could get all the horcruxes, not to mention my studies in dark magic. Luckily, I would have the room of requirement, the chamber of secrets, and even the restricted section. I'd also have to explore the school and find all the secret rooms of the founders. Those things would be useful. I'd have to also befriend all the ghosts, especially Helena. They'd be useful.

Actually, now that I think about it, I could renovate Grimmauld place with the help of some newly purchased house-elves. Then I'd be able to stay in it during the summers without Dumbledore being any the wiser. And, considering the wards, I'd be perfectly safe.

And, to get money, I'd just sell muggle supplies and objects at Hogwarts for inflated prices. Of course, I wouldn't give my actual name. I can't have people knowing everything. I could also sell Harry Potter merchandise. I might even be able to employ Fred and George and work with them with all the selling and advertising.

Unfortunately, that would mean that I'd have a very stressful first year with everything to deal with. I probably wouldn't get much sleep, and nevermind quidditch. And I doubt I'd be able to get all of this done in my first year. But I would lay the groundwork for it.
