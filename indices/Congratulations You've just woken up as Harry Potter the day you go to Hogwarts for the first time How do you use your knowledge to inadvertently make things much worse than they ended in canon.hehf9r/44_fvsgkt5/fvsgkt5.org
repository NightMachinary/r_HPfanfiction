I'd go all mini Tom Riddle on Dumbledore. Dumbles would get many heartattacks, and Quirrelmort would be so very confused. But, for a while, I'd also lay low and work on my magic, knowledge of the wizarding world, gaining followers, and figuring out a way to eventually overthrow the corrupt ministry, just in a more...political way than Voldemort. There was a reason he was defeated, after all. People feared him. I want to be respected and loved as a ruler.

Though, granted, I'd also try to piece Voldemort's soul back together. I wouldn't want to die to kill him. I'd also see if he'd be agreeable to my goals. My reasoning is a pretty solid game changer. And certainly a lot more reasonable than his.

I know I'd have to learn Dark Magic to heal Voldemort, but I wouldn't mind. Dark magic doesn't always seem to hurt people. It could help, but people, especially muggleborns, are too afraid of it.

So, I'll lay low. I'd also kidnap Pettigrew and keep him with me for a bit while I work on getting Sirius out. I'd also befriend Remus, Severus, and my other teachers. They'd help. I'll even meet the Tonks's. I could manipulate them so they'd allow to stay with the over the summer. Though, then again, they'd probably be agreeable anyway. I'd be Sirius's godson, after all.

Of course, I'd have to learn the anti-animagus spell and the obliviate spell to be able to steal Voldemort's wand without Pettigrew remembering my doing anything.

There are a lot of other things I'd do, but for the most part, I'd change the whole game.
