It's tougher to be in Harry's body but not have any prep time.

My goal is a purge of everyone I dislike in the Wizarding World. I straight up want to slaughter every single Death Eater and kill everyone who shares the same beliefs as Voldemort.

People like Fudge and Umbridge also draw my ire.

Either way, I can skip a lot of plot events by just outing Voldemort by grabbing Quirrel by the face and killing him at the soonest avaliable opporunity. We don't have to waste time with this stupid mystery. Goodbye, Quirrel-mort.

Freeing Sirius is another goal, but I start to question if I shouldn't just kill everyone on the planet.

See, the Harry Potter universe has an afterlife. It's implied to be a good one. The spirits summoned from it are all able to watch what people in the living world do at all times. If the afterlife is a paradise, then there's no good reason for anyone to be alive and suffering. I'd end the pain. Forever.

So one of my priorities would be getting my hands on the Resurrection Stone, bringing a sacrificial pawn to put the ring on and take the curse for me, so I can use the stone to speak to dead people.

I might just end up deciding to kill Peter Pettigrew so no one will revive Voldemort, then wait until after I can break The Trace, then use my invisibility cloak to steal a nuke.

Then I'd apparate around the world, spreading these everywhere by duplicating them. Then I'd set them off, having prepared a floating platform high in the sky for myself.

I'd need to stay alive long enough to ensure that I've made continued life on Earth impossible and that there aren't any survivors.
