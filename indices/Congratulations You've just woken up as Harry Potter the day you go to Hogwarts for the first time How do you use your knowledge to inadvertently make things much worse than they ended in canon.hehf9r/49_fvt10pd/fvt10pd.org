Hmm...well I won't want to get hurt or lose my own freedom so it will just be a case of messing with everyone else, so...

- Insult Ron when he tries to bond and then join up with Malfoy when offered - or require money from him to sway you

- Let Hermione get maimed or killed by the troll, taking the queen off the board

- Still befriend Hagrid, but let Norbert loose in the school, causing absolute chaos

- Let Fluffy out or tempt it out deliberately

- Steal the Stone out of the mirror and slip it into Quirrell's classroom

- Assist Malfoy in the bullying of Neville
