I would launch a counter propaganda mission amongst the students of Slytherin (if I were in Harry's body I would be sorted according to my own choice I assume) , target the Malfoy scion for extreme empathy exposure (he did want to be Harry's friend I can use that and his high profile introductions) and then convince enough portraits to claim various Muggleborn students as lost heirs to extinct Wizarding family lines, possibly Gringots would be in on that particular scam because when you explain via genetics that everyone is everyone's distant cousin (and split the contents of previously unclaimable vaults with them) they would also vouch for the long lost heir scam. Then when I've broken down the basis for blood prejudice among the youth (it'd take a few more years to get the adults convinced via ministry reform because they were the ones that decided to claim these poor lost Witches and Wizards as something other and less than, shame on them) I'd try to get a counter intelligence program going for accurate real time information on Voldieboys whereabouts because hopefully by year five I'd have him painted not as liberating the Pureblood cause, but as a woefully confused wizard plotting to undermine the magical heritage of a large portion of the population when they are just as capable of magic as the rest.

Truly a lot could be done to sway things toward the entire Muggleborn caste being abolished through the female claim, you could potentially cite Witches through history having their own family lines that were unrecorded because of sexist Ministry policy.

Of course targeting the youth and convincing them to view the students they've othered not only as equals but even fit marriage prospects, in time I would hope to have an entire generation of half blooded genetically diverse Witches and Wizards that would keep claiming that the Muggleborn heritage concept is totally made up by the Ministry to keep control of the population at large by turning them against each other.

It's a very backwards strategy from a real world perspective but the Wizarding elite have proven to be susceptible to anything that plays to their collective vanity.

TL;DR Turn the children against the system and watch it alllll burn. Even if I die I mean I could potentially convince the other children to just mass emigrate to the MACUSA for asylum and Voldemort has no leg to stand on if there aren't any youth to hold over their parents heads.
