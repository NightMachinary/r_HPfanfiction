As soon as the doors open to let in the firsties, I would charge the staff table and pounce onto Quirrel while screaming "Idiot Dumbledore stuck me with abusive relatives blah blah blah." as a way to hide why I'm jumping on Quirrel. And then when he crumbles to ashes say you didn't mean to kill Dumbledore.

This would most likely get Dumbledore in a boatload of trouble, kicked out of all of his positions, and the Death Eaters start moving and the war starts super early. Meanwhile, since I stole Pettigrew, this gets Sirius a trial and he takes me out of the country with Reemus and the Tonksesseses.
