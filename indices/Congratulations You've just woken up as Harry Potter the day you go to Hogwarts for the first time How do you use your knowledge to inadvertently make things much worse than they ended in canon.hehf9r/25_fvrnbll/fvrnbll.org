Try to learn the killing curse and when the opportunity presents itself, cast it on Dumbles. He wouldn't suspect it at all and if I was fast enough it'd be pretty easy to kill him. When he's dead I commit suicide. The wizarding world is now missing its savior and its warrior of light. As a result of this, public morale is pretty bad. Then, because the mirror wasn't yet deployed in the third floor corridor, Quirrel gets the stone pretty easily. Voldemort should then be able to quite easily access his support base and gain control over wizarding britain. The statute of secrecy would be close to breaking because Voldemort encouraged muggle-baiting and the such. This would result in international conflict as other countries try to stop Voldemort from revealing wizardkinds existance. The resulting war would of course not help conceal wizardkind, and the muggles would stumble upon a species engulfed in war. They'd be swept into the conflict, and because magic is so powerful, nuclear weapons would be thought to be the only answer. Nuclear war would then result in destroying humanity.
