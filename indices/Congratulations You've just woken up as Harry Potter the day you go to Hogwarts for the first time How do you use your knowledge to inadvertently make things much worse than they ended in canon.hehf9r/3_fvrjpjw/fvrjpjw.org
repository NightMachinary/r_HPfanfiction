"Congratulations! You've just woken up as Harry Potter..." Don't congratulate me, that's terrible news.

As for how I inadvertently make things worse, other than just generally being myself, the first thing that comes to mind is that eventually the unspeakables somehow end up finding out I lived a life as an entirely different person in a world where magic doesn't exist, then I end up being poked an proded in the department of mysteries while they study me.
