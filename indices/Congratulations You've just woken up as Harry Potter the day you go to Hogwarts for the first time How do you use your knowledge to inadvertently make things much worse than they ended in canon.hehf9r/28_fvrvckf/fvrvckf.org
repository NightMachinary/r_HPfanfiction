I have no idea how this happened but serious is alive, Lunas addicted to The Bee Gees, Neville thinks Hermione is his long lost twin and Draco Malfoy Has eloped with Hedwig To Bermuda. Voldemort has been vanquished but Everyone's gone batshit. I'm currently hiding in a castle in Estonia because the Bulgarian Prime Minister thinks Harry is having an affair with his daughter. Simply because the letter sent via owl Got caught in a storm in the ink ran a little. So instead of a formal announcement of a new British representative for the ICU Auror Conference the Bulgarian Minister believed it was a love letterSent from harry potter to his 19-year-old daughter. Never mind that she's six months older than the potter boy. You could never reason with an overprotective father, So the man who survived has no choice but to do the one thing he has never done in his life hide whike Hermione fixes this mess.
