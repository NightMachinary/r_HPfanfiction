You'd either have to already be a Machiavellian mastermind to rival Moriarty IRL, otherwise you'd be the SI on which every single plot backfires so spectacularly, that you'd have no political clout left or be a squib or be in Azkaban before your 15th birthday. It'd probably be a fantastic read though.
