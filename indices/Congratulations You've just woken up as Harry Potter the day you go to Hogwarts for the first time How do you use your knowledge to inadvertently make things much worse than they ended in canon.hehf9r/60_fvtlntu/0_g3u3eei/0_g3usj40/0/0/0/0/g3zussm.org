... oh your really pessimistic. I was assuming that I'm ME not Harry. And my luck is better than his. Also, nonexistent child protection laws? That's ludicrous even for the backwards Wizarding world (example is the Black family are incredibly rich and incredibly dark Wizards. I'd don't think anyone would have /dared/ take Sirius just out of pure /fear/. Neville's grandmother is from an old and also very wealthy line. In FF's she's described as a typical old school family matriarch that /again/ no one dares mess with, that's just FF but we don't see her in canon much. Better example is Tom Riddle and Harry Potter... both went to one person about abuse. Who? The same person ironically. Dumbledore. What happened to /both/ Tom and Harry? /nothing/. Because Dumbledore did /nothing/.) I'd /love/ be in the Wizarding world. Harry's life or a side character either way. And I don't think I'd make such a fundamental mess of things. Isn't that the whole point to daydream on “what if's” in the first place? To have fun and see how far we can stretch canon? Either way we can just agree to disagree. I definitely wouldn't make that much of a mess of things and my viewpoint is much more optimistic.
