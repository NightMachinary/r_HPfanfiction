I know the Harry Potter universe backwards as well but what is inherent to Harry Potter is that the he poor kid is so unlucky outside of life and death situations. Don't you see every change you make potentially backfiring in the worst way possible?

Be sorted in Slytherin & find out that you are universally hated - either for being a Slytherin or helping whomevers family members to Azkaban.

Complain about abuse and discover child protection laws are non existent & you are seen as an attention whore because we have canon examples of both Sirius and Neville of stuff that never ought to have been allowed.

Try to save Sirius from prison and find out they made it a law to keep him in like they used to with Nazis after ww2. I could give you countless examples of how things could go terribly wrong.
