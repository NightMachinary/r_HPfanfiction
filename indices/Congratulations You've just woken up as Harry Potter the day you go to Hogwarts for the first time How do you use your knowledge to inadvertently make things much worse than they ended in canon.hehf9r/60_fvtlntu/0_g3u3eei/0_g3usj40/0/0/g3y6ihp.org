I'm often times unlucky and often times likely to get confused but I know Harry Potter so well forward and backward that I'd be /stunned/ if most of my schemes didn't come out either on top or on top enough to keep me out of /serious/ trouble. I get being cynical but if your knowledge base is good and if you know who your dealing with (money and power hungry idiots for the most part) then you should theoretically be able to make a pretty good base plan. But being in a situation is much different than theorizing about a situation. I'd definitely be Slytherin, I'd definitely be besties with Draco given he's not a complete ass to his friends, I'd definitely /not/ marry Ginny or any Weasley (maybe an except for Charlie... maybe). I'd definitely probably not sacrifice myself to Voldemort and would probably definitely try to reason with him at least once to see if a peace treaty is anywhere near possible (probably not). But full on antagonizing would be definitely there just for certain people and situations (like I wouldn't mock the Minister of Magic to his face, but Dumbledore? Hell yeah.) I wouldn't do a lot of things Harry ended up doing (triwizard tournament). And I wouldn't have accepted things half assed. I'd have screamed from the rooftops about the Dursley's abusing me, for example. I'd definitely change things. I would just be a secretive (aka Slytherin) dickbag behind the scenes (hence public /angel darling/)
