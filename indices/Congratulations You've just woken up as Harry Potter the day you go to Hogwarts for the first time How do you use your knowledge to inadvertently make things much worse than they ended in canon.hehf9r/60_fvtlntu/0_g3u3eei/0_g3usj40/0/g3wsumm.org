Maybe it is because I couldn't plot myself out of a wet paper bag, but I can't imagine regular people being thrown into Harry Potter's situation, and manage to keep both goodwill, and to be politically on top.

You'd have to be a planning mastermind to rival Sherlock's antithesis Moriarty in order to get away with such a grand plan.

Frankly I'd imagine such a self insert happening, and every plan failing spectacularly, which basically leads to the self insert to keep digging their own grave.

But maybe I am just cynical.
