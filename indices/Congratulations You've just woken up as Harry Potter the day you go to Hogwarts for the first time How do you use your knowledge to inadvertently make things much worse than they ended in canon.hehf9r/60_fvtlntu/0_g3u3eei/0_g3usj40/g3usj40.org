For some reason I didn't understand half of what you said, sorry! My idea is to be four steps ahead of everyone else. Definitely more dark than original Harry Potter is. My /game plan/ is to have enough political allies to /keep/ me from Azkaban on the off chance I did screw up or theorized wrong. Powerful friends is everything and so is money (which I have thanks to the Potter fortune, and Sirius granted I could convince him to make me his Heir). They /couldn't/ throw me in Azkaban. Or that's the theory at least... obviously not every plan goes the way you want it too! - oh and edit - while I'm truly making a muck out of everyone who's important canon wise I'll be the public's /angel darling/. Throw me in Azkaban and you'll have a riot of epic portions.
