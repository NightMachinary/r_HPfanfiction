If it were me... I'd threaten everyone I'm the boy who lived and defeating Voldemort is a /choice/ not something I'd /have to do/ until they listened to my omnipotent wisdom. Tommy after the stone? Free my godfather. Ginny in the chamber? Too bad I'm being beaten by the Dursley's; let me /live/ with said godfather. Peter is back for more because you all are incompetent? Well, honestly I don't care enough so you can just deal with that yourself. Moody isn't moody and I got him caught but I'm still a Champion? I won't participate. Dragon? Imma close my eyes for a while. Lake? Take a swim! Maze? Nah, I get too dizzy. Don't touch that cup BTW. Umbridge? The wizarding world would be fascinated to know about the torturing students are undergoing, I'll just owl my very good friend Rita, she works for the Prophet, you know. Draco is evil? He's my best friend since first year. He never took the mark cuz I'm not an idiot (and his father either learned the error of his ways or he's dead. If he's dead - I didn't do it. And you can't prove I did.) Snape kills Dumbledore? Also didn't happen. If it did happen then good thing we have pensive memories of the entire thing and a written magical contract between Snape and Dumbledore. I'm sure it'll come in handy. Horcruxes? I know where they are all and what they are. I've been hunting and destroying them since I was a first year. No biggie! Like I'd be the biggest shit they'd ever seen. Dumbledore would probably just kill me himself. And I'd totally be a Slytherin (cuz I am now in this life, so I would be a Slytherin in /Harry's/ life). I'd take a great joy in messing with everyone - probably a less annoying, less bigoted, version of James Potter. I'd take different classes too, and probably have Snape teach me some Dark Arts, because it may have worked for JK's version, but I highly doubt Voldemort can be defeated by the expelliarmus spell. Oh, and I'd totally befriend the basilisk and other snakes as well. You know how useful they'd be?! Honestly that was a missed opportunity.
