There is an ongoing fix called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13722277/1/][I see no difference]] . After being insulted by Snape, Hermione decides “screw this place” and convinces Harry to run away rather than try to complete in a tournament that he has no business being in. They are still escaping as of the latest update so we will see what happens after that.

Also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6755363/1/No-Hurry-At-All][No Hurry at All]] by robst. After the battle at the DoM Harry decides he is done with the Wizarding World. It's robst so H/Hr and Dumbledore bashing (mild Ron bashing as well).
