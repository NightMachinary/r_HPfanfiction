One of my most favorite "Harry leaves canon" stories are the crossovers with StarGate. I recommend this set of stories:

They are written in the order you see here, so you should read them in that same order

In short, Harry gets kidnapped from Earth by fleeing Goa'Uld before he even attends Hogwarts, and returns only by the 3rd story, where Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire forces him back to Earth ...
