[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][The Power Of Paranoia]] is a 5th year divergence where Harry, upon receiving precisely 0 communication from his friends, hearing someone aparating outside his house and the whole dementor assassination attempt combined with the court appearance letter, puts 2+2=5 and comes up with the conclusions: his friends didn't contact him because they are dead, assassination attempt plus letter equals ministry taken over. He promptly flees the country and puts his name and his being the bwl under the fidelius and disappears out of everybodys lives, causing chaos back in the UK for those he left behind.
