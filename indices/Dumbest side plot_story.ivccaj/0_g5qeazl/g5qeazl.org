I once read a fanfic where they wanted to make Snape headmaster for some time so they somehow needed to get rid of McGonagall. I think the side plot was her getting stuck in a foreign country with some random muggle named Garry Hotter who for some reason thought he was the next Harry Potter- I kinda forgot the whole plot but I found it h i l a r i o u s because the main story was super dark and tragic.

It was a great Snape fic BTW, if I remembered the name I would advise you to read it lol
