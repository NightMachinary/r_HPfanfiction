I read The Merging rather recently, and had to think about this for a bit... there's a chapter marked as an 'interlude' that the notes said could be skipped. Since I distinctly remember once reading an "interlude" that had all the students of Hogwarts as literal fucking kittens living in a barn, I decided to skip it and save my sanity.

And no, I'm not making that up. I'm also pretty sure that Albus was a goat.
