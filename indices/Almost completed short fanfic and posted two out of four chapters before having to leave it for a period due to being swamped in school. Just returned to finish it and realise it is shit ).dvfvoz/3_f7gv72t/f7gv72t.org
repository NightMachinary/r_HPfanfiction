This literally just happened to me recently. (BTW, I'm brand new to reddit as a user - been a lurker forever on various subs, but created an account today to get involved in this sub because I have recently come back to fanfic and am super bummed that the HPFF community - as in, the actual "HPFF" site/forums - is no longer what it used to be. I digress).

I posted a ton of stuff years (and I mean /years/) ago and abandoned some WIP's when I got busy and completely faded away. I finally got the bug to pick it up again, and while I have a good emotional connection with most things I'd posted, as I looked back over some pieces/chapters I was like, /That's horrendous, why did you actually write it like that?/

I posted new chapters on a couple of fics to get the updates /out there/, but resolved to go back and revise earlier things that were bugging me, too. If what you're dealing with is mainly ticky-tack annoyances, I'd suggest doing that.

Our minds and abilities change over time, and sometimes when you look at older work, you just realize you were less mature (as a writer), less polished, etc., so I think it's really normal (even good!) to look back at your old stuff and think it's too crude, over-embellished, doesn't flow, what have you.

If you're just really horrified and don't want anyone reading it at all in its current state, you can just make it into a "draft" (or similar function depending on where you're posting) so readers can't see it while you tidy it up - then post your updates once you get the glitches out! One of my stories that was pretty popular back in the day - I went back and re-read it and cringed so hard I couldn't stand it. I've hidden it for now so I can do major re-works of a few things before I pursue an update.

And I agree with [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]], sometimes you just need to let yourself write something else to clear your head and see what is really inspiring you. Maybe try out a new fic with the same/related characters, see if a fresh approach helps you figure out what didn't work the first time.
