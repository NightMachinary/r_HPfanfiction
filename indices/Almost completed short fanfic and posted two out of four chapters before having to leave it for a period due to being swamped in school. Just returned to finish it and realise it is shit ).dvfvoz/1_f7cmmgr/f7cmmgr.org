It happens all the time, it's not just with you. I left a chapter "mainly ready" to post and had to take a break, and when I came back it needed so much editing you wouldn't believe! There are some things you can try, the first is to look for a beta reader (they are magical beings that take your chapter when you think it's finished and suggest a lot of changes). When we're writing we don't have the emotional distance necessary to tell whether it's good or not, and betas help a lot with that. If you can't (or don't want to get one), one way is to wait a day before you post and not touch it for that time, and the next day read it again (out loud if necessary).
