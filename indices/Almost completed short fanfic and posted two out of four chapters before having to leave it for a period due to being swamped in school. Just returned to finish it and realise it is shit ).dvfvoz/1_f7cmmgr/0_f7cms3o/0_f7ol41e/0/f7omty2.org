For the HP fandom, there's a Facebook group called Wordsmiths & Betas that's meant to make finding a beta easier (If I'm not mistaken, they have an album with beta profiles). You can also make a post asking for a beta on a FB group that's specific to your pairing (for fics about the Marauders, there's Shrieking Shack Society, for rarer pairs there's The Fairest of the Rare, and so on and so forth). Just make sure the person is okay with the pairing and with whatever kind of smut it is that you've mentioned (and that there isn't any group rules that forbid it, that's important as well).
