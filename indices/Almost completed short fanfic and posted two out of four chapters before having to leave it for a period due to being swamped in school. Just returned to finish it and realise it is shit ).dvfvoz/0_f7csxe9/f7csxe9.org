I think JKR said it took her 12 re-writes just to get the first chapter of the first book. Not being happy with what you've produced is the default state.

Writing, like most other things improves with practice and like most things practice is annoying and you get it wrong a lot. Think of it like a musical instrument, years of practice go into a public performance but before that you sounded shit for a long time in private, that didn't mean you weren't excited the first time you made some noise and I bet your parents clapped. Much like practice for most things it can also be a slog at times. Like most hobbies if you want to get better you need to work for it but if it always feels like work then you should think about spending your time doing something that you enjoy more. Free time is precious.

Realising what you've written is terrible is frustrating, it is however, a sign of growth. You've learnt something. Next time you'll do better. Read through it and work out what sort of thing has gone wrong. Is it a bad idea in the first place, have you done something that doesn't fit? Has a character acted very much against how they behave, is an event happening that should have been butterflied away by a previous event? Identifying errors can really help identify what you need to improve. If you are happy with how things happen but what is happening is the issue then perhaps you need to plan more for example. Editing can easily take as long as writing, editing is almost always extremely boring so I would recomend in future you write well ahead of anything you publish so if editing drags you down you can relax and write something new for a bit.

Another thing that might be worth saying is there is a very big difference between a fun story and a technically good story. Have you ever read Unattoned? Some people say its the best written fic in the entire fandom. I wouldn't say I know enough on the technical side to agree, but I can say I dislike reading it. On the other hand, there are some dumb powerwank fics that are definately guilty pleasure fics. Guilty pleasure but shit fics often get a lot of attention on FFnet etc. So long as you can tell the differnce it doesn't really matter what you write. Sort fics by favourites on any big site and you'll realise they don't generally correspond to quality all that much. Are you writing for favourites or for youself?

Finally, there is nothing wrong with having multiple unwritten fics sitting around as you work on whatever catches your attention. You don't owe anyone anything. Promising updates to people is silly and just puts pressure on you. Maybe you want that but not everyone does. Don't feel you have to finish your story just because it has some favourites if you aren't happy with it, maybe take whatever idea first sparked it and try again.
