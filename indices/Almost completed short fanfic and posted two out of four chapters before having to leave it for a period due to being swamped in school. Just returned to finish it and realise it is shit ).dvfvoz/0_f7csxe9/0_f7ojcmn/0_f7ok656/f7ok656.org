This subreddit has a discord you can join and people there are pretty friendly. Not the place to ask for your entire thing edited but they'll probably be happy to read over a small section if you're struggling.

If you're feeling really brave you can head over to the Dark Lord Potter forums where you'll get the harshest feedback but they know what they're on about.
