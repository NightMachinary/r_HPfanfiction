Thank you for all your great advice! You are right that the 'writing quality' often has nothing to do with what fics become popular - and isn't that what is so freeing and inviting with fanfiction? We appreciate each other's stories for what they are as we are all trying to get better.

One of the reasons I finally dared to post a story(except actually liking what I'd written) was that I thought I'd get feedback that would help improve my writing. The surprisingly positive response sort of changed the focus from that to just the pressure to make two good last chapters. Thank you for lifting that pressure a bit.

I think I will try to find a beta reader to get the feedback I so desperately need. But for a now just working on other (still fun) ideas does sound nice.
