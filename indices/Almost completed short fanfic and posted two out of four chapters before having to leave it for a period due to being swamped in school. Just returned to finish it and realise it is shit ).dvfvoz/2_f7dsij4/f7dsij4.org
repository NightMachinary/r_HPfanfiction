Yeah I had that happen with the first several things I posted.

It's so hard when you think hey I actually like this and I want others to see it. Then you go back later and it's full of errors and doesn't flow or whatever.

It took some effort but now if I write something I just save it to my drive and then come back and check on it in some days or weeks to edit and add to.

Eventually i'll post something but i think i'll do the wait till a story is fully finished and mostly edited before doing so.
