My fic has Harry becoming a Lord, but not part of the Wizengamot. Basically, on another world a group of group of dragons need to get the hell out of dodge, and bargain with one of the local 'small g' gods to grant them passage. Harry Potter gets new dragon friends, becomes Lord of the Dragons. It's a Harry/Hermione/? fic, but the ship isn't the main focus. linkffn(Elune's Pebble)
