How far can you apparate? If it's more than a few hundred miles, congratulations, you're now the cheapest method to get things into space.

Profit.

Can't apparate very far, no problem, conjure water into a tank, put magically hot rock in the bottom above a nozzle, congratulations, you've made a thermal rocket, if you can get that water continually conjure, you've got a really nice rocket with infinite delta-V, just make sure you use enough lightening charms to keep your TWR above 1.

Profit.
