2 could be done by expanding a high rise so that each tenant gets their own floor, I doubt anyone's going to investigate that there are more tenants then floors.

4 would be easy! it's not like you ever see your package sent by ship, train or airplane! you just know when it doesn't turn up.

5 is the sort of thing undertaken by a nation state anyway and the muggle executive is already exempt from the statute.
