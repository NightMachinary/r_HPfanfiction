Don't each of these ideas violate the Statute of Secrecy? You might be able to get away with option #1, and #3 while being a long shot for feasibility isn't completely impossible. However, with #2, #4, and #5 I cannot conceive of any way to accomplish those tasks and maintain the Statute of Secrecy.

People will notice that their house/apartment is larger on the inside than the outside. Port Keying freight will not cause the requisite travel trail to avoid suspicion and investigation and getting items to the moon is simply begging to be caught. Unless violations of the Statute of Secrecy are acceptable, then frankly the world is your oyster.
