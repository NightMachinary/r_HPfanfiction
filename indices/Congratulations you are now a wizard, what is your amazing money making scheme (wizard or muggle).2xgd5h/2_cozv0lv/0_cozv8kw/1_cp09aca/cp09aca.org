There is no general magical/electrical disturbance. In GoF Arthur Weasley magically repairs an electric fire. Diagon Alley sits right in the middle of London.

Basically, the only place that is magical enough to mess with technology (that we know of) is Hogwarts.

No need to repeatedly charm the turbines. The flying charms in Hogwarts school brooms lasted decades before they started acting up.
