If you're asking for your own fanfic, Harry's a Parselmouth, it'd be easier for him than most wizards to aquire potion ingredients from basilisks, ashwinders, boomslangs, runespoors, etc.

Also, I've seen house elves used as slave labour in mines and on potion ingredient farms, but I think werewolves would be more efficient cheap labour.
