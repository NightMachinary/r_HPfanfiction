No, in canon all transfigurations are permanent ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit#heading=h.gfbn05kbd3sn][Read Taure's Headcanon document]])

You can transfigure something into an animal

Lily did teacups into rats, Hagrid 'tried' to turn Dudley into a pig, Cedric transforms a rock into a dog, Mcgonagall changes her desk into a pig etc etc.
