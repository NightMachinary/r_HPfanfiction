Option 1: Time Travel + Muggle Lottery + Muggle Stocks. Step 1: Wait for the winning lottery to be announced. Step 2: Travel back in time 6 hours (or less if possible) to buy the ticket. Step 3: Check whether any stocks have risen greatly in the last six hours. Step 4: Go back in time 6 hours and buy those stocks. Step 5: Sell the stocks 6 hours later (at the time you started to go back in time). Step 6: go to step 1 or 3.

Option 2: Arbitrage. In the books, 1 galleon is 17 sickles and 1 sickle is 29 knuts. Because we don't know the size of the coins, we don't know how the arbitrage would be done, but, with a fixed relation and coins made of valuable materials (silver and gold), as the muggle market fluctuates, there will often (if not always until the coin relations or coin size changes) be money to be made buying silver/gold to be sold for galleons.

Option 3: Reparo business. The spell reparo seems to be somewhat overpowered. Even if it doesn't work with objects containing any electronics, there are still old things that never contained electronics (e.g. old planes/tanks/ships), and new things that don't contain electronics (e.g. expensive watches). A wizard could presumably use reparo multiple times a day for a large profit.
