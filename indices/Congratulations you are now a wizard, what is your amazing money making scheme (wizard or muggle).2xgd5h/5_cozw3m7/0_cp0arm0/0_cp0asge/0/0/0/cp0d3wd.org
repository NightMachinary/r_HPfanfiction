I was basing my statement on the value of gold in the 90s. [[http://i.imgur.com/8rEeFKi.png][I may have given this considerable thought.]] The assumptions used in that were 1) pure gold, 2) galleons the size of a Â£1 coin. Since we don't know the size of galleons that seemed as good a choice as any. Pure gold is unrealistic but doesn't affect the values /that/ much if the fineness is reasonably high.

On the other hand, maybe the exchange rate is so low because the gold is very impure. I'm not sure if debasing their currency is in character for the goblins or not.
