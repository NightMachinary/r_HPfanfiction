Harry Potter is set in the 1990s, a time during which the value of gold was much lower than today. Say the galleon is made of 14 karat gold, at the price of gold in 1990s, the coin could be about 0.6 millimeters in diameter and weigh about 1 gram. This is about twice as large as the smallest coin in human/muggle history:

It's theoretically possible (not likely) that the goblins followed the price of gold and galleons were discontinued in the 2000s or the ratio of gold sank below 50% in galleons as the price of gold rose in the 2000s, but the price of gold in the 1990s allows for tiny galleon coins of 14 karat gold.
