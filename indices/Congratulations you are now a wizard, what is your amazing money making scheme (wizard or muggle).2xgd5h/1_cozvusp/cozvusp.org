Legally? Get a portkey licence and market same-day global package delivery to large companies. As long as the muggles don't know, it's legal. Alternatively, find a way to brew a potion that slowly restores a human body to peak physical condition and sell it as an energy drink. And to that guy that came up with using the reparo on antiques to fully restore them, kudos to you oh dude lost in the mists of time.

Illegally is where it gets interesting. Weapons, drugs, people are the current staple of international criminal organisation. The problem is that it's insanely difficult to actually move these shipments across borders without being detected. So act as a middleman and portkey cargo across borders for the various cartels. Take half for yourself and use gemino on the other so that you can sell to other interested parties. Using compulsions would make an enforcer's job a lot easier. Assassination? Pfft. No wards, no problem.

On the wizard's side of things, anything electronic where legal, poisonous where not. Basically, criminals need ranged weapons that don't emit magic. Muggles have been spending centuries developing them. Hello muggle/magical crime crossover.
