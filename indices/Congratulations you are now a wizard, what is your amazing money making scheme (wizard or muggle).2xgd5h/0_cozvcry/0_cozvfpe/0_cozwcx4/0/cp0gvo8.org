It's just as likely that the use of a time turner would alter the past enough that the stock investment wouldn't work out, since stock value is dependent on people buying stocks, and stock prices affect (effect?) the company's attitude. Plus you'd have to hide the stocks from yourself until back in the present or you could technically go insane. You might not be looking directly at yourself, but you would be confronted with the fact that two of you existed at once, which is what I always thought actually drove the wizard insane. Plus, if you didn't wait then you'd get rich early, not have to go back in time, and create some sort of weird time loop. Actually, what if that created a parallel universe where you discover random wealth, become a horrible person and you come back to a present where everyone hates you?

Sorry... I got a bit ramble-y there.
