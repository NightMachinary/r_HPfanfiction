I agree with deirox. Other than crime and becoming a super hero, converting magical energy to conventional energy is probably the easiest and most benevolent method. Other things might be restoring old anything (depending on the mechanics of magic, obviously), fighting crime (legillemency, anyone?), and freight transport (again, depending on the mechanics, portkeys would probably save some money).
