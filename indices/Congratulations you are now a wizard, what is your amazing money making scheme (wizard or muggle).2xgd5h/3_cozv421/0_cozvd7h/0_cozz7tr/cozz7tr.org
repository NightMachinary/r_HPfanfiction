Step 1. go to junkyard/garage sale and buy really old, but broken stuff like furniture or cars for mere pennies (or just take it away for free).

Step 2. "reparo" + "cleanio it uppo" (I forgot all Latin I ever learned)

Step 3. Sell as priceless antiques in mint condition.

Seriously, it's like printing money and since none of the items are actually enchanted it's not even illegal to do.
