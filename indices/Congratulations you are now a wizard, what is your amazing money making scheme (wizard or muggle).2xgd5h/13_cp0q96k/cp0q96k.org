Note : requires non-canon spell but it's not far-fetched. :

Elemental purification/separation.

Create a spell to separate X items in the basic element. "hyperpure silicon may cost as much as $100/oz." And we know that most of the earth crust is made of silicon. Or make diamonds out of any carbon compound. (harder than just making pure silicon because you have to re-arrange the atomical structure) If you can make a spell that separates the compouding elements you can get actual 100% purity (technologically impossible) .

Really the possibilities are endless.

I really doubt that a spell like that is hard , hell it's a "stupid" form of transfiguration and/or vanishing (just vanish everything it's not silicon/carbon and you're set) , you need some understanding of basic chemistry that's all.

It's way less suspicious than breaking lotteries and/or cheating the stock market and it can be done with way more anonimity.
