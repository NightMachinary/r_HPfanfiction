So... a lot is wrong here and not actually canon.

1. The attack against the Potters was in october 31st 1981

2. The books make it clear that there were two "candidates" for the prophecy right away, Neville and Harry, even though they weren't born yet, because the prophecy announces the birth of said person.

3. The alleged recruitment is not canon, is something JK Rowling misremembered, as Hagrid said Voldy never tried to recruit them. And even if you can argue that Hagrid is an incredibly unreliable source given that he doesn't know much, I think JK established that the fans cannot begin to take her additions to the story seriously with all the tweaks and trying to change canon shit. It is not written anywhere in the book, so it is not canon, and the only actual canon reference that we have about it denies it. It is, at most, a headcanon.

4. Prophecies in HP do actually get fulfilled, at least the ones regarding our main characters. Excluding of course the shit Trelawny spews every other lesson, because they are not actual prophecies and her Inner eye is more than slightly fucked up. Dumbles was only trying to impart on Harry that prophecies do not take free will and the importance of a self fulfilled prophecy. It is true that not all will come true, but given that Dumby is more than a little manipulative towards HP, I have a hard time believing everything he says, but that is up to each one of us to believe it or not ;)
