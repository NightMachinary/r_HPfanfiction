I think he prob had a lot of trauma and shit and all the thing every Snape fan says and we are tired of hearing(I'm one of them, and my otp has to be SS/HG /Just because they are the best written fanfics I've ever seen/ and not at all compatible with canon) HOWEVER, saying that he was too young at the age of 20 when HP had to deal with a lot of the same shit childhood wise is doing a disservice to both of their characters. I know HP had support and bla bla, but Snape was no child and he recognized his mistake afterwards. (I don't know if I got my point across, but I'm a little busy rn)
