I had always hard time to believe that Snape was torn for twenty years by his revealing of the prophecy. Yes, it was very unfortunate, and yes it could possibly lead to death of a woman he was interested in (I have hard time to say that she had loved her, because [[https://youtu.be/t4mqHdd5gzo?t=92][Shrek is right]], if he loves her, he has to let her go). But it *was* a mistake, he really did not meant to hurt her.
