I think there was one called The Boy Who Died A Lot, which has Harry die in all sort of manners, and Snape has to use a time turner to go back and save him repeatedly. Harry's first Death is notably the situation you've mentioned. It's a Harry/Snape fic, be warned. And it's long as hell but a decent enough read.
