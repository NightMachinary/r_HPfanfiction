It's not a big focus or anything, but the second Weasley Girl story (from the Weasley Girl AU, where Ron was born a girl) has a few scenes where Dursleys and Weasleys interact. The first chapter starts at the beginning of Harry's second year, but instead of Ron, Fred and George coming to bust him out from the Dursleys', it's Ronnie and Ginny... and it doesn't go as smoothly since the Dursleys wake up.

Dudley's really only in the first chapter and one of the epilogues, Vernon and Petunia get SLIGHTLY more focus. The second chapter has Petunia briefly visiting the Burrow... Fred and George aren't impressed by her... and both she and Vernon play a certain role in the plot, even if they don't get very much screen time.

Oh, and Marge shows up for a brief cameo towards the end, and immediately gets on the wrong side of the present Weasleys (Ronnie, Ginny and Molly),
