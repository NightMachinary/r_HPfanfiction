I remember reading one (or maybe more but I don't remember well enough) where Lily and Sirius were alive but James either was dead or abandoned her for some selfish stupid reason (it was either AU or dimension travel). They loved each other but didn't admit it or thought too much of the past (if James was dead it was because of guilt I think).

Unfortunately, can't remember the fic's name.
