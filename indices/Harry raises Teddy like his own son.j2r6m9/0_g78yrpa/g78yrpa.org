This is more how it gets to that relationship, but try Teddy's Excellent Adventure, linkffn(13021745).

Also, not the focus of the story, and Teddy only appears occasionally, but they have that relationship in Steve and the Barkeep, linkffn(8410168).

I had two other stories in my list that might have met the description, but they've both been removed from ffnet since the last time I looked at them, so I can't really verify that.
