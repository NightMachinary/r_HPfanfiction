I'm reading it rn and while I'm enjoying it I really hate some of the authors quirks when trying to sound British. If I see "sodding" used one more time I'll be tempted to drop the fic there and then. I don't like the romance much either bc honestly Harry's character just changes to something you'd see out of twilight or something always growling and stuff. It's a bit cringy. Let's not even get started on how unrealistically dense Harry is. I'm enjoying the story but these problems really annoy me and also the way the author makes everyone over the top sarcastic and joking about everything when the author is clearly not funny enough for it to work.
