Its actually my second favourite fic all time, only Grow Young with Me beats it. Starts fairly slowpaced, and I actually dropped 100k words in because I started reading another fic at the time that simply grabbed me way harder. Then I forgot about this fic and one day I had a power outage for like 10hrs in my house, so to pass time, I browsed my phone for older fics to read and this popped up. Then i read it non stop for 2 days (at the time it was 700k words total) and started following it. Its really, really fucking amazing. Great battle scenes, great complex magics, the Horcruxes aren't boring, the OC is a new creature (it says so in the first or second chapter) and the world building is phenomenal, with a war SOOOO much bigger than just the UK, great humor, a nice friendRon (which I love, I hate bashing in general, but mostly when its Ron) the romance is really nice, Tonks and Remus are hilarious, it has one of the best Dumbledore's in fanfiction imo, an actual GG, manipulative, utilitarian but good Dumbledore, doing his best to win the war (and it is A WAR, not a bunch of skirmishes with a single final battle)... I could go on and on about it, I really love this fic. I've talked with author several times these last couple years and I haven't ever managed to figure out if they are a woman or a man, even if they mentioned their husband. The reason the updates take a while is because the author is a EMT(I think that's the acronym) and loves to go caveing, so it takes a while to surface, and sometimes shit happens.
