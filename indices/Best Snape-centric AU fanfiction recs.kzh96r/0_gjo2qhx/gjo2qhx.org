A Snape centered magic AU!??

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

This is the best one. people can fight me. Snape is cunning and clever and sly. He's a spy with actual motivation and brains and personality.

It's a monster fic but brilliant. and you name it, this story has it.

A portrait in the Slytherin Common Room comes to life. Harry Potter goes missing. Things occur.

....I have no idea what else to say without spoiling it but it's good. It's very good ðŸ˜Š
