Wow, why would they be? I mean, I don't /mind/ her being black in the /Curse Child/ production at all, but why would someone be angry about the other way around? Nothing indicates either way in the text, and, due to her being from an English family, she'd be stasitically most likely to be white... so I really don't see what could have made people /expect/ her to be of color so much that they'd be offended when she was casted as white in the movies.

(Incidentally, my first reading of POC was /Pirates of the Carribeans/, which had me very confused. Has to do with not being a native English speaker, you see.)
