[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5137052/1/Harry-Potter-s-Army-A-General-s-Lament][Harry Potter's Army: a General's Lament]] is Harry/Padma. It's the only one I can remember reading.

I found these [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=1599][two]] [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=8948][lists]] of Harry/Padma that should give you some stuff to check out at least.

As for Harry/Parvati, I've heard good things about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3400326/1/Butterfly][Butterfly]], and you can check out these [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=2827][two]] [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=1858][lists]] for other Harry/Parvati stories.
