I'm the one who posted the reddit topic you linked. Somebody was kind enough to give me [[http://ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][this link]] that contains ebooks for many of Araciel's works, including the original Niffleheim Academy (it's being rewritten and posted on AO3). Make sure you click on either epub or mobi, not on the fic name---that will give you ffn's "story not found" error.

I have a downloaded copy of Fairy Tale in MSWord format. I'll PM you the link.
