There aren't any good ones. It's too difficult to get 'right', and I don't even know what getting it right would entail. linkffn(11517235) gets close and does so by handwaving the incest aspect from an emotional pov via a plot contrivance. Couple of one shots or thereabouts from DLP. And that's it, I guess.
