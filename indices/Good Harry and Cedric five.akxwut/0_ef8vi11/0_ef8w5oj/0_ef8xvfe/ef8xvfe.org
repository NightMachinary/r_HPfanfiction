I went through the first seven pages on ao3 (cedric/harry tag, sorted by word count) basically doing page searches for that scene but couldn't find one with it. I'll try again a little later and report back if someone doesn't find it by then. Have some conciliatory fics instead. Hopefully some will be new to you!
