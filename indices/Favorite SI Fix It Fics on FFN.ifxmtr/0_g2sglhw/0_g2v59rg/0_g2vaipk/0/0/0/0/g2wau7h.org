Oh, not at all. I don't think anyone could reasonably claim that A Cadmean Victory is about fixing what went wrong in canon, nor is The Pureblood Pretense, and many stories don't take place within canon at all, whether they're post-Hogwarts like Grow Young With Me, or on another continent like Alexandra Quick, or even crossed over to another world like The Shadow of Angmar. And even when a story fixes /some/ things, it may not really be a fix-fic overall if it introduces new challenges to match. It's when such challenges do not appear that the label really fits. Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay gets away with it by focusing on school life and the antics of the various non-human but fully intelligent students, which makes for an interesting and engaging storyline even without the drama of fighting a dark lord.
