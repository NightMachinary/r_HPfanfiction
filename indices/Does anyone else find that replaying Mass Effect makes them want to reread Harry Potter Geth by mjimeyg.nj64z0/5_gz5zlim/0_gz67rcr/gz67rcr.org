I've never played Mass Effect, but I was sometimes around a roommate as he played through the entire trilogy, and I'm pretty sure I checked the wiki for more background information as I read. That was enough for me to enjoy it, though it's been long enough that I can't say for sure how much knowledge is actually necessary.

It probably wouldn't hurt to find a YouTube video or something that gives a short description of the major races and characters.
