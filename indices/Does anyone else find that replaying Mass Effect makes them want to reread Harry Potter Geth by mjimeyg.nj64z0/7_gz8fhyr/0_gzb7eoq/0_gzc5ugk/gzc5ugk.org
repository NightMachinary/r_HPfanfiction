I love both 1 & 2, most of my issues with the trilogy are in the third game. 1 has the best plot + Wrex, but 2 has a great squad & a ton of gorgeous places you get to visit all over the galaxy. Having multiple base worlds to visit in 2 instead of just going back to the Citadel over & over & over again was something I particularly loved.

Plus, I've beaten the first 2 games about a dozen times each and 5 or so times for the last one (and over 1000 hours on the MP), so I've got the entire series pretty much burned into my brain at this point. And Harry at least gets to properly deal with the starbrat, so I'll forever be grateful to mjimeyg for fixing the ending since Bioware refused to do so.
