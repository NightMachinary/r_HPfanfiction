*Grain of Sand* is great, Highly rec

*Teddy's Excellent Adventure* for Time Traveling Kid getting adopted parent with birth parent.

Unfinished:\\
*Bodacious Bodyguard:* Tonks in disguise at Hogwarts as Harry's Bodyguard\\
*Rotfang Conspiracy:* Smutfic. Tonks characterization pretty good, but Harry's is a bit inconstant. A bit too much independent/super when he is moving the plot along.\\
*Family Matters*: Tonks is knocked out by her mother who takes her place in the final battle, thus she lives. Godfather falls for widowed mother. Lots of potential.
