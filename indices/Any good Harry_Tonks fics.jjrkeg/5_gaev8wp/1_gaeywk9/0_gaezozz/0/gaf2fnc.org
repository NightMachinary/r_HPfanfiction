To me, it was okay, I've seen better and I've seen worse fics in that category. If you want a good HP/Mass Affect story, Harry Potter: Geth is one I would highly recommend, along with a lot of the HP stories by that author.

But I think I enjoyed ItMoaS the most, followed by MatG, and Madness Affect the least in that trilogy.
