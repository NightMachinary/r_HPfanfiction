Monster Hunters Inc. Basically government paid mercenaries who kill supernatural creatures. And business is very good. Lots of gun porn.

Sandman Slim. Description of first book: The stories' main character, James "Sandman Slim" Stark, escapes from Hell to take his revenge on the people that killed his lover. He wanders a dark Los Angeles haunted by vampires and demons. After 11 years of combat as a gladiator against demons in Hell, he is more than prepared to fight back. Very violent.

Galactic Football League. Take American Football, cross it with Star Wars, and throw in a splash of mafia/gangster for flavor.
