I'm nearing the end of Red Sparrow by Jason Matthews. It's a good read and I highly recommend it.

I'm also a big fan of Stephen King, with my particular favorites being The Stand, 'Salem's Lot, Pet Sematary, It, 11/22/63, and Under the Dome (though it's ending sucked).

And of course, one of my favorite books of all-time, The Godfather by Mario Puzo definitely deserves a mention.
