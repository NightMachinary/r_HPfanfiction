I think Red Sparrow is fantastic (up to the point I've read). Definitely a ton of insight and knowledge in the workings of the CIA. I haven't read Clancy or Flynn, though many reviews on Amazon allude the workings of Jason Matthews to Clancy's veteran works. Have you read Red Sparrow and Palace of Treason?
