/Earthsea/ by K. Le Guin is my long-time favorite series, the earlier books at least, as the later ones are too philosophical and I might just be too dumb to understand or enjoy them. The first book deals with a young mage as he grows and learns, and that's a lot more to my liking.

/The Chronicles of Amber/ by Roger Zelazny, the first five books that is. The later five which deal with Corwin's son are just meh. The books follow a group of semi-immortal royal siblings who rule over a city in the center of the universe, and they can hop through dimensions including Earth.

/The Witcher/ by Andrzej Sapkowski is great fantasy, although my enjoyment lessened when Ciri became more of a focus and started hopping to alternate worlds.

/Недотёпа/ by Сергей Лукьяненко. It follows a noble-born teenager whose parents were overthrown by a rivaling lord. He manages to run away, seeks justice, and ends up becoming an apprentice to a mage in the process. It's YA so not very deep at all, but easily readable and humorous throughout.
