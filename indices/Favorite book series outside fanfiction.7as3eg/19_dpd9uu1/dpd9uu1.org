Im actually a sucker for the dragonlance series, specifically the Legends series featuring Raistlin Majere. I love his character.

Mistborn is the shit, as is most anything by Brandon Sanderson. Also Barry Lyga's I hunt Killers series is off the chain.

The Dark Hunters is good too, tho i prefer the Chronicles of Nick to the actual Dark Hunters series as its less of a hassle to understand characters.

Anything by Johnathan shroud. Bartemaus is probably the best nonwizard or human based magic system ive ever read. Not to mention the character work.
