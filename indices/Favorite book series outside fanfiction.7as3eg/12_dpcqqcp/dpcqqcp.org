I really like Jo Walton's recent work. Among Others features a girl at boarding school, some magical realism, and lots of reading recommendations. My Real Children is about a woman whose life diverges into two based on a single decision; I thought it was amazing - I had a book hangover for days after I finished it and have recommended it to so many people. This summer, I read her Philosopher Kings trilogy, which is a little bit fantasy, a little bit mythology, and a little bit sci-fi. I would recommend all of these books.
