If you liked the pureblood pretense, you'll probably like Scott westerfeld's steampunk YA leviathan trilogy about an AU WW1.

I liked The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms recently, sort of a politics/mythology fantasy series, heavy on the world building and characters.

Robin McKinley is one of my favorites- her award-winning series is The Blue Sword/ The Hero and the Crown but I also loved her /Deerskin/, a fairytale retelling of The Coat of Many Colors. The original story is about a widowed king who falls in love with his daughter & how she escapes from him, so it's heavy material, but the second half of Deerskin features the princess surrounded by incredibly charming and loving characters while she gets back on her feet. Happy, cathartic tears abound.

I have heard many good things about the fantasy/morality of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series but have yet to read it.
