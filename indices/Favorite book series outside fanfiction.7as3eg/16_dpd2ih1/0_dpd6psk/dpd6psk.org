That book creeped me out so much I never finished the trilogy. I'm debating whether or not to see the movie. Do you think I should finish it? Is it a satisfying ending or just more creepy ambiguity (not that there's anything necessarily wrong with an ambiguous ending, sometimes I like them. Not in this case. I want a full explanation or I'm not reading any more, lol)
