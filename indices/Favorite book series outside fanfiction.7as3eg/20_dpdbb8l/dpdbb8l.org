I'll stick to sf/fantasy titles because I don't think my very narrow taste in mysteries would contribute much to the conversation, and the list of my favorite mainstream fiction/lit fic would go on interminably.

For series, at the top of the list is probably Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun quintet. They're brilliant and dreamlike and disturbing and mysterious, and they have a hypnotic effect on me. Some readers find them too slow, but I love the language and the gradual immersion in a barely identifiable post-apocalypse world. (By barely identifiable, I mean it's science fiction and the clues are there, but it reads like an alternate-world fantasy.)

Lord of the Rings, which is an old favorite and a comfort read.

The Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake, which is incredibly atmospheric and an amazing, creepy blend of Gothic and Victorian. I have to be in the right mood to read these because the language is beautiful but very dense, almost claustrophobic, and most of the characters are grotesque.

The Riddle-Master Trilogy by Patricia McKillip. Fairly standard Chosen One plot, but beautifully written, with a sweeping sense of magic and transformation. Romantic in the larger sense, and like LotR, with a non-ironic faith in noble heroes.

Further down the ranks, I also thoroughly enjoy the Johannes Cabal series by Jonathan L. Howard for the droll, self-referential narrative voice, misanthropic, singleminded protagonist, and steampunk magical world.

Ditto the Ancillary trilogy by Ann Leckie. Absorbing and entertaining, if a bit uneven.

Stand-alone titles:

Little, Big by John Crowley. Also, Engine Summer, even though it's somewhat dated at this point.

Angela Carter's The War of Dreams, surrealistic fantasy with dollops of Nietzsche and de Sade. Also, The Bloody Chamber, a collection of re-written fairy tales

Samuel Delany's Nova, although it's been years since I read it, so my high opinion of it may not withstand the test of time.

A Stranger in Olondria by Sofia Samatar, a combination of folk tale, anthropology, myth, and poetic coming of age, very beautifully told.

Richard Powers's Galatea 2.2 might belong here as well (parallel storylines of a former failed love affair and current romantic obsession juxtaposed with the gradual growth to sentience of a research lab AI)
