While I too am a big fan of the Dresden Files (and also Codex Alera--God bless Jim Butcher), I would say my very favorite series is /The Grimnoir Chronicles/ by Larry Correia.

To briefly summarize the first volume, /Hard Magic/:

It's 1932.

For the last eighty years, there has been magic. One out of every hundred Americans has magic, and one out of every thousand is called an Active, who has control over their magic. While America suffers through the Depression, Japan is led by a warlord known only as the Chairman.

A man named Jake Sullivan has the Power to manipulate gravity. He's a private investigator, a war hero, and an ex-con. Under a deal with J. Edgar Hoover, Sullivan helps the Feds catch renegade Actives who use their power to kill. One mission goes bad, and Sullivan finds himself beaten by a team of Actives, wearing strange rings, who claim they're protecting other Magicals. Humiliated and chastised by Hoover, Sullivan wants answers. And he's done working for the feds.

Meanwhile, on a dairy farm in California, a farmer tries to train his adopted "granddaughter" how to use her magic, the power of Teleportation, safely. One day, a car drives up, four men get out, and their leader, a one-eyed man, guns him down. The farmer manages to give his granddaughter a small bag before he dies. Inside the bag is part of a piece of a Tesla weapon and a ring, along with a piece of paper with names and an address.
