I posted elsewhere in this thread about Sanderson so I won't harp on again here more than just saying all of his work is top notch, if you enjoy Mistborn check out Stormlight Archive once you're through Mistborn era 1, or after Mistborn era 2. [New Stormlight Archive book is out in under a fortnight]

The Kingkiller chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss are a similar vein to Sanderson's stories. Quality characterization and fantastic world-building in a fantasy setting. KCs main character is a musician cross alchemist/wizard and it makes a great combination.

Third i'll recommend the Gentleman Bastard Series by Scott Lynch. It's less 'hero saves the day' than most fantasy, as it follows a thief / con artist and his friends. Imagine Oceans Eleven, set in a world of swords and sorcery.

His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman has been mentioned earlier in this thread, as has the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix, both are great reads with enough content to keep you occupied for a while.
