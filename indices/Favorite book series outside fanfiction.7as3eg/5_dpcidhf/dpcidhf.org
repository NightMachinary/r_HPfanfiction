My absolute favourite novel is War and Peace by Tolstoy. Characters that feel as alive as if they were real people, a fascinating historical background and a bit of philosophy here and there. What else would you want. Anna Karenina is great too.

I also very much enjoy ASOIAF. A very complex plot driven by multi-faceted characters in a world that is phantastic, yet life-like enough to feel real.

Oh and then there is The World of Yesterday by Stefan Zweig. It's probably the book that had the most significant impact on me. It's the memoirs of a writer whose adult life spanned the first half of the 20th century, with all the radical changes in society and the historical events that shaped it. Zweig was a very cosmopolitan person who suffered a lot from the nationalist divisions the World Wars and the rise of fascism brought.
