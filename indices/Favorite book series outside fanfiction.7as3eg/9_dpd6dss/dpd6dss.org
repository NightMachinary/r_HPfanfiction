Codex Alera by Jim Butcher.

Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, after he passed it was finished by Brandon Sanderson. I'm not sure if I'd fully recommend this one though.

The Stormlight Archive is great so far. By Brandon Sanderson. Pretty much anything by Brandon Sanderson tbh.

Night Angel series and Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks.

The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss.

World of Watches by Sergei Lukyanenko.

Those are some off the top of my head at least.
