As far as actual series goes, probably Skulduggery Pleasant, even though I haven't read any of the books since the first series ended. Snappy dialogue and a good array of characters that have their own personalities, even if over half kinda fall under that same snarky umbrella.

As far as individual books go, probably American Psycho, The State and Revolution and The Motorcycle Diaries.
