Each to their own. I started reading it when I was 12 or 13 and there were only 8 or 9 books in the series. Given how long it took for the next books to come out, I ended up going back, rereading, and catching so much that I missed the first time. Rereading every year is probably out of the question for most people (especially if your reading speed isn't insane) but it's definitely worth reading a second time just to see what new stuff you catch.
