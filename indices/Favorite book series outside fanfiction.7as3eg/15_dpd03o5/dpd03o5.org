*Toaru Majutsu no Index / A Certain Magical Index* - Long light novel series about conflicts between Academic City, a location where cutting edge technology is pioneered and kids are artificially made into psychics and various magical organisations.

Or at least it seems so at the beginning. Truth is much more complicated. There are plans, plans within plans and plans within plans within plans, and our heroes are only pawns in all this.

The main series is currently 40 volumes long and there are book side stories and manga side stories and they can be pretty relevant to the main series (and there is anime-original stuff which semi-canon too), especially considering that the whole book is Chekov's Armoury. For example, the description of a certain character's look is foreshadowing for something that happens over thirty volumes later.

The author has a hard-on on mythology and esoterics and did a crazy amount of research on it (there is a lot of stuff taken from Gesta Danorum for example in regards to Nordic gods) and he created wondrous, though often bullshity symbolic magic system.

Uh... I kinda wrote too much on this, so I'll limit myself with the second one.

*Discworld* - You should already know it, if you don't then go and fix it.
