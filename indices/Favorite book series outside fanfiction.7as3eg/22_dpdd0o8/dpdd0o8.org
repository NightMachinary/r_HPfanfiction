Woo, Sanderson love! I'm very behind on finishing Words of Radiance but The Way of Kings had me enthralled. I've been picking up his books after Mistborn and WoK and loving them.

I loved the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow series until they just started falling apart. Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide are surprisingly good books on Humanism and tolerance coming from a horrible bigot like Card.

It's not a novel, but the comic Saga is incredibly good. I'm once again very far behind on it, but I was never able to stop myself from finishing the entire thing when I got my hands on a new volume.

Other than that, nothing really crosses my mind. That's just from looking at actual books on my bookshelf, so there's probably others that are slipping my mind currently.
