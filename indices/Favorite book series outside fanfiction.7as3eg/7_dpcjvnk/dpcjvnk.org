I read few English-language book /series/ --- as English is not my first language I mostly read French literature, and then mostly standalone novels as opposed to book series like /Harry Potter/. I do have a soft spot for /A Series of Unfortunate Events/ and have quite liked the few /Discworld/ books I read, however. Oh, and I'm in love with the fantasy web serial /The Wandering Inn/. Seriously. Read it.
