I was replying to another comment when the word "French" caught my attention. I realize now I read mostly English novels in their original language, but there are some French books that ought to be more popular. * /La Passe-miroir/ is a fantasy series that is so original and refreshing. The story world is fascinating, as are the characters. It is all so crazy and grotesque but in a familiar way. * /La Horde du Contrevent/ is a brilliant sci-fi standalone novel. Another fascinating read, for other reasons, but it is also very unique. A fantastic journey. * Pierre Bottero's trilogies, and in particular /Le Pacte des Marchombres/. Most of his writing is for younger audiences, but he has such a distinctive writing style that it can be enjoyed by anyone. The first trilogy set in this world is /La Quête d'Ewilan/, but it is the most ""childish"" one. Still enjoyable, but /Le Pacte des Marchombres/ is by far the best in my opinion. A compelling read about the evolution of an iconic character. They are also adapting his novels as comics, and they are really good.

As for non-fantasy books, I also love Jean Anouilh's version of /Antigone/. It is a play I studied in middle school but I absolutely loved it and still do. Victor Hugo's "Le dernier jour d'un condamné" or "The Last Day of a Condemned Man" also had a huge impact on me, as a plea for the abolishment of the death penalty. Way more recently, I read François Bizot's /Le Portail/ in which he recounts his being imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge during the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975.
