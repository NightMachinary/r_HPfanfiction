Anything written by Trudi Canavan -- Although I've not yet read the Millenium Rule trilogy, I've read everything else by her and feel confident in saying all her works are great.

The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman -- I've only read the first one in the series (three currently published, fourth due out next month), but it was brilliant and novel.

Discworld Series by Terry Pratchett -- It's Discworld. What more do I need to say?

/Good Omens/ by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman -- Great fun.

Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix -- Necromancy, talking cats, saving the world from the dead, all good shit.

Bartimaeus series by Jonathan Stroud -- Demons! Personally I find Nathaniel dislikeable, but Bartimaeus more than makes up for him.

/Every Heart a Doorway/ by Seanan McGuire -- Short, but a good story about kids who've been to other worlds, come home, and want to get back.

Midnighters trilogy by Scott Westerfeld -- About a bunch of kids who have special powers during an hidden extra hour at midnight that only they're aware of.

/Graceling/, /Fire/, and /Bitterblue/ by Kristin Cashore -- Graceling introduces a world where some people are born with a natural affinity for a particular skill. Really interesting, good stories.

Nightside Chronicles by Simon R. Green -- Urban fantasy set in an underground London. The books are a little on the short side by fantasy standards (only average 70k), but they're a good read.

/Six of Crows/ and /Crooked Kingdom/ by Leigh Bardugo -- Group of misfits perform a heist, also there's some magic.
