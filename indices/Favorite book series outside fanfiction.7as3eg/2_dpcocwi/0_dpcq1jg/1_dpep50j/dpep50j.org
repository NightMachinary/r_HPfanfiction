If you're just starting the second, you have a lot to look forward to.

A lot of people say that Stormlight is his greatest work and while fantastic, Mistborn will always be the series for me. Mistborn isn't over either, there is more on the way (although it's set later and follows different characters).

You should check out any and all of his other work, especially stuff within 'Cosmere', which essentially means it will be set in the same universe as Mistborn, each series will be on a different planet or in a different time but there is things that connect them, including certain characters that pop up in multiple series (including Mistborn, keep an eye out!)
