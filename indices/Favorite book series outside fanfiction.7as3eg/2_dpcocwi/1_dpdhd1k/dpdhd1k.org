Mistborn is amazing, the standalone (for now) novels like Elantris or Warbreaker are great. But his greatest work is The Stormlight Archives. The books are huge and it is quite slow at the beginning but oh boy is it worth it. It took me several weeks to finish part 1 of book 1, but for part 2 and the entirely of book 2, I could just not stop reading. Book 3 is out in a dozen of days and I cannot wait.
