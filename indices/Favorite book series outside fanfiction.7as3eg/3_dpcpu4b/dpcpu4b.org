I loved "His Dark Materials" (The trilogy that started with The Golden Compass) by Philip Pullman. I've heard it described as The Chronicles of Narnia, as written by an atheist - which I found to be pretty on point. Much less "follow the rules of God/Aslan", more figure things out yourself and from the people around you. Supposedly there's going to be a prequel series coming soon.

Also, the Culture novels by Iain M Banks - if I could choose a fictional universe to live in, this wins no question. The novels deal with a post-scarcity utopian society's interactions with their neighbors, who generally aren't. If you're into hard science fiction, I'd heavily recommend the series.
