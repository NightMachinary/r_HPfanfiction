Anything by Jim Butcher, his world building is truly amazing. Malazan Book Of The Fallen was also great, but its complexity works against it (you have to read the whole series in one go, because it's not told in a linear fashion and you'll be hopelessly lost if you leave it for a month or two and then try to continue)
