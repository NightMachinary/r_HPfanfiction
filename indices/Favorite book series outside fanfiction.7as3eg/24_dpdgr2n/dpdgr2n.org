The "Discworld" series by Terry Pratchett! It's definitely my favourite book series ever. Not all the books are equally good, but all of them contain at least one moment of pure brilliance. Pretty much anything by Pratchett is worth at least checking out; he has such a way with the English language. (The later books, which were written by dictation and text-to-speech programs because Pratchett was too ill to actually type anymore, are a little more rambly and not as consise... though these books work best as audiobooks, I find, especially if read by Stephen Briggs.)

"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The cornerstone of modern fantasy; this is where pretty much all the classic fantasy tropes comes from. And it STILL manages to play those tropes less straight than many of the imitators. The book isn't perfect; it's badly-structured, messily told, it often drags in the wrong places, the female characters aren't that impressive... but the world it creates is just so vast and engulfing and MAGICAL.

Tove Jansson's "Moomin" books are an old childhood favourite that I re.-read recently to find they were even better when i read them as an adult. Those books are just beautiful... not for their external action, but for the rich inner lives of the characters and the curious mix of melancholy and happy-go-luckiness. And occasionally they're just hilarious.

One of my very favourite stand-alone books: "Watership Down" by Richard Adams. Possibly better known as "that adult cartoon with the bleeding, dying rabbits that scared the crap out of children," but the book is so much more than that. It's an epic adventure story featuring wild rabbits in the main roles, which is a lot more awesome than it sounds.

Anything by Michael Ende. You know that movie, "The Neverending Story"? Yeah, that's essentially the first half of the book. The second half, after Bastian has saved Fantasia, that's when things REALLY GO TO HELL, and it's awesome.

I've had a lot of fun with the Metamor City podcast stories by Chris Lester too. Essentially, it's a "classic fantasy world in modern times, except magic has developed and grown stronger just as technology has." So you have computers and hovercars and airplanes along with wizards and elves and dragons and magical curses. Mind you, there's a lot of sex in these stories, and the author's transformation kinks and fetishes are pretty blatant... but the world is really well thought out, and the characters are good. I especially like the grouchy, snarky wizard who runs the magic shop "Spells 4 U."
