I like both modern fantasy, sci-fi, myths, and dramatizations of history. I confess I haven't read much fantasy recently, but I have enjoyed /Mistborn/ and the /Kingkiller Chronicles/ to an extent. I've also been reading the /Honor Harrington/ series. For myths and dramatizations of history, /Taiko/, about the Sengoku (Warring States) Era is fantastic, the ancient Chinese classic, /Romance of the Three Kingdoms/ is just as enjoyable as ever for me to read. For more Western myths, the /Four Branches of the Mabinogi/ is something I've just started and am enjoying.
