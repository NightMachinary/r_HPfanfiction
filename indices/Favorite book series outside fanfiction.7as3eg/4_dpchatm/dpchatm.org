The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini - Dragon riders, elves, and Doctor Who references oh my!

The Original Star Wars expanded universe: The Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zhan, The Corellian Trilogy, The Jedi Academy Trilogy, and so on.

My brother is a big fan of Mistborn.

The web serial Worm, which I'll admit I prefer the fanfiction to the canon.
