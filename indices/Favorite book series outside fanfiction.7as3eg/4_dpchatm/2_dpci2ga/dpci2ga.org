The Inheritance Cycle is basically just published fanfiction though. And most everyone enjoys Worm fanfiction because cool powers are cool, curbstomping and PHO reactions are fun, and despite what people may claim, grimdark can really wear on you.

Edit: Made clear that second sentence was referring to Worm, hence the mention of PHO, and the "cool powers are cool" refers to the popularity of Alt-powers.

Edit 2: Apparently I can screw up an edit, replaced a "Worm" with "PHO".
