  and despite what people may claim, grimdark can really wear on you

Yeah, I hate the sentiment that "only grimdark is good" - it's often said to be real, but reality isn't all bleak. Sometimes you want simply plain fun when reading, so with this I really agree with you.

Inheritance Cycle isn't /just/ fanfiction, Paolini has added loads of own material, and put a unique spin on a lot of things. Yes, it is less original than Star Wars was, or Harry Potter - but it still isn't quite in the realm of fanfiction.

  because cool powers are cool, curbstomping and PHO reactions are fun

And also, Eragon does have formidable opponents at times, the Shadow of the first book was quite scary when I read it the first time. It had its flaws, but I found it plenty scary when I first read the book (when I was 13 or 14), and even when I recently re-read it it wasn't that bad.

The end was a bit shitty, but it wasn't /as bad/ as you make it seem, even though the Inheritance Cycle is far from a flawless work. I think it's somewhere in the middle.
