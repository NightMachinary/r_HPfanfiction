Well shit now I want to read the third option that sounds incredible.

Actually all three are good and honestly this whole line of thought is much more interesting than mine. I'm imagining there's an explosion, like the one that destroyed Godric's Hollow, and Voldemort's shade attacks Harry - cue the actual final battle, which happens entirely in Harry's head. All the while, because the Horcrux connection is so unstable, Death is slowly but surely dragging Voldemort (and any attached bits) into the abyss. This manifests as a crumbling mind palace, slowly being eaten away. So Harry and Voldy are fighting each other while also trying to escape this disintegrating environment. Who comes out on top?

Goddamn.
