I think, that at the end (completely ignoring the boats metaphor) Voldemort could somehow feel that he's gonna die and using that â€˜rope' he would use it as the final battle ground and try to possess him for the last time but this time he just doesn't want to be a head in the back of the cranium he wants the full body for himself, so the souls fight to consume the other one, we're depending on the type of you rather is 3 options -Voldy wins, nothing more maybe gains his sanity back maybe he doesn't but has all of Harry's memories and knowledge -Harry wins, he keeps all of Tom memories, knowledge and parceltongue -Tie the consume so much of one another that he don't even know were Harry starts or Tom ends they were two souls and now they're one,Will he be Good? Bad? Gryffindor? Slytherin? What does he think about muggles, Kill them? Slave them? Ignore them? What's his future? Married to Ginny and Work as an Autor? Become the Emperor of Magical Britain? Solve the world's problems, Or destroy the world and recreate a new one better? Does wizard really need to live in Earth? Take the wizards off planet and become the Emperor?
