Well, clearly Harry may suffer some soul damage.

This will, of course result in some behavioral changes on Harry's part.

A loss of rhythm. Given Harry's extant dance skills, that will not probably be noticed.

A cheerful disposition, and a gravitation towards sales and marketing.

Snogging Ginny Weasley, taking up that offer to promote Firebolt in Wizarding Britain.

Shaking everyone's hands after the battle.

Except when you look into his eyes, there's just something subtly missing.

And a really severe reaction to Dementors. He's getting by with a broken soul, after all.
