The way I see it there's a few things that can happen in this scenario.

First is heavy but manageable damage to Harry's soul, with effects that either take a long time to heal or lead to a chronic condition of some kind. He's still who he is, damaged but alive.

Second option is irreparable, massive damage that can never be fixed, and would drastically affect him or his lifestyle. He loses his magic, he loses his sanity - something along those lines.

Third, Voldemort's dying soul drags Harry's down with it and they both die. Maybe Harry ends up in King's Cross and comes back - which would be the best case scenario.

Are there any fics that explore this concept?
