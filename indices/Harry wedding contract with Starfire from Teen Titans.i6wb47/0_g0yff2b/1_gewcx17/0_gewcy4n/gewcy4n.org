#+begin_quote
  Blackfire was about to arrange for her sister to marry an ugly swamp alien only for a contract to appear before her. After reading the contract she realizes she had no choice but to go along with this but she the groom was not what she expected. This is just a one shot. I do not own anything belonging to Harry Potter or DC Superheroes.
