I wish there were more fics involving James and Lily. I think this would've been interesting though probably impossible. Another way to make immortality happen that ain't a horcrux for Harry would be awesome. Bonus if they /all/ had something for immortality and Harry can bring his parents back. It'd be super funny if Harry is Dumbledore's champion, finds out his immortal, finds out his parents are immortal, decides to bring them back but to /show/ Dumbledore not /tell/ Dumbledore what he's doing, and have James and Lily be like “what are you talking about?! We follow Voldemort!” And show Harry their Dark Marks. Or something like that, haha!
