There was a lovely NextGen story, which I cannot find anywhere (please, help!), where Neville Longbottom was a professor at Hogwarts and his daughter, who grew up in the castle, knew every nook and cranny, ghosts told her bedtime fairy tales, turns out to be a squib. The story is how she struggles to be included into students of Hogwarts.
