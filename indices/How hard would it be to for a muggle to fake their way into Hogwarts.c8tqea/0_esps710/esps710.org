It would probably become very conspicuous that the kid doesn't ever cast any spells; honestly, I think a better bet would be to smuggle oneself into the Castle /without/ posing as a student --- to just set up camp in an abandoned classroom and just hide from everyone, blending into a crowd of student whenever it is necessary to pass through the more well-frequented halls and corridors. Hogwarts is already full of unexplained mysteries, Ghouls, Ghosts, Elves and assorted things that go bump in the night; I think you'd have a fair shot at successfully keeping beneath the Professors' notice. Especially if, after noticing you on the Marauder's Map, Fred and George decide to help you.
