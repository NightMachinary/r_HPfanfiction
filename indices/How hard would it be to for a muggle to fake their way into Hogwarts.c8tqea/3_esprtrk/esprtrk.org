The greatest challenge would be the classes that actually require using a wand. Those are Transfiguration, Charms and Defence. It's also indicated that Potions require the witch or wizard to perform magic of their own as well, hence Filch is incapable of brewing them. That's already more than half of the core classes. She'd be fine in Herbology, Astronomy and History of Magic though, which probably already earns her more OWLs than Goyle will ever get.
