The standard way this see to be played is 'muggle comes from a different universe and is thus immune to magic'. Seen that in a few fics.

I think fanon holds there is no way for muggles to end up at Hogwarts. I'm not sure I buy it: squibs have been to Hogwarts, and unless you want to classify 'non-magical wizard-born' separately, you could probably believably do something like this.

You would have to think up a reason they could bypass the protections...
