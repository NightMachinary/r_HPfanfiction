It would be impossible to fake being accepted- there's a magical book and quill that determines who can go to Hogwarts. Your name isn't in the books, you are not going.

To actually sneak in regardless I think would be equally impossible. Even if one managed to get on the train or get to the location, due to the enchantments around the school all they would see is old, abandoned, ruins in the middle of nowhere.

Getting past /that/ hurtle, I would suspect it would become fairly obvious when they can't fly a broom or perform any kind of magic in class. Even the most challenged wizards could do /something/ magical.
