I think she would still need some kind of magic to activate whatever spell or charm was on the object, unless you invented some kind of special charm a wizard/witch could give her that is completely self supporting. At that point the object would most likely only have a specific purpose and be limited. It being a new spell, may also open up possibilities for it malfunctioning.

I don't know what you could do about the ruins thing, unless she always wore special goggles or something? Maybe something another witch/Wizard was tinkering on? She could have swiped them?

Canonically though, there is no way around those charms from what I know. Unless the character has stronger magic than what cast those cloaking charms, which doesn't sound like a possibility.
