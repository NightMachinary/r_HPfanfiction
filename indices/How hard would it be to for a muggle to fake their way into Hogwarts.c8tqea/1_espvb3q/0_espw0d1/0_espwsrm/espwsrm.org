Probably not unless she has a source of magic from a bracelet so when she tries to perform spells, there's some sort of a response. That being said, unless you want to have your AU have some sort of lineage test that somehow she could pass, I'd have a hard time seeing her even getting through the sorting. I know you said that the hat doesn't care, but to me it would still matter, as her name wouldn't be on the roll and she'd need to explain that.
