I think there was once a Squib named Angus Buchanan that tried to fake his way in, but the hat caught him and refused to sort him. He couldn't see the castle and had no magic of his own, so he'd been faking having magic for months before this so his family wouldn't catch on. His older brother flew him to the school on a broom since he wouldn't have been able to make it through the barrier to the train.
