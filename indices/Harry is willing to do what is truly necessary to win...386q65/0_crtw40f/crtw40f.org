the fic that immediately came to my mind was [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets]] by Vorabiza. Warning though, this story is slash. Otherwise it is definitely over 60k and complete. It's basically an alternative for Deathly Hollows and starts post-HBP. It features Harry taking charge and making some hard choices and compromises, having to deal with everything from a baby to the minister of magic, resorting to blackmail and killing curses, and keeping secrets from just about everyone in order to win the war and kill Voldemort. He uses both his Gryffindor and Slytherin sides and eventually does lead the light side and the Order as well.
