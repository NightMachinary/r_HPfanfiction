Interesting, but sadly i'm more leaning into seeing how a Harry Potter could change with such elements, because it's always godlike power without a cost, in these stories I want to see unkillable monster Harry, but it actually extracts a cost, like drinking blood, insanity, or eating people to further expand on my post.
