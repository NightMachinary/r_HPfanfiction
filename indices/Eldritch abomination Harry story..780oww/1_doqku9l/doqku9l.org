There's a HP/Dresden crossover where Harry is literally an eldritch abomination. It takes place in the Dresden world, where some warlocks try to summon an /Outsider/ and MoD!Harry appearing is the result. In the form of the Hogwarts express. With tentacles. He basically slaughters all of the warlocks and then some other stuff happens.

Unfortunately I can't remember the title or the author. I think he posted it on DLP as well as FFN.
