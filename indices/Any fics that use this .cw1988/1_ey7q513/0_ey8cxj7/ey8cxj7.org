It's mentioned in the books that he was the only applicant that year.

For year 3 we get Lupin, who was probably only convinced to take the position because Black escaped.

Year 4 we have Moody who probably did it as a personal favor to Dumbledore and to be there as extra security with the triwizard cup going on.

Then we have year 5 in which it was mentioned that Dolores was appointed the position by the ministry because a newly passed law allowed them to if there were no applicants available to fill the position. This is referenced again when Trelawny gets fired and Dumbledore was able to hire Firenze on the spot before Umbridge could fill the position with another ministry lackey.

Overall, the mention in book two, along with the inference from book 5, shows that the position has been basically unfillable for years. It got to the point where politically, the ministry knew it could get someone on the inside of Hogwarts immediately if they passed a law that granted them the ability to appoint a person if the situation came up that the headmaster couldn't fill the position himself.
