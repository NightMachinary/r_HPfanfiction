Doubt it.

Remember that the use of an Unforgivable back then was a free ride to Azkaban right away.

and unless we are talking about a really unhinged or DarkPleb Potter its unrealistic to attack Snape with an Unforgivable Curse.

Anyways, the Canon delivers the information on how to cast the Unforgivables aswell as the requirement for the Cruciatus (Bellatrix said you must WANT to cause the pain) in Book 5 while in Book 4 Moody shows the Unforgivables in action - that includes probably the wand movements, if there are any.
