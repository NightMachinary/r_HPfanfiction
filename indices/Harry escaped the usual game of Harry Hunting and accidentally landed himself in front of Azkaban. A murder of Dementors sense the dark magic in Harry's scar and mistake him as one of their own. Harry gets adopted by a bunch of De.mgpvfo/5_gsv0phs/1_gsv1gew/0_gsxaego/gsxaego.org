Thanks! I have a few ideas to play around with. I was having trouble deciding if a dementor raised Harry would be a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff. I'm leaning Hufflepuff because I think he would be very loyal to his half insane godfather and the family that took him in. But hanging around Sirius might give him the push to Gryffindor.

As much fun as Ravenclaw and Slytherin Harry can be, I don't see a dementor raised Harry getting sorted into either house.
