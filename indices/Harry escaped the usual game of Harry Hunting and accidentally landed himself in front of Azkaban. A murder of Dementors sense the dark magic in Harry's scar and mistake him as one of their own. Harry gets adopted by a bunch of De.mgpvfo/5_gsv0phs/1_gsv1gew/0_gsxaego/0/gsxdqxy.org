I'm also leaning towards Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is said to be the most inclusive and patient of all houses and it would have great appeal to Harry, given that many people would label him mad for his ragtag family.

I think the Dementors and Sirius (also a few other inmates) would bring the nurturing side of him to the forefront. Like befriending the house elves and asking them if he could send the leftover food to Azkaban, learning how to knit from Molly so that his family has some warm clothes, etc.
