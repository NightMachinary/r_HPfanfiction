Harry looked around as he followed the new person down the hall. He had heard of prison. Uncle Vernon always told him it was where he would end up. It didn't look like a fun place. They passed many doors made of bars and through them Harry could see other people. Some were screaming. Some were sleeping. None of them paid attention to Harry.

Harry figured the person in front must be a guard here. He was able to open the doors and go where he wanted. So Harry followed his guard and tried to remember the twists and turns of where they were going.

It wasn't long before Harry was led into a room with hundreds of people dressed as his guard was. His guard gestured to the center of the room. Harry just wished someone would say something, but maybe these people didn't talk to freaks. Maybe this was a prison for freaks. Harry stood where his guard pointed to. After a few moments his guard made another deep rattling breath again. The others must have understood something Harry didn't. They were tilting their heads and looking around.

A rattling noise started to fill the room. The small boy stood in the center of 764 dementors as they all struggled to breath. Harry wondered if they might have asthma like that kid from his school. He didn't like being the center of at attention but he supposed it was better in here than out there. The screaming was starting to get loud and Harry was worried about what would happen to him.

The noise died down after a few minutes. The guards were looking at each other. One of the guards stepped into the center of the room with Harry. He wasn't sure, but he thought this one might be a woman. She was slightly shorter than his other guard and slightly slimmer. It was hard to tell since they all looked so much a like with their black dresses and hoods.

The woman approached him and lowered her hood. Harry flinched and choked down scream. The woman didn't have a nose!. Or eyes! Just a large mouth. Years with the Dursleys had taught the boy running from adults would just make things worse. So he stayed still, staring at the woman as she drew closer. When she was right in front of the boy she picked him up. She wasn't rough like Uncle Vernon, but she wasn't gentle either. Harry tried not to fidget as she brought him up to her face. Harry grimaced a little hoping he wasn't going to be shouted at, but to his surprise. She kissed him.

Harry had never had a kiss before so he had nothing to compare it to, but her mouth was on his. He felt a sucking sensation. Was he supposed to do that too? Harry took a deep breath against the sucking. And just like that the kiss ended. Harry was dropped to the floor as the woman flinched away. Tears came to his eyes. She must have figured out he was a freak after all. The kiss wasn't especially good, but no one had done it before. It reminded Harry of last Christmas when Uncle Vernon got Harry a pair of new socks. Something that was all his, but after Harry thanked him the lights on the tree burned bright and went out, so Uncle Vernon took his present away and threw them out. He spent the rest of the holidays in his cupboard.

Harry wasn't sure what was happening, but the guards seemed worried. They were moving about erratically leaving Harry and the woman who kissed him in the center of the room. After a few minutes Harry felt his eyes droop and he yawned wide. All the movement stopped.

The woman who kissed him gestured for him to follow as she left the room. She brought Harry to a room like all the others and pointed to a bed against the wall. The boy beamed. They were allowing him to sleep in an actual bed. The Dursleys never did that. The woman stood in a corner watching him. And Harry crawled into bed with a blissful sigh, it was like sleeping on a cloud.

It wasn't long before the boy was fast asleep, His nights were usually filled with nightmares that woke him several times through the night, but tonight he would sleep all the way through. Instead of green lights and screams, instead of loneliness and pain, Harry dreamed of a motorcycle. A flying one. The laughing man was taking him flying on a motorcycle. It was the best dream he had ever had.

(It is 330 and I was having trouble falling back to sleep, so here is the next part.)
