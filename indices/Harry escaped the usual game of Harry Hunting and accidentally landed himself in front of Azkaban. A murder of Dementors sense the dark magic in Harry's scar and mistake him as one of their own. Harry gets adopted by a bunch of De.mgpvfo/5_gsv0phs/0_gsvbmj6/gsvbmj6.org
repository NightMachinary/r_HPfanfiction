Harry was confused. It had been a pretty normal day until now. He had managed to escape Dudley on the play ground, but when he jumped behind the dumpster he wound up in a small room. He didn't know there was a room behind the dumpster, he looked around the room. It was dark and a little smelly. The laughing man in the corner was wearing rags like he was. Maybe this was a room for freaks. Harry had never met another freak. As he searched the room Harry noticed he couldn't see the dumpster anymore. There was just 4 walls and a door made of metal bars.

Maybe he hit his head jumping and passed out. He didn't remember being unconscious, but he sometimes got confused if one of his relatives hit him in the head, so it wouldn't be unusual for that to happen. Maybe the laughing man knew where they were. Harry bit his lip, he knew he wasn't allowed to ask questions, but he really didn't like not knowing what was happening. Especially if there wasn't a way out. Harry decided he would have to chance it.

"Excuse me, sir?" He probed shyly. The man's laughter slowly died as it became a dark chuckle. Harry felt a shiver go down his spine, the man looked dangerous, but for some reason Harry didn't feel afraid of him. The man reminded Harry of someone, but he didn't know who. The man ignored Harry as he began mumbling to himself.

"Great Merlin, it speaks too. How long have I been in here?" Harry froze. He didn't like it when he was called an it. He may have been a freak, but he was still a boy. The man's words stopped him from commenting though. It must be a rule that he shouldn't speak. Unsure of what he should do, he stared at the man instead waiting for instructions.

The laughing man had stopped laughing now. He looked like he was going to cry, but Harry still wasn't sure what to do.

"I'm sorry James. It was all my fault. And now you are dead and I'm in prison slowly going insane." The man laughed again and a second later a dog was in his spot. The dog circled himself three times before it fell to the ground with a flop and seemed to fall asleep in the corner.

Harry was stuned. A man just turned into a dog. Did he do that? He had done some freaky things before, but never anything like that. He looked around fearfully, Harry didn't want to get in trouble for being a freak when he didn't even know where he was. Wait, prison! Did he just say prison? Was Harry in prison?! What did Dudley do to get Harry sent here? Or maybe Harry did something. He may have just turned a man into a dog. It wouldn't be that big of a stretch that he did something freakish enough to end up here.

Harry sat in the opposite corner of the dog and hugged his knees to his chest. He tried to remember what happened, but the last thing he knew he was running away from dudley and jumped behind a garbage bin. He couldn't think of anything else.

Harry sat patiently in his corner as he waited for someone to tell him what to do or what happened. After a few hours the dog remained asleep but the door was opening. Harry stood at attention as soon as he heard the door open. Uncle Vernon always complained he was being lazy or disrespectful if he was sitting down. And Harry didn't want whoever came in to think of him as that.

A moment later a tall man in a cloak glided into the room. At least Harry thought it was a man. He supposed it could be a woman, that would explain why they were wearing a hooded dress.

Harry had so many questions, but the man earlier seemed mad that he talked. He didn't want to make anyone else mad. Whoever it was took a deep rattling breath and the room felt a little colder. A sliggt shiver ran down Harry's spine and his breath turned to fog. It wasn't too bad. A lot better than when Aunt Petunia sent him out to shovel the snow off the walk without a coat.

The person tilted their head as they looked at Harry. After giving a few more deep breaths the person pointed at Harry and beckoned him over to follow them. Harry complied taking one last look at the dog in the corner as he was led out.
