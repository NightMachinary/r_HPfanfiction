That would be amusing.

Imagine Sirius having a near heart attack from seeing little Harry prancing around the halls of Azkaban. And further questioning his own sanity when Harry told him that the Dementors adopted him.

Also, the Dementors are very good at hiding Harry from the guards of Azkaban. The prisoners won't snitch, because Harry distracts the eldritch horrors attention away from them.

Harry's whereabout is only known when his Hogwarts letter arrived at Azkaban. It's most scandalous.
