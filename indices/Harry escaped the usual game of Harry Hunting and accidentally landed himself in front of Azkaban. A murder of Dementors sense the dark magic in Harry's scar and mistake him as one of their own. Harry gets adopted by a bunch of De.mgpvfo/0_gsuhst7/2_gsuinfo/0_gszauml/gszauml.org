"Hey Harry, you left your Potions textbook at the castle. We had to be in the area, so I told the girls I'd drop it off before you got to school. Have a good year, dearest!" the Dementor (bizarrely) said cheerfully. Harry smiled at her/it, ignoring the shocked expressions of his companions with an ease born of practice. "Merci, Cher. Bon soir!" Harry said, reaching up to embrace the demon. Then, further shocking his compartment mates, he kissed her once on each cheek, and she reciprocated. "Cher" left the compartment and the train, the lamps relighting as she and her fellow guards left. Beaming, Harry turned towards the new Defense professor, who was gaping unabashedly. "What?" Harry demanded, "She's French. It's what they do.".

"Oh. Yes. I see." Remus managed. Ron patted him on the shoulder. "Don't worry, sir. I had a similar reaction. I think everyone reacts that way, actually." Ron said, cocking his head in contemplation. "Right... I'm going to have a word with the engineer. I'll be back." Remus said, shaking his head. "And I'll see if the trolley lady has firewhiskey..." he muttered soto voice.
