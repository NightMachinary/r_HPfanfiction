Dementors were magical, how could they not be? The origins of these magical creatures were unknown however. Theory's have been speculated through out time but never confirmed.

However, they knew their truth.

They we created by death. Soldiers that he crafted to search for the last brother holding his Hallow. Though they never did find him, they were there when he came to Death. Death had praised the man, he had a great deal of respect for his cunningness and bravery. The man had sent Death quite a few corrupted souls so in thanks a bond was born.

The dementors protected over the Pervell line. They worked together to find the individuals who corrupted the laws of nature.

None of the Pervells ever felt the effects of the dementors. They understood each other's language and shared their abilities. The Pervells were the only wizards with the shadow abilities. They were also the only ones who could quell the dementors hunger. Their magic and very essence satisfied their needs.

When Harry Potter, the last descendant of the Pervells, stumbled onto the rocks of Azkaban from the shadows; the dementors flocked to them. A buzzing sensation bounces through them as they saw their partner. Their supporter.

Their friend.

Harry, curious of the flying creatures, tried to listen to as many of them as he could. Names, greetings, and questions were all thrown at him. One must have noticed the overwhelming look and brought a quietness to the night.

An introduction was made. An explanation followed. Then came questions. It wasn't long until they ended up outside a cell on the seventh floor.

'An innocent man resides here. He will help you.' It whispered to him. 'If we had the authority to free the wronged, we would.'

They walked into the cell. A man was starring out the window, his eyes glazed and his mouth slightly agape. Hearing the rustling of fabric, he turned to look at them.

'He never does well on full moons,' the creature informed.

"Why not?" Harry asked back watching the man walk over to them.

'One of his best friends is a werewolf. He wishes he could take care of him.' Harry nodded, not quite understanding but accepting the answer.

The prisoner had a tattered jumpsuit on and wild hair, Harry noted looking at the man. His beard was uneven and there were scratches all over his arms and face. His breath was foul and his gaze went through Harry.

A hand came towards Harry's face and he just watched him. It ghosted over him before suddenly resting on his cheek. The man stiffened.

Then screamed.

He tripped backwards starring at the boy who jumped in surprise. It took a minute for any of them to get there bareings.

"Why'd he scream?" Harry asked looking up and past the dementors cloak.

'He probably thought you were a figment of his imagination. It happens to those exposed to our presence too long.'

"Harry?" Sirius mumbled astonished. "How are you here?"

"I shadow walked." Harry responded, pleased with himself.

"Oh god, not this shit again."
