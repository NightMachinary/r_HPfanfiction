They don't have young. They grow in dark places like fungi. It's probably asexual reproduction, I think. Or maybe they're remnants of broken souls. Dementors were first found on Azkaban island after the death of the dark wizard Ekrizdis, who had warded the island to hell and back. He trapped and tortured muggle sailors. And when he died, the wards broke. And the island was found. And so were the dementors. It's my theory that the dementors are those tortured souls, or remnants, at least. And they're searching for their souls for the rest of eternity. And they eat other souls to maybe try to find some peace and happiness in their eternal torture. But that's just a theory.... A /book/ theory! [Cue Matpat's theme song]
