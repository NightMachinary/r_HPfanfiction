No I meant when you said

/'Lupin steps in front of Harry for fear his Boggart will be Voldemort, when he should be stepping in front of Ginny so the rest of the class doesn't see 16 year old Tom Riddle'/

Harry would be expected to see Voldemort, and if we take the fact Ginny'll see Tom, then I get why Lupin shielded Harry. To the class, Voldemort is far scarier than Tom Riddle (especially since they didn't know who he was)
