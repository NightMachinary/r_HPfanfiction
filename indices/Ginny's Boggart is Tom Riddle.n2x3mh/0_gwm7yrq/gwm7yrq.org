I'm more interested in knowing what form Ginny makes her boggart turn to. I think she might anticipate it being Tom, so she'd be prepared enough to shut him up quickly before he says much. I just want to know what he turns into.

Does he turn back to a diary? Does he change into a clown suit? Does she dress him in drag like Neville did to Snape?
