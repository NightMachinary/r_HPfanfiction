Ginny's Boggart was never shown in Canon, but I personally don't think that it would truly take the appearance of a Young Tom Riddle.

First of all, even if Ginny's worst fear being likely to be linked to the events of the Chamber of Secrets, it is not confirmed and children can sometimes have irrational fear. By the time they were confronted with their Boggart, both Ron and Hermione had lived very traumatic experiences (the Troll, Fluffy, Ron's sacrifice, the Whipping Willow . . .), and yet both of their worst fear were pretty . . . trivial in comparison. Hermione was just afraid to fail her exams (though some theories say that it was a representation of her wear to not be good enough, to never fit in the magical world), and Ron was afraid of spider (not even because he ended up in the middle of an Acromantula den the year before, but because of a stupid jokes his brother did years prior).\\
Ginny might as well a completely different "worst fear", like an Hag just because some cousin told her a very scary story when she was 3 or 4.

I am also not sure that Ginny ever saw the true appearance of Tom Riddle. I don't think Tom had any reason to show her a memory like he did with Harry, and in the Chamber he only got a physical body after Ginny was unconscious. So even if Ginny's worst fear was truly linked with the Chamber, I believe her Boggart would take a different appearance.\\
I could see her Boggart taking her own appearance. just like she was possessed. Or maybe the cabinet would open, only to reveal a simple black notebook.

And concerning Lupin's actions during the class, of only stepping in when it was Harry's turn, I think it was (kinda) justified.\\
From the start I am not convinced that showing everyone worst fear is really a good idea. I get that it's important to teach children how to fight their fears but kid are also little shit that could try to use this knowledge against each other. But in every case Harry Potter is a special case.\\
In Fanon, it's common to present Theodore Nott as an abused child, whose worst fear in his own father. But even if it would be very embarassing for Theodore to have his fear revealed, it would only affect him. And the same things would apply to everyone else. If Ginny's boggart was Tom Riddle, the other children would see an attractive teen goes out of the cabinet and be confused. In comparaison, Harry's worst fear was (believed to be) Voldemort. Voldemort going out the closet would have meant and terrified class with a lot of teens trying to escape, it would probably have been a lot worse than any other fear, no matter what people may have thought of the class.
