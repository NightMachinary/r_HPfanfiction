  From the start I am not convinced that showing everyone worst fear is really a good idea. I get that it's important to teach children how to fight their fears but kid are also little shit that could try to use this knowledge against each other

Definitely agree. We see this in canon even with both teachers and students. Apparently Snape is even more vicious towards Neville after that class, and Malfoy was already taunting Harry over his fear of the Dementors.

Exposing a classroom of 13 year olds to the thing they're most terrified of seems like a bad idea full stop. A recipe for a classroom of traumatized 13 year olds
