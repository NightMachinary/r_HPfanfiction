honestly, the more I think about it, the more Lupin's boggart just seems irresponsible. Yeah, sure, I mean everybody loved it... but it's like a bit of an invasion of privacy to have your deepest fears shown to everybody in class.

And it's not like Harry is the only kid with cause to be traumatized. Just the year before, the basilisk attacked at least two third years. Hermione of course conveniently wasn't traumatized by the basilisk...but what about Justin? In hindsight, the fact that Neville fears Snape more than being tortured to insanity by Bellatrix and her posse was probably lucky for Lupin. And then there are all these death eater kids... who I'm not saying they necessarily suffered any trauma from that, but if they know about it, would it be so farfetched, to assume, that their biggest fear would be for their parent's death eater activities to come to light...so they probably wouldn't want that to be seen by everybody in the entire class.
