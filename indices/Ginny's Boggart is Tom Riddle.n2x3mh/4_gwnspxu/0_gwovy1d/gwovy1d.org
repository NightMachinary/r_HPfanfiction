Oh it completely seems irresponsible! Harry's class is the first class not born during a full scale war, they lived during the aftermath. What does he imagine the greatest fears of some of the older 7th years are? Their parents dead/tortured? Themselves?

Like you said, it just seems lucky that Neville was more afraid of Snape than being tortured to insanity by Lestrange.

Even as a normal, untraumatized child facing my greatest fear is not something I could handle at 13. The logical outcome seems to be a classroom of terrified, sobbing children that couldn't make their deepest fears funny on command.
