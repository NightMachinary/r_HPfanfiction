Ginny wasn't in Harry's class, as she was a year younger. We don't know if any students other than third years got to face the boggart.

In Calibration by TheDivineComedian, we see Lupin training the boggart to keep it child-friendly, which doesn't exactly fit with his canon fear of Harry turning it into Voldemort, but would have been a nice thing to do.
