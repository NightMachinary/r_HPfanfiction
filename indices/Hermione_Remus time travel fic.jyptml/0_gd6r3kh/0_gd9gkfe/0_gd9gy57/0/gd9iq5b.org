Yes! It does have Harry x Sirius which sort of seems to be the focus, but Hermione and Remus get a lot of development.

The fic deals with the logistics of Harry and Hermione being in the past and how they deal with it/ what they do, and all of the drama that ensues.

Also, Harry and Hermione are BAMF and pretty experienced because they're from after the war, so that's good. It's just really well written and very interesting.

(This is all probably in the summary/tags, but yeah.)
