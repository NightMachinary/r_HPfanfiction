It sounds really familiar to me, but in my time-travel phase I mostly read Hermione/Sirius, so it's very possible that I'm mixing my stories up. I found three stories I've saved that are Hermione/Remus timetravel, and they appear to be from around 2016. Unfortunately I can't remember much about them anymore. The first one says it's inspired by a ffn story, but it seems to have Harry as another timetravelling mc with Hermione, so that might not be right? I'll link them in case it's one of these.
