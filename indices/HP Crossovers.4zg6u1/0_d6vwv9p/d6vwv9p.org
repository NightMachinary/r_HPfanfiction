linkffn(3983128) - A crossover with Iain M. Banks' /Culture/ universe.

I usually have limited enthusiasm for crossovers, but I'll make an exception for this one. Very well written. A decently done Dumbledore and the smug arrogance of the Culture is nicely captured.

Unfortunately a deadfic. But what's there is at least entertaining.
