linkffn(7849109)- I'm not usually a big fan of slash, but I really like this story. Xmen/HP crossover that's long and not just a rehash of either universe. And it's active as of April 22.. isn't that nice? While HP begins wildly damaged and OOC, if you continue reading, there IS HOPE for his character to grow/develop to become more like the HP we know and love (maybe stronger too for his experiences). This is possibly the thing that keeps me hooked on this story.
