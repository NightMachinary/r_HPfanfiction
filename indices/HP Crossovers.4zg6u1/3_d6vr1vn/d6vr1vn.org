Using the search bar is your friend for most [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=Crossovers&restrict_sr=on][HP crossovers.]]

For Atla: I would suggest linkffn(Embers by Vathara). Zuko and Iroh centric that would literally replace half of book 2 and everything of book 3. It is a grounded version of the series that centers with the concept of consequences.

Edit: Would also add linkffn(Uchiha Fukurou;Ninja Who Lived) for Hp/naruto fics. Both are reincarnation fics.
