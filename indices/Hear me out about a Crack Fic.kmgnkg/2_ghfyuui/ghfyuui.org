He would know all the important plot details needed like Horcruxes, death eater names .. etc if he read the books which he would have for the movies and then it will be a massive info dump. I always felt the summoning of HPs from alternate dimensions to be a bit iffy ... they are basically depriving the guy of all he knows .. what if their savior has family depending on him in his dimension, they basically killed them as far as he is concerned as they can't meet him and he can't meet them anymore and wouldn't they go to alternate options like hiring mercenaries or begging for ICW assistance or something, we know from Dumbles fighting his boy friend in Europe that there are ways to involve foreign figures in a country's struggles .. anyway here I am using logic in wizarding matters!
