  I can't see how they wouldn't apply to wizards.
#+end_quote

If the Squib OC's father keeps his weapons in the wizarding world, then the Muggle authorities wouldn't even know of them to begin with. So the laws may not be applicable to wizards based on context and how the weapons are used or located. And would the wizarding authorities even care that this character owns such weapons? As long as those things got the job done without too much trouble and a protracted conflict is avoided, probably not. Once again, why would wizarding authorities even enforce Muggle gun legislation? As long as the Squib OC's father isn't going around shooting random wizards like those deranged spree shooters or planning some sort of mass shooting or terrorist attack, I can't see the wizarding community batting an eye at his weapons ownership. Furthermore, the character was once an Auror, essentially a wizard cop, so it cannot be strictly said that he is/was a "civilian".

  Muggle police absolutely would have the power to arrest him, and the sentencing would be pretty harsh.
#+end_quote

But they can't arrest him, since he can simply stun them, wipe their memories so they wouldn't even know he committed an offense and thus wouldn't even know to arrest him, and he can also simply Disapparate to escape them completely. And it's not just him. Any wizard with a decent amount of skill can do any or all of these things to Muggle police that try to arrest them. And that doesn't get into the fact that the Squib OC's uncle can bust him out of any potential confinement with relative ease. Why do you think Muggle police never managed to arrest any Death Eaters despite their atrocities against Muggles? Because they can do all of what I just described in the first sentence AND they won't have any qualms about using Unforgivable Curses against Muggle police that try to arrest them.

  Guns, especially handguns, are illegal within Britain. Nobody owns a gun. You can't even legally buy any type of handgun.
#+end_quote

Which is why the Squib OC's father has various ways to acquire such. Guns may be illegal in /Muggle Britain/, but are they illegal in /wizarding Britain/? Absent of a statement from Rowling, this cannot be definitively stated. It is already clear that laws are not the same between Muggle and wizarding jurisdictions in the same country.

  Drop the idea, it wouldn't work in Britain. They're not a part of the culture like they are in the states.
#+end_quote

I will not drop the idea without a reasonable cause. Since they are not part of the culture, that's why everyone else isn't packing such weapons. It's just the one guy. As for it "not working", that really depends on the context. The fictional world is not a one-for-one equivalent to how things are in real life.

  Please don't try to shove American norms on Britain.
#+end_quote

If I was "shoving norms", then everyone in the story with the inclination would be packing firearms, which is clearly not the case, so it can be hardly called a "norm". Once again, it's just one guy. One guy doing something does not make it a "norm". I highlighted that the character's Muggle attachments (which is a byproduct of his upbringing) even makes him be seen as weird by his wizarding peers, so that inherently bucks the notion that his behavior is a "norm".

  It doesn't work and it makes your writing terrible.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. The Britain that Rowling wrote in HP canon is clearly distinct in some ways from the Britain in real life. So she took some liberties there. Does that automatically make her writing terrible? No. So automatically saying "it doesn't work" is patently untrue.
