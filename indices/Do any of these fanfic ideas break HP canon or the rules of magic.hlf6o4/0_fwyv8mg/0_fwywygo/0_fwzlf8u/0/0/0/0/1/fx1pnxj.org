I did ask for opinions, but the wording and attitude behind them is also vital. When giving an opinion, I don't advocate for people to out and out drop their ideas but suggest how it can best be integrated into the story in as close to the original spirit of it as possible. I also don't go around and say that inclusion of a seemingly "bad" idea automatically equals bad writing or a bad reception from the readers, because that simply is not always the case, and I've seen many stories that are examples of this.

In the context of the Calamity, the gun idea is hardly ridiculous. Without spoiling too much, it is a subtle hint as to the impact of the Calamity. Fact of the matter is, the Calamity is a serious mutilation of the time-space continuum, and the story explores its effects on society and also the fabric of reality. The Squib OC's uncle sees his brother with a gun and no one bats an eye at it, even in a region where this /should/ be the case. Why?

In part because it is a symptom of the damage caused by the Calamity on time and space. It is a dead giveaway that the Calamity is having a more serious effect on the time-space continuum than most in the know suspected. And one of the few who picks up on this is the character's brother. Admittedly, the twist and a few other deliberate incongruities from the research I did was the point all along, and garnered the approval of my British friends. That aside, is it your choice and that of anyone else on here to read the story or not. I am not dropping the gun idea.
