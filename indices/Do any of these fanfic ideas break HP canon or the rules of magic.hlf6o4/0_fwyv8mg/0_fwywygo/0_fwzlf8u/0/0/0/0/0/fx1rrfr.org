That said, since the story does deal with time and space being mutilated, I do note that it might be a little more prudent to point out that certain deviations from real life British culture (such as the gun idea) are due to the effects of the Calamity on the fabric of reality. However, doing so entails some spoilers and I obviously don't want to divulge major plot elements. But that said, I did do the research and did consider that the deviations were necessary owing to the subject matter of the severity of temporal and spacial warping on reality and how it affects perception.
