  Guns and weaponry are not viewed with the glamour they are in the states. If you are writing about something set in another country, do some basic bloody research. Guns are vulgar, ugly things. No one uses them except the violent underclass who get them illegally.
#+end_quote

There is no glamour to be viewed here. The character is actually quite pacifistic. I think the thing that matters is his attitude towards the weapon and owning and using it. If he treats the thing with a certain gravitas or admits that he hates holding it but accepts it as a necessary evil on balance of probabilities, that's hardly glamorizing. Wielding a gun or sword does not make it glamorous since individual views on the wielder's part do matter.

  Please research the UK and British culture. You are absolutely shoving American norms onto the US if you insist on your character using guns.
#+end_quote

I've done the research, and decided that this was an acceptable deviation, considering the cultural differences between Muggles and wizards and how the latter group generally underestimates and looks down on Muggle technology. It's not a "norm" if it's one guy. A norm is by definition something usual and expected, but one guy bucking a trend or even being seen as odd due to his behavior does not make a norm. So I am absolutely not shoving American norms into Britain.

  Drop it. It doesn't work over here. In Britain, we police by consent. It's a point of national pride that the police are not routinely armed. Nobody carries guns. Even in massively rough areas of Manchester, your average criminal doesn't carry a gun. A knife, yes, but not a gun.
#+end_quote

I will /not/ drop it without reasonable cause, and simply saying "drop it" is not convincing. Once again, what you are describing is something that Muggles observe. And it is an evident point that Muggle and wizarding culture possess distinct differences, even in the same country. It may not "work" in a Muggle setting, but it is not definitive that it will not "work" in a wizarding one.

  Want him to have a weapon that would be vaguely convincing? Try a longbow. They're significantly more traditional and less American. Not a gun. Not a taser. It would also be vaguely interesting, unlike some poor quality story by American that turns people into gun toting idiots.
#+end_quote

Funny thing is, I'm not American. And the story does not turn people in "gun toting idiots", given that the one guy with the weapon is actually intelligent enough to be a "Muggle enhanced" Auror, so he's hardly an "idiot". You don't see that many such individuals simply because most wizards are ignorant of or underestimate Muggle technology. But I daresay that if someone like an Auror is well-versed in Muggle tech and weaponry and can make bombs or biological weapons, then he is very intelligent indeed. Such people are actually quite dangerous. To say that a story is "poor quality" on scant basis is premature and not strictly applicable to the scenario at hand.

  If you insist on a gun, a shotgun is significantly more convincing. They are technically still legal, but mostly owned by old farmer types. You would struggle to find anyone who owned one in the city, for example.
#+end_quote

Convincing? The premise of HP is not a convincing one to be frank, and neither is most fantasy or magic fiction. One man who owns a gun is not going to break the story. I'm far more concerned about the abilities of his brother doing that, to be frank.

#+begin_quote
  If your character is supposed to be ex police, or dual trained with the police and aurors, he would have had little to no firearms training.
#+end_quote

The character was an Auror, but picked up an assortment of Muggle skills such as the knowledge of how to use a gun, through his upbringing, since he has deep attachments to both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. It's simply an aspect of how this rich family raises its young. The family is just generally well-versed in Muggle workings since they have a significant number of Muggle and Squib members.

  If you insist on shoving American gun culture into a story about British characters, your writing will be terrible and the story will be unreadable to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of Britain. Drop the gun idea.
#+end_quote

If it's one guy who used a gun back when he was in wizard law enforcement and is now retired, but still kept his weapons around, then I think it's fine. It's on the whole a small aspect of the story anyway and he's not going to be going around packing that sort of heat until shit really hits the fan later on down the road in the story. Therefore, I daresay I am not shoving a "culture" in the story since once again, not every Tom, Dick, and Harry is packing such heat. It is premature to say that the writing is terrible without context or reading any actual parts of the story. And to be frank, my British friends have no issue with this anyway, and they have more than a passing knowledge of the country. So to say that it will be unreadable to any British person is patently untrue. Once again, I am not dropping the idea without reasonable cause.
