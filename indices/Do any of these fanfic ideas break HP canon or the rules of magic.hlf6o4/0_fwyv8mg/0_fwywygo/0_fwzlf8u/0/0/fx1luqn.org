Guns and weaponry are not viewed with the glamour they are in the states. If you are writing about something set in another country, do some basic bloody research. Guns are vulgar, ugly things. No one uses them except the violent underclass who get them illegally.

Please research the UK and British culture. You are absolutely shoving American norms onto the US if you insist on your character using guns. Drop it. It doesn't work over here. In Britain, we police by consent. It's a point of national pride that the police are not routinely armed. Nobody carries guns. Even in massively rough areas of Manchester, your average criminal doesn't carry a gun. A knife, yes, but not a gun.

Want him to have a weapon that would be vaguely convincing? Try a longbow. They're significantly more traditional and less American. Not a gun. Not a taser. It would also be vaguely interesting, unlike some poor quality story by American that turns people into gun toting idiots.

If you insist on a gun, a shotgun is significantly more convincing. They are technically still legal, but mostly owned by old farmer types. You would struggle to find anyone who owned one in the city, for example.

If your character is supposed to be ex police, or dual trained with the police and aurors, he would have had little to no firearms training.

If you insist on shoving American gun culture into a story about British characters, your writing will be terrible and the story will be unreadable to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of Britain. Drop the gun idea.
