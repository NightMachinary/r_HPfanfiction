This may be true where Muggles in Britain are concerned, but I would wonder if those rules apply to wizards. If a wizard got a hold of a firearm and stayed within the wizarding community out of sight of Muggles, would most wizards even notice or care? Would the wizarding world even be bothered to enforce gun legislation passed by Muggle governments in the country? Given that most wizards are ignorant of Muggle technology or actively look down on and underestimate it, I don't believe that they'd really bat an eye at it. The same argument goes for the taser. It seems unlikely that the wizarding community would care about the Squib OC's father owning and using one if it got the job done in his capacity as an Auror and he kept it out of the Muggle world.

In story, the Squib OC's father used a firearm simply because it was faster to draw and fire one versus having to flick out a wand and chant an incantation and use a hand gesture to perform a spell. He also is very aware that most wizards know nothing of firearms so it's an easy and obvious way to catch people off guard in combat. He may be aware that he is actively flouting gun and weapons legislation in the UK by using firearms or tasers, but then again, as a wizard, no Muggle cop can arrest him, and he could simply erase the memory of any Muggle who sees him using these things.
