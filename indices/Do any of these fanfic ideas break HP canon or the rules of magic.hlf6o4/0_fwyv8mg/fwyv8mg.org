If you're setting this in Britain, drop the weaponry. Police aren't routinely armed and they're never allowed to keep their firearm when retired. Handguns have also been completely banned since the Dunblane massacre. Guns are not routine here.

Tasers are also not routine, and it is illegal for a civilian to possess one.
