Thanks for the response, and I would say that yes, the Squib OC's uncle could seem rather OP, since he does have a bunch of abilities that no one in HP canon has demonstrated. I do have some hard limitations on him still though, such as that the character could travel through time, but perhaps he still won't do things like try and stop Voldemort's rise to power, since he is cognizant enough to know that even with time travel, there are some things you really don't mess with. Of course, there are other limits on him like that he cannot willfully manipulate time like reversing it or speeding it up or freezing it and of course, he's not a reality warper. But those seem obviously too high level anyway, since no one in HP canon has anywhere close to that level of power.

Apart from the physical constraints on his powers, direct limitations on what he can and cannot do, I could impose limitations on him that he may refuse to perform some actions even if it is within his power to do so for moral or character reasons. However, some people don't see those as "actual limitations" because the character could say, change his mind on not performing the action, and just do it, and there isn't anything that could stop him doing so. As you say though, pulling a Disapparated wizard back to the point of origin might be rather OP, and I could find a way to nerf it. Though that said, the character may still be able to easily pursue such people wherever they might go.

I would think that the Calamity mutilating time and space is a thing as well, such that maybe this character cannot travel to the time when it happened simply because time is far too mutilated there to allow for it, if that makes sense. The fact /a spell/ was canonically suggested to have caused the Calamity certainly hints that some spells can warp time and/or space and some clearly powerful individual wizards are capable of performing this magic. I certainly want to hint that the Calamity has had farther reaching impacts on time and space rather than just dumping Foundables where they shouldn't be, though. And that could come in the form of deliberately placed deviations from real life, such as say people in the UK using guns and no one batting an eye at it despite guns being illegal to own in real life by civilians. Such a deviation, among others, could be chalked up to the effects of the Calamity on mutilating time and space.

Any thoughts on other ideas regarding the story?
