I think you can get away with having the uncle super OP with the time stuff if he is just pants at other parts of magic. Like perhaps he isn't the most competent of duelists or maybe he's very unstrategic/unimaginative in a fight.

I can't say I know what the Calamity is, but if you say it's a spell that caused it then it would be quite easy to put in your fiction that a particular wizard/group of wizards caused it and that gives you a very strong enemy to write into your story. You could go so far as saying their manipulation of time rivals the uncle. Or perhaps they just have very far reaching network of agents that can provide consistent resistance/conflict at all times.

I'm not sure it's appropriate for me to give suggestions to the writer on how they should write their story, so I'll stop here.

Sounds like you've got a good grip on things as far as your story is concerned. You don't need to be super well-versed in Harry Potter cannon to write a convincing AU if we're being honest. You can diverge from cannon lots without breaking the suspension of disbelief so long as it's reasonably explained in the story.

Like I said previously just make sure to intersperse that in the story so it's more of a show don't tell kinda thing. I dunno, it's your story you should have fun writing it and let people like me either read it or not. It'd be silly of me to say your premise is unrealistic when it's all about magic y'know?

Keep up the writing! Good luck
