I skimmed through this post and most of your previous post as well.

I feel like you could easily “break cannon” magic if it is explained in a plausible way. The only issue/difficulty I have with this is the uncle who is quite OP. Plucking people out of apparating, etc just seems like such a powerful wizard that unless you have an equal to go against them it would be difficult to have any meaningful stakes.

That being said, as long as you're able to make the story appropriately dramatic and properly explain your changes to cannon w/o too much blocky exposition, then I don't reckon readers would complain.

Hopefully this helps! If not I can try again, lol

Good luck on the fic!!
