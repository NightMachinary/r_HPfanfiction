It seems that there are "rules" in HP magic, but if you push hard enough, you can break them and produce effects with magic that haven't been seen before. I mean, how does spell creation come about? However, outside of outliers like Voldemort, it appears that no one usually does this, simply because to do so requires a great amount of skill and power and also at times, for you to do some very unethical and/or horrendous things.
