I want to introduce you to linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) because they address and subsiquently fix this problem ðŸ˜Š.

Yes I agree it's completely stupid and for this and a variety of other reasons I think the Ministry is stupid although...not gonna lie, a pretty accurate reflection of the actual British Government who are also fucking morons.

The main fix is generally money and bribery. Most of the Marked people who got away with it were wealthy as shit (Malfoys spring to mind etc) With minimal defence they could bribe their way to freedom based on their status.

The wizarding world is a small community. To be in a position of power you need to support of other powerful people. If you send all those powerful people to jail, who is keeping you in power? Sure isn't that what Donald Trump is doing? Pardoning all his friends? It's not that unbelievable of a thing for politians to do... Turn a blind eye for the sake of power....
