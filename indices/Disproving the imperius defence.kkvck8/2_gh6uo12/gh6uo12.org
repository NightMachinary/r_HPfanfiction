Intent matters. I can't say as I know much of this subject, but ‘willingly' is a very vague word under the correct context. The Dark Mark is essentially a tattoo, and if someone who normally wouldn't allow one to placed upon their flesh was held at wand point, in that situation, they would ‘willingly', or choose to, brand themselves over the ultimatum. The Imperius Curse is, effectively, remote-control mode, where ‘choice' does not come into play. You may not be willing, but your intent doesn't matter under the curse's effect, as you're not allowed a choice, forced as the ‘wand point' situation may otherwise be. However, that said, there's a hole in this explanation, by way of one holding the ability, in part, to fight off the curse. If one is able to rail against the effect, then one does, in fact, hold some internal choice in the matter.
