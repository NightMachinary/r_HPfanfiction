That vow would be a disaster. Everyone has biases, and everyone has moments of hate. You could be a complete saint and the vow would kill you if you critiqued muggleborns in any form.

Not to mention the sheer power it would give them. Hermione could walk all over Lucius or Snape, destroy their homes, bang their wives and they could do nothing about it because /hating her would kill them/. I've seen fics that unironically used this as a solution and I really hope their authors never hold a position of power over anyone.
