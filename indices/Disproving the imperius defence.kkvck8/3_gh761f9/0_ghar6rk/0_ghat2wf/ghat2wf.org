What I'm saying is that things would've been better in the long run had the Council of Magical Law not accepted the Imperius defense at face value. It'd be easy to figure out who was under the Imperius Curse and who wasn't by administering three drops of Veritaserum to each former Death Eater that is renouncing the Dark Lord at trial. Those who are found to have been lying, make them take an Unbreakable Vow to never become a Muggle-hating genocide worshipper again. Sounds cruel, but it's a harsh necessity given that Voldemort wreaked havoc in both the Wizarding and the Muggle worlds.

Instead, the Ministry bought the "imperius defense" hook line and sinker, and let the renounced Death Eaters resume their former lives. Lucius Malfoy gained a powerful position by making lots of donations to Fudge's campaign. Macnair is employed as an executioner. Dumbledore vouches for Snape, but while good at heart, Snape is still a sadistic teacher and a bitter jerk. Subsequently, these former Death Eaters manage to, on a rather dangerous level, infiltrate the Ministry, playing a long game for the coup in Book 7, doing things like: creating a new generation of Death Eaters like Draco Malfoy and his friends, terrorizing the Muggle groundskeeper and his family at the Quidditch World Cup, and busting out several of the loyal Death Eaters from Azkaban.
