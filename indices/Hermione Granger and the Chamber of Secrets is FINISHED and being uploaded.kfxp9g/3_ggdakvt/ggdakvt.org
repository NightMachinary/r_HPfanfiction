This is so interesting! Congrats to you for having the patience to write all that out, I'm really impressed. I've got a question- it's plausible that Hermione did things that weren't in the books because Harry didn't notice it (e.g. in third year he was ignoring Hermione a lot), so are you writing anything in that wasn't specifically canon in the books, but could have happened? Could be something small, like sneaking into the restricted section in order to find the Sneak curse she uses with Marietta.
