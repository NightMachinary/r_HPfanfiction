Absolutely! For example, in the first book, the first 4 chapters are totally made up (but sticks with known canon). It tells the story of how Hermione learned she was a witch and her first trip to Diagon Alley before meeting Harry, Ron, and everyone else.

Book 3 is going to be absolutely insane. Just writing the words "Time Turner" made me do a shot of fireball.
