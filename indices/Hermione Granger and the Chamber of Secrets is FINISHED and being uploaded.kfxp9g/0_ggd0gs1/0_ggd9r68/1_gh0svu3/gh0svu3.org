Also (not probably for the third year, possibly later), I still cannot stop thinking about that hex Hermione sent against Fenrir Greyback during The Battle of Hogwarts. He was always described as well above-average large man half-beast, and yet Hermione's hex sent him flying over whole large hall. I am not sure whether I sign up for the magic-is-intent-based theory, but if yes, there had to be a lot of intent behind that hex. It seems that there had to be some relationship between all three Gryffindor girls in the Harry's year (despite the disaster of Ron-Lavender relationship). Also, when Hermione went to the Yule Ball in her fourth year, she was very well dressed up ... seems like somebody had to help her with that.

Is it possible that there was some girls-only adventure, which boys were never told about?
