I have just read something similar about the third year and I was surprised how quite shitty her third year was ... either she was dying from overload of work, or more than half-a-year Ron and Harry didn't talk with her (whole “eating of Scabbers” was around Christmas and they were not really talking still when they run towards saving the hippogriff, and before that was the “checking Harry's new broomstick” fiasco).
