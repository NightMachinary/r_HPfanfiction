IMO, the main arguments behind H/Hr is that:

1. Harry is the main male character. Hermione is the main female character. Thus, by law of fiction, they must automatically hook up at the end of the series, preferably kissing while a huge explosion is going on in the background

2. Ginny was a horribly horribly underdeveloped character for the first 3/4 books before she did a complete 180 in personality (although she is still underdeveloped and 2 dimensional in the last 3 books). Plus the giant sign saying Oepedus Complex
