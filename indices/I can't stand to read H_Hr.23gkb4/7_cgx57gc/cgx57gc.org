I completely agree with you. Trying not to be a basher, but I just can't see them together. I'm one of those rare people who can only read canon-compliant stories (Queen Rowling's word is law!). Plus, I spent far too many years waiting for Ron and Hermione to happen to just jump on board for any other pairing.

I absolutely LOVE the dynamic between Harry and Hermione, though. They just "click"; he's the gumption and she's the direction. They need each other in their lives, and I just melt over the idea that you can love someone endlessly and not be romantically attached. Everyone is always obsessed with pairing characters up, and I just want to sit back sometimes and enjoy the honest friendship.

So what if Ron and Hermione eventually needed marriage counseling? Tons of people do, and they still manage to make it work. That idea actually makes me love them a whole lot more! There's too much Ron bashing in H/Hr for me to be happy! You'd think that nobody loved him, and he's such an honest and believable character.

Also, and I'm probably the only person in the world that will say this, but I don't find Hermione to be a sexual character. I think so many people have forgotten the character in place of Emma Watson (not hating on her, but she will NEVER be my Hermione), and that girl is good looking enough to drive any fanfiction alone. I never felt that the Hermione from the story was looking for a sexual companion. She always shoved dating and companionship aside for better things (even when she was upset over Ron in book 6). For me, her character will always be first and foremost the "best friend driven to succeed". The romance was just the icing on the cake
