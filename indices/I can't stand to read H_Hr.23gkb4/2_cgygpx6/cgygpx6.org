It is almost a law that the majority of fics about the most common pairings end up being of low quality. Since these are the "safe" fics many inexperienced authors go for.

In a H/Hr story I expect to see:

- A Mary Sue Hermione.

- Weasley bashing for no reason. Extra points if usage of love potions is implied.

- The war against Voldemort being almost completely ignored.

- ...

In my experience the best stories are those with either no pairing or with weird and unusual pairings since only authors who are very confident in their abilities write stories like that.

it really saddens me because I actually like the pairing, I just wish there were more good stories about them.
