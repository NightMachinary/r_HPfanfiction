Being a Ron/Hermione shipper till the day I die, I can't stand reading any fic with Harry and Hermione as a ship. Either there is Ron bashing which happens too much, or it is just not believable at all.

A shame, because I like reading soul-bond and time travel stories, and a lot of them are Harry and Hermione.
