I have been an avid H/Hr shipper since the 4th book was released. I always thought they were meant to be. And I just disliked Ginny's character all around. When the movies were released, I liked her character less than I already did. The relationship with Hermione and Ron always seemed forced at best, and Harry and Ginny....well that never made sense to me at all. She loved the boy who lived, not Harry.

IN ANY CASE. You asked for a fic where you could stand Hermione. This is the best fanfic I have ever read, and the only one I have gone back and read multiple times. If this isn't a Hermione you can like, then there isn't one out there. It also keeps Ron normal, no bashing, no crazyness.

Harry Potter and the Circles End. Fucking amazing story. In my opinion, even if you don't like H/Hr, this is still an amazing book.
