I'm not going to say that you read the wrong H/Hr (even though you might have), but you are definitely blinded by fanon. Canon Hermione is equal parts horrible and awesome. Canon Harry is mostly horrible. “Hermione tries to make Harry a better person” is pretty much what the books are about. If you don't like that Hermione and Ron are the real heroes of the Harry Potter series, then I can't help you, but facts are facts.

Read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][this]] for a fantastic Hermione, or don't. If Harry was in any way great he'd be Luke Skywalker. He isn't, that's the point.
