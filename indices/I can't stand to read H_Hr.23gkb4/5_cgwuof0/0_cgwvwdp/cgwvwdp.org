I may have read the wrong fiction - I'm not arguing. But...

I understand that Hermione is both horrible and awesome. And I know that the series couldn't have happened without Ron and Hermione. But I really think your not giving Harry enough credit here. He is not the best character at times, but really I think hes one of the best characters I've read. I just love him. I can't really say much more than that. I love Harry's character the most in the whole series. I'm probably biased, but who isn't?
