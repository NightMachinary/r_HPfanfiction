I love Paragdim of Uncertantity, because it took canon and twisted it slightly. It had Hermione having a great love with Ron, Ron then dies and Harry and Hermione get it on.

My biggest issue with H/Hr is the continuing Ron bashing. It's so hard to find a story that doesn't have that. Often they'll start in year 4 or 5 and all of a sudden Ron is an asshole who feels he owns Hermione and that Harry is meant for Ginny and starts screaming hatful things at Harry.

My faves are when he rapes Hermione, or inexplicably starts throwing punches at Harry.
