Although Hermione is very clever and knowledgeable, I don't think she's good at quickly/easily applying her knowledge in the real world. I always thought that her penchant for rules, bossiness, and book-smart-not-street-smart kept her a believable character on level with Harry and Ron.

Thanks for the recommendation! I'll have to check it out.
