Well, it's seems the HMS Harmony is outnumbered in this thread :) But that's business as usual I suppose. As a tl;dr, I'd recommend Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori.

That said, Hermione railroads over every character. She is by far the strongest single member of the trio. It's really just the consequence of her being a Mary Sue. She'll railroad over Ron in R/Hr fanfiction as readily as Harry in H/Hr. And no, their incessant bickering and fighting that so many fanfiction writers mistake for affection and love doesn't somehow "even things out" between them if it's nearly always Hermione that comes out on top. In the days when I actively read fanfiction, finding a Ron that wasn't a dense, stubborn sitcom caricature of a man was a tall order.

But then again, we're talking about /fanfiction/, FFS. The average fanfiction writer isn't exactly of high caliber. And it's fanfiction with a deeply flawed (if not lovable) set of novels as canon. So I guess we'll all find something to hate.
