Escape to Darkness has been a story I have passed over for some time because it seemed short for its premise and I was concerned it was abandoned or lacking content. Is it complete and worth checking out?

I read the Irish choice a while ago but it was lacking in other areas (romance for example), and I got a bit bored with it.
