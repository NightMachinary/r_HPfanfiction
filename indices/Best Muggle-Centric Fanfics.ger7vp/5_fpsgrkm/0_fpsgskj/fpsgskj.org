  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
