I'd still recommend reading DAYD. It's controversial and met with mixed reactions, but I enjoyed it the first time. It wasn't until I re-read it that I started to pick apart the problems with it.

I second the recommendations for Not From Others and anything by Northumbrian. I'd also recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1536120/1/Secrets][Secrets by Elizabeth Culmer]] It's Chamber of Secrets from Ginny's POV. I believe it's this month's book club too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/1/The-Unwinding-Of-Percy-Weasley][The Unwinding of Percy Weasley by JustAudrey07]] It's post-Hogwarts, and how Percy met his wife, Audrey.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9080959/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Casualties-of-War][Dumbledore's Army and the Causalties of War by PJHope]] It's written in a different POV each chapter and deals with the DA and their recovery the summer after the BOH. It's a WIP.
