NO! This story is just masquerading as canon-compliant, but it's full of OOC developments and implausible plot devices [[/spoiler][Snape sending Neville/Ginny/Luna to be killed by werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Victor Krum saving Neville from ministry execution chamber?!]]

If you like year 7 actions at Hogwarts, you are much better off reading *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408), by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is an excellent year 6 fic from Ginny's POV.

For postwar canon-compliant fics, you may want to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] story series. *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), happened immediately after the final battle. *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is his best story and happened in year 2010.
