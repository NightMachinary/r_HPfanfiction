linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4772789/1/Six_Years_Six_Applicants]]) is a short little story with one chapter per year, that tells us about Dumbledore's interviews to fullfill the post of DADA. A certain character applies every year, hopeful. No prize for guessing which one.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's eye, Soul's reflection]] is a lovely story that attempts to write the fifth year via Luna's POV: Unfortunately, it's canon compliance falls short simply due to the fact that it was written before HBP came out. Still a very good story.

Inquisitor already Suggested GW and the Half Blood prince and Strangers at Drakeshaugh, and I'll add my support to those choices.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/]]) Hogwrts houses divided is set in 10 years after the battle of Hogwarts, following Teddy Lupin and 3 OCs on their first year. If you want to be strict, it doesn't follow canon simply because Teddy Lupin is ment t be a Hufflepuff (JK has said so), and this story puts him in a diferent house (even though itwas written before JKR said it). It also suffers a bit from trying to tell the story from several characters' POV, and making the transicton between them a bit awkward at times, but I think those are all things that can be looked past.

Non canon fics that I would recomend to anyone are Oh God Not Again linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) and Seventh Horcrux linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]]) which are bot simply hilarious and a good way to spend the afternoon.
