There are quite a few such fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]]: Crossover with Star Wars. Sith Harry becomes full fledged 3rd faction, and is hatching megalomaniac plans with Hermione and Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]]: Head Auror Harry Potter is not dark per se, but he does seem to have some nefarious goals and is very manipulative and ruthless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: The only incomplete one in this list. This Harry was raised by his loving parents who got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap. But that doesn't mean he's a nice guy though, as he will manipulate his own family for his goals, on top of other things.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]: Slytherin Harry and Ginny against the world

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10707993/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unforgivable-Tournament][Harry Potter and the Unforgivable Tournament]]: Harry uses the Unforgivables to his great advantage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]: They are never described as dark, but their deeds speak for themselves. This is the ultimate revenge fic, as the systematic liquidation of the old establishment doesn't stop at Britain's border.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]]: Slytherin Harry and Gryffindor Ginny make a great power couple. They are also slightly sadistic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Hermione and Ginny are especially ecstatic about this development.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]: Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel to their younger selves and unleash hell upon their enemies. Harry is a very accomplished assassin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: This Harry thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but only wants to teach DADA forever. To achieve that, he needs to shut out those pesky competitions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: My favorite of this genre. Postwar Harry and friends had it enough and declare war on the incorrigible establishment. Trio interactions are wonderful, but we can see them getting increasingly cruel and ruthless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]]: Forced to leave the Earth, Harry rules their fledgling colonies with an iron fist, together with the mad scientist Hermione and his brutal enforcer Ginny.
