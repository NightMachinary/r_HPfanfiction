...really? That's the problem you have with this?

AUs are a thing, mate. If the author wants to postulate a universe that mostly looks like the canon one, except Voldemort /can/ feel love, they have free reign to do so if they think it'll make a good story. Of course, it rarely does. But the basic fact of changing this or that secondary canon fact to suit one's plot isn't some terminal sin.

What's more, /present-day/ Voldemort cannot feel love, but Rowling has been rather cagey on whether he was a born psychopath or was screwed up by his upbringing, and, later, all the Horcruxes and assorted soul-damaging Dark Magic.

Most Harry/Riddle pairings are with a younger Tom Riddle, though I'll admit this isn't universal. This Riddle /could/ plausibly not be too far gone to forge a deep emotional connection with someone else, even if 1990's Voldemort was.

And besides, the only Harry/Adult!LV I ever brought myself to read, out of curiosity, featured as a major plot point Voldemort fixing the damage done to his soul and his ability to love by the Horcruxes. So it's not as though even these writers ignore the issue altogether, or at least not all of the do.

Bottom line, there are /many, many things wrong/ with a Harry/Voldemort pairing, but this isn't really one of them.
