Yes, that's what I was referring to. It's still pretty vague, isn't it? 'cause, obviously, not every clinical psychopath grows up into a serial killer. With the right upbringing, you could have gotten a perfectly nice, harmless person who simply didn't feel love, but didn't think murder a valuable use of his time either and would rather collect stamps or something.
