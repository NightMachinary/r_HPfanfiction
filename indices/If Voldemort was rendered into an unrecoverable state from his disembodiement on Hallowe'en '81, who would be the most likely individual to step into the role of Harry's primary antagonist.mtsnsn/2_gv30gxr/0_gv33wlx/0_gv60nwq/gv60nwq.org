I got the sense that the reason Barty took soooo long to get Harry to Voldemort for that whole ritual thing, is Barty wanted to assess Harry for himself and get an idea whether Harry might be a suitable replacement Dark Lord.

Some death eaters thought maybe Voldemort's prophesied rival was going to be another Dark Lord and try to usurp him. If that was the case it would explain why Barty helped Harry in the tournament and also tested him with the Imperius curse to see how well Harry could resist it. It would also explain why he entered Harry in the tournament to begin with, because what better way to assess someone's abilities than the Triwizard Tournament?

Ultimately he seems to have realized Harry was too good and pure hearted to take up their cause and sent him to Voldemort as a sacrifice.
