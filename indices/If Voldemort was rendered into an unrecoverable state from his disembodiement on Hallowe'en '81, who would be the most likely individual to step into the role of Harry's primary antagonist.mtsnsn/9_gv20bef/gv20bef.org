Draco Malfoy. He attacks Harry relentlessly, and his lifespan will be very close to Harry's. Fudge, Lucius Malfoy, and their ilk would disappear, but Draco would still be around.

I second Dumbledore as a semi-antagonist. He meant well, but he really messed up Harry's life. Voldemort killed his parents, but Dumbledore killed his childhood. I can find only 2 explanations for Dumbledore's actions and inactions: He's either evil and manipulative, or massively incompetent. Either is bad news for Harry.
