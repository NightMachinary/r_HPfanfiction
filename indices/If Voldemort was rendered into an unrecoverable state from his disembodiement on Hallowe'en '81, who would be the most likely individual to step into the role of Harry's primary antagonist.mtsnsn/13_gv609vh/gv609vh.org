I'd say diary Tom, and this would fit with the prophecy.

It says Voldemort would mark the kid as his equal. So, teenage diary Tom being restored to a corporeal form could be considered fulfilling the prophecy. He's more Harry's equal than a 70-ish year old undead-ish creep with a sliver of a soul. Diary-Tom already is annoyed by/dislikes Harry for defeating his older self as a toddler by the time they meet.

In canon JK couldn't do that the way she set it up, because it would have meant Ginny's death. But a fanfiction writer could probably come up with something good and feasible. Or just kill Ginny off, and give Harry even more reason to go after him.
