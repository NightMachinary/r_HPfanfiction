I'm of the opinion that Dumbledore was either malicious/had other intentions, or he was just plain incompetent. From the very beginning, when he was tasked with protecting the stone, for example, he made a set of â€˜protections' more like an obstacle course than anything else that some eleven year olds solved with not much trouble. I mean, maybe some of it was the other teachers, what with the animated chess set that Ron could solve or the fire barrier that had its clue right there with a little riddle that hermione (and me as a 12 year old!) could solve. I mean, why not just leave the barrier as it is without any potions or riddle to the correct one? But Dumbledore was still overseeing the whole thing (and was also in charge of doors, which could be opened with a first year spell?), and just a bit of forethought would've protected the stone much better. Makes me think the whole thing was staged to trap Voldemort/see how Harry and his protections work against him. Then second year when he couldn't figure out what the monster was when a smart 12 year old could! he had all the same clues they did, except maybe Harry's parseltongue but that was easy enough to guess with /slytherin's/ monster (ofc it's a snake, what else?). It's just a lot of things like that, where children handled the situations just fine, if a little badly, and he didn't do much. And between believing if such a famous and powerful figure is incompetent or had other intentions, I like the latter.
