I don't think Dumbledore was trying to prevent Quirrel or Voldemort from reaching the final part of the obstacle course. The stone was there as bait set up in a way that they could corner whoever was trying to steal it. He was likely hoping to lure in and capture Voldemort's wraith.

Remember that the stone was still trapped in the Mirror of Erised at the end of the course, and there's no possible way anyone intending to use it could have gotten it out.

Over Christmas break, Dumbledore literally removed the mirror from the 3rd floor, stuck it in an unused classroom, then disillusioned himself and sat all night waiting for someone to walk in and mess with it. I'm 99% certain he was waiting for Quirrel or Voldie to show up, not Harry.
