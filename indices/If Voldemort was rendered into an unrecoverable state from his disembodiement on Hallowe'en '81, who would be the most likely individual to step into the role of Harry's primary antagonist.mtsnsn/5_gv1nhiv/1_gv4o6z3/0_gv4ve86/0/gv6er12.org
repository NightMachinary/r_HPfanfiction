Our knowledge of Dumbledore's motives is inherently limited by Harry's perspective, so we can only speculate and offer indirect evidence. In this particular case, you claim that the relative ease with which the trio got through the obstacles is evidence that Dumbledore had intended for them to. But, you have to look at other explanations as well.

For example, an alternative explanation is that the obstacles were there to "keep honest people honest", and the only real trap in there was the Mirror of Erised, something that used Voldemort's (or his agent's) very intentions against him, since any such agent would want the Stone to be used.

Or, Slytherin's monster: remember that no one except for Myrtle actually died. Is it even common knowledge that a basilisk's gaze can petrify under some circumstances rather than kill, or is it something that Hermione figured out from the totality of evidence---including something that Dumbledore could not have known, which was that the creature spoke Parseltongue?

You can question Dumbledore's competence (though I prefer to interpret it as there having been circumstances of which Harry was not aware), but Dumbledore never forced Harry into confrontation with Voldemort.
