Canon Dumbles gives no indication of being bent on fighting the war until Voldemort actually shows up. You can even see him not giving Harry the prophecy, until he had to and not believing the prophecy himself.

I mean I don't believe he'd sleep safe and sound, but Harry would deffinetly not grow up as a child soldier just 'cause.
