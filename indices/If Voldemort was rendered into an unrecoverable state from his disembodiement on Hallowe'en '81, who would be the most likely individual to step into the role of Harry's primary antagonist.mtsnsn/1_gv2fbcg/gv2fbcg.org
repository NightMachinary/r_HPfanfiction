Well books 1-3 show us that other than Voldemort Harry really doesn't have many confrontations. He doesn't share Hermione's views on house elf welfare and while he doesn't condone magical racism he doesn't really get to fighting it before Voldemort is introduced as its figurehead.

I'd say if we remove Voldemort, Harry would have an antagonistic relationship with Draco for sure, but probably not with the Ministry (since he doesn't really contradict anything the ministry does before the war begins, and there is no reason to think he would publically set himself against the status quo until he is much older) . The book itself would probably shift to drama about being famous for something you wished had never happened, and striving to become your own person.

If we went into Harry's adulthood he probably wouldn't be an Auror, but would he be a social revolutionary or a quidditch star? Who can tell?

On the subject of the horcruxes lying around: Generally this can be as good as you make it or as bad as you make it. It will more or less negate the idea of your prompt though since horcruxes are a lot like the one ring, they affect you and attempt to restore Voldemort to life. You can use them as a cheap angst generator to make Dumbledore extra worried but at this point you just have a HP rewrite on your hands with no first year.
