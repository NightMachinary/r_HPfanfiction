Well I think the insult was to Colin's memory who adored Harry and even gave up his life for him. And Dennis, who was mostly unaware of Harry's social circle (I believe that that particular point is even touched... I think Colin even lied to his family or was deluded about what good friends he was with Harry), felt that Harry chose Fred over Colin because Fred came from a pureblood family.
