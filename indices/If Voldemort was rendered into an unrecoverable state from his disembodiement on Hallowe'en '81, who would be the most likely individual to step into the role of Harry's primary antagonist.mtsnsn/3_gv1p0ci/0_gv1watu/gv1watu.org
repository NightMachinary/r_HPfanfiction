I read once something like this but it was post-war. Muggleborns are frustrated with the Ministry for taking so long to try the Death Eaters and many still get away on technicalities or by lying/bribing/selling other people. Dennis Creevey is particularly offended when Harry doesn't even show up at Colin Creevey's funeral because he is busy attending Fred's and starts believing that even if Voldemort's gone, Muggleborns will always be treated like second-rate citizens. He starts rallying the angry Muggleborns around him and they begin attacking all Purebloods, including those that had been good guys during the war such as the Weasleys, Andromeda and Kingsley.
