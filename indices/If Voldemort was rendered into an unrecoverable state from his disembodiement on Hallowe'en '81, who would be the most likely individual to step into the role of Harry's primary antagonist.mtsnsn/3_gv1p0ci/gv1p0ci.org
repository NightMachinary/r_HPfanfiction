What would be interesting is if the wizarding world did a full 180. With Grindelwald the saying was magic is might, it was more about wizards versus muggles. Which led to Voldemort who was pure blood or pure blood versus everyone else.It would be interesting to see a Muggleborn terrorist group.

After Voldemort the pureblood essentially you go into hiding or try to hide their supremacy and a bunch of laws that are pro muggleborn get passed which leads to tension and because of the war that they just came out of being seen as too pure blood isn't politically correct. Pureblood start wearing muggle clothes is buying random muggle things to blend in and show that they are being politically correct.

So first and second generation wizards try to rip up the establishment. Someone like Tonks who may try and hide her pure blood mother ancestry could be a cool antagonist.
