Malfoy. Umbrige is a dumb flunky that's too stupid to be dangerous unless someone is patroning her, and Fudge is a clumsy idiot that is just a bigger version of Umbridge: like her, he's only dangerous when someone acts as his patron, pushing him into things.

The dual-antagonists of the series are effectively Voldemort and Malfoy. If Voldemort is gone forever, or at least effectively neutralized as a threat, then the primary antagonist would be Malfoy and his circle of ex-Death Eaters, without a doubt.
