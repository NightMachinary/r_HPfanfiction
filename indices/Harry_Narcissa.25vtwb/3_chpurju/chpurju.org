It's an interesting pairing, but from what I've seen usually tends to be more smut/harem focused. If that isn't a problem here's some links:

As for ones I've read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2426698/14/Time-for-Independence][Time for Independence]] had a neat 50k setup, but was sadly abandoned before it could really get going more.

- [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1041][Inheritance]] is one of the smuttier "Harry bangs all the Black daughters, and all the veelas".
