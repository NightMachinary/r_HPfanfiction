Depressingly unfinished before it gets to the good stuff but linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul]])

This one is v. Explicit and tbh I don't think the characters bear enough similarity to HHr but [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Keira Marcos: The Soulmate Bond]]

I'm a big reader of HHr and that's really all I can think of. I'll come back if I think of anything.
