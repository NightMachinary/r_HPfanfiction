Look up the fanfic author RobSt. He has a very mixed reception to his works but you might find what you're looking for there.

Personally, I'm not a big fan, since I'm Hinny trash, and abhor bashing of any kind. But when I read it, Harry Crow (his most popular work) was somewhat enjoyable, somehow?

I remember that when I skimmed the first few chapters of linkffn(12879819) it had telepathy between Harry and Hermione, so I /think/ it's a Soul Bond.
