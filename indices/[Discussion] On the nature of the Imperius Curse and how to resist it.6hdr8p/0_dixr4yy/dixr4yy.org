My headcanon is that it's not actually willpower (it just feels that way, kinda).

Rather, resistance to the Imperius is achieved through achieving some level of mindfulness.

To illustrate, when I am thinking a thought, I usually both think the thought and a running side commentary second-guessing the thought and why I am thinking the thought the way I am thinking it. (Usually only for thoughts like "What should I have for dinner" or "I will go biking" or "I will say X to Y" or "I believe A about B".

So someone who is sufficiently practiced in mindfullness might automatically question the order, and end up throwing it off. In fact, from the canon description, it sounds exactly like this.

I particularly like this headcanon, as even muggles might learn to resist the imperius,
