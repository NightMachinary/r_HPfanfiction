I've thought about this a lot from the other side: what it takes to place an effective imperius on someone, especially for the longer term. It requires a spellcaster who has a total will to dominate the other person. Was it Moody or Bellatrix who said that when it comes to unforgivable curses, you have to /mean/ them? I think that's true. I think it also says a lot about Barty Crouch, Sr. that he was able to keep his son under an imperius curse for so long.
