Harry also knew it was about to be cast on him and got some practice in. I think most people get 'magic suckerpunched' and then aren't even mindful that they should be resisting. I think a lot of people could get better resisting with practice too (knowing what the feeling is and remembering the difference). Harry has the leg up because he's lived a life ignoring and/or being distrustful of other people's instructions.
