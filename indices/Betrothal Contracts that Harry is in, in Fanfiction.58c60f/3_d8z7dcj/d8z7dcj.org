I have seen way more Harry/Daphne Betrothal ones then any others which makes sense because of who Daphne is. Apart from that I can literally name almost any other major female character that has had a betrothal contract with Harry in some fan fiction out there that I have come across.

Harry/ Susan, Hermione, Ginny, Tracey, Hannah, Cho, Parvarti twins, Tonks, Fleur, and so on.

Some of the more "interesting" ones I have read have been where Harry travels in time and ends up with one or all of the Black sisters (Bellatrix, Narcissa, Andromeda), or others like Lily (yea i know his mom), or similar.

I have even seen a few FFics where Harry ends up going much older without traveling and "collects" pureblood wives from death eaters by conquest or financial power or some other such thing.

... Or ones where he ends up with "sisters" like Daphne/Astoria or Fleur/Gabrielle, or the Parvati Twins the like.

And then of course there are the ones where a gender is swapped or family added to like a female Longbottom, or female Harry, or female Voldemort, or whatever you want to throw in.

Interestingly the only contract or partner grouping I can not think of ever seeing personally for Harry is a Harry/Male one and that's likely because I am not remotely interested in slash. But I am sure they are out there.

My personal favorite for Harry 1 on 1 is Hermione or Luna, and I do have a thing for time travel fics where Harry ends up with members of the previous generation....

.....but when it comes to groups, my favorite mix ins are Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Daphne, and Tracey.

That said... if an OC or side character is well developed, they can be very cool to read about.
