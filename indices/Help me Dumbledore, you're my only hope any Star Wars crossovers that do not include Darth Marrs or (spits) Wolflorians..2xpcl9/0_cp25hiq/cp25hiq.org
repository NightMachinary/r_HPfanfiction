I'm a fan of The Havoc Side of the Force: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]. As long as you don't mind first person it's a wild ride. WIP.

Summary: I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

I love both HP and SW so I'll even read shitty ones to get my fix, but there is a lot of shit out there.
