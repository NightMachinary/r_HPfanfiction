Darth Revan? Amnesia Revan? Redeemed Revan? SWTOR Revan? Which one makes a difference I think...

If you do Darth Revan or post KotR Revan then with alchemy gone wrong could do it. In your world building sith alchemy could be the same as HP alchemy. Maybe when Dumbledore destroyed the stone at the end of first year, he flubbed it somehow? There's lots of ways to make it happen though. Good luck!
