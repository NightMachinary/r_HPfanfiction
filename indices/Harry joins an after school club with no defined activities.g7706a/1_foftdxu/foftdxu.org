I remember the story and several scenes but I'm having trouble finding it again. It's a club that starts in first year and at the first meeting harry goes with hermione. She doesn't stay with it because it's so unstructured. Harry sticks with it and it isn't until the 3rd or fourth meeting that the club gains structure. I think a vicki or Victoria leads it.

It becomes a Harry/Astoria story as the girls in the club (who come from all houses) decides that they need to be together. I remember that Harry has a picnic with the greengrasses and he has Sirius show up with astoria's favorite chocolate.

At one point Harry has Lucius Malfoy come into the school (Malfoy has a squib daughter) to test an idea he has that squibs can make potions and carve runes. Draco gets pulled up and fails miserably. Harry then helps Lucius' daughter through the steps to make the potion and then to carve runes.

Lucius then asks Harry for tutoring for his daughter and other pureblood squib children. Lucius turns against Voldemort and even sets up Bellatrix to be killed by his house's protective charms/wards.

Oh every year harry keeps trying to get Hermione to join but she refuses. Then she finds out that for the last couple of years the Headboy and girl are all members of the club.

The last scene has Draco spouting off loyalty to voldemort and Parkinson Sr obliviates or imperio's him

And with all that I can't remember the name of the fic or find it in the searches I'm doing.
