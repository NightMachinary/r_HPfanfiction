  I personally don't think that all blood purists go to Slytherin and its entirely possible to become one over time after being sorted or stop being one after being sorted. I also think that all purebloods who are very disconnected from muggles have certain biased thoughts about them that they end up getting over eventually.

I did say "the really convinced blood-purists", not "the unconsciously-biased wizards", you know. Nor did I say that you couldn't become a blood-purist later on; only that any kids who are blood-purists at time of sorting go to Slytherin regardless of whether they're that cunning or ambitious.

I also think bias against nonhumans is an entirely different kettle of fish from blood-purism, and, for that matter, so's bias against Muggles /per se/. You can be biased against Muggles but not Muggle-borns (fanon!Grindelwald), or against all people with Muggle blood but not any form of magical beings (Hagrid, it would appear), or have nothing against Muggles or Muggle-borns but be okay with House-Elf slavery (most wizards in canon).
