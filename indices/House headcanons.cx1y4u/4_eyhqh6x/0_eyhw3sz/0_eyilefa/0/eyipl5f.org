Thats fair there are definetly different kinds of bigotry shown and its possible to be one kind and not the other.

However these kids are 11. And very secluded 11 years too when it comes to purebloods. At that age its really easy to change your opinion on things when exposed to different ideas.

Draco for example didn't start saying Mudblood till his second year. Now that might just be when Rowling decided to introduce that concept. But in pottermore it mentions that Draco grew up around these bigoted views but was told not to broadcast them because it could get his father in trouble. Then he got to Slytherin made more bigoted friends and became more openly hostile. So this in my opinion is him getting more hateful due to his companions because the hostile rhetoric he grew up on is being doubled down on.

Hes kind of like the reverse Sirius. Sirius likely had a very similar upbringing. Like Draco I expect Sirius had certain things he just accepted as true but didn't think much on it. But then had those ideas he grew up with be disrupted. Werewolves aren't like people say, muggleborns aren't like people say. At that age you are constantly learning new things and having old ideas over written. Especially old ideas that had no importance to you. And as a kid growing up around just purebloods muggleborns would be pretty irellevant to you. Until you met one and hated them or got close to them. Then suddenly opinions about them would matter more.

Sure your parents think differently. But not agrreing with your parents isnt uncommmon for kids. If your relationship with said parent is less than stellar you might be more inclined to accept they are just wrong sometimes. And from the interaction in book 2 and given the type of person Lucius is Draco might still like his dad, but I think would be willing to admit he might be wrong about certain things. Especially if his own experience challenged his fathers beliefs

This is not to say Draco had no personal responsibility and had no way of changing his mind at any point or is this poor inocent. But he did have the potential to turn out very different pretty much everyone did. They are eleven. They dont really have the strongest of convictions.

Although Draco isnt the best example since he does have alot of slytherin qualities. He is cunning he tricks Harry into almost being caught by Filch first year. He is ambitious becoming a prefect getting onto the quidditch team second year getting all of the teams the best brooms so they can win. You could say he cheated or is unfair or even talentless but those arent slytherin qualities.
