I mean yes he isnt very smart yes and ya he fails to trick a 11 year old but he too is 11. He does become a bigger pain in Harrys ass in 5th and 6th year by being better at being cunning but that's not the point.

He doesn't have to be smart to be in Slytherin intelligence and talent arent the house qualities. If anything intelligence is a Ravenclaw quality Hes not necessarily hard working but he doesn't have to be. He just has to have things in wants that are hard to acheive and want to be sucessful. You can do that with very poor work ethic. Its not exactly a good thing but hard work isnt a slytherin quality its a hufflepuff one.

And this isnt to say that Slytherin only ever had petty horrible greedy people. You can have a hardworking ambitious talented cunning Slytherin who is a good person too and they can be perfect for the house too. But so is Draco. In fact Draco has shows ovbious slytherin qualities than most other people show for their own house.

Hermione for example alot of people say hey could have been Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Harry people say could have been Slytherin ive also seen the Hufflepuff argument.

Pettigrew many argue doesn't seem very Griffindor like Lockheart isnt that Ravenclaw like. But Draco seems very Slytherin at least to me while showing pretty much no qualities that might make him seem like he could be in other houses too.
