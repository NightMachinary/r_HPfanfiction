I'm not talking about potential, or even moral responsibility; merely whether or not 11-year-old-Draco or 11-year-old-Goyle was likely to want to jinx Muggle-borns for existing and call them names. This seems to me the best explanation of why the Sorting Hat would Sort Draco into Slytherin "the moment it touched his head". If there /are/ rationalizations for why he kinda fits the Slytherin ethos, they are too tentative to be the sort of thing that the Hat would consider clear-cut a second in. And even then I find the examples you cite dubious:

#+begin_quote
  He is cunning he tricks Harry into almost being caught by Filch first year.

"Almost" is the operative word. He "almost" tricked a /first-year Gryffindor/, and even then didn't quite make it. Tricked him with one of the oldest tricks in the book too, surely not one he thought up himself.

#+begin_quote
  He is ambitious becoming a prefect getting onto the quidditch team second year getting all of the teams the best brooms so they can win.
#+end_quote

Arrogant and privileged is more like it. He didn't have a set goal he worked to attain, he just threw some money around to get the small people to admire him because they /should/ be admiring him.
