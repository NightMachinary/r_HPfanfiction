I personally don't think that all blood purists go to Slytherin and its entirely possible to become one over time after being sorted or stop being one after being sorted. I also think that all purebloods who are very disconnected from muggles have certain biased thoughts about them that they end up getting over eventually.

For example Ron has a instinctive negative knee jerk reaction to Hagrid being half giant. Or at least not the most positive. He easily gets over it but the bias was there in the first place and he's still just a kid. Those biases might be easier to overlook when you are a kid and your world view is much more in flux than it is as an adult. So while the other founders may not have flat out refused to teach muggleborns I think they might have had some muggleborn bias too. After all if they were do on board with muggleborns why not just kick out the one who is blatantly anti muggleborn before he establishes a house?

That being said I actually love the idea of all the founders fighting over each kid. Helga is there like see he said Neville wants to be in Hufflepuff. And Godric is like only cuz he thinks hes not brave enough to be in my house. He thinks Im cooler hes just settling for you. And Helgas like well fuck you too Godric but hey I got Diggory so you can suck it. And everyone sulks because like the rest of the school they too all liked Cedric.

Also Im totally on board with Mischievousness is something Godric secretly values.
