- Since the Sorting Hat is canonically made up of an amalgamation of copies of the minds of all four Founders, I think the Sorting Hat's internal psyche basically consists of the four arguing for who will get who --- not that he /literally/ has a split personality, you understand, but he plays out the arguments in his head the way he knows they would happen; he knows that Salazar would say "this boy is clearly suited to my House, because [X]", and Godric would counter "but have you considered that [Y]", and so on.
- As such, all the really convinced blood-purists go to Slytherin because Slytherin was a blood-purist and the other Founders not, so the way the argument plays out in the Sorting Hat's head is Salazar saying: "but... but... they're stupid! they have no ambition! you can't just--!" and the other three ganging up on him and saying "screw you, we're not having someone like that in /our/ House, /you/ handle that kid". Hence things like Draco's lightning-sorting; it's not that he was obviously suited to being a Slytherin so much as that the imprints of the other three Founders were utterly mortified by the idea of having him in their House.
- A little-known but very widespread element of what makes a Gryffindor is a mischievous streak. Consider the Marauders, consider Fred & George, consider Dumbledore... and, this should not be underestimated, consider McGonagall, for all that she hides it. (Remember, she's the one responsible for sending Hogwarts Letters, so there's every reason to believe the "flood of letters down the chimney"/"letters in the groceries"/"letters eveywhere" thing in Book One was her pulling one over those "awful Muggles".)
