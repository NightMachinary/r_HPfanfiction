I personally think that the sorting hat sorts on future potential, not current aptitude, or maybe even where the person will flourish and become their best version of themselves. 11 year olds are almost never particularly cunning, or ambitious in anything but the most general terms. They're rarely hard workers, without an adult standing over them. Some few 11 year olds might make it into Ravenclaw, knowledge for knowledge's sake. But by and far the vast majority of 11 year olds. A small number might make it to Hufflepuff for loyalty. And even Gryffindor...11 year olds are that sort of stupid brave where they don't really understand the risk so they don't care about it. They're generally not courageous in the normal sense of the word.

I also like the idea the Heads of Houses have their rooms either within the House, perhaps on a small corridor off the Common Room, or right outside the entry to the House. And that there's a bell in the Common Room that rings in the Head of Houses' rooms/office.

Any House that has had someone have to do an 8th year because they failed their exams has an extra dorm room. The number of beds in the dorm room is a matter of shame for the House, as Hogwarts only creates a new bed in the dorm when multiple people need to do an 8th year. Ravenclaw's 8th year dorm has a single bed in it, students who are performing poorly are forced to sleep in there as punishment by the Prefects.
