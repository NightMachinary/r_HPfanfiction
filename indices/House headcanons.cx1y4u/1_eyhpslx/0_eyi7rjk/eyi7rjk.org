I have the same thing! I reckon that Hufflepuff dorms might actually be cross-yeargroup, so they might have people from 1st year right up to 7th, with the older students being sort of 'dorm parents' to the younger.

I'd imagine that Ravenclaw would probably have two or three to a room until the NEWT years, when they'd need the quiet and space for study, so get a single.

Slytherins... they like their space.
