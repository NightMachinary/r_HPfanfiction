Ehem, extremely popular opinion coming through:

In my head canon, houses don't really matter because the Sorting is pretty much an organisational thing, and doesn't have any real meaning. I can't help but throw up a little whenever I read how all the Slytherins have 'aristocratic features' and sneer all the time. The first years are eleven-year-olds for crying out loud. The height of 'cunning' an eleven-year-old schookid commonly achieves is copying someone's homework and changing a few words. The only way I could possibly stomach the Sorting as a value selection or character evaluation would be if Houses could be switched at any time. Like, you do something brave: sorry, you're a Gryffindor now.
