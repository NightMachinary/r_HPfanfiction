But what more exactly? Children at eleven can't be sorted based on their character, not even by magic because that would mean they'd never be able to change (before even reaching puberty, mind). A witty, friendly kid can easily become an introvert dreamer though. That's a simple fact.

And this doesn't even cover that eleven-year-olds simply aren't old enough to have super-nuanced characters. Real children are a bit witty, a bit snarky, a bit lazy, maybe friendly, sporty and so on and maybe a combination of two; real eleven-year-olds lack experience and concepts non-geniuses pick up naturally as they grow as a human.

An eleven-year-old wanting to become an astronaut isn't ambitious. He's a child.
