Acculturation is a real thing. The houses each spend a lot of time separate from each other. They eat only with members of their own house. Most of their free time is spent in house common rooms. All classes are with their own house - even though they're also with another house, the two houses tend to keep separate in class. And of course there's ingrained rivalry between the houses, which strengthens the need to differentiate. So each house develops its own separate culture, and first years will rapidly adapt to that. While you can argue about what, if anything, the hat sees in 11 year olds, there's no doubt that the different houses are going to behave differently. First year Slytherins aren't necessarily going to be cunning, but they are going to sneer a lot and try to seem aristocratic.
