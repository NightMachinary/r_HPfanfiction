For dorms i would say this.

Ravenclaw dorms have the girl's dorms so that when a boy tries to open the door they are frozen until a girl says their name thrice

Gryffindor would be the original and Hufflepuff would have the same setup

The snake den would have single room dorms which would of course all be different sizes and you would get a room based on your houses standing (example. House Malfoy) so if a muggleborn somehow made it in then he or she would have a small jail like room with the actual ability to leave

Commons.

Ravenclaw commons has the ceiling enchanted like the hall of hogwarts but doesn't show what really is outside but shows the whole galaxy they're in and their private library is bigger than the hogwarts library. They also get the knowledge of the RoR (Room Of Requirement) at year 5 and can't talk about it to people who do not know because of being sworn to secrecy. (Phew that was a long one)

Gryffindor you guys already know (original) EXCEPT they have a small target practice area on the side which in you can practice any spells, but you can only shoot in the general direction of the targets.

The 'puffs have a super cozy and home like room and have a tunnel leading to the kitchens.

And finally the sneks have a similar common room as in the original series, but i don't remember if they had this. A window into the black lake that shows fishies and sometimes you can see the giant squid.

Stereotypes which make it to the houses.

The 'claws are usually smart,wise and extremely good at thinking outside the box

Gryffindors are brave, and courageous and foolish.

The 'puff's are kind, mostly happy and helpful but will defend their friends until the enemy has lost.

And then the sneks The slytherin population of the castle is basically the cunning and ambitious bullies of the school and most of them except a few are blood puristical

Those few being my favourite choice for pairing Daphne and then her friends of course. (they aren't usually paired with MC)

Oh and btw each founder made a secret room for their descendants (some weren't only for descendants)

Rowena Ravenclaw a study with the diadem and all her knowledge (the diadem only helps you learn and doesn't actually give you instant knowledge) she also made the RoR in my ideas

Gryffindor also made two rooms one of which is the headmasters office and the other being a study that you could reach by pressing a brick in the enchanted staircase with gryffindor's sword and then dropping a drop of blood onto a pedestal which appears after sword thingy. After that you have access to the study as long as you have the ring on your finger that appears after the first visit

Hufflepuff made a room you can relax in with your friends (this one is not descendants only this is everyone) which is opposite to the hufflepuff commons and opens when you say ”relaxation above all” and you can then enter a room which has a hot tub and other fun things

Slytherin built the chamber of secrets and a secret study in there which is accessed by blood sample on a pedestal which appears after some snek tongue work and has some personal diaries and some parseltongue guide books and spells in that language too.

THAT is my headcanon gosh that was a long one

Some ideas are very similar to some fanfics and yes i know that but i don't think they have exclusive rights on ideas.

Hope you had fun reading it!
