I just finished the story so far and I have some things to say. 1) The eragon references earn you so many brownie points in my book, I remember reading the first book in 3rd grade 2) although I feel the romance is a bit cheesy, it doesn't seem like it'll be “oh Fleur we might be 11 but let's bang” sort of thing though. I'm also just a teenage boy so probably not your target demographic in the first place 3) the spelling and grammar is good, it could use some touch ups but nothing major 4) all in all it's a good story and I'm excited to see what you do next
