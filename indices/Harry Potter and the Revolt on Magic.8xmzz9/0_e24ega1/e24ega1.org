Hmm...would you delve into the rights of non-humans? Goblins, centaurs, house-elves, merfolk, giants, et-cetera? I keep finding it odd that human magicals govern all of these other beings, without letting them use wands or participate in the Wizengamot.

What about the original purpose of the Statute of Secrecy? It was put into place to protect witches and wizards (and apparently all magical beings) from violence, right? If it's instead used by said witches and wizards to evade prosecution when they harm muggles, should it be abolished?

According to canon, there's a specific exemption to the Statutes (both underage magic and of secrecy) for self-defence or defence of others, perhaps that should be pointed out?\\
For that matter, who are the members of the council that 'voted unanimously'? Will they be significant in the story later, with individual personalities? Do they have a motive beyond acting as antagonists?
