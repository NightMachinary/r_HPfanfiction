Harry is a dragon and that's ok

Outside the obvious part about him being a Dragon, there is no 'golden trio' - they're good friends with Neville and Dean (the closest ones), have quite some relation going with the Twins and Ginny, and also Percy - tbh this fic has got the best portrayal of him i've ever seen.

Then there is some ongoing friendship with some fellows from slytherin and a bunch of technically human OCs, but those aren't as thick.
