yeah, a centralized authoritative source is not in the spirit of fannish work in general, as i said, it still makes me wish for something more weighted, but i guess i do that already. a story better be the best thing i've ever read if i'm going to go through cached websites or live journal - but i'll accept ao3 recs without question because ao3 is a weighted source in my mind.
