  i wish there was a better way to collectively somehow create a fanon - something that holds a bit more authority and is a bit more cohesive

It's an appealing thought, but I don't know how you'd ever get fanfic writers and readers to agree on what constitutes the "classics" or the core works. Anecdotally speaking, I'm still surprised by the fact that I hadn't even heard of the majority of this subreddit's most often recced fics, and I've been in HP fandom for 10 years.

The fandom's just too vast for any kind of central authority to be representative. HP consists of a variety of separate fiefdoms that speak slightly different languages but all originate from the same source, though it's common for fans to migrate across borders.

And that's without getting into the whole question of quality vs. popularity, two things that rarely coincide...
