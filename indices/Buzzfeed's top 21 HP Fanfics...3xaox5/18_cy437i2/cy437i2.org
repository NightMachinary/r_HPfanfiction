aww c'mon now. i think anything that gets people reading fanfiction is great, and you have to admit - this is a huge world to get into. i know i haven't even scratched the surface, and i consider myself an old hat at this point. it can be intimidating and a turn off. /Isolation/ and /We Learned the Sea/ are fics I find myself re-reading to this day. luckie1 might be my favorite dramione author, honestly. i don't have much of an opinion about the others - I don't read harmony or much drarry. In the New York Magazine article - [[http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/fanfiction-guide.html]["It's a fanmade world"]] - /The Shoebox Project/ is listed as the must read Harry Potter fic, where I couldn't force myself to struggle through the first half.

i wish there was a better way to collectively somehow create a fanon - something that holds a bit more authority and is a bit more cohesive, which is almost the complete opposite of fannish works in general. it's frustrating! a couple weeks ago, a friend (almost 40, lawyer) hit me up on twitter and asked me about HPMOR, because it was the last thing Aaron Swartz was talking about on reddit before he died, and this was discussed in the new yorker or the economist or something, and he knew i read fanfiction. It was difficult to discuss something so complicated and with so much feeling and history & so many sources, without any of them being...i don't know. weighted.

would it help, to have something like the [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Main_Page][fanlore]] wiki be more heavily promoted, edited, supported? will buzzfeed stop making shitty clickbait if there is an acknowledged authoritative fannish wiki? i don't know, but we gotta do something, otherwise we'll be sitting here complaining about buzzfeed articles until the cows come home.
