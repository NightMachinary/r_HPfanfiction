As amusing as Harry Crow's inclusion might be to some, the fact that H J Potter is on the list is fucking hilarious to me.

I'm not wrong in remembering that as the one where Harry and Hermione spend years in a "time compressed alternate dimension" given as a gift from... Magic? for having a soul bond after second year and are basically adults, yes?

I assume that because it's a souls bond they've also got a /mind link/ or some such.
