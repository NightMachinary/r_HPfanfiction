While I'm not sure I'd pick that as the best fan fiction story around, I will say that anything that gets people reading fan fiction is probably a good thing. Harry Crow was the second story I read, after HPMOR. My tastes have changed slightly in the not quite 2 years I've been reading.

I suspect that anyone who starts off their fan fiction journey with Harry Crow, or any other particular story, even something widely acclaimed on here (e.g. The Santi's HP & the Boy Who Lived, A Long Journey Home, etc.) will see their tastes change noticeably if they spend enough time in the fandom.
