I think it's because it's a very superficial skim of longer fanfics, at least by my reading - I've read 20/21 of them and I don't ship more than half the ships mentioned.

That said, I also don't think Harry Crow is terrible. I don't think robst-type stories deserve the hate they get around here. They're enjoyable to some people. When I want a long fic with guaranteed little to no egregious failures in spelling/grammar and decent-ish plot, I'll go Crow or HPMOR (sometimes also Heir of Corvus, if I can find a copy sneaking around.)

I'm cool with the fact that I don't agree with the majority of people around here, I just think that sometimes the hate gets a little excessive. Not that you're being excessive, OP, just reminded me of some people who are ;)
