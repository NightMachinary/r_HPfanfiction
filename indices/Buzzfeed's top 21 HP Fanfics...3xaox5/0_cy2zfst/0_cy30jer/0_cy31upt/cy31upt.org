The problem I have with robst is that his stories are blander than white bread. If robst's stories where a sandwich they would be a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_sandwich][Toast Sandwich]].

The bad guys are stupid and easily beaten, the good guys (Harry/Hermione/et al) are super powered and morally unimpeachable.

It's a good thing that his stories aren't tagged as romance because they don't /have/ romance in them. Two characters just suddenly being together, does not a romantic fic make.

I've never read a story of his that ever felt satisfying. If you were to map out the rising and falling drama in a robst story, the only thing with a flatter line would be a corpse.

The worst part about it all is that his stories are not only technically well written, often have really interesting premises. A Harry that was raised by warrior goblins could be so awesome, but now it's just meh. It's honestly a shame.
