First off, thanks for articulating that. I'm about to head off to bed after a sleep-deprived exam day so I'm not at my finest.

And I think this is what I sometimes (not always) like about robst's stories. When I want a long, plain fic to keep me vaguely entertained (or not bored, if that is clearer) without offending my sensibilities by reading like it was written by someone who flunked out of Grade 4 English, that's what I'll read. (My emphasis on spelling is just personal taste. My suspension of disbelief goes from 100 to 0 the first time I see something like Pavarti, Hermoine, McGongall, Dursely, you get the idea.)

His stories have just enough aptitude - technically, as you said, and with some decent plot ideas - to keep me entertained. I agree that it's a shame that they didn't come out better, but I think the lack of tension and defined plot rise/falls doesn't quite justify the level of outright hatred and disdain around here, which was effectively my point.
