  I've never read a story of his that ever felt satisfying. If you were to map out the rising and falling drama in a robst story, the only thing with a flatter line would be a corpse.

  The worst part about it all is that his stories are not only technically well written, often have really interesting premises. A Harry that was raised by warrior goblins could be so awesome, but now it's just meh. It's honestly a shame.

Yeah, I have to agree with that. Some of his stories do have interesting premises, so you do start to read ... and then there's no actual conflict because suddenly the good guys are so perfect and can't be inconvenienced by anything so everything just goes their way.

So his ... whatever, is good, but then you get to the part when the whatever is supposed to become an actual story with conflict and head meets desk.

And that's just darned sad because the ability to actually include conflict in his stories isn't some sort of magical ability he hasn't, everyone can add conflict to their works, so it's just him being either that blind or that stubborn and something that could have been good suffering for it.
