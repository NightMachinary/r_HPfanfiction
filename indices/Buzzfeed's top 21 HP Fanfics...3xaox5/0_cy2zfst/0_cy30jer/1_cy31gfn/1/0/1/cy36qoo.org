I think that we are using different senses of the word bashing. when I use it I'm referring to the author setting up the story in such a way that a character, Dumbledore for example, will be holding the idiot ball and doing stupid or horrendously out of character things like love potioning and obliviating all of Hogwarts because Harry got sorted into Slytherin or something like that. From what I remember of Denarian, it was closer to Harry being a condescending asshole because he's a one-dimensional condescending asshole.

In terms of the best Dark Harry fic, I think I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] the most because it does a really good job of portraying that slippery slope into fiendfyring children sort of thing. Any suggestoins for other ones?
