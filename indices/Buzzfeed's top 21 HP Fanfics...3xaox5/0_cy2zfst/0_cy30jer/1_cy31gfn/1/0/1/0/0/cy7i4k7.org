  In my mind, the characters are all speaking with the author's voice so hearing Harry call Dumbledore a useless old goat is bashing him.

I think there's a big difference between bashing from the author's perspective, and a character bashing another. In Denarian, the character Harry "bashes" basically all of the other characters - but it's mostly just Harry being an asshole, as his character is. The other characters aren't /written/ to be awful one-dimensional characters who exist only to be bashed. In fact, from what I remember some of the other characters, including Dumbledore were pretty damn well written in the Denarian series.
