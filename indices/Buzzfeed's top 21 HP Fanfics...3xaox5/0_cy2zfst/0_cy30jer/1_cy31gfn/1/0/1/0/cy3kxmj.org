Actually, I loved Too Young to Die myself. I loved how in the beginning it was justified... just like all evil doers.

Possibly. My definition of bashing is whenever a character is treated as if they are less than another character. In my mind, the characters are all speaking with the author's voice so hearing Harry call Dumbledore a useless old goat is bashing him. If that makes sense?.. either way, I like that we can have this conversation without either of us hating the other...lol
