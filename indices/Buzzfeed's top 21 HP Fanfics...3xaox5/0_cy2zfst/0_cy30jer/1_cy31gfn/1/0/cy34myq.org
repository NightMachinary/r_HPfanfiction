this is what I am talking about. Harry spends the ENTIRETY of the Denarian Series, BASHING everyone who isnt him*. (I said it like that cuz of his special circumstance.) Yet IT is hailed as the best dark! Harry Fic. I am not saying that Crow is better than Denarian, or any other series that bashes, because they do bash. That is what I am saying. I think the issue is that Harry Crow suffers from being too long and too repetitive with its dogma. and even then I would say the linkffn(Saving Connor) suffers from the same thing.
