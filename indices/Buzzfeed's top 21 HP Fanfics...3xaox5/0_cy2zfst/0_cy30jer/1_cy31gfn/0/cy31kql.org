I liked Harry Crow more than Denarian Renegade. I don't even know why - I just couldn't get into Denarian (and the whole storyline) at all. HPMOR, for me, was a fun fic I read when I wanted to see things turned upside down and enjoy myself as I went.

If people want to down vote me, that's fine; I think I pretty much universally get these around here for not hating HPMOR XD
