I agree. It makes me sad that the only thing we say about these pieces of fanfiction is that we hate them. I rarely ever hear why. Harry Crow suffers from the same issues that the Denarian Renegade suffers from. HPMOR suffers from better than thou syndrome which if we are being honest, can apply to sooo many fics. Im also fine with not being of the same opinion as everyone else. But it also is really confusing to me as to why the opposing opinion exists.
