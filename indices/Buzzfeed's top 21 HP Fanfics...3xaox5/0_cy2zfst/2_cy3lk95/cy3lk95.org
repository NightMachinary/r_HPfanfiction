As a partial Dramione shipper I have to admit I couldn't finish 'Isolation' because it was too poorly written. (I quit after the bees had 'bitten' Hermione) Yet it's still somehow the most popular Dramione fic out there it seems time and time again. I do agree on about half of the list buzzfeed provides though, so I think it's an okay list. I would have liked to have seen at least one snamione fic though.

Basically, tastes differ, and you can't deny Harry Crow has a lot of fans.
