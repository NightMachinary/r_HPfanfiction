This, this right here is why fanfiction has such a bad reputation. Whenever a somewhat mainstream article about fanfiction comes out it is always about shitty fics. The best fic in that list, HPMOR, is a 3/5 at best.

If fics like Alexandra Potter, By the Divining Light and Harry Potter and the Natural 20 were mentioned in these articles, I'm confident fanfiction wouldn't be as stigmatized as it is.

I honestly don't know how you could be a writer for a major site and be able to stomach half the shit on that list.
