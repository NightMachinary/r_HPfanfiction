Buzzfeed = noise aggregator.

I guess I'm not as fussed about Harry Crow and MoR being on the list when taken in that context: they definitely generate noise. I'm more annoyed that other, better fics with noise-generating tendencies were excluded in favor of... shipping-specific favorites? Half of these I didn't even recognize. It's like they polled a Sorority House at a nearby college and said "This is what /everyone's/ talking about!!!!!"
