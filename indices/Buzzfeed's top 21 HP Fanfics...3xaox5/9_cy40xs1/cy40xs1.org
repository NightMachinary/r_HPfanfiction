This makes me cringe.

This is why no one likes fanfiction. Why would you, if you have MoR /and/ Harry Crow /and/ smutty Dramione in a single list? And call it the best of fanfiction? Like, /what the actual fuck/, Buzzfeed? It's like they're /trying/ to put the worst of the worst on display for the world to see.

Why does this site even exist anymore?
