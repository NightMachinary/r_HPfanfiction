No, you just need a glass or two of water --- maybe three to be on the sure side. Transfigure it back about 15-20 minutes after they drink it and a majority will be in their bloodstream. At that point, one of two things happens:

1. If the volume remains relatively constant, they suddenly have the worst case of the bends /ever,/ and will probably have a stroke/heart attack combo the moment the bubbles hit their brain and heart.
2. If the volume expands with the same ratio as steam... well, one liter of water would instantly become 1600 liters of air. Inside them. The bone shrapnel alone would probably kill someone nearby.
