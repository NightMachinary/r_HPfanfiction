You're absolutely right about that. Even if she strongly suspected that Harry wouldn't do the right thing, she should have tried.

In my own story where I dealt with that incident in retrospect, I had Hermione admit that she didn't act like a good friend because friends /trust/. A friend who doesn't trust you isn't a good friend. She didn't trust Harry to do the right thing.

Though, to be fair, I had Hermione admit that she knew this at the time and went ahead to go to McGonagall anyway because she decided that she preferred a living ex-friend than a dead friend, and further also hoped that she stood a better chance of being forgiven if she told without talking it over first becaue the latter would likely be perceived as more of a betrayal.

So, I think you're right... but it's theoretically possible for even Hermione to agree that you're right, but still have sound reasons for her actions.
