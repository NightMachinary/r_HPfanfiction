Hey, sorry for unloading on you undeservedly, I'm just kinda tired of people exaggerating Hermione's (and many other HP characters') negative aspects. Also, I'm not OP, but OP I would recommend making up a random fight scene because in canon they resolved this fight fairly amicably and even had closure when it turned out the Firebolt actually was from Sirius.
