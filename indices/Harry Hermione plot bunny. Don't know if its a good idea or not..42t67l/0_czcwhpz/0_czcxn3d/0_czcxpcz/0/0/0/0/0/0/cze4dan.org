Regardless of how right she was - actually, it's probably worse since she /was/ right - it's the lack of trust that I can imagine him taking offense with. In canon OotP the thing that pisses him off the most is being left out of the loop, right? He doesn't like people making decisions for him, especially if they go behind his back to do so.

So on the one hand, he's angry because Hermione went straight to the teachers as if to say "you're too stupid for me to tell you about it, I think you wouldn't listen so I won't even give you the chance" when it turns out the broom wasn't even dangerous, and /she's/ angry because he blames her for (correctly) thinking the broom was from Black and that /to potentially save his life/ she told the teachers.

Sounds like you could spin quite a bit of deep-seated resentment out of that.
