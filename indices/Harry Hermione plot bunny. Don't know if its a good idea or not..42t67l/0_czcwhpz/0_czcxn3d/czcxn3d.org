Ok look. People hate on Hermione for doing this, but she was pretty much justified in what she did here. I mean think about it. There's a mass murderer out there who's specifically targeting Harry, and everyone's worried that he's going to be attacked. Out of nowhere, he gets an anonymous gift of the FASTEST, MOST EXPENSIVE BROOM EVER PRODUCED. Of course she's going to be worried that it's from Sirius Black. If Sirius was actually going after Harry, that's exactly what he would have done because then he doesn't have to even go to Hogwarts.

And of course Harry has a past history with cursed brooms, and if he wasn't a complete idiot (or rather if he wasn't a thirteen year old), he would have remembered that and been concerned about the Firebolt.
