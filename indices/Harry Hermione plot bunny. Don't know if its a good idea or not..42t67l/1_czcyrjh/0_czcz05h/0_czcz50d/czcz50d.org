Well, then it depends on how good those other ideas are. A fight and the making up can be very nice as a starter, but in my personal opinion, it's easy to draw it out too much and overload the story with drama. Harry and Hermione are facing a mass-murdering psychopath after book 4, that's a very big incentive to get over a fight rather quickly.
