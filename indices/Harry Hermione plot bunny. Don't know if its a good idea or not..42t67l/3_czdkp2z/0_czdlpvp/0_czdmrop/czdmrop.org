Oh, I told plenty of my friends "You know, I don't really have a thing for her" when I see that he is loosing his shit over his crush. Its what you do. You give it up yourself so that your friend can pursue his happiness. In return, he will do so too whenever you need it, if he is a true friend.

But damn me, if I didn't think about those times often, asking myself "What if I didn't back off? What if I was the one?"

I could see this scene, Harry realizing that he basically just gave up the girl he wanted, needed, longed for,(add romantic dribble here) in his life and then confronts her about it, ending in the scene you described. "Have we ever been friends, Harry?"

Following that I could see him going back for his seventh year or simply that life slowly catches up with them. Early Adulthood, I speak from experience, is freakin terrifying. You have no idea what you're doing and shits hitting the fan in regular intervals. Most teen relationships do not survive the change into adulthood simply because the change of pace, the stress and the uncertainty is too much for two unexperienced people to deal with. Add to that the inevitable media fallout afterwards and the fame, and you got yourself more than enough reason why Harry, Hermione and Ron would go at each others throats out of a need to let off steam.

From there you could build a "new" relationship between the two. Speaking, once again, from experience, more often than not people change a lot when they hit the harsh reality of life and the last bit of the veil of teenage dreams fades. Maybe build their relationship on mutual interests, goals or vices (Hell, one of my best relationships yet was built on our mutual liking of Whiskey). I once wrote a break up between Hermione and Ron because of their different ideas of how a family looks like. In this fic the goal of Harry and Hermione was to "take over" Britain by political means. In the end Hermione would be Minister (Ministress?) of Magic and Harry Chief Warlock with Ron happy as Chief Auror with a huge family of small Rons and Padmas.

Anyway, I'm rambling. There are a lot of possibilities and whatever avenue you're choosing, be sure to post a promotion.
