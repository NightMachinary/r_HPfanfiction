  A break-up could still occur, but probably because the world slowed down and they have less stress, and the small things might start to matter more. Unless they really got past that small stuff while fighting for their lives at each other's side.

Good point. Although I didn't mean "active" stress (I'm getting into territory here where I'd love to use my native language). I'm talking, as you say it, about the stress of small things and existential questions. Making money, having a career, having children,... Thats not the stress of life threatening situations and war - something I would compare with a hammer smashing a rock. This every-day stress is more like a waterstream slowly eroding your defenses. Most people loose their edges, but stay put, some drift away.
