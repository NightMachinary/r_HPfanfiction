While I agree about your thoughts about teenage relationships, I think you Forget that Harry Potter and his friends are not a group of typical Teenagers. They've been fighting a war since they're 11, facing murderers each year, and dealing with far more stress than most people ever deal in their lives.

A break-up could still occur, but probably because the world slowed down and they have less stress, and the small things might start to matter more. Unless they really got past that small stuff while fighting for their lives at each other's side.
