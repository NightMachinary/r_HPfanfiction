  Every friendship needs a good fight.

I find this thesis to be unfounded. My best friend of over 20 years and me never had a fight. Not about the tools in the sandbox and not about any girls. Do we need it? I think not. I also don't need a fight with any of my other friends.

But a character driven story with a start like this sounds like a decent read. Have you thought about doing it after Hogwarts? Maturity could add to it quite a bit, me thinks.
