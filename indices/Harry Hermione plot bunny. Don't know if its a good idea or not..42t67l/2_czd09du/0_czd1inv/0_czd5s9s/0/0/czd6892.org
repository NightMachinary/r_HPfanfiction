Suspense of Disbelief. Basically something that sticks out so much in a story line that you lose your ability as the reader to believe the story anymore.

For example. Harry Potter, we all suspend the reality that magic is not real, so we can enjoy the story.

Not having any relationships or teenage drama in a story about 14 and 15 year olds would be so unbelievable it wouldn't be readable.

Good example I can think of was a story I read a long time ago. It was a terrible fic, but the stand out fact was that somewhere in the 3rd chapter, Harry picked up a guitar and started playing and singing country music....it was so confusing I had to stop reading the fic because it didn't make any sense.
