WOW! I understand what you mean...I'm going through my story outline and I almost shot myself in the foot at how little substance there was other than the plot....I keep trying to avoid romance but it keeps popping up in my writing.../sigh/ its inevitable.

No clue what pairings I'm going to do...might as well make this a Harry/Hermione story...but they definitely won't end up together in 5th year...

Thanks for that. I didn't know what I was thinking
