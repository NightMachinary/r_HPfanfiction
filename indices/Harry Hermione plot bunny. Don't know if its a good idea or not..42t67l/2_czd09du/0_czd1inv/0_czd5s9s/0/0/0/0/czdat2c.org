There is the other side of the coin on this as well. Some authors go the other way and the entire thing is about the characters and their emotions or relationship problems, but completely forget to write a plot somewhere in there. So there is all this 'character development' and none of the substance that actually yanks the story forward. A healthy balance of both is really what is needed to make the story seem somewhat reasonable.

Harry Hermione stories are certainly my favorite, I never was a fan of Ginny as a character in the books or movies. There are a lot of different directions you can go with that pairing.

15 is a young age to have a serious relationship that doesn't end in more or less disaster. I'm saying that from experience, but that is all part of the fun!
