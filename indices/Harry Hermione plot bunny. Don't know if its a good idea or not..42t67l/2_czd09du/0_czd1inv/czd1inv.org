The fact people keep quoting that little tid bit of mine means I didn't explain myself properly.

Here's what i mean by that. Every friendship has arguments, they have fights and people move on and then things just keep coming up and its just a cycle of more arguments and fights.

For example: I've had fights with my friends. Then I would have that ONE fight that brought out everything that would explain why each one of us acted the way we did towards each other for years. That fight is what I mean and in the end it would either cause a drift or it would make the friendship that much stronger.

I don't really count Harry's anger in book 5 at the beginning because THAT is an entirely different conversation. This conversation is about how Harry and Hermione treat each other compared to how Harry and Ron treat each other compared to how Ron and Hermione treat each other.

Also: No pairings will happen in this story. I'm avoiding all romance.
