"The fact these two never had the fight they needed annoys me. "

Harry blew up several times against Hermione in book 3 and 5. Hermione was quite a bossy person and liked to nag. Harry usually responded by brooding in silence first, lying to get her to leave him in peace next, and finally exploding in anger.

I honestly don't think book Harry and Hermione would make a good couple. They were both too serious and generally didn't get along without Ron. During their lone times in the tent, Hermione would pull out Phineas Nigellus' portrait for company, and Harry would stalk Ginny on the Marauder's Map for hours. That was awkward.

I don't mind writers pairing them together, because I really really like Hermione. But Harry's character has to be modified in this case.
