You're getting a lot of hate for this (I think unnecessarily so) but I agree with you that these pairings should exist in canon compliant or canon divergent fics, only AU fics. Whilst people may object to Draco being compared to a NAZI, no one should be able to deny that he was still a horrible and largely irredeemable person for 95% of the series. I find this pairings disgusting and unrealistic outside of AU.
