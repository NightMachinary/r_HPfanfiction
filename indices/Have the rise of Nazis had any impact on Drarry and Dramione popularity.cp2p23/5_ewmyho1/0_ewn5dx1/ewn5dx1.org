The Hitler youth were absolutely Nazis and saying the death eater : Nazi comparison is questionable is bizarre and obviously incorrect. It's almost explicit in canon and is explicit in interviews.

I actually did read a good Drarry fic because I didn't pay attention to the tags. It involved Draco being tortured pretty horribly and I admit I might have dropped it if it were any other character receiving that treatment. Do a lot of Draco pairings have him getting punished properly?
