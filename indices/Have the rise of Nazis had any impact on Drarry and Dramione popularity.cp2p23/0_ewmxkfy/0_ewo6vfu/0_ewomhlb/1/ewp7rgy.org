There are certain things that stem from being raised a certain way. There are other things that you just genuinely have to be a bad person to say. Take the end of GoF, for example:

#+begin_quote
  "Too late now, Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well - second - Diggory was the f-"
#+end_quote

I can understand that he was raised to hate muggles and muggleborns, but to raise the point of Cedric's death only a few days after it happened, in a way like that, takes a bad person, not just someone raised badly. If your morals are that bad at age 15, when most people have an at least somewhat mature outlook on the world, then you will never be a good person.

Sorry, but Draco is completely irredeemable.
