No, I most certainly am not saying that his character couldn't change. What I am saying is that he had done so much wrong and harmed so many people, largely through bullying the muggleborn populace of Hogwarts. So sure, he could become a better person (as he does in so many if these fics) but that alone wouldn't redeem him or make right what he had done wrong and fix the damage he had caused.
