As someone who's about as ideologically opposed to nazis as it's possible to be.. this is a bad comparison and it always annoys me when people make it. At most Draco and the other children of Death Eaters are comparable to Hitler Youth. They're brainwashed children. Draco in particular is forced to work for Voldemort while his family is held hostage. Was it the moral thing to do? No, but it was an understandable and very human thing to do. And, again, he was a /child/.

All of the Drarry or Dramione stories I've read has involved some form of redemption arc for Draco or were completely AU. I don't think I've ready any that were started after 2016, but I don't see how it would make much difference.
