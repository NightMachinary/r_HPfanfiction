The Charlottesville marchers are also brainwashed children. Lucius was also a brainwashed child and if Voldemort had won or even if he never existed Draco would have ended up just like him. The point is, in canon, being sympathetic to a clear Nazi analagous cause is virtually his only character trait.

There is nothing sympathetic about real world spoiled rich racist brats and that is definitely a category in my mind much more now than it was four years ago.
