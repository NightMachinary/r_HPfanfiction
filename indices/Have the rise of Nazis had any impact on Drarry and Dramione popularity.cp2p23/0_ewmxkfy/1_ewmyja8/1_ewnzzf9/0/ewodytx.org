First of all you don't know me. So you don't know my mothers side is Jewish and that her family was persecuted in Russia and then in Germany. That I grew up with stories of the holocaust. You also don't know that I am Hispanic from my father's side.So as someone who has grown up as a Hispanic Jewish woman I can tell you right now that when someone does say something like this and when I have been assaulted and scared I do know that it's because it's what they are taught. And I feel sorry for them and that they have been brought up in a hateful environment while I grew up in one that taught kindness and compassion. If I hated every person who ever wronged me I would live my life hating people. People are not born evil, people are made evil. And I believe whole heartedly that people have the ability to change. So don't tell me I wouldn't apply this standard because I have and I do. I can stand my ground and be proud of my heritage and not go so low as to think people are not redeemable.
