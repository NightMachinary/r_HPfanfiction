I agree. Draco is such a great character for fan fic. He's young and we saw his struggle in the last two books. He's also smart and while he's a piece of shit a lot in the books it's always as an entitled spoiled brat racist thing. It's clearly what he was taught and learned growing up in a racist household. He wasn't born that way - he was brought up that way. Which is why redemption fics are great. It would be a sad world if we didn't believe people could change. If we didn't believe that racism could be untaught.
