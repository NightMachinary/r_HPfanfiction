Jkr did a really bad job trying to redeem him imo. Voldemort turned on his family before he really got involved, so the easiest interpretation of his character is realizing he's fucked whoever wins and tries to jump ship out of self interest. There's never a sign of him engaging with the idea that muggleborns are just as good as he is, no apology, no real firm commitment to the good guys that he couldn't have wriggled out of if Voldemort won. The epilogue implies he must have been redeemed sometime over the next 19 years but we don't have any means of seeing how that might have happened.
