Another thing that makes Draco interesting to fanfiction author is that Draco is the most well-off within the main character. We know he's pureblood, rich, and (according to the movie) good looking. He's basically the dream boyfriend of a teenage girls (and some boys). Because who want to read or write the redemption story of the poor and ugly Mundungus Fletcher or the boring and poor Percy Weasley?

We can't deny that most fanfiction is a wish fulfillment in one form or another. Draco already has a soon-to-be redemption plot, an interesting backstory, and a dream background. It's not hard for a teenage girl to write a story based on that. Of course you get an amazing story once in a while. This is also why Sirius-centric story is popular in the Marauders era. Draco and Sirius are similar, their difference is Sirius gets his redemption early on his school year while Draco's only started at his sixth year.

We get less Draco centric fanfiction nowadays because most of the teenage girls that write Draco centric fanfiction in the early days grow up. They either stop writing fanfiction, move to write on another fandom, or move to a more sympathetic character because they realize there is more to Harry Potter than the classic prince of Slytherin.
