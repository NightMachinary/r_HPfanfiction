It's fanfiction, and people want to read what we want to see. We /want/ for bad people to be redeemable instead of heartless monsters. And there's something compelling in a character like Draco. Someone so privileged and ignorantly hateful, he mirrors the kind of mindless bigotry we see from people irl (they don't even need to be actual nazis) every single day. Yet we get to see, even from Harry's admittedly biased view, that you can still be a shitty person in some ways without necessarily being evil overall. We see that his beliefs get tested /really/ hard when he sees the brutality and evil involved in actually carrying out and acting on his sides ideology. He mirrors the average bigot like him that is super racist in the way that they “really don't like [insert cultural group here]” but don't want to /actually/ kill them or see them dead because “woah, isn't that a bit extreme?” That make sense? So in that way, he's someone we could have met irl, someone we probably have met. Someone we see as redeemable. You can do shitty horrible things under duress, should you suffer consequences for it? Absolutely, but do you deserve as harsh as a punishment as the one who did it willingly, gladly? No. I don't think so. Because we are literally genetically programmed for survival. It's much easier to die for someone you know and care about, (or do something awful to ensure the lives of those you love), than to die for a stranger or some cause you don't really believe in anymore.

And seeing those bits of humanity shine through, I think is like fodder for fanfic authors who want to see “what if”. What if, he was separated from his family hateful ideology early on? What if he learned to question his beliefs and actually thought for himself while he still had the chance? What if he never had to follow in his father's footsteps, because he was shown a better way?

Fanfic is all about what people wish they could've seen in canon. And people want to believe that not all Slytherin are evil, because no child is born evil. Draco also happens to be the most well-known Slytherin character, so he gets written about the most. It's that simple.
