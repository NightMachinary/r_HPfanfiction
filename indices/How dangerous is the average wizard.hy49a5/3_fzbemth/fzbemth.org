The Average Wizard can probably take out 5 Muggles in a fight supposing they don't get lucky like Wormtail and hit a Gas line with a Fire based Explosive Spell.

Why 5? Swarm potential, most wizards are REALLY good at single target fighting, once it's clear that he needs his Wand to kill people, that becomes the target, tackle him and take it.
