I've been thinking along similar lines. In my mind, because magic and magical creatures are so inherently dangerous wizards have a higher tolerance for danger if you will. I like to think this is why there was not more of an uproar from parents/ teachers about a troll in the dungeon. There was an issue with the basilisk however so it seems that one-off dangers are less of an issue than a sustained threat. Additionally, most of the Hogwarts teachers (Defense notwithstanding) seem to be more powerful than the average wizard in their field so there is some of the safety in that.

In a story I'm planning, this also leads to some of the even higher risk jobs having ways of coping with the mental trauma from situations that are putting them in peril because a higher tolerance only gets you so far.
