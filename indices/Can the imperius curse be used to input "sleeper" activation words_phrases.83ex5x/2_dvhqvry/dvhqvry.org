I don't think it could be used to re-start the Imperius control. But I wonder if it could be used to implant a trigger. Like if Voldemort had someone under the Imperius and said, "The next time you hear the phrase 'The hippogriff flies at midnight' you will take out your wand and set the nearest building on fire with Fiendfyre." Would that person actually set a building on fire if they heard the trigger phrase- even though they were no longer under the Imperius?
