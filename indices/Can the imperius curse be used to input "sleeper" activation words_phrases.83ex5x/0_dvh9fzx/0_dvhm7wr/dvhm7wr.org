Well, I think there must be /some/ consequence to keeping a lot of people under the Imperius. I feel like it must take some willpower to maintain on the caster's side, some concentration, much like Occlumency; such that only a genius like Lord Voldemort could keep hundreds of people under the Imperius at once. This would explain why, when Voldemort blew up in 1981, the Imperii on all his victims broke, because amongst the literally soul-scarring pain of having his body obliterated and his mangled soul kicked to Albania, Voldemort lost control of his currently-active Imperius Curses.
