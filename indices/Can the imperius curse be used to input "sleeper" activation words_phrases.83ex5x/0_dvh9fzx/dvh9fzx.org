Why would you remove the Imperius from someone if you still wanted to control them? Just keep them under the Imperius. It's not like there's a limit to the number of people you can imperius at once, nor a time limit to keeping them under, nor even a distance limit to maintain the curse. Nor is it detectable by any means we (or apparently the Ministry) know of. An imperiused person can even cast the Imperius on others, creating a chain of control. It's probably the most powerful piece of magic we see in the series.
