There's no need, but that aside, no. The Imperius only works while they're under the curse. One can't jumpstart the curse after it has been lifted. Also, the scenario you gave wouldn't work unless the victim understood Parsletongue, which basically would limit it to Harry or a random OC. Either you have chained Imperius curse or you just put them under the Imperius and command them to act naturally until you need more specific commands. I mean, that's partly why the curse was so useful in the wars.
