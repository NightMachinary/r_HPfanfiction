Of course, if what I said is true you can't really Imperuize (?) people who don't understand your language so the curse would be rather limited. But that seems to be the case based on Harry hearing a voice in his head speaking English in both the Crouch and Voldemort uses of the curse on him. Unless the magic auto-translates, which seems a bit weird.
