Idk about best, but two of my favorites series are not found in ff.net

The first is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/][The Paradigm of Uncertainty]] by Lori. It's among the earliest fics written (I think the first fic in the series was started just after the PoA book came out). It features mage!Harry (this series probably birthed the powerful Harry cliche...)and adult Harry/Hermione. It takes place nine years after Hogwarts and the characters are wholly adult, doing adult things. Voldemort is gone; a new villain is fucking up everything.

I read this every 3-4 years, when fanfiction cliches threaten to choke me up; since it came out so early, the author was pretty creative, for a fanfiction writer.

The second is the [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/][Harry Potter and the Flying Squad series]], by Horst Pollman.

It's a post GoF AU (actually probably published before the OttP book) featuring six stories, totalling over one million words.

The main pairing Harry/Cho and it chronicles Harry's life in his 5th, 6th and 7th years and post-hogwarts.

This thing is pretty strangely written - the author is either pretty old, or not a native english speaker. His dialogue and descriptions are not like anything I've ever read. That doesn't mean it's great - I've reccomended the series to a few people - some loved it, some hated it. I personally love it.

If you do take a stab at reading this and you find the 5th year fic boring and/or bad, well, I don't blame you. I think the first fic in the series is the weakest. I believe the series gets much better in the 6th year story - so try that if you want to give it a second shot.
