If you like Lord Potter, try [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/][Keira Marcos' stuff]]. (her own site, login required)

She has one very long Hogwarts-era (Soulmate Bond), and several post-Hogwarts. One of which is time-travel/do-over (though also slash): the War Mages trilogy (but only one posted so far). Moody's reaction to their "new" dueling prowess is priceless.

I also recommend [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=330][Vorabiza]]. Though I think they're all slash, if that's a concern.
