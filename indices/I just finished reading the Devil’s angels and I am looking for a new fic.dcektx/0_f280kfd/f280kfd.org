Everything Thorfinn/Hermione is fanon and mostly based on one author's ex boyfriend. Thorfinn and Hermione have, I think, two possible interactions in canon: Battle of the Astronomy Tower (Rowle was the crazy blond wizard firing off random spells that even killed a fellow Death Eater) and the coffee shop in DH when she obliviated him.
