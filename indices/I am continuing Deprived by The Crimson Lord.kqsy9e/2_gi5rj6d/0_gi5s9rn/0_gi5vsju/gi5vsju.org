There are no blurred lines ... any art based on the previous art (and that includes translations, for example, but it certainly includes fanfiction of fanfiction) has to have an approval of the original author. Period. Anything else is plagiarism. And yes, many people violates rights of the original author, and yes, when the original author doesn't know, he is hardly to sue you, but theoretically he can.
