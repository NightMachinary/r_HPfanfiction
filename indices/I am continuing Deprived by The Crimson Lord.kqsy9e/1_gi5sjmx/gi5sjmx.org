'Cleaning up' and slightly changing is understandable, from your perspective, but, well, rude, despite your attempts to contact them. Also, you'd definitely be slammed by fans for plagiarizing if you did this. You're putting someone else's chapters under your name. That's just not okay.

A better approach is to present your version as a continuation that picks up from where they left off. I've seen this a few times, and it seems to be met with less rancor. On the other hand, in one case the author had planned on coming back, despite the years-long lapse, and then was really upset that others had 'finished' her fic.
