I would encourage you to do a fanfic of a fanfic rather than a continuation of someone else's story.

*Fanfic of a fanfic*

You take inspiration from their ideas but tell a story in your own words and in your own way.

Canon comparison: writing your own version of sixth year.

Morally speaking, mostly ok, especially where the author has given it their blessing (as JKR has).

*Continuation*

You are purporting to complete a story that isn't yours, stepping into the shoes of another writer and usurping their moral right to tell their story how they wanted it to be told.

Canon comparison: finding JKR's incomplete draft of Deathly Hallows and publishing your own "completion" of her story, working off her incomplete draft.

Morally speaking, unacceptable. Most fanfic websites will ban you if you do this.
