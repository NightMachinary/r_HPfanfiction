[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This is a major AU in which his parents nailed Voldemort with a trap on Halloween 1981 and got to raise him. He never went to Hogwarts and made friends with that usual crowd. Chapter one already shows what he really thinks about traditional magical societies. For a long time, his main opponent is one GInny Weasley.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): This is probably the poster fic against traditional magical establishment featuring a (almost) canon Harry. It's also the ultimate takedown of that stupid marriage law trope. Their actions don't stop at Britain's border either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Written by the same author of the "Marriage Law Revolution". Here, Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore. He allies with Harry, and things got out of hand very quickly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and kill off their enemies once more. They also bring down the Ministry and bankrupt Gringotts. The only two who escaped their wrath are Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends have it enough with the incorrigible postwar Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again. IMHO the best of these 'revolutionary' fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]], linkffn(4356667): In this unique fic, Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia'. Narrated by Lucius Malfoy, the outcome can't be more ironic.
