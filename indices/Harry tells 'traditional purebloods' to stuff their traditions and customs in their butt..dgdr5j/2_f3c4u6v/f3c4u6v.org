That's actually weird to me. I've seen far more where he plainly doesn't care about the pureblood customs. Which, when you think about it, is actually just /incredibly/ rude. Imagine if you went on vacation to France, and you were talking about how barbaric it is that they eat snails, and how quaint their architecture is... etc etc. Clearly some portions of pureblood tradition are just outright /wrong,/ but plenty of tradition is just tradition.
