Hermione wouldn't miss information such as "If they get freed, they die, they need to be slaves". And that information wouldn't be hidden either. Certainly nopt at Hogwarts.

The point is, if you invent pureblood culture, claiming the Weasleys wouldn't be aware of said culture is shitty bashing since they are purebloods. And assuming Hermione would be unaware of it is also bashing - she's attending Hogwarts for years.

Unless, for some reason, said culture was actuively hidden from the vast majority of wizards - which includes most purebloods. But then, claiming the others are uncultured barbarians is so hypocritical, Harry would have to realise it at once.
