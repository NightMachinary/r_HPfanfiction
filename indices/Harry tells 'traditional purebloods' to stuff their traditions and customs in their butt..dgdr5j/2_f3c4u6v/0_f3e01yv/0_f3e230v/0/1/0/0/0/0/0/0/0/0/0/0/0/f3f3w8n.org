You're using fanon here. Hermione wasn't the most socially aware girl at the start of the series, but she outgrew that. She was the one who organised the DA, after all, and later went on to become the youngest Minister for Magic in some time. That requires quite the social acumen. And the Weasleys aren't uncultured louts. I don't know where you'd get that impression - they aren't the ones sprouting bigoted beliefs in public, as Draco, supposedly a cultured pureblood, is doing any chance he gets.

But yes, JKR's setting falls apart as soon as you leave her railroaded plot.

However, if you add fanon pureblood culture, the Weasleys would be aware of it, being purebloods themselves. And whether or not harry and Co. would snub it would depends entirely on how exactly said culture was detailed.

I've made up a different pureblood culture myself for one of my stories - one where the wizards split off in 1692, and developed differently. I was shooting for a truly "different but equal" approach. They are more progressive in some areas, and more archaic in others (though usually tempered by custom), but, above all, far more magical - magic is used all the time in daily life, from summoning snacks and floating serving trays at dinner to robes covered with as many spells as you can manage or afford as a way to prove your status.
