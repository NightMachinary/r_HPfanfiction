But is it really a different culture for the kids and most people?

They celebrate the same holidays in canon. The kids deal with similar issues.

Magical culture seems to be a quaint village life for a kid before the internet.

Pure-Blood culture on the other hand sounds dangerously close to Aryan ideology.
