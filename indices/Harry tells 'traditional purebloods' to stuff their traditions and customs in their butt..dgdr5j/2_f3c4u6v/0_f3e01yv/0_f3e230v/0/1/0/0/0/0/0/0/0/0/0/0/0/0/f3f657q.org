I'm using canon, but I personally disregard JKR's nonsense outside of the books themselves. Even if I didnt, events which happened /after/ Hogwarts have little bearing on the matter of her attitude /during,/ and throughout the books, Hermione is persistently arrogant and insensitive, well into the fourth book at least.

And when I call the Weasleys uncultured, I'm not saying they're rednecks or crude. I'm saying they /don't care./ None of them, except Percy, gives a rat's ass what's proper or expected of them, and that extends to their interactions with friends and family- the Twins are blatantly disrespectful, Bill and Charlie both have some degree of a rebellious streak, Ginny is hot headed and independent, Ron is impulsive and crude, and Arthur is, as I said, utterly obsessed with muggles. Their independence and freemindedness is a persistent Weasely trait, and one which is very much a part of their family dynamic. I would be surprised if they taught Harry and Hermione much about something to which they pay so little attention themselves.

A "separate but equal" culture is exactly what I've been arguing for, though. They are, as I've said, somewhere between a foreign country and a literal alien civilization. I'm specifically trying to say that they /should/ have a rich, diverse culture with complex etiquette, traditions, rituals, ideologies, and likely even religious beliefs. They've been highly isolated for the better part of 500 years, and anybody who thinks that won't lead to a significant cultural divergence needs to examine the divide between American and British culture, which have had a century less and far more interaction.
