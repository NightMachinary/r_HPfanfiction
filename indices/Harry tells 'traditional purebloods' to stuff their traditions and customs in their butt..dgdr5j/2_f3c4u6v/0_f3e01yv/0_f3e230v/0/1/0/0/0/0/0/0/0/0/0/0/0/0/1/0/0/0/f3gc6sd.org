/Only if it's badly done./ Obviously it would be out of character for Hermione to miss something like that, if it's readily available information. But what would be reasonable is for her to decide that she knows what's best for them and she's going to help them whether they want it or not- exactly like she did in canon. Similarly, finding an easy way to extract Horcruxes is also badly done, because obviously if it were a viable option, Dumbledore- who's been looking for a way to destroy the damned things for 20 years now- would have found it.

Bad implementations of a technique do not mean that all implementations of said technique are bad. When sloppily or lazily done, they become cheap bashing techniques.
