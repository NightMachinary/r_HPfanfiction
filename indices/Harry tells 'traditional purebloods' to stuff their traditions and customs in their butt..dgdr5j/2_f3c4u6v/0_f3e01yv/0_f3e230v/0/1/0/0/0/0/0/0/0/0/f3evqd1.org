I actually addressed the point of the Weasleys elsewhere in this thread. As for Hermione? She's /absolutely/ the kind of person who would go to France and ramble about how /quaint/ it is that they eat snails, and it's so /barbaric/ that they don't shave their armpits. Hermione is both arrogant and socially clueless. She /might/ make a study of wizarding culture as a matter of course, but she would never show it any level of respect or deference.
