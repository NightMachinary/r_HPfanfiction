We see exactly three holidays, and nothing at all touches on any of the other elements I spoke of. And you're prepared to condemn the entirity of Pureblood culture based on the actions of an illegal, fanatic terrorist group which comprises a minority of the population? Ok then.

So in the stories where Harry "just follows every pureblood tradition without questioning" does that mean he becomes a Death Eater? Because so far the only thing you're referring to as "pureblood culture" is pureblood /bigotty./
