  Hermione wouldn't miss information such as "If they get freed, they die, they need to be slaves". And that information wouldn't be hidden either. Certainly nopt at Hogwarts.

Yes, i was agreeing with you. You'll note that I addressed this point previously.

  The point is, if you invent pureblood culture, claiming the Weasleys wouldn't be aware of said culture is shitty bashing since they are purebloods. And assuming Hermione would be unaware of it is also bashing - she's attending Hogwarts for years.

I don't think so. "Bashing" implies that the character in person is portrayed as a bad person. But is my father a bad person because he has little regard for the culture and traditions of the deep south? I certainly don't think so. As I've /repeatedly/ said, the Weasleys are fiercely independent and freethinking. Their lack of regard for what's "proper" is /established canon,/ and you're ignoring that wholly. Similarly, I addressed the point regarding Hermione- she likely would not be unaware of it, but I find it hard to imagine she would be respectful of it, /especially/ in the first few years of the story. At a bare minimum, for the first three or four years, Hermione is brash and insensitive, and often convinced that she knows better than other people. Such a person would not put the effort into changing their way of life to suit quaint and peculiar local traditions, when their own lifestyle is clearly "better."

However, at this point we're going in circles. Neither of us is saying anything that hasn't been said at least twice already, and it seems unlikely that this will go anywhere productive. It is likely best for both of our time if we simply agree to disagree.
