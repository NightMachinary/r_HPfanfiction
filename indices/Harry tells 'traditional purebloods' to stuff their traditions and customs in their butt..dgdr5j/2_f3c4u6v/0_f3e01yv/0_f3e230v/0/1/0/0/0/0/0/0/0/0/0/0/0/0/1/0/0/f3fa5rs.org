But that leads to shitty bashing such as "Oh, Hermione is trying to kill the elves by freeing them, they need to be slaves to survive", when Hermione would have found out about that since she thoroughly investigated the matter in canon. Adding a major thing like pureblood culture has to affect the characters. Otherwise, it's cheap bashing. Like having some easy way to extract a Horcrux that Dumbledore somehow never found despite years of research.
