Lol no. With any other writer, I accept Word of God, no matter how galling I may find it- I'm particularly contentious with Wildbow. JKR's WoG, however, is a self contradictory clusterfuck of retcons and low-effort pandering which is not worth my time or effort to read, especially when she very clearly made up the entire setting as she went and put little to no long term planning into the story.

Edit: you also wholly disregarded literally every other part of what I've said in this particular side of the discussion, choosing to cherry pick two specific lines and misrepresent them both. Pot, meet kettle.
