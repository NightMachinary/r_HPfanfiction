Well yeah, but it's reasonable to assume that there's more to the world than is explicitly shown in canon. That's half of what fanfiction /is/- expanding on and exploring concepts that weren't touched upon in canon. And again, OP was referring to /fanfics/ where Harry follows pureblood custom. Presumably those fanfics actually /have/ some variety of tradition and culture which Harry is following, otherwise the discussion is moot.
