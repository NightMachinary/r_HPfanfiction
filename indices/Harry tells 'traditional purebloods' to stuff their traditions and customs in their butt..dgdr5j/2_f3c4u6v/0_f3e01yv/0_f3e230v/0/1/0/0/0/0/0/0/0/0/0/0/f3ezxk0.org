Have you /read/ the story? Hermione is incredibly bossy, insensitive, and arrogant. She wouldn't be /bigoted,/ but she'd certainly be disrespectful and arrogant. And the Weasleys literally are uncultured louts. Like, they actually are. I love the family to death-except Ron- but every single word I said in that post is completely accurate.

But if the Watsonian explanation doesn't satisfy, there's the Doylist- JKR is a trash tier worldbuilder. Her setting falls apart like a house of cards made with exploding snap cards under the slightest examination, and it should be no surprise that it is unrealistic, superficial, and one dimensional. But that doesn't change what I keep trying to say- if a fanfiction /has/ a wizarding culture for Harry to ignore, then it is reasonable for that wizarding culture to be meaningfully distinct, and in that case, openly snubbing it would be disrespectful.
