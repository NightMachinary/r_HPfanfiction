Ah. I think at this point we come into a divergence of priorities. To me, creating a "fanon" culture for the wizarding world would involve filling in the gaps, explaining why what we see in canon is the way it is, while actually /changing/ as little as possible. To me the ideal is to fill in the plotholes, shore up the foundations, and examine consequences. The canon characters, in particular, should ideally be left as untouched as possible, except insofar as fleshing them out beyond the one dimensional caricatures which JKR wrote about and turning them into complicated and believable people.
