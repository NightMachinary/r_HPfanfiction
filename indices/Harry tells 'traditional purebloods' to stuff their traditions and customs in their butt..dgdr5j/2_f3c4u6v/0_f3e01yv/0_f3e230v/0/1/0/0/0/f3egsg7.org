It pretty much seems that the only "pureblood tradition" of note is the bigotry in canon. However, in many stories, pureblood culture is expanded into a different (usually meaning: 19th century muggle) culture. Whcih, for some weird and never explained reason, the Weasleys are completely unaware of, so that Harry's designed love interest can exlain the culture to him and alienate Harry from his friends.
