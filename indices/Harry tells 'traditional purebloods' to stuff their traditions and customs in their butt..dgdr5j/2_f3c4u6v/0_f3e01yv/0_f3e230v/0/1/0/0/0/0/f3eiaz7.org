That's certainly all we see of it, but the idea that that's all there /is/ is nonsensical. The wizarding world is effectively an entire alien civilization, with only the barest contact with outsiders. Look at how far the US diverged from Britain, and the Wizards have had a full extra century and are far more secluded. Any distinct community develops some manner of culture- even simple online communities develop traditions, a hierarchy, and standards of etiquette within astonishingly short time frames, and the Wizards have been highly isolated for centuries. Certainly their culture- whatever it may be- must of necessity be watered down to some degree by the influx of half bloods and muggle borns, but at the same time there /must/ be some manner of distinct Wizarding culture.

As for the Weasleys, the simplest explanation is that they couldn't give two shits about tradition, outside of Percy, who has virtually no meaningful presence in the series. Mr. Weasely is half mad and obsessed with muggles- that alone tells us what value he's liable to place on ancient tradition. Add to that Bill and Charlie's rebelliousness, the Twins' rambunctious energy, Ron's... everything, and Ginny's fierce independence and the fact that she's the youngest in this highly irreverent family, and there's no reason to expect that they'd be particularly respective of any old traditions.
