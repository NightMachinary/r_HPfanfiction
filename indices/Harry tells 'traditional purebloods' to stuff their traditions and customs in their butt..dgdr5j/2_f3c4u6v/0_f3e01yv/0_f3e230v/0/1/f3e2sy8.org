I agree that there's nothing redeeming in canon, but there's a few flaws with that argument.

1) we see virtually nothing of pure blood culture in canon. We do not see their religion, their relationship or courtship practices, their alliances, their etiquette, their politics, their holidays. The most we see of their culture is the bigotry which was /only/ present in a psychotic rebellion faction, and some small elements of their entertainment and diet. That's /it./ And it would be patently absurd to claim that any culture at all is wholly lacking in any of these things, much less all of them.

2) You want a /fanfiction/ in which Harry disrespects Pureblood culture, but your argument that Pureblood culture is irredeemable is based in /canon./ This is a double standard. Fanfics, of necessity, expand on and explore material not touched upon in canon. In order for a story to explore the consequences of Harry snubbing Pureblood cultire, it would be /necessary/ for the author to make up more information about said culture. Otherwise, what is there to snub? The bigotry? I /highly/ doubt that's what you were referring to with the line

"I read so many fanfictions where Harry just follows every pureblood tradition without questioning. "

So, either you're claiming that in most fanfics you read, Harry supports the Death Eaters- as pureblood bigotry is the only canon example of their culture we see beyond their entertainment- or you're claiming that he follows /noncanon/ traditions. And if it's the latter, we get back to my prior points- that it is an author's right to make up information to fill the gaps which JKR left us, and that not every detail of a realistic culture will be offensive.
