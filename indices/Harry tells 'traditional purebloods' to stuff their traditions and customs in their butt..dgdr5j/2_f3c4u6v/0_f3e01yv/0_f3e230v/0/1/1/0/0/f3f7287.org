Indeed. Also, authors often make it appear as if it were incredibly difficult to fit into that culture - but for Harry, of course, who learns from his Slytherin love interest. But if Harry can do it, then Hermione could learn all about the culture (which is usually just Jane Austen with spells, so she'd be familair with it anyway), and Ron would have ben born into it (and taught harry and Hermione). (Which is another point I hate: Authors always dismiss Ron who in canon was the "Inside guy" for pureblood culture for Harry and Hermione in favour of their Slytherin OC.)
