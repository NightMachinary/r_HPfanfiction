Hmm, Patron was an interesting read. You utilizing secondary and tertiary characters is a refreshing change of pace. But you wrote it as a struggle against a system, which is pretty important. Because you included a struggle.

I don't want to see pureblood culture to boost the trio. The trio already has a great base. Tom Riddle didn't need that stuff in canon. Dumbledore didn't need it. Grindelwald didn't need it.

I also don't want to see the trio become closet racists. Pureblood culture needs to die, but including a few more purebloods like Cedric in a fic? Yeah that sounds alright.
