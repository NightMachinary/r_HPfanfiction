I never said they should get a boost or accept said culture, or become racists. I'm just saying that I think Ron and the Weasleys would be the logical choice to teach Harry and Hermione about said culture - as they did in canon, after all. I'm not fond of the trope that Harry's friends are uncultured idiots and only Slytherins know the real wizarding culture.
