No. Just no. I don't want any of them doing that, except Ron as this parody fic maybe (Ron is underutilized).

Hermione ends up devolving into this secret pureblood with a Slytherin love interest, Harry becomes this "I'm not racist, I'm friends with a muggleborn", and Ron becomes... I don't know what he becomes exactly, a horrendous OC with his name?
