Ron teaching Harry and Hermione about traditions doesn't need to lead to those tropes at all. They basically stay the same, but instead of a rather typical British culture with some magic, we've got a more fantastical culture. Hell, I did that in "Patron", basically, where Harry and Hermione adapted without ever accepting those parts of the culture that they loathed.
