Oh I agree the main plot is actually common in real life, but you misunderstand what I meant (I wasn't being clear).

I mean issues that pop up in the story that only require someone to explain themselves is overdone. I don't know how to explain it, but it's like the stories that keep bashing Dumbledore to keep the plot going.

Or worse, they decide Draco is the aristocrat...
