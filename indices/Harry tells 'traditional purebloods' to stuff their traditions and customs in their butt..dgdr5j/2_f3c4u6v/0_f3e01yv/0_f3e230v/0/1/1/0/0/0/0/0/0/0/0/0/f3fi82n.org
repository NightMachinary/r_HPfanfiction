Fair point. It just gets worse in Fanfiction when people have the aristocrats looking down on the muggleborn and justifying it as them not understanding culture.

Some days I feel like taking a noncopyrighted work like that and replacing the main characters names with Harry Potter characters, just so people know it's bad.
