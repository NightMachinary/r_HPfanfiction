The problem is that most authors and readers never imagine how their "pureblood paragons" would treat them as muggles. They always imagine themselves as a southern belle or aristocrat. There's a lot of wish-fulfilment in those stories. It's especially apparent in stories with Daphne - how often does such a story see Harry the poor half-blood having to struggle against prejudices from Daphne's bigoted family? And how often do Daphne and her family gratefully teach the noble head of the Potter family how he can use his considerable power and wealth best?
