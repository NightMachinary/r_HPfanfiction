We see a lot of pureblood culture in canon - we follow the Weasleys, which are a pureblood family - they were even, although against their will, included in the "sacred 28". The thing is, in canon, pureblood culture isn't very different from muggle culture. They celebrate Christmas like muggles, they exclaim "Oh my God" like muggles - even Draco. Their entertainment is similar as well - books and wireless, just with different authors and singers, and they lack the telly. And we see their traditions, such as gifting someone a watch for their 17th birthday.
