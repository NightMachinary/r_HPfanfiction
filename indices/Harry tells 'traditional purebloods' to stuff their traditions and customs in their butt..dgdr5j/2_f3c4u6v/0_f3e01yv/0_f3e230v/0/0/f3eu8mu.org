This is one thing I dislike most. I like to think of the wizarding world as the kid(s) in your 3rd grade class that could read at an 8th grade level, slacked off for a decade, and now, in college, is still only able to read at an 8th grade level. The wizarding world is (was?) more advanced than the Muggle one for centuries. I can admit that if I was growing up in the 40's or 50's, I definitely would have liked to live in the WW. Great healthcare, women have the same jobs as men and can vote, low cost of living...I'd be on board. In modern day though? I'd probably split between both worlds tbh.
