One of the most interesting fics I've read in HP fandom was abandoned because of JKR's comments. I'm disappointed - not with with fic author, but (even moreso) with JKR for how her nonsense is not only perpetuating bigotry, but is also driving people from their passions in the HP community. Secondary to the effect she's having on trans kids and adults, I really hate that she's marred her legacy in such a way that forces fans to have to consciously separate her from the work to enjoy it. It's a bummer.
