I mean, also pandemic. Yes, there are some authors for whom HP is irrevocably tainted by JK's commentary, but I also think that this pandemic has been rough on a lot of people and it's harder to be creative when you're under this kind of stress. I am hopeful that once people's lives get less stressful we will see updates on stories that have been sitting silently for awhile. I stopped buying licensed stuff after her awful shit about the US magical community got published, but I didn't drop the fandom because I'd rather contribute to there being more beautifully queer and actually culturally diverse stories written in this beautiful sandbox of a world.
