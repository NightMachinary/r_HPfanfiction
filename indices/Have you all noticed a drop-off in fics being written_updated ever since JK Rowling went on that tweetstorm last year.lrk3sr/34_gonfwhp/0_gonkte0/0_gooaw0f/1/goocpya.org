Transphobia doesn't mean that someone is literally scared of trans people. I don't know about you, but I think most people realize this.

You can look up the definition of the word to verify:

trans·pho·bi·a; /ˌtranzˈfōbēə/

noun

dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people.

Disagreeing with people's existence is not on the same level as disagreeing with someone for disagreeing with people's existence. There are people who disagree with black people not being second class citizens. I'd hope you wouldn't equate someone arguing against such a bigoted take with the racists as if that were the same thing.

Bye.
