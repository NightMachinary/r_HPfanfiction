Yeah, i can see that. If you're interested in my thoughts on it, I think that has a lot to do with that strategy just being effective (in certain ways) - but only if you have the numbers. Any group that's got enough numbers to shut down a conversation they don't want to have often does, and only recently have there been enough lgbtq PLUS allies (and enough of people who fall into one of these groups in positions of at least some influence) to effectively shut down those conversations.

This isn't a very scientific analysis though. What do you think?
