Yeah. I don't agree with JKR on everything and I do think some of where she gets her information are not great sources, but I'm really glad she's speaking what's true for her instead of kowtowing to mob mentality. I loved how she said in her essay that she was in her "fourth or fifth cancellation" at one point, or something along those lines. Way to take it on stride and be resilient.

What's frustrating too is that I think she has a lot of compassion and would be open to hearing different perspectives and learning more about the trans community, but people are so hateful toward her it just pushes her more towards the terfs.
