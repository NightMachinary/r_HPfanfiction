Another article about trans people standing in solidarity with JKR around domestic abuse/assault. This is an important piece for me. JKR disclosed being an assault victim in her essay, and I have seen very little compassion or respect for that experience. I'm glad to see that some people have enough nuance to understand that you can be in solidarity with someone around one issue even while disagreeing about another issue. It's called having principles, instead of just reactivity.
