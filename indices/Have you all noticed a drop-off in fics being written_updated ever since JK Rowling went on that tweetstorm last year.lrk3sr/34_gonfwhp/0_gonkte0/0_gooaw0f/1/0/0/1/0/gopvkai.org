Totally. What bothered me the most is that I saw someone saying "Don't read JKR's essay, I read it for you and it's transphobic trash" or something like that.

Like, i don't get it how people can read her essay and decry her as this evil bigot. But at least if you READ it, you are engaging with the sentiments expressed. Telling people not to read something that takes maybe 20-40 minutes (depending on reading speed) is contributing to that warping effect you mention.

And it's disappointing to me how many people don't want to investigate these issues for themselves, but just take others' word for it. Then again, that's been around for a long time...thinking of religious folks who don't even know what is written in their supposedly sacred texts, for example.
