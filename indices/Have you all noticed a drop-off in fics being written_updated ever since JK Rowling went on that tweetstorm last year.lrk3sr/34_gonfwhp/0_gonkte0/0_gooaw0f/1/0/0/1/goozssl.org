its the modern world we live in.

we can no longer have complex thinking because everyone has spent time in social media where everyone thinks just like them.

so every single person freaks out when you express a view that's slightly outside what the group they are in deems acceptable.

even more so is people do not even check the source anymore.

One person reads it goes away with an interpretation and that interpretation gets spread and warped.

we are breaking new ground in human history for so many things. and suddenly people on boths sides are like no how dare you discuss these highly nuanced and complex topics that just entered mainstream public thinking a few years ago.
