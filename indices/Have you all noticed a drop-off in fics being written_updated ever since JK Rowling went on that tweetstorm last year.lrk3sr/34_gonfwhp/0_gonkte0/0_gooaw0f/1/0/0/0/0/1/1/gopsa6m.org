This trans person hasn't voiced agreement with JKR, and I don't agree with everything she says, but she does bring more nuance to the issue than most of the dominant discourse I've seen. Of importance to me is that she empathizes with and validates JKR's reasons for concern about women's safety, even while disagreeing about strategies.

"Since she liked her first transphobic tweet, Rowling has been receiving death and rape threats on a daily basis. It's a fury I understand, but it also scares me, because the more feelings run high between transgender activists and gender-critical feminists, the further we become removed from a solution.

...I'd like to say to her: I'm not Voldemort. Really, I'm not. And I even believe that you're not Voldemort. Good and evil are not as binary in real life as they are in your books.

...Let's start being kind to one another, because only when we join hands will the world become a better place for the both of us."
