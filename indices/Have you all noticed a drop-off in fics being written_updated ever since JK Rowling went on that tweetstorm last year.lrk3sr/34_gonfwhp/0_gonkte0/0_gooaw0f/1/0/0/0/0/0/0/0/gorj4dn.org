I'm bi myself as well (or some approximation thereof) but I don't feel comfortable in a lot of lgbtq spaces due to the dogma of hating people who have different views on things. And don't always fit in with straight people either. But I am grateful when I can find people to connect with regardless of their various identities. I went through a phase of over identifying with queer stuff; it's part of the journey, but it can also be really shallow.

That being said I'm grateful for the many lgbt activists who have worked to help society be in a place where I can more or less live my life comfortably with partners of any gender, even if they were dogmatic at times.
