No one is saying trans women attack women. The fear is that regular men will see an opportunity and take advantage of the fact that trans women dont always look the same. You cannot look at a transitioning trans woman and a man side by side and tell me which one is a man who doesn't mind looking slightly feminine in order to avoid detection and a trans women. Pretending like it's not going to happen doesn't mean it wont the fact that "it doesn't happen" also doesn't mean anything because this is a discussion about making changes to who is allowed in restrooms the concern isn't that it does happen it's that it could if we dont address the possibility. Personally, I dont often use public restrooms, so no it's not a phobia of mine. I do understand that it's a valid concern that should be discussed though and I am trying to make you understand that it's not irrational and that discussing restroom safety would be a better alternative than demeening women that are concerned about the possibility (see cameras in toilets for more examples of the lengths men go to, I could come up with more but I'm not going to waste my time just to have you disregard everything I said and tell me I need therapy). I am getting concerned about you, you have suggested more than once that people with valid talking points need to "seek help". Normally people project their own issues on to others, do you have a good therapist? Tell me to seek help again, it makes you sound so sophisticated. Not at all like your gaslighting...
