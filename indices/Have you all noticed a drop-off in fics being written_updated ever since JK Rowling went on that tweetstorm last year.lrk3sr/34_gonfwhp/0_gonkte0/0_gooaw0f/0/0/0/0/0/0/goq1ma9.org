I'm not afraid of men, I understand how someone could be concerned about womens safety in restrooms though and I wont stand by and pretend it's ok to invalidate a woman who was assaulted in a restroom when she chooses to use her platform to bring it up. You're picturing a man dressing up in heels and a dress. You dont have to wear a dress to be trans you dont even have to look like a woman to be trans whose to say you aren't transitioning and had to wear pants and a tshirt that day, why does he have to dress as a girl at all to gain access, many men grow their hair out these days and even that isn't necessarily required to be trans, it's legal for him to be in there and all he has to do is say hes trans if someone dares question him. You see enough men in various transitions to womanhood in the women's restroom you stop questioning it as a society and eventually it becomes the perfect place for men to gain access to women. No one has said it's a current issue, some people are voicing concerns about a future possibility and in response people like you are implying they're crazy. We could address the concern and start changing the bathrooms instead of telling women they are being irrational, but that would help society as a whole and tearing people down for trying to start a conversation is so much more entertaining.
