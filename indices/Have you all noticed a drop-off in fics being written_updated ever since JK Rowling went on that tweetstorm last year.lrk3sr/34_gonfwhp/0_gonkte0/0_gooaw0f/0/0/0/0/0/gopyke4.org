I've read bad fanfics with more believable plots than this. You're missing the obvious point that men who want to attack women just do it. They don't need pretend to be trans women, they just wear their normal clothes.

I guess if some rapist comes up with an overly-elaborate plan that before he rapes a woman, first he's going to pretend to be a trans woman, that unnecessary step will at least slow him down, so I don't see how it's a bad thing. I'm picturing some rapist being like, “I really want to rape someone, but first I have to find the right shoes in my size, and how am I supposed to walk in these, anyway?” If you're more afraid of this guy than of the rapists who are out there in ordinary men's clothes, you're afraid of the wrong people.
