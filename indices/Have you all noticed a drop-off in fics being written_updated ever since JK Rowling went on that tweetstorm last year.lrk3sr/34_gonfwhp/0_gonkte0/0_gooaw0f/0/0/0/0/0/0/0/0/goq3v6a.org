I'm not imagining they're safe. I am saying this could be an opportunity to discuss bathroom safety and instead of telling women who are concerned to "seek help" the conversation instead could be along the lines of yes men are pigs and will take advantage of every opportunity how can we use this movement to help women. Like I said though tearing people down is more entertaining. The trans community as a whole could have chosen to acknowledge her past experiences, condemn the society in which it was allowed to happen and start a movement to address the safety of public restrooms but instead the majority decided to call her transphobic and "cancel" her.
