Yes, women are often attacked by men, but what does this have to do with trans women? Men who attack women don't dress up as women first, they just wear their usual clothes. If you have a fear that men are going to dress up as women before attacking women, that fear is irrational, since that doesn't happen. I suggest you seek help in overcoming this phobia.
