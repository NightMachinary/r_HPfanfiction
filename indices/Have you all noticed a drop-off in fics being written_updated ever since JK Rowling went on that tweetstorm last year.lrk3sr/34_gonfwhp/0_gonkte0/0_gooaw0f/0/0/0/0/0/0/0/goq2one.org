You don't have to be a woman, cis or trans, to walk into a woman's bathroom. Anyone who wants to walk into a women's bathroom can just walk in. The only thing keeping men out is politeness, and anyone who intends to attack women in a bathroom isn't concerned about politeness anyway. There's no guard checking that your clothes are sufficiently feminine. There's no card-scanning machine for you to run your woman card through. There's no lab checking that you don't have a Y chromosome. You seem to be imagining that women's bathrooms would be safe, men-free spaces if only it weren't for trans rights, and they're not. Trans rights have no effect on this.
