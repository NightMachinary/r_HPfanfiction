Being assaulted in a bathroom is not imaginary to her. Also she wouldn't have had so many people read it if it hadn't have gotten so much bad press, that's not her fault. If, like I said, her fears were acknowledged, and used as a force for good they wouldn't have caused nearly the amount of upset as the trans community opposing her caused and it wouldn't have reached nearly as many people. Its not her fault she was assaulted and also not her fault the community as a whole tried to silence her.
