It's not an irrational fear. Women are raped, molested, and gawked at constantly it's the reality of our world, and allowing men in women's restrooms disregards women's safety. Transitioning to more private restrooms would be a worthy goal but allowing any man to put on womens clothes and enter any restroom is not the answer. There is no way to tell a real trans woman from a pervert just trying to watch women pee. She didnt say anything to indicate she's transphobic she is voicing a valid concern about women's safety. The trans movement seems to disregard women. Womens sports is another area where wins for trans community are actually losses for women. JK Rowling just tried to start a discussion and the response was disturbing. Why cant we discuss this issue? It might not happen all the time but I'm positive there are plenty of sick men out there willing to throw on some lipstick to have unlimited access to watch women pee, cause it happens... its real... it's not some made up irrational fear... men put cameras in toilets so dont tell me there aren't men out there that get off on it... There has to be a way to address the concerns of women. Calling a woman who voiced her concerns irrational makes you sexist. You are using bullying tactics to silence her. This discussion could lead to safer restrooms which would be beneficial to everyone, the gaps in American restrooms are disturbing without the addition of men, but you'd rather say she has a mental illness than talk about it. If these conversations about the nuances of our changing world can not happen then we are silencing women again which is a step backwards not forwards.
