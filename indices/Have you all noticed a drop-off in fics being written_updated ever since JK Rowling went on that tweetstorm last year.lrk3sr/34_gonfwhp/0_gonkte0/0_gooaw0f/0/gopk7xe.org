I read her essay. She's apparently afraid that trans women are actually male rapists who are just dressing up as women so they can sneak into women's spaces to attack them. That's very clearly an irrational fear.

I feel sorry for her, since it seems like people are angry at her for having this mental illness. She needs help.
