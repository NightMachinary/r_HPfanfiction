I agree, but I didn't think there would be any gain from getting into an argument about it when that person already has gone through everything JKR has done and still stands by it, and when they've admitted to transphobia anyway.

For context, I've previously been one of the most vehement posters on this sub about LGBTQ issues & equality, within the general fandom, and within this space. From my experience, going all out to crush and destroy someone who has a conservative position can sometimes be less helpful in the long term than keeping them in the space and in the conversation, and showing that there is no reason to fear trans or queer people.

However, I also understand that not everyone always has the patience or mental energy for that position which requires taking the high moral ground, especially if you are already in the victim position.
