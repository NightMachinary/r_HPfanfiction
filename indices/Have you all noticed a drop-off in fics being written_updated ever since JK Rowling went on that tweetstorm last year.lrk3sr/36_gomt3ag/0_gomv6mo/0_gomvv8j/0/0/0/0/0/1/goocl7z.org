I'm not afraid of trans people, as such. I do, however, get concerned by the things that are done in their name, such as the vitriolic reactions seen in threads like this.

Most of the time, I'm happy to live and let live, though I would tend to speak up and raise concerns about hormonal or surgical changes that have significant side effects and may not be reversible, especially in minors. The other point where I get concerned is when someone is no longer allowed to believe that transgender philosophy is mistaken - such as JKR asserting that womanhood is about biological sex, citing a number of concerns with changing that, and having people explode in fury, boycott her books, etc.

I get a real "Emperor's New Clothes" vibe from the whole movement. And it occurs to me that the kiddie story doesn't actually depict what would happen if the ministers of state and other government officials had stood their ground and said, I don't see the clothes. Would they indeed have been judged unfit for their offices, fired, perhaps ostracised? The fairy tale doesn't show it, but let's not act it out.
