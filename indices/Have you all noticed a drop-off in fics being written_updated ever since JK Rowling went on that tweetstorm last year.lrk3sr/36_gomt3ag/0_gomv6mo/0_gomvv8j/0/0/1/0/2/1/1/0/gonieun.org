First of all, there's no such thing as "transgenderism". Being transgender isn't an ideology to be converted to. It's just a thing that some people are, just like some people are gay or lesbian.

Second, you're wrong. Transgender people still existed. They might not have had the words to express it as we would today, but they existed. Look up, for example, the Roman ruler [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus#Marriages,_sexuality_and_gender][Elagabalus]], who, while by no means a good person, is reported to have "delighted in being called Hierocles's mistress, wife, and queen", and is one of the first people on record requesting reassignment surgery. Or you could look up the clergy of Cybele, which included a type of eunuch called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli][gallus]], who "castrated themselves and wore women's clothing, accessories and makeup, [and therefore] some modern scholars have interpreted them as transgender". History is by no means devoid of trans people.
