If you have to ask me this question in 2021, then you've more likely than not heard the answer to this question before but ignored or dismissed it.

If you're genuinely curious, you can start by looking up the statistics regarding murders, assaults, and suicides of trans people in your country and read up on all of the contributing factors that lead to this disproportionate violence towards that community. You'll find a multitude of reading materials regarding trans rights and you can choose where to start reading.

Bye and have a nice day.
