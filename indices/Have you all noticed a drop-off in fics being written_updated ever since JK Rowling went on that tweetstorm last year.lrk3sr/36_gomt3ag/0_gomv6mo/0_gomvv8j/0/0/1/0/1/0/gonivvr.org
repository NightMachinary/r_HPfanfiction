If your personal beliefs lead you to, whether you realize you're doing it or not, shit all over trans people and their existence, then you hold some shit beliefs.

Do you feel the same way about gay people?

And as a side response to one of your other ignorant comments in this thread, lgbt people have existed since before homo sapiens sapiens evolved into existence. That includes trans people. Just because most schools don't bother teaching it and a lot of historians used to sweep it under the rug doesn't mean that ancient people weren't hella gay and trans.

Arguing otherwise is no different than the people who try to say that homosexuality doesn't exist in nature when it very, /very/ clearly does.
