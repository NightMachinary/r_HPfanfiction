I'm sorry to hear that. I'm also a queer writer, and I love enjoying the worlds we all come up with ourselves, independent of JKR. It never really felt like /hers/ rather than /ours/ and everyone else in the fandom, but I get that the memory of it is probably stained for a lot of people. I hope you change your mind, but I understand if you don't.
