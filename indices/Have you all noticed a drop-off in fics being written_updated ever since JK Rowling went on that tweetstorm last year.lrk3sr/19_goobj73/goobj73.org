As a LGBTQ+ writer, I just spitefully add queer characters to my stories, but after I'm finished with the current series I'm working on, I'm thinking of hanging up the HP hat, there's too much bitterness because of JK's fuckery to want to enjoy the world anymore.

But also, the pandemic is really making leisure activities like fanfic writing a challenge, I can imagine that its the same for a lot of other writers.
