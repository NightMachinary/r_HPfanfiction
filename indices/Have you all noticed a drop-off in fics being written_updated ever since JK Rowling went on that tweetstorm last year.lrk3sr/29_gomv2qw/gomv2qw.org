I wasn't too bothered by the original tweets and essay, people have different political opinions and all. I was bothered by the BBC giving her an award for her essay full of misconceptions. The BBC has become increasingly transphobic, which is worrying as it's regarded as this neutral voice of reason in the UK.

I haven't stopped writing HP fanfic, although I have been focusing on original fiction and school work recently, so I've slowed down quite a lot.
