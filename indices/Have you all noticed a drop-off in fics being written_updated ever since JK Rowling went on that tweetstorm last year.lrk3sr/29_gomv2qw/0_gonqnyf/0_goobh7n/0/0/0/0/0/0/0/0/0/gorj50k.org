Well, I see no reason that transgender people cannot exist within a society that destroys gender hierarchies. Radical feminism and the validity and existence of trans people aren't diametrically opposed.

It is beyond me how you can see the two as incompatible, but judging by how you're so quick to jump to making farcical arguments regarding 'trans-racialism' while at the same time completely ignoring how TERFs regularly work alongside homophobic conservative parties and out and about Neo-Nazis, harass trans people with the intention of suicide baiting, and act in a generally abhorrent manner in every interaction they have with trans people, you either:

A) Have little to no understanding of the science and research behind gender dysphoria and the transgender experience.

B) Hold, at the least, TERF adjacent views (again, judging by your jump to trans-racialism as though that is some sort of argument).
