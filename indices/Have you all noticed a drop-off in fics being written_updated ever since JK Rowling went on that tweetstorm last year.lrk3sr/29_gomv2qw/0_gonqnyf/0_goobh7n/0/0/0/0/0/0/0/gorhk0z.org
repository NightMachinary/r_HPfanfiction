No. That means that feminism isn't respecting of the scientific consensus.

All of the data supports transitioning for transfolk. When the tenets of a philosophy - feminism - conflicts with that of science, we take facts over the theoretical.

The fact that you would compare trans people to others dyeing their skin shows an innate misunderstanding of what it is to be transgender, and is the long-winded equivalent of making a helicopter joke, or saying "What if someone identifies as a chair" or some other such nonsense.

Know what you're advocating for, by wishing people would be unconcerned about how they identify? Conversion therapy. You're making the argument, or equivalent, that trans people should just be happy to be who they are and not live their lives in the most fulfilling manner they can. Also, in a manner that does not hurt anyone or infringe on anyone else's rights.

What you've essentially just said, is, "Shouldn't gay people just learn to be happy to be born as they are, and date the opposite sex?"

You're placing the tenets of a philosophy, one that can be ever-shifting, over the absolute plurality of research that indicates that when transgender people take steps (whichever ones /they/ find comfortable and necessary whilst under medical supervision) to live their lives as they feel they best should, they are immensely more happy.

What you are saying is an indirect contributor to the 41% suicide rate statistic, because you're suggesting that - against all data and reason - transgender people stay unhappy in their current living situation for the sake of a philosophy that judging by your personal interpretation refuses to adjust to the modern era.

Again, all you are doing right now is suggesting the equivalent of conversion therapy, and I'm disappointed that you would make that reach.
