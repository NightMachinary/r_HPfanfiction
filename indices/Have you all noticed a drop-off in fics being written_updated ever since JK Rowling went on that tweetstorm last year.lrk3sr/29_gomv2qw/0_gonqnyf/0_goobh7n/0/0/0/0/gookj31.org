Actually, my understanding is that the basis of radical feminism is the idea that sex and/or gender shouldn't restrict you. No matter what your secondary sexual characteristics may be, you can do anything. Merely taking away the hierarchy would be something less than radical.

And as long as someone merely claims a preferred gender and pronouns, there's likely no conflict.

The clash arises when gender dysphoria enters the picture - and as far as I can tell, it's pretty inextricably entwined with the whole transgender movement. If someone says that they /need/ to alter their appearance, that they can't truly live as themselves unless they change their secondary sexual characteristics, then they are rejecting the idea that those things make no real difference.

As soon as you introduce the idea that someone needs to have a particular body shape in order to fill a societal role - even if that need is imposed from within - you've stepped away from radical feminism. If you feel that you must be a woman because you like lipstick, or dresses, then have you not embraced last century's gender stereotypes? Changing your body because you're curious would be one thing, but changing your body because you feel it's /necessary/ is something else, and not particularly compatible with feminist principles.
