Yes, so why do they get so bent out of shape over trans people living their lives? Isn't it so strange that these people are essentially gender abolitionists, yet gender essentialists at the same time? They contradict themselves through their own rhetoric.

Radical Feminism is a type of feminism developed in the 60's, radical comes from the word "root", they believe the root of women's oppression is patriarchal gender relations and they believe in revolution, not reform, to fix it.

Some people make transphobic readings of how radical feminists view gender, the term TERF was actually coined by a radical feminist that wanted to distance Radical Feminism from transphobia by making it clear that they did not represent Radical Feminism as a whole.

And for your other point regarding dysphoria, trans people /must/ exhibit dysphoria. That's kind of the definition of being trans, is being uncomfortable and unhappy in the body and role you were born into. That's a very very quick summation, but that's an intrinsic part of it. I have no idea what you mean by transgender people not being compatible with feminist principles. Which ones exactly, and are they actually followed in the broader form or are they more like ancient commonlaw that only bigots, pedants, and sovereign citizens care about?

Know what bothers me about TERFs? It's that they're hateful. It's that they're hypocrites.

She makes no mention of the things they have done in any detail, completely glossing over the method in which they conduct themselves - behaviour and speech that could be compared to Klansmen rallying against black people.

So, these people say they're worried about women's rights, but when confronted as to why, and what about, they have nothing to actually discuss. Their political motives come solely from fear, hatred, or unabashed misunderstanding of the actual process and science behind what makes a trans person trans, and the ways they can move forward and live their lives.
