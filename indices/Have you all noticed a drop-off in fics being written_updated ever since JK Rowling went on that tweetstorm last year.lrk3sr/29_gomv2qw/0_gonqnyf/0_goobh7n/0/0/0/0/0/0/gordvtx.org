  That's kind of the definition of being trans, is being uncomfortable and unhappy in the body and role you were born into.

Feminism, though, would say that the proper fix is to ensure that all bodies are respected and no one is locked into any particular role by virtue of their body. So, if trans people don't think that it's possible to be free of limitations while keeping the bodies they're in, then they don't really accept that feminism works.

Suppose you were working tirelessly to ensure racial equality, and then you encountered a group of people with dark skin who tell you that they believe they're the same on the inside as the white-skinned people around them - and so, to embrace that sameness, they're going to bleach their skin white. Would you say that their goals are compatible with yours? Or that they've missed the point and are inadvertently perpetuating harmful ideas about white superiority? Wouldn't you want them to instead be /unconcerned/ about their skin colour, because in an equal society it shouldn't matter at all?
