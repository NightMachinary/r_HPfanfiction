Radical feminism literally just calls for the reordering of society so that there's no more hierarchy when it comes to men, women, and all in between.

I don't understand how, in any way, that cannot be reconciled with trans people existing and living their lives without having TERFs attempt to strip their rights away.

Radical feminists, by the definition of the term, should be pro-trans. TERFs have co-opted the meaning of radical feminism and turned it into something fueled solely by bigotry.
