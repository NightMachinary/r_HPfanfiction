The term TERF was coined by them as a name for themselves. They literally gave themselves that name, and now say it's an insult. It's petty and ridiculous, especially for such a hateful group of bigots.

Women are women. Men are men. Transwomen are women. Transmen are men. TERFs exclude women, and infantilize men, standing against all scientific consensus, based on a poor understanding of grade school biology.

They look at transwomen as invaders, and they look at transmen as women who have decided to chase after privilege or just don't know any better.

By excluding trans people and in turn treating them as either children or predators, they are anti-feminist.
