Very occasionally, but in reality I think the fanfic fandom has been separate for a long time - it's got a whole life of its own that doesn't require JK Rowling to input anymore. I've seen quite a few authors notes commenting on it though, and separating their story from the views.

I think I have noticed a big impact of the pandemic. I originally thought I'd write more now I had lots of time at home, but actually the lethargy that pandemic life has left me with has meant I wrote nothing for a year, and I've felt like quite a few authors have been acting the same.
