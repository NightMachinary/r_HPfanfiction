I read her comments, got disgusted by her views . . . And proceeded to make sure my fic had non binary/trans characters. I mean, JKR invented metamorphmagi. People who can change their appearance at will. It's beautiful! So I decided I was just going to go all out with those possibilities as a little f you to the creator.

I think it depends on the person though. Some people reacted by leaving all aspects of the fandom and I totally understand and support that. I think the rest decided the fandom is it's own thing now, apart from JKR, and it doesn't take much to see how amazingly a lot of writers have incorporated trans/lgbt characters into their work.
