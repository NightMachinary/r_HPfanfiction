Genuine question. Do you take joy in being hateful? Does it bring you happiness, to purposefully go out of your way to attack someone?

Do you spend your time on street corners yelling slurs at black people, just because it sounds like fun to you?

I'm actually curious, because I can't wrap my head around someone being so intentionally vile and taking pleasure in their actions.
