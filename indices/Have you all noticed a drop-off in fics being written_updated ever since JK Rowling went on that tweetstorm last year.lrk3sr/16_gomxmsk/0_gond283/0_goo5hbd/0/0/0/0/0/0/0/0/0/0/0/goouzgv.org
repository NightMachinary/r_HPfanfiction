J.K. Rowling has massive social influence. What about this statement is false.

Also, you're really making it difficult to think you're anything but a conservative, by labeling... people pointing out bigotry as bigotry "the newest Twitter & Tumblr wokenessâ„¢."

J.K. Rowling, if not to be described as transphobic, espouses transphobic rhetoric and supports transphobia through her actions. She may not express hatred herself, but the consequences of her actions are the same. This is pretty much undeniable, and I've covered it extensively elsewhere in the thread.
