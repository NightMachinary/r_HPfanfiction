Bro. She's one of the richest people in the world, with one of the most (if not /the/ most) influential franchises and modern stories the human race has ever seen.

Her name and creations are as recognizable as McDonalds and Mickey Mouse. How does she /not/ have a platform through that incredible amount of wealth and fame?

When she wrote her manifesto it made the news in pretty much every major station, because someone of her status and influence had spoken up, brazenly so, and voiced bigoted opinions.

If you can't understand how she has a platform, then I'm sorry to say but critical thinking is beyond you.
