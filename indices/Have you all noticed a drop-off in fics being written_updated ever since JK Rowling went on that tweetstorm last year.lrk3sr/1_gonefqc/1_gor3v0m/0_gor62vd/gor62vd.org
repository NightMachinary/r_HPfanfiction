I'd love to, but there isn't really a way of doing that with Ao3's system. You can sort by date last updated, but not by publish date. Honestly though, if the story is abandoned or complete doesn't really matter for this analysis, as long as those 'completed abandoned' stories are truly abandoned and the writer doesn't come back and update them (which I'm sure does happen, though hopefully its rare enough to not be noticeable).

Part of my longer term project may touch touch on this though. I'm looking at the HP stories on Ao3 with the most Kudos (probably going to do the top 1000), cataloguing by update and publish date, word count, pairings, etc. I'm just getting started, but so far, most of these top fics were published earlier. Again, this method will have a ton of recency bias since obviously earlier fics will have more time to accumulate kudos. But this apparent discrepancy is interesting and there are a few possibilities that I'm looking at.
