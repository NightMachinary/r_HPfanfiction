There are some ways of looking at this quantitatively. Ao3 gives you the ability to sort fics by date last updated. Of course, doing this doesn't help because a lot of fics last updated in 2020 are going to be updated at some point. However, you can also only include completed fics, which resolves this. This way, you can look at how many fics have been completed each year. The trend is actually the /opposite/ from what I expected.

- 2020: 44533 stories completed
- 2019: 29146
- 2018: 24900
- 2017: 24000
- 2016: 19781
- 2015: 14222
- 2014: 12642

Now, there could be some recency bias here (some authors may update 'completed' works maybe). The big surge in 2020 is probably due to the pandemic. Some of this growth is also probably due to Ao3 drawing people away from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] (and is thus illusory growth for the fandom as a whole). This is also an incomplete picture in terms of kudos/bookmarks/engagement. I'm working on a more detailed statistical look at the state of HP fanfic over the years.

With all these caveats aside, it doesn't seem like HP fanfiction is going anywhere.
