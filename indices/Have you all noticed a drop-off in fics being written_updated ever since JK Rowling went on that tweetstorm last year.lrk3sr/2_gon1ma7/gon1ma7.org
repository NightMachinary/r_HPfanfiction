I've noticed it in the past year. I chalked it up to COVID honestly and JK didn't even cross my mind. Some of the authors I follow have been open about how they've been out of work, picking up second and third jobs, suffering from COVID, working in hospitals and the like. Not to mention if they have kids at home all day. Updating fanfiction that they aren't getting paid for is probably the last thing.
