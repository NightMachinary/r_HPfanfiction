Sometimes I feel like the only English major when I see people dis Harry Potter for JKs opinions. The first thing you learn in literary criticism is that the author is dead. It hasn't affected my interest in HP at all, but I would of course like JK to learn more about the subjects she talks on because she remains a hugely wealthy and influential person in the world. I just ignore her in the mean time.
