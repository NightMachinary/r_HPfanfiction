I think you have the wrong subreddit, you want [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]

Although from what I've seen, the people there aren't likely to be more sympathetic.

If you want to defend JKR's comments, I'd suggest studying them more, so you can explain yourself more clearly, rather than just making yourself sound like a bigot on a rant.
