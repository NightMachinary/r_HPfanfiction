No. I think it's been on a general downward trend since the books and movies wrapped up, but I don't think that has been exacerbated by JK Rowling's views. Not to say that there aren't some writers who were put off for that reason, but I think the majority still fall into the following groups:

- Don't know what she said.
- Don't care what she said.
- Agree with what she said.
- Disagree with what she said, but separate art from artist.
