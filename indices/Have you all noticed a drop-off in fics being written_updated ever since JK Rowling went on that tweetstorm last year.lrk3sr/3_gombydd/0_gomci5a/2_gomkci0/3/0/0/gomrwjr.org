That's unique in its space though. People have been wanting a more fleshed out game for ages. There hasn't been demand for a show as far as I'm aware. The movies were bad in particular ways because we are very immersed in this space, but they were largely successful. The teen dark magic/power shows have been dwindling lately so a Hogwarts show would need to be unique, and it would be heavily criticised if diversity and portrayals are very bad.
