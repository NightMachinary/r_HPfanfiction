Hmm I wish you could put a venn diagram in a list haha

The two circles would be "yes" and "no" in response to the question "does this person separate the art from the artiat?" And the overlap would be "depends"

Personally, I enjoy the world she created (thats why I'm here haha.) I didn't lose my enjoyment of Hogwarts and the saga of Harry Potter just because of Rowling directly. But when it comes to products and productions that occur after some of the things she has said and after the way she has treated her world and her characters? I don't really want to give her the positive feedback of increased sales.

Edit: "venn" not "vent"
