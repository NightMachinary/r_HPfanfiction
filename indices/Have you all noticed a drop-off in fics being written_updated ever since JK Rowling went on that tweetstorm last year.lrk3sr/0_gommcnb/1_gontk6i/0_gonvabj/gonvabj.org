You might want to try installing Firefox then. There is what's called Reader Mode (I think, I've got Firefox in my native language, so I'm giving a translation). What it does is basically take any text on a website and change into a uniform, easy to read format. It's the only thing I even use anymore to read fics on either platform. You can activate by a little icon on the url bar. Or maybe try finding an extension if you're using Chrome.
