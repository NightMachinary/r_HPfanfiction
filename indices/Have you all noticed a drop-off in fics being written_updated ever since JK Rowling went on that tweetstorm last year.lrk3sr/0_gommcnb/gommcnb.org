So I mostly read on AO3 because I find the format easier on my eyes.

The main way I search for stories on there is filtering the ones that are complete and then viewing by date completed and I have absolutely noticed a slow down in *completed* stories. I don't know if that's because stories are being abandoned or if authors are completing things more slowly but there have been days when there are only a handful of new stories.

The other cool thing about AO3 is you can also sort by specific time frames so it would be easy, if somewhat tedious to figure out how many stories were completed in a single month this year and comparing that to last year, 2 years ago or more.

OH and I have also seen authors notes disavowing JK's tweet and basically saying that they don't agree with her and *that* is why they are going to keep on with their stories.
