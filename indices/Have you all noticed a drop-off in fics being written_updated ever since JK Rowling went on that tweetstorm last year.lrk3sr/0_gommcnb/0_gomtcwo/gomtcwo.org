personally i think it's taking longer for fics to be completed because the majority of stories i have read in the past year or so or am currently reading generally have the rate of 1 chapter a month or slower yet 95% of them have not been abandon with a lot of them being complete or are on their way to completion and probably will reach it,unless something bad happens to the authors.

I have also noted the trend of fics being planned out or the writers thinking where they want the story to go. As i see less and less of "i didn't like how this story is going, rewrite coming", This probably helps them reach completion.
