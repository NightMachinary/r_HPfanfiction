I don't think there's been an impact among the fics I read. In fact, in some cases, I feel I've seen more fics.

I think the pandemic has had more of an impact on Harry Potter fanfiction than anything JKR said this past year. People stressed about unemployment or the virus may not be up to write while those who are furloughed and not too worried about money may be able to hunker down and write more. Only one author I follow said anything about JKR. I've stumbled upon a couple fics where the author said something about JKR, but as a whole, I've seen far more mention unemployment or the pandemic.

Personally, I'm glad most authors aren't throwing in a bunch of author's notes about whether they agree or disagree with JKR's tweets. Fanfiction for this series separated from her a long time ago.
