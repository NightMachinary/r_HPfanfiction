I've been reading some great fanfics lately that are doing a great job of addressing issues of bigotry, racism and anti-LGBTQI+ sentiment within the HP-verse. I feel sad that I feel I can no longer wear any of the merch I bought prior to JK outing herself as a transphobe, but I refuse to signal implied support for her attitudes to my trans friends and students. Although a trans kid I taught last year told me that it's OK to wear HP merch if you stole it.
