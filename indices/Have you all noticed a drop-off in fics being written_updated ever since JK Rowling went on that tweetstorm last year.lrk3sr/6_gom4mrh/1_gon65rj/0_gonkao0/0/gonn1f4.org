I'm reading the ‘Of a Linear Circle' series by flamethrower at the moment. It's very character driven and the world building is amazing. The author seems to be a bit of an old languages buff - the breakdown of the meanings of words in various languages is very involved. I also love all the plot twists. Some of them have enough clues dropped that I love the ‘Ah ha!' moment when I find that I'm right and others really catch me out. It's done in a way that makes sense though, where you're able to see the subtle foreshadowing after the fact.
