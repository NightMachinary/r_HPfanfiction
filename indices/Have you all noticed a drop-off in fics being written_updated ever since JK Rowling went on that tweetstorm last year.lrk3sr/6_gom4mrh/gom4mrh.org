I've always been pretty good at divorcing the art from the artist, so to speak. I enjoy seeking out works by fan fiction authors who are reclaiming the HP universe for their own in defiance of its creator. I don't agree with JK but I won't let her ignorance ruin something I enjoy. I will do my best to never put another penny of my money into her pocket, but since she doesn't profit off of fanfiction I don't feel morally conflicted by continuing to read or write it.
