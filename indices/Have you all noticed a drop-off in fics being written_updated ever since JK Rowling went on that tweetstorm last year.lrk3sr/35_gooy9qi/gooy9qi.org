It's amazing the fandom hadn't died out yet. Part of the magic of it is the eternal appeal to those books. No matter how many times I've read them I still every once in a while will open them again, and someone else will enter the fandom and keep it alive. I doubt JKR will manage to kill the fandom all by herself. I mean, we basically shunted her out already.
