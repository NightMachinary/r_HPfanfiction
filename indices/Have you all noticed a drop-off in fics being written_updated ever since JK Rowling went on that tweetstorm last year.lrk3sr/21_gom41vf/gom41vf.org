It's entirely possible. Her comments did rub a lot of people the wrong way.

To me, I think there was a lot of knee-jerk reactions to it. Obviously her initial tweets were offensive and she completely went about it the wrong way, but when she wrote her explanation essay I thought she had some valid points, but made the wrong decision in how she expressed them.

Personally, I'm able to separate the universe from JKR herself, so it hasn't affected my views on the fandom at all.
