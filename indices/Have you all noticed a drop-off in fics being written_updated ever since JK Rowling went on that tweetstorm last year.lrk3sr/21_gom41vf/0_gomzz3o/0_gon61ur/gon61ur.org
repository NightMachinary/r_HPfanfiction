Okay, in the interests of a fair and clear discussion, I will say what I think was valid, and you are free to disagree and correct me if necessary. I am always happy to learn if I am wrong.

I felt it was valid that she was concerned that if all a man has to do in order to gain access to a female bathroom is claim to be trans without any official recognition, it creates a danger for women, particularly in light of her own experience at being assaulted in a bathroom. I can also understand how this could be taken as her saying "all trans women are evil perverts who are a threat to women", but I truly believe that is not what she meant. I believe she meant that most trans people are perfectly safe, normal individuals, but it only takes one person abusing the system to create an issue.

I also think she has a point when discussing how young people who were depressed/low/confused/not in a good state of mind could be influenced by people they speak to online into thinking they are trans when they are not. As well all know, teenagers are both emotional and easily influenced. It would not be a good thing for somebody to be convinced that they are something they are not by an outside influence. If somebody is trans, and they come to that conclusion naturally and by themselves, I would wholeheartedly support them, but if they have been influenced by somebody who has taken advantage of their mental state, I would be concerned.

While we're on the subject, I have seen some people labelling her as "TERF". I don't agree with using this label, as I think labelling her as that is also harmful in its own way.

If I have taken the wrong conclusions from what she has written or have said anything offensive in my explanation, please please don't hesitate to correct me. I would like to be educated better on the subject.
