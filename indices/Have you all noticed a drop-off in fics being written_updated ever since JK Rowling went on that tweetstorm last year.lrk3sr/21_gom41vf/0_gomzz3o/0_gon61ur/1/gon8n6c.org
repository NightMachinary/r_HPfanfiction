  I felt it was valid that she was concerned that if all a man has to do in order to gain access to a female bathroom is claim to be trans without any official recognition, it creates a danger for women

And your feeling in this instance is wrong. It just is. Have you actually looked at the data for assaults in women's restrooms by men pretending to be woman? It turns out that doesn't happen. If a man wants to assault a woman in a restroom, he'll just ... do it.

  young people who were depressed/low/confused/not in a good state of mind could be influenced by people they speak to online into thinking they are trans when they are not.

Also erroneous. Check out the rate of people who detransition. Medical procedures with a regret rate as low are considered astounding successes. People don't tend to think they're trans when they're not. Again, check the data.

  I have seen some people labelling her as "TERF". I don't agree with using this label, as I think labelling her as that is also harmful in its own way.

This is wrong in such a terrible way that I'm honestly not sure if you're trolling. To put it in another way, this is like equating targets of racism to people who say that some people are racist. This is both-sidesism pushed to such a toxic extreme that I'm halfway convinced that you'll actually agree with the comparison I just made and then proceed to say anti-racists really /are/ just as bad.
