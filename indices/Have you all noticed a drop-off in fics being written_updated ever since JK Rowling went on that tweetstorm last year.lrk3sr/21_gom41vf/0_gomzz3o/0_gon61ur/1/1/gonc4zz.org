You're right, I have not looked at the data in either case, so I don't know.

You raise a good point that men will just go ahead and assault someone if they are going to. Again, I think this is her own experience colouring her views on the issue. I don't necessarily agree with her view now that you have pointed that out, but I can still understand why she thinks it.

I do not think that anti-racists are bad, in any way. Please don't put those sorts of words in my mouth. I just think that, in this case, when somebody says something like "ugh, shut up, TERF" instead of calmly explaining why she is wrong, it accomplishes nothing and creates more hate. It's not the same as calling somebody a racist, because racism is pretty much universally agreed to be a bad thing, so does not need explaining to anybody. TERF is such a new term that it can't really be thrown around without explanation in the same way.

Thanks for taking the time to reply, though. You have made me reconsider my opinions, and I feel better educated.
