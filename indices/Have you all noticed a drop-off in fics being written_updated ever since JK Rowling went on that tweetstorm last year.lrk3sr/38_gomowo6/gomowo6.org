I think that there are still a lot of fics, both new and continuing... but they're just not as good as the older ones. For one thing, most possible plotlines have already been done a thousand times, so everything feels a bit derivative by now. For another, the stories that came out, or at least started, before JKR turned a magical world into a McGuffin hunt (i.e. before book 6 dropped) are FAR better than the trash that resulted from having to deal with her obsession with trinkets. And finally, I think that most of the stories that come out now are some combination of bad slash-fics or pairings of terrible people (Snape, Draco, Voldemort) with their favorite character, Marauder-era, or dealing with Harry's kids, and I find none of that interesting.

tl;dr: No, I don't think there are fewer fics. I think there are far, FAR fewer decent fics.
