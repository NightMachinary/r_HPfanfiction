I had just started trying my hand at writing a Lupin centric fic when I learned about her tweet. It was originally going to be rated G, easily. I heard about her tweet, verified it, and became extremely irritated. I'm an ally, pure and simple. Suddenly that sweet little rated G fic became... not.

Lupin became transgendered, and for a while the story was about his struggle with his identity, pulling from the struggles some m-f friends explained to me years ago. JKR also said there were no wizarding universities but I disregarded that as well and had a group of Oxford students on the wizarding side come together and create a ritual to help his outward appearance reflect who he really was. Human trial one created a hermaphrodite, but a homosexual couple were excited because they could have a biological child together thanks to the discovery.

Lupin's second trial was successful and I gave him an obsession with toys because toys can't contract lycanthropy and he didn't want to possibly transmit even the milder form of the disease that Bill received in canon. Later, Lupin found a nice fey man who couldn't contact lycanthropy because he wasn't human to begin with. That's when the fic turned decidedly adult, not that it wasn't with its other themes, but it went from just rated R to rated X.

I liked my emotional depiction of Lupin so well, it has become head canon for me. Even when he doesn't make an appearance at all, off camera somewhere, is a Lupin struggling with his identity. Now /I'm/ the one struggling because I'm trying to write a fic for the late '70s that would be unchanged from Harry's POV up until Halloween 1981. The struggle is because if Lupin becomes a more predominant character, which I don't see how I can keep him out of this story, is personifying him properly and getting into his mindset that would be compliant with him possibly falling in love with Tonks someday.
