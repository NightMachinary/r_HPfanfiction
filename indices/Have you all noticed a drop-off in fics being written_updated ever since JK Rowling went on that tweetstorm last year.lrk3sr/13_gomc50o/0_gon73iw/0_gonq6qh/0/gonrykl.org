Aw, thank you! There's no link though. After I vented my frustration and felt better, the story started veering away from Lupin and I abandoned it. I've given up attempting to write Lupin centric fics, I'm afraid he'll always have a supportive role for me. I didn't know Trans!Lupin had its own trope, that's cool. Tell me more?

I decided long ago I wouldn't start posting a fic until I complete it because I mostly write for self therapy and frequently I'll be working through something when a different night terror takes presidence in my mind. I have a bunch of unfinished fics in my Google docs drive.
