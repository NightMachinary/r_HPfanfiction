Damn, I'm sorry! Anything I have on docs that I think would upset me to lose I actually have handwritten. I have a few fics I've been working on for a few years that started hardcopy. Most compilations of notes that aren't in story form yet, but I will take your advice anyway. I'll probably email them to my self to have two back ups instead of one like I did university papers. If you can get those links back, I'd love to see them. What do you prefer to write?
