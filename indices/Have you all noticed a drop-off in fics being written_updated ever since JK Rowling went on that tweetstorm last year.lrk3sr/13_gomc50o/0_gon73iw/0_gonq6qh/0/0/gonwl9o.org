Ah, that's fair! Though, I will say that a bunch of my favorite fics are unfinished and never will be finished, but I don't regret reading them and occasionally choose to re-read them even though I know they're unfinished because they still bring me joy, so if you ever do decide to post things then you will still have appreciative readers even if you say straight up that a story will never be finished.

As far as trans!Lupin, he often shows up in muggle AUs, usually some kind of college kids situation. I also read one where Lupin isn't a werewolf, he was cursed with a physical sex change and it's a huge secret because weird inheritance reasons and weird wizarding law hangups, so he struggles with lots of dysphoria and his monthly transformations are replaced with him hiding his period. I don't have access to my computer right now and I had a major cloud loss recently, or I'd give you a list from my personal database of HP fics I've saved.

Also, on the subject of Google Drive and data loss, remember to have a second backup location! I lost access to my google account a little over a week ago and am still fighting to get it back (google won't tell me what TOS violation they think I did, I'm pretty sure it's bullshit and an error, but either way the current result is I can't get at my in-progress work) so I'd recommend taking the time to back everything up either on a different cloud service or on a physical device! We all trust Google, but apparently they can just no warning shut your account down and not tell you why. /frustrated shrug/
