I think my peeve is when character behavior is inexplicably illogical, or runs counter to the established plot.

Like a character being given a passphrase to make sure the other person is the real deal, and not an imposter, /uses/ that passphrase, and /still/ fails to spot the imposter.

Or another example, when a character has had a best friend for years, spends an entire bloody day crying in a bathroom when an acquaintance tells her she has no friends.
