I have grown quite annoyed at muggle-wank. Yeah, the wizarding society is not perfect, petty much all seven books are dedicated to deal with the great problem with racism, but generally the author take it beyond the absurd. An example is the tendency of making intervention and cultural colonization from what amounts to a foreign nation seem universally good for everyone at the same time it makes muggle society seem unreasonable better than the magic one, hand-waving any real world problem as insignificant at the same time it makes any problem at the magic society overwhelmingly terrible. Or when fanfics make all witches and wizard, even power-houses like Dumbledore or Voldemort, seem like defenseless sitting ducks compared to muggles, I mean, come on, Grindewald essentially was a Deus ex machina away from razing Paris to the ground and Voldemort freely attacked the muggles of Britain petty much since the forties.
