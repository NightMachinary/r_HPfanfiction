I dislike it when some authors refer to characters with 'the Gryffindor', 'the Slytherin', 'the blond one', 'the brunette' or such. ("Harry looked baffled. He wondered what the blond one meant with his outburst." for example. This is not from any actual fic.) Use their names please. Harry's (just) Harry. Not 'the green eyed boy'. It's cute on occasion but not in constant use.
