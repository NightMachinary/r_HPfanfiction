Stepping Back, linkffn(12317784)

​

Harry has to go back into the past after the DoM battle. The wizarding world is screwed because of Voldemort. Too many families wiped out, this causes too many squibs. Throw in the fact that too many Death Eaters got away with it. The British Magical world was on its way to a slow agonizing death.

​

Harry goes back into time for Marauder's Era 6th year? This is right around the same time that Voldemort made his first "public" appearance in recruiting.

​

It has a bit of angst about the whole "look at who people are /now/ instead of who they are in the /future/"
