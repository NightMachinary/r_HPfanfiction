  Who's so good at magic that he manages to do it just fine even with a broken wand, something neither Harry nor Ron could do?

His wand /isn't/ broken. That's what he tells people because a lot of awkward questions would be asked if the public got wind that Albus Dumbledore owns a wand with which he can casually fix snapped wands for his friends. (And because he legally /isn't/ allowed to carry a wand anymore, of course.)

  He hates the Slytherin House, all because it pains him to see what has become of it.

...or simply because he has a cover to maintain, seems more straightforward to me.
