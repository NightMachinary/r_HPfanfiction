I know it's very popular to set this narrative that Harry becoming an Auror was some kind of world expectation + Rowling betraying her Tory leanings, but in canon, Harry is well suited for the job.

He has a nose for trouble, investigates and puts together various pieces well, and seems to genuinely enjoy Defense Against the Dark Arts. Remember in PS/SS, he's the one that puts the clues together on how Hagrid got the dragon egg and why that means that Voldemort/Snape found their way past Fluffy.

I can also see him thinking that he wants to hunt down and capture Dark Wizards to prevent another Voldemort from happening again, and if he can prevent another family from going through what he went through, he'll consider that a good day's work
