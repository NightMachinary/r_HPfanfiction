It is, and one of the weirder bits at that. Why would you actually create an inferior version of Harry compared to the existing one? No one ever thought that mediocrity was an interesting character trait.

Harry doesn't want to be normal /or/ "just Harry", he wants to be the one to kill Voldemort. That's about as un-normal as it gets.
