I know you wrote no time travel but the first book of Amulet of Time was just too amazing not to mention. It's an old gem which started even pre OotP. But as the series of four finished books grew, the author managed to fit in the deathly hallows well enough. The founder time in this isn't just a setting. It's a lot about how exactly Hogwarts was founded and the first children who went there. F.e Rowena Ravenclaws daughter. It shows how Peeves became a Poltergeist and so much about ancient (wizarding) society. The founders also have a huge role in it. I admit, it could be that it sometimes might be a little ooc and super!harry and a bit much in general. (The nurse is some fairy if I remember right, who of course teaches Harry about ancient but super efficient healing tactics etc.) I read it when I was 14 and it was one of the first fanfics I have read so I can't really guarantee that it would still be considered quality work. But I remember still enjoying it when I reread it at around 16 or 17. I think I might be rereading the series soon.
