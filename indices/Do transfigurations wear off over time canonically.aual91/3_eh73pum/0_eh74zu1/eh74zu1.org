At first blush, Transfiguration would appear to completely eradicate the goods economy, leaving only demand for services (which, it should be said, is still a substantial part of the economy). However, on further analysis, there are six factors preserving the wizarding goods economy:

1. Gamp's Law has five principal exceptions, which describe the five classes of physical item which transfiguration simply cannot create (either by transformation or by conjuration).

2. From the fact that those five exceptions are known as the "principal" exceptions, Gamp's Law presumably has further subsidiary exceptions. These perhaps describe classes of physical good which can be created with transfiguration, but only within certain limitations.

3. Transfiguration is widely considered the most difficult magical discipline, and most wizards have not mastered it to the degree necessary to use it to create the goods they demand.

4. The goods demanded by wizards are generally not merely physical, but come with enchantments to improve their qualities. Transfiguration can only create physical things; it cannot imbue an object with magic it did not originally have, which must be done by Charms (the performance of which is a service). Flying brooms, clothes with warming charms, quills that correct your spelling... these things cannot be created with transfiguration.

5. While transformations are permanent, nonetheless they can be reversed by the active intervention of a wizard. This would especially relevant for the magical construction industry, where durability and security are of particular concern.

6. While highly skilled wizards could theoretically use their abilities to put some traditional industries out of business, it is usually more profitable for the wizard to put those skills to a different use. For example, a highly skilled wizard might be able to perform large, perfect, animate transfigurations in an instant. Such a wizard could likely replace many farms if they devoted their life to transfiguring items into cows. However, that same level of skill means the wizard in question could easily obtain even more lucrative and exciting employment elsewhere (or would seek to enter politics). It's just not worth it for a talented wizard to spend their life performing mass production of basic goods.
