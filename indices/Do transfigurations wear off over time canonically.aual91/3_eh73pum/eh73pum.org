In canon transfiguration seems to be permanent, but it just breaks so much in terms of worldbuilding. You can't really have an economy if people can just turn pebbles into whatever they want. There are exemptions to Gamps law, which is kind of an attempt to fix this issue, but it's not really consistent or well explained.

Tl;dr: Transfiguration behaves however it is convenient for the plot.
