  Physical objects do not spontaneously turn into other objects in the absence of magic. You would need some new magical intervention to make a further change.

Something that does slightly muddy the waters on this is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Francis][Francis]], Professor Slughorn's pet goldfish that Lily Evans transfigured from a petal as a gift for him. On the morning after Lily's death, Slughorn found the bowl empty, which suggests that the transfiguration was an on-going effect, rather than a one and done deal.

(Note: the wiki page classes Francis as a transfiguration, but it's possible he was some other form of magic. However, the lily petal turning into a fish in front of Slughorn does suggest transfiguration as opposed to any other sort.)

I'm willing to chalk this up to an oversight on JK's part, however, as there seems to be no real rule as to whether or not the magic a wizard cast in their lifetime remains after they die: the body bind that Dumbledore cast on Harry in HBP (and the aforementioned Francis) both cease existing after the witch or wizard dies, but the sticking charms Sirius put on the posters in his childhood room remain in place.
