A fair point - it's been so long since I've read the novels or watched the films that they kind of blur together for me, tbh.

Script writing is a specialised subset of writing, distinct from writing novels, so it's unsurprising that JK didn't write them. Although she did have a hand in checking them over and making alterations, so it's not like they were just any old shite the writers and producers threw together despite her wishes. But then again, she did okay /Cursed Child/, so that's probably not the most encouraging of thoughts.

I'd take issue with the idea of the movies not being canon, however - it seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction to make, especially since JK was so heavily involved in the pre-production. I'd imagine most people take Pottermore as being at least supplementary canon, and it's almost certain that the majority of articles there aren't written by JK herself. I'm of the opinion that we take a leaf out of the Star Wars playbook: as long as it doesn't directly contradict something in the primary canon (i.e. the novels) then it's canon, although secondary to anything that comes out in future instalments.

It's interesting to note, however, that the Fantastic Beasts films were actually written by JK as her screenwriting debut, so does that make them definitively canon? And if so, do the details in the Fantastic Beasts movies that contradict the books and Pottermore take precedence?
