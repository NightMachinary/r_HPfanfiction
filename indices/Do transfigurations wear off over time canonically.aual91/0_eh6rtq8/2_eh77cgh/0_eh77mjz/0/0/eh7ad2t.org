I think most people only take the "Written by JK Rowling" articles on Pottermore as canon. The rest of the stuff is Buzzfeed style articles like "Ten reasons why Harry and Ginny were destined for each other". That's not really even /trying/ to be canon - it's clearly secondary commentary.

"Written by JKR" seems to be a fairly standard definition of canon, with some people requiring the material to have been /published/ in a traditional work, whereas others are willing to take JKR's word of god as canon too. But I know of very few people who are happy to take "random employee of Warner Brothers who designed prop #352135" as someone who can determine HP canon.
