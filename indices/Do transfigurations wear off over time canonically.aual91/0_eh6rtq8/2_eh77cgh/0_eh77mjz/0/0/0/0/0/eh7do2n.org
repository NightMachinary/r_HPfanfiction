  there are multiple places in which the movies directly and unambiguously contradict the books, such as the time at which Harry receives his Firebolt in PoA (Christmas vs. end of year).

By all means, if it comes down to original novel vs. adaptation, then the original work takes primacy. But in cases where it doesn't contradict anything, I feel the issue is a little more grey. It's fairly standard to restructure and change certain elements of the work in an adaptation - things that work well in one medium don't always work in another, and cutting a 300 page book into a 1.5 hour film necessitates pragmatism.

We're also in the bizarre situation, now, where the Fantastic Beasts movies (being written by JKR) also enjoy canon status, but there's already been some fairly major contradictions (such as McGonagall teaching at Hogwarts before she was born, and the existence of a younger Dumbledore brother despite their mother being dead and their father serving a life sentence in Azkaban long before the boy could have been born - although I'm almost certain the McGonagall thing will be retconned into either a relative or random person with the same surname).
