I think you're overestimating the nature of JKR's "sign off". It wasn't a canon check - there are multiple places in which the movies directly and unambiguously contradict the books, such as the time at which Harry receives his Firebolt in PoA (Christmas vs. end of year). JKR's input on the movie scripts does not amount to her being a co-writer of them, nor does it mean they're canon. It was just there a) as a marketing ploy, to win over existing fans and b) to prevent the writers from digging themselves into really massive holes in terms of failing to lay the groundwork for later books which had not yet been written.
