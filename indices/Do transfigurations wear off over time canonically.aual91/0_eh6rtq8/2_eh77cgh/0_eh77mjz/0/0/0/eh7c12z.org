  But I know of very few people who are happy to take "random employee of Warner Brothers who designed prop #352135" as someone who can determine HP canon.

When it comes to the films, however, we're not talking about a "random employee", we're talking about the script writers who have been tasked to adapt and expand on JK's work, which then was signed off on by the woman herself. For me personally, that lends at least a /little/ credibility to the new details that make it in.

Still, it all comes down to personal preference, I suppose - I'm happy to agree to disagree.
