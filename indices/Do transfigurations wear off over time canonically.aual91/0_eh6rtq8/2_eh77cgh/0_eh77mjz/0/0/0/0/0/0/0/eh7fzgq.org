  Their status in my mind is basically that of a piece of fan art of which JKR happens to have said "I like this".

I think this is where you and I fundamentally disagree: to me, the films are officially licensed products, carrying the authority and weight of JKR, much like the old EU was with Star Wars: if it didn't directly contradict the canon of the movies, then it was officially secondary canon, unless contradicted by the primary canon, i.e. the movies - and that's how I feel about the Harry Potter movies and the Cursed Child play (rather sadly in the case of the latter).

  the McGonagall thing has been a double retcon. JKR originally said she was around 80 at the start of PS, then Pottermore reduced her age significantly, and now it's gone up again (to be even older than the original). This is not unusual - Tolkien frequently retconned elements of the LotR universe, often in private letters which were only published decades later - and you generally just have to go with the most recent version.

With McGonagall, it's further complicated by her conversation with Umbridge in OotP, where she says she's been teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years, i.e. her first year of teaching was 1956. It's a complete mess, tbh, and just makes me think that JK's sort of lost all interest in internal consistency - it's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of contradictory and nonsensical statements and plot holes that have been cropping up ever since she decided to expand on the original seven books.

A major difference to Tolkien is that he /actually/ retconned the Hobbit, specifically the One Ring's importance and Gollum's obsession with it, in order to tie in with LotR. Later editions of the Hobbit were different to earlier editions in this regard. JK seems content to allow contradictory information to exist side-by-side in her body of work and Word of God statements, which creates a level of internal inconsistency, contradiction and plot-holes that go beyond forgetfulness or inattention to detail. It's extremely frustrating for me, and exactly the reason I lean more towards *Death of the Author* with JK than I do with other writers.
