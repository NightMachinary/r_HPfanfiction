For fans who have been around long enough, the McGonagall thing has been a double retcon. JKR originally said she was around 80 at the start of PS, then Pottermore reduced her age significantly, and now it's gone up again (to be even older than the original). This is not unusual - Tolkien frequently retconned elements of the LotR universe, often in private letters which were only published decades later - and you generally just have to go with the most recent version.

As regards the movies, I completely agree: when creating an adaptation, things have to change. But this, to me, seems to lead to an inevitable conclusion: the movies are an /adaptation/ of canon, not canon itself. JKR signing off on the movies is her signing off on them /as an adaptation/, not as something equal to her own work. Their status in my mind is basically that of a piece of fan art of which JKR happens to have said "I like this".
