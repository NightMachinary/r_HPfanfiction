This. One of the things I see in some fanfics which works is that the transfigured property still has the 'soul' or at least the memory of what it first was and so it is a lot easier to be transfigured back into that state. Loosely take animagi, it's a self transfiguration but it has to have the memory of what they were wearing/holding etc. This is probably why the first lot of transfigurations we see is needles to matchsticks as the length and shape are similar.
