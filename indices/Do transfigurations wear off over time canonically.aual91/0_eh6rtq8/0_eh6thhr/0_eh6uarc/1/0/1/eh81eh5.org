Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're implying is that they could not transfigure honey-bbq chicken wings but they could transfigure something into a live Chicken and then, from there, properly cook the chicken?

The reason I use Chicken as an example is that it's probably the easiest meat in the world to cook. You cut the head/feet off, pluck it, and then literally just set it over a fire.

While nothing that you're saying sounds fundamentally incorrect, it just doesn't make sense that they had to actually /forage/ for food.

I mean, Harry went out and CAUGHT fish. WHY catch fish if you can just transfigure a live fish?
