You're not wrong, that was also my previous understanding. However, I think people have previously focused too much on Hermione's statement of the exception to Gamp without paying enough attention to the context of the conversation (the focus of which is Hermione's inability to cook and Ron wishing for his mother's cooking, not a lack of actual ingredients); I also think that people have not paid enough attention to the word "good" in her phrase "good food".

I am now convinced that JKR intended to exclude the possibility of conjuring up a ready-to-eat meal for yourself, not to exclude the possibility of creating things that could be turned into food if you know how to cook (magically or otherwise). I suspect this was motivated by JKR wanting to close off a possible plot hole ("if you can conjure up complete meals, why do we see Molly cooking the long way?").
