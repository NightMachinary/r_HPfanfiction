I think the edibility thing is commonly misunderstood (including by myself in the past). In DH, when Hermione said "you can't make good food out of nothing" /they already had fish and mushrooms/. Their problem was not a lack of edible materials, their problem was their inability to turn it into something nice. The exception to Gamp's law essentially amounts to saying you can't use transfiguration to skip the cooking process to make "good food". You can still use transfiguration to make things that can be turned into food like pigs (PS).

As for killing, no, Draco was turned back fine in GOF. One imagines that the soul continues even when the body is transformed. Voldemort's soul continued to exist without any body at all, after all.
