  Why does that need to be anything approaching a law? There are animals that people straight up eat, while they're still living even. Why should bread be any harder to make than something like a teacup?

I'm afraid I don't understand your question. What do you mean by "need"? These are the rules of the universe as they appear in canon. "Need" doesn't come into it, does it? It's not like there's a standard of correctness by which canon can be judged by. Canon /is/ the standard of correctness.

However, if you are looking for why, it seems to me that the difference between bread and a teacup is obvious: food has a special status and value in human society, and the laws of magic appear to be largely anthropocentric (see, for example, the inability to create gold, or the way magic can distinguish between information generally and secrets specifically).

It seems that any conceptual difference that humans can make, magic can recognise.

  Draco managed to keep his soul even though he was turned into an animal, and Slughorn keeps his despite being a chair. Given the impossibility of bringing a soul back from the dead, it's clear that on some level transfigured things are still the original thing.

I feel like my post above already addresses this. Physically, nothing of the original object remains. But souls aren't physical and so are unaffected by transfiguration. Magic itself is also not physical, and so the new object will have magical traces of the object it used to be.
