  What on earth makes food so special?
#+end_quote

The fact that people eat it, one assumes.

Much like gold is special because people consider it valuable.

  given that you can make animals (and probably fruit and edible plants)?
#+end_quote

We know you can make animals, but you can't eat animals without putting them through further processing.

We don't know whether you can make ready-to-eat fruit. I would speculate that, much as you can make a pig but not a pork chop, you can make an apple tree but not apples.

  Why does Gamp need to make laws that specific?
#+end_quote

Presumably because magic is that specific and Gamp is simply recording its nature.

  For your second point, consider this: what happens if a person is turned into an object and that object is broken?

  The sensible thing would be to have the spell end once it's sufficiently damaged, but by your logic it would persist. An ensouled object in many pieces, with magic to boot. What are the consequences of such a thing?
#+end_quote

I'm perfectly happy to have magic be dangerous and to lead to potentially lethal or mutilating consequences. McGonagall warns the class about the dangers of transfiguration in her first class.

One can only speculate about what happens to the soul of a person who has been transfigured into an object which is subsequently broken apart. Perhaps the soul moves on (i.e. dies), much as it would have if a human's body is broken. Perhaps the objects remain ensouled, and if the object is restored the person can be retrieved via untransfiguration once more.
