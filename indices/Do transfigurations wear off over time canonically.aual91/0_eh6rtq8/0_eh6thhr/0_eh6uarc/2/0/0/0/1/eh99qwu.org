People will eat raw carrots, unprocessed insects... even live octopi.

Gold is special for other reasons than because it is considered valuable. Its innability to corrode, for example. Also, it's rare, has a distinct colour from other metals, is dense yet soft, and it is plausible that gold came to be an obsession /because it cannot be magically reproduced/ rather than the other way around.
