That first one was two separate points: - What on earth makes food so special? What about food would make it impossible to make from other things, given that you can make animals (and probably fruit and edible plants)? Especially when you can make things that are artificial, complex, and organic? - Why does Gamp need to make laws that specific? Presumably if there are reasons why you can't make good food from one spell, it's as a result of other governing laws.

For your second point, consider this: what happens if a person is turned into an object and that object is broken?

The sensible thing would be to have the spell end once it's sufficiently damaged, but by your logic it would persist. An ensouled object in many pieces, with magic to boot. What are the consequences of such a thing?
