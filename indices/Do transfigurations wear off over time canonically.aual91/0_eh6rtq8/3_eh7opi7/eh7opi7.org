My own little idea is that a charm adds something, a curse limits something, and transfiguration changes something. Jinxes and hexes are just minor curses. These are mostly arbitrary distinctions because magic isn't too precise. It's very much like classifying living organisms. Life isn't following your rules. We can try and successfully label it, but we will always be changing what is what and expanding things to match reality because life is too fluid to define so neatly.
