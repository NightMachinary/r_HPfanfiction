Is there any indication what the limits of transfiguration towards mechanical things are? Like, is there anything in canon which supports or denies the possibility of transfiguring something in hardened steel? A steam engine in one go? Any size limit (eg a car, a small boat or a supertanker)? Because the complexity of most machines is significantly lower than even the most basic of animals which make an appearance pretty early on. Hell, an entire engine is probably less complex than a bacteria, nevermind a bird or a small mammal.
