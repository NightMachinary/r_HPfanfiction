I was thinking more along the lines of WWI technology levels (Harry and Hermione dropped into Game of Thrones 10 years before canon), but it would indeed be interesting if one was to take the bit about technology and use it. I mean, an electrical fire is rather pointless, but if you can transfigure a generator of that size and the parts for a steam turbine, you have an easy power supply instead of experimenting with lead-acid batteries.
