Edgy, sarcastic but in that bratty sort of way that seems kind of artificial? Like I can't describe it but he's less Harry more Bart Simpson?

Also too many pop culture references, too many pranks or trying to act like how the author thinks James would act.

Overly mean to Ron, thinking he's a lazy idiot- Harry loves Ron and respects him.

Harry at the end of the day, is a decent person with a good head on his shoulders
