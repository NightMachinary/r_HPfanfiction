I'm personally not interested in a deeply dark Harry, not even if the changes that brought him there (raised by Bellatrix, etc.) are a valid explanation.

And I'm not interested in a womanizing Harry, not even if the changes that brought him there (fragment of James' soul sticks to Harry and reacts to Lily cheating by disparaging all women) are a valid explanation.

But I'm more open to other changes--- more trusting or more into academics because he was raised by a loving, supportive adult. Or more timid because he was scarred by Dursley abuse.

It's a personal preference thing, like everything else, with the one golden rule being that you'd better explain what about your AU made Harry into Harry-in-name-only.
