I don't like to read fics where Harry's evil. I hate even more fics where he does evil things for evil people and somehow he's the one in the right.

Don't mess with his instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. That's his only super power that's canon, and rooted in his personality as separate from the vagaries of his upbringing.

If Harry becomes apathetic, that means he's not actually invested in the plot we're reading, and that's boring.

To me, no matter what changes, Harry Potter is basically a decent person, who cannot help putting himself in danger sometimes.
