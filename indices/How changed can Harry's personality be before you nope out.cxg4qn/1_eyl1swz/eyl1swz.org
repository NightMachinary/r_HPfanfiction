I think the answer to this question is the same for why I would drop a lot of canon-divergence or AU stories. Really, it boils down to this: /Does the change here follow a semi-logical or believable progression?/

For example, all those fics where Harry meets X person prior to the Hogwarts Express and ends up wildly diverging in personality - this is not a believable progression. People are not like that. Its even worse, because...well honestly Harry should not have had the personality he had in canon anyway.

What I mean by that is that Harry is more or less not affected by the neglect and emotional abuse he endured in any real way in canon. He is constantly described (and its valid too) as having James personality as well, with perhaps a touch of his mother. Having never met them at all, this implies he would have been about how he was in canon except in the most drastic of circumstances (say torturing him or raised as a child soldier).

Ironically, that last part is actually to Rowling's detriment, though I think it may have been accidental. One of her themes (particularly in CoS) was that its not how we are born but what we choose to be. That genetics don't really matter. Problem is Harry, and Voldemort if you want to get down to it, sort of imply the exact opposite in canon. Ultimately they both had their fathers' looks and personalities with just a hint of their mother (also important because of blood), despite having never met or known them growing up (and no, the Graveyard shades and Tom murdering his dad at 16 don't count).
