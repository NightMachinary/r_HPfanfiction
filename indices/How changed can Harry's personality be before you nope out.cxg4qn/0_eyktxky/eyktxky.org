For me, it can be "Harry Potter" in nothing but name. You can write about a complete psychopath that shares nothing but the name and looks and I will still read it, IF:

1. It is well written.
2. The personality change makes some sort of sense.

I don't read fanfics for carbon copy Potters of the original. Be creative. Go nuts.
