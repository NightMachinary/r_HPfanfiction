I personally can't stand it when Harry's written as this over confidant cool headed lady's man who's more politically savvy than god. Part of what makes Harry interesting is that he's not perfect: he's awkward, got a temper, not that ambitious, and not very outgoing. Like, being raised in a different environment allows for some pretty drastic changes, as long as you account for why those changes occur and don't make him this perfect all powerful being.
