I don't like fics that make him a casual murderer of innocents, but that's a general nopezone for me. For example, I started reading one a while ago, which had some pretty good worldbuilding with "druidic" things, but by the end of the second chapter he first flirts with a muggle barista, then leads her to a pier and then murders her by drowning, all described in very visceral detail.

Not really something I like.
