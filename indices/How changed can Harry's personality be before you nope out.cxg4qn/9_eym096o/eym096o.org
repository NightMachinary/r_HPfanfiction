I usually read fics where Snape mentors/, adopts Harry and lately more so have been when he's at Hogwarts. In quite a few he goes from being semi normal (other than dealing with depression, abuse etc) and then he's a huge crybaby that needs to be tucked in and all

I understand him being weepy and all but I can't stand when he's a bigger version of a toddler
