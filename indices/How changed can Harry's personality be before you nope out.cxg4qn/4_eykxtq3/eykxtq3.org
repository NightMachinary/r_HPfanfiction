As long as it's a good story and somewhat makes sense, anything goes.

If the entire premise of the story is that Harry has a completely different childhood, then obviously he's going to be different. If Voldemort did ....something.... to him as a baby, he's also going to be different, and that's perfectly fine if it makes a good story.

Because if Harry grew up in a loving family reading science fiction and nonfiction books then it's perfectly reasonable that he might ride a broom with transfigured rocket motors attached to escape from the baddies at some point in the story, and I'm okay with that because it makes for a totally awesome scene.

If Harry with exactly the same background as canon Harry tries the same stunt, then that's a bit out of character.
