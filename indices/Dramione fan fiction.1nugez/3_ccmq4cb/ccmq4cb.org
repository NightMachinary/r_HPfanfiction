"Parade of the Sun" by Sage/everythursday - Hermione and Draco both go after an extremely potent, magical, mythical plant. He, in an attempt to restore his family to prominent status, she in attempt to prevent what she believes will be a resurrection of the war. They are competing with each other but they end up gradually having to rely on each other for survival.

It's better than God of the Lost and is finished. What I enjoyed most out of it is that I found both characters completely plausible based on canon minus that "10 years later" crap. And they kind of evolve naturally throughout the story.
