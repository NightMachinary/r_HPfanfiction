What would've happened if they were actually communicating about this particular subject? “Hermione, I don't want you to come with me, hunting Horcruxes. It is too dangerous and I don't want to risk your life.” Hermione would obviously answer, “Of course, I shouldn't be with you, at all.” That would've certainly achieved what Harry was looking for. There is no way Hermione would let Harry embark on this journey alone, let alone mention it. Considering the changes I have made in canon, I do believe that extremely hard wouldn't be close to define the difficulty of persuading Hermione. The obvious solution has the 'Brightest Which of Her Age' as seen it: Obliviation.
