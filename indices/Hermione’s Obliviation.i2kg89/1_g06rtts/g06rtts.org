This is so out of character, at least for Harry. He and Ron would have gravitated towards each other since they were roommates and classmates in any case, and Ron'd be the fun friend that Harry needs. He often finds Hermione tiresome to be with even after they become friends, and he mentions in GOF during the temporary fallout with Ron that Hermione just wasn't the same, and he constantly thinks about how much he wants Ron back as a friend. He doesn't want to be hanging out in the library all day. And Harry, at least in school, isn't emotional to show that comforting that Hermione appears to need at times. He would certainly not profess his love very easily, like that.
