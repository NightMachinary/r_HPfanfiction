Yeah, the friend who is able to help Harry have fun for the first time in his life, who worries so much about him that he flies his dad's illegal flying car to help him when he doesn't receive answers to his letters, and who faces his worst fear to stand by Harry's side is toxic. Right.

Just because he didn't push Harry to study all day, as Hermione would (that shit is unnatural for kids; Hermione is the odd one out who actually wants to study that much), doesn't make him toxic. It doesn't make Harry lazy to not want to study as much as Hermione does. It makes him a kid.

Yeah Ron has flaws, but he apologises for his mistakes. Hermione is also jealous, but she never apologised for attacking Ron. I find that Ron has a very big heart, and it's not hard to see. Why else would he take a job at the WWW if it wasn't to support is brother, when he struggled after losing Fred? Why else would he follow Harry into danger time and time again? One of Ron's best traits is how much he cares about and how far he's willing to go to support those he loves. If you claim that his goodness is deeply buried, and that he's toxic, I believe you have read too much Ron bashing fics, and need to brush up on canon.
