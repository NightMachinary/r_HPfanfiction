Set up a search once and then bookmark the result page. That way, you can quickly make small adjustments instead of excluding 30 tags each time.

Also, blacklist the relationships (eg Harry/Draco) and warnings you don't like (eg non-con, graphic violence and so on). Some people don't tag characters but the relationship or the other way around, so you have to cull both categories.
