The two fics I can think that might qualify for your request of are both Harry/Ginny, but in both of them Ginny is super OOC. Dunno if these will do it for you, but you aren't getting much response, so here they are anyway.

Linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker) takes place in Hogwarts with Harry as the Defense Professor and Ginny as a 7th year, but it is a pretty controversial fic. It's actually really well written and I think it's a great fic. The caveat is that this fic explores rape and PTSD extensively, and it gets pretty graphic. it doesn't glorify the rape at all; the purpose of the fic is hurt/comfort and recovery from extremely traumatic experiences. As you can imagine, the romance/sex in this fic moves extremely slow, but it is pretty satisfying. Ginny's characterization is substantially different from canon in this because she's several years younger than in canon and she's been through a truly horrific tragedy. Harry's been through some similar shit as Ginny (though indirectly), so he's not the same person as in canon either. This is the same author that wrote Backward with Purpose.

Linkffn(The Prodigal Daughter by iluvfanfics1) is a post Hogwarts fic where Ginny goes away to study in France and makes a triumphant return with all the neat powers like Empathy and something called the Fire Goddess. Harry's super OP in it as well. I remember the premise was decently interesting when I read it a decade ago, but I have severe doubts that it has aged well. The sex/romance is particularly interesting due to an Aura/Magic sharing mechanic between Harry and Ginny. The author of this fic uses a much more pre-HBP characterization for Ginny, so you may find it palatable. This is definitely the lesser of the two fics by far.
