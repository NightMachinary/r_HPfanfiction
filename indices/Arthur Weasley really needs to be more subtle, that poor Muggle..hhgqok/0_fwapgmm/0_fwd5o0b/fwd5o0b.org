Based on the guy running the campground for the QWC, it does look like there are at least short-term side effects to sufficiently many Obliviations in succession, besides which a backfiring Obliviation has been shown to produce permanent damage, at which point it is not unreasonable to extrapolate that sufficiently many Obliviations could lead to permanent deleterious side effects.
