Repost from a few months ago, and I'll say what I said then:

Whoever is involved with this shit needs to go to azkaban. If obliviation causes permanent brain damage in your AU when applied repeadedly, then don't apply it repeadedly. Makes no sense for a cheap gotcha moment that reads like bashing.

What do you even want with this post? Is it a prompt? A request? We have flairs for a reason, you know.
