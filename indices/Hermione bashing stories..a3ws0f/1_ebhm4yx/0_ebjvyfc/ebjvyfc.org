All good, I haven't read some of those fics in a while, quite a few years in a couple of cases so I went back and read them. Well, tried to anyway. Holy mother of satan, what on this earth was I taking?!?!? There was a couple I couldn't even make it through the first couple of chapters let alone finish them.\\
There was a couple of all right ones there though, so uh, guess my judgement was partially sound?
