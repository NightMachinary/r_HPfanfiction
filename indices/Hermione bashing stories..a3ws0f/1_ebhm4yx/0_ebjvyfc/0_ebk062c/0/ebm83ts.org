Yeah, I went through a bit of a stage a few years ago where I pretty much read only bashing/independent Harry fics for about 2 months. In other words, I read the exact same story just by different authors for two months and enjoyed them all.\\
I still enjoy bashing fics when they're done well but it annoys me that there is so few well written ones.

I noticed the grammar as well but my brain was definitely not awake enough to make any sort of joke. I think I've spent so long on the internet that my brain just automatically translates things into proper English half the time.
