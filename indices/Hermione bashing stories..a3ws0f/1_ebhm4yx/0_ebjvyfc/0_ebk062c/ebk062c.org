Well, it was mostly a grammar joke: the OP meant "Hermione-bashing stories"---stories that bash Hermione, not "Hermione bashing stories", which would be Hermione bashing some stories she'd read. You were just the next post down, though I know many of those fics, and they are, in fact, bad.

In any case, welcome to the club. Tastes evolve, usually towards more discernment and less tolerance for crap. I know I used to be far more tolerant of Ron-bashing than I am now, for example.

The OP specifically requested bashfics, so, by definition, much crap is to be found in them, especially since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/96i42t/hermione_critical_fanfiction/e419p97/?context=3][Hermione is a character whose canon flaws are actually very difficult to write well]], or at least harder to write, say, Harry's or Ron's. (Not that there are many that write Harry's and Ron's well, either.)
