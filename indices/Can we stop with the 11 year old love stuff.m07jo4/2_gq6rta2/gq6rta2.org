I think it's fine to sort of plant the seeds for a relationship early on. But not in any weirdly romantic way.

[[https://youtu.be/VR8hlvLghrs][I think one of the best examples of how to portray a healthy romance that starts as kids is Ellie and Carl from Up]] --- (spoilers for Up if you somehow haven't seen it yet)

Naturally, I think you shouldn't have eleven year olds smooching each other in fics (or other...unsavoury things) but I think it can be a cute starting point for a future relationship if its developed correctly.

Even though it wasn't anything remotely sexual I distinctly remember having little puppy crushes on my classmates towards the end of elementary school.

Ultimately, I think if your ship meets in first year authors should focus on developing their friendship dynamic/platonic relationship and letting it gradually become something more as they age appropriately.

Personally, I'm very uncomfortable reading any smut before characters are at least 18 (or preferably at least early 20's) But I think some PG-13 handholding and smooching isn't so bad once fifth year hits, provided it's not a weirdly vivid/gropey makeout session.

A good way to gauge whether or not something you're writing involving minors is too much is to ask yourself, “If this scene was acted out on TV, would there be global outrage?” Lmao
