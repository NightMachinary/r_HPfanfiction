My theory concerning all the stories with very precocious eleven year olds is that if authors are writing a fic that takes place during their Hogwarts years, they typically want to write it from the very beginning, meaning first year.

Problem is, a lot of authors are also eager to jump RIGHT into the meat of their plot and RIGHT into the ship, so you end up with the aforementioned eleven year olds winking suggestively and entering politics.

People need to learn that you can START a fic in the protag's last year of school
