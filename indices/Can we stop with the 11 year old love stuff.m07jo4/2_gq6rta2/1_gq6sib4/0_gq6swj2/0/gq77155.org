What I don't get is why these authors don't do, like, a minimal amount of legwork to shift a bit of canon around so first years are 16 or 18 or even 20 or whatever. If you want to write about adult romance, why not write /adults?/

It seems infinitely simpler to age up the characters and make Hogwarts into a university-style institution attended after muggle education rather than trying to justify whatever the hell else they always do.

I'd honestly prefer this overall - I like characters with agency over their own lives.
