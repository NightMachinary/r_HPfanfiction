That last line, Lmao. Yeah, I'm all for relationships and ship building but I think that, overall, fanfiction authors typically struggle with a relationship ark, they try for the relationship at 11 that would only be a realistic at... 13 or 14. I understand innocent crushes were very common for most people, and I'm not saying that that is abnormal, I'm saying that the romance of the 11 year old relationship is unrealistic at best. This also goes back to character building too, you rarely see proper character growth in a lot of fanfiction. Case and point, Sirius dying in canon truly shocks Harry into the mindset of 'this is war' and we see a revival of Harry's growth after he was a pessimistic lil shit for a year. We rarely see that type of growth in fanfiction, even on the small scale.
