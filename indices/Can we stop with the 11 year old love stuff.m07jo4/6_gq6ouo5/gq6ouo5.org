To be fair I remember crushing on others as early as Kindergarten but I was more like "I think they're cute and I like them a lot" And I developed crushes instantly but I never thought about /relationships/.

But yeah I agree with you I don't want to read about 11 year olds in relationships. That's weird. Though I don't see harm done in an innocent crush.
