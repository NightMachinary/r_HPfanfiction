...I now want to see a story where an 11 year old Harry develops a crush on Daphne. They hang out, be friendly, awkwardly do the things kids do such as sneak glances at one another and awkwardly try to make moves to hold hands, despite the social pressures of Gryffindor/Slytherin (although the older girls in both houses going "awww" at the puppy love would be hilarious).

He goes for the plunge and kisses her on the cheek one day.

Bewildered, and a little freaked out, she responds by slapping him and sending him crashing to the floor.

You know like that Simpsons episode where Bart kisses that girl his age and she freaks out? Yeah. XD

A few years later, they're dating properly, and he'll never let her live that down.
