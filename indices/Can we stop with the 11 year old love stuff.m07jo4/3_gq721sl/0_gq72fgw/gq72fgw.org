Idk how it is elsewhere but over here you were "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" after asking the other person "Can I have a chance on you?" (literal translation, basically you asked for a "chance" lol, seems really strange but makes sense in my native language). Wasn't uncommon to have several boyfriends/girlfriends and the "relationship" was mostly holding hands and spending recess together. 11 isn't exactly toddler age.
