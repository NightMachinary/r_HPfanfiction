At that young age it's completely normal to have crushes on people you don't even know. It's even in canon, Ginny had a huge crush on Harry ever since she met him. At that age you don't really think about adult stuff, your priorities lies in 1, is he/she cute? 2, Does he/she seem fun? And that's it.
