Eh, I had massive crushes on people at 11/12. Never did anything about â€˜em, I but wrote a lot about them in my journals ðŸ˜Ž

However, I don't want anyone that age...actually not younger than 16 or so to be making out...not even, like, intensely kissing.

I will say, it was common knowledge that one couple in my 7th grade class had oral sex. That was very unusual, of course. Not to say I want it portrayed in stories I read, because I would probably set it down if I saw anything like that, but I do acknowledge it happens on occasion.
