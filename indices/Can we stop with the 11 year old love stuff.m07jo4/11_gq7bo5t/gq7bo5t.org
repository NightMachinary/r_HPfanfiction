I mean, that's your experience. But I know people who had boyfriends in kindergarden, and a friend of mines daughter started having boyfriends when she was 5 and now at 12 finally have one boyfriend at a time.

We can discuss 13-14 year old with a harem Harry, but having boyfriends/girlfriends at 11 isn't unusual.
