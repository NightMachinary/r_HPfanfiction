11 year old me had a serious crush on a girl where I was actually dreaming about her, and I got really really mad when some other guy started going out with her.

I can understand if the authors go too far in romanticizing 11 year olds, but it's also a bit extreme to apply your own case of not having any crushes at 11 to the rest of the population
