When I was about 11, a boy slipped me a Valentine conversation heart that said "be mine." Still think it was sweet and romantic. We said we were BF & GF, went to a couple of movies (I think; it's been a long time since I was 11/12), hung out together in and out of school, and he kissed me good bye when I moved away. Previous to that, I know there were boys I considered my boyfriend at the time (and they agreed), but obviously we would have done even less. Kiss on the cheek at most--and didn't we feel oh so daring!

Crushes aside, I wouldn't expect 11yos to be much more advanced than that for the most part, especially Muggle-raised ones and Weasleys. You could maybe make a case for some of the pureblood, since I think some of them were raised in such a hothouse atmosphere. So Draco might do the winking thing, but probably not Harry, Hermione, or Dean (to name a few).
