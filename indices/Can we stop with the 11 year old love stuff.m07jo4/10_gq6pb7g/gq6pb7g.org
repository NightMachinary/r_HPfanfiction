My 1st crush was a classmate in the 1st grade (6) my second was an old friend and started in 3rd grade (8-9). Kids started dating and kissing in the 5th grade (10).

Could fan fiction write these things better? Sure, but it's not at all impossible or unrealistic for 11-12 year old Harry to crush on someone or hold hands with some blushing, little girl. We don't see Harry liking anyone else before PoA because it's not narratively wise or relevant.
