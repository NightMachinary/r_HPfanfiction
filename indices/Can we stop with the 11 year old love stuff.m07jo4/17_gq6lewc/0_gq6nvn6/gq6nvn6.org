Definitely, some relationships in fanfiction work out of way to well, missing the awkwardness that comes with people avoiding feelings and dancing around each other. Usually they just go right in with the 'practically soulmates' method, where they are almost perfect for each other in every way. That's not to say that people can't write a convincing relationship ark, just that most fail to do so. Cho and Harry's interactions in gof and ootp is definitely a good example of teens fumbling with feelings and figuring out how they work.
