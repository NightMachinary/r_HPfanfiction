  Disturbing might be an odd choice of words, but I agree most young kids are more interested in their friends and their hobbies than seeking relationships.

I mean, maybe we really do use langauge differently but there's an incredible, vast amount, of difference between "apathy" and "finding something disturbing".

I wouldn't have argued against apathy. It's not even in the same ballpark.

Also age 11-12 is exactly the age where "cooties" starts to change. There's definitely some hand holding and as others have called it "puppy love" starting there.
