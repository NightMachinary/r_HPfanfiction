Crushes are fine. 11 year olds definitely have crushes, on celebrities, on the handsome older kid who's on the sports teams, on classmates and so on.

What 11 year olds don't have, normally, are adult relationships. They're awkward children. They don't "flirt" the way adults and older teens do. Remembering being 11 (and it's a long time ago so maybe I'm off base but whatever!) if you "fancied" someone as we call it in the UK, you wouldn't flirt or wink or march up to them and ask them out. You'd do weird stuff like make an excuse to be where you know they are, then hide when you saw them! You'd never approach them directly, you'd send your best mate to give /their best mate/ a note asking if they liked you- and if they didn't like you? You pretend it's all a joke and actually you think they're ugly!

So yeah, writing kids with crushes and being awkward and ridiculous about it (much like Ginny is in canon tbh) is fine. What's not fine is having them being all suave about it and acting like they're a confident 25 year old who knows how to ask someone out.

Also, some fics, there's a level of sexual stuff between young characters (and I have seen this in fics where they're in first/second year, usually with the /soulmate/ excuse and that's why I now avoid soulmate fics), which is a) no and b) FUCK NO. Any physical contact in a "relationship" between 11 or 12 year olds would be limited to hand holding, kiss on the cheek, maybe a really awkward peck on the lips. 13, 14, 15 would snog and would notice boobs on girls, fit upper body on boys and so on, but again most people aren't ready for sex at that young age and additionally, most people /don't want to read underage sex./ Between 16-18 the lines get blurred, because the age of consent in the UK is 16, so if Harry is 17 and Ginny is 16, it would be perfectly legal for them to have sex, but again I wouldn't go into great detail about it- if you're writing smut and your intention is to arouse, make your characters at the very least 18+.

You can mention that 16 year old characters have sex, in a way that isn't designed to titillate, if it is needed for plot. But if you want to write what's basically porn, please remember that in the majority of the world, pornographic depictions of under 18s are illegal, for good reason. I know this really applies to visual media, but the majority of people would be uncomfortable/grossed out reading it, never mind seeing it. There's a huge fic audience of the "original" potterheads who are in our 20s and 30s now, and grown adults tend to not want to read about schoolkids having sex, even if they are of age.
