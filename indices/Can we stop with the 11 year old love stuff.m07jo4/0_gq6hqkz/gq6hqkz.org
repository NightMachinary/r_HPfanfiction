Hmm I had crushes as young as like 7 years old, but it was very generic and like “Oh they're cute. I'd like to be friends.” Once I was like 12, then I started to feel upset about how my friends were dating people and I wasn't even though I didn't feel ready to date myself. I felt ready to date at 16 but purely in an innocent, affectionate way, with no desire for hooking up, despite the fact many of my peers were getting physical with each other. I didn't even want any sort of physical intimacy (outside of innocent affection) in a relationship until I was in my early 20s.

In short, I think it varies depending on the person. There are certain actions people have HP characters take in their early or late teens that disturb me but actually do happen among some in their early and late teens. I just avoid those stories.
