Just because you didn't have any crushes at age 11 it doesn't mean no one else did. This is fairly common. It is not the same type of crush one has at 14 or 17, but many people start developing the notion of romance at this age.

For example, I had crushes but was too much of a potato head to act on them. They were mostly on older boys who wouldn't pay attention to me anyway or on celebrities. When we were 12, my friend also had a crush, but on a boy a year younger and they "dated" for a month. They basically kissed and held hands, and broke up for some random reason I don't remember anymore.

Also, IIRC Ginny had a crush on Harry at the age of 10/11 when Ron and the twins took him to The Burrow before their second year.
