This is also a lot more prevalent in the UK schooling system because there is no middle school here, compared to America's system.

11 year olds are thrown into the deep end with up to 18 year olds, so the youngest students always look to the eldest ones.

In America, they have a short break from this because middle-schoolers are hemmed in with kids their own age.
