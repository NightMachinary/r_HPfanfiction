I certainly had crushes at 11. I knew people with 'girlfriends' at 11. Hell, I had a 'girlfriend' at 4.

It's fine if you don't like it. You don't have to. I kinda don't either, cause it's usually pretty cringe. Don't act like it's unrealistic, though, cause it really is. A bunch of kids in a giant castle with minimal supervision? Of course they're gonna start pairing up. I'm surprised Hogwarts doesn't regularly have pregnancies, tbh
