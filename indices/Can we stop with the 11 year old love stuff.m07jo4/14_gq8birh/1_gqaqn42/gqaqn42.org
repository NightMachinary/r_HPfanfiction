Hah! When my family and I were on holiday on the Isle of Wight, I was like 4? 5? There was this little Indian girl about my age that apparently I'd taken a "liking" to, and her me (she also used to seek me out, according to my parents).

We used to run around the swings together, playing tag and sitting together.

I don't remember much, sadly enough. but I was really bummed (for about ten minutes) when her family left one day.

All I remember are the swings and the sandpit they were in as we ran around them.
