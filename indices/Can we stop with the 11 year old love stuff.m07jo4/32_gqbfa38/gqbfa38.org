When I was 11 I definitely was thinking about boys, and boys definitely took notice I wasn't as flat as I used to be. I definitely was precocious. For that matter, I was definitely french kissing and heavily petting by the time I was 12.

But if you grew up with Harry Potter like I did, you are probably around your thirties by now. Why do you even bother reading the fics that follow an 11 year olds point of view? There are plenty of fics where Harry & friends are adults and worry about adult stuff. Have you tried reading those?
