No, I'm not complaining about crushes really, I'm complaining about how fanfiction authors really force relationships in first year. The one I recently started to read had Harry and Draco as auto crushes from the literal minute they interacted on the train with not so subtle flirting happening in the great hall before the sorting. I'm complaining about how romanticized the 2 11 year olds are, how unrealistic most relationships are in fanfiction, and how most authors skip over the whole learning about eachother and jump into 'not even in puberty yet but I already know who I want to be with when I grow up ;)'
