Alright, I understand you being frustrated about something being criticized that you like, I get it, k? I didnt say I dislike au's, in fact, I quite enjoy soulmate au's from time to time. I also like original story's, I think they can be very creative and, as the claimed title, original. I'm ranting about the romatization of 11 year olds falling in love at first sight in the canon verse. This include grossly exaggerated flirting before they get sorted in the great hall. If this was a soul mate au and they toned down the flirting then absolutely, they can fall in love or crush very heavily while they are 11, tho most soulmate au's dont have that happen.

Your assumption that I'm using the idea of Cho and Harry as a baseline for how romance should happen in the potter universe is also incorrect. I'm using that to show about the time that more serious relationships begin to form. Let's be honest, at 11 did you think about heavily making out with a person? As most people have commented, no, they had innocent crushes or very light relationships ie: holding hands and 'kissing'. As I read the rest of the chapter of the fanfiction that started this post, it became very obvious that this was not a innocent crush and slowly started to look like Harry was... for lack of a better term, 'lusting' after Draco. He repeatedly invaded Draco's space and made 4 innuendos followed by winking at Draco in an attempt to, and I quote, 'see him blush'

Not innocent, leave the 11 year olds alone, I have since stopped reading the fanfiction.

Tl:dr: some stuff that was assumed was wrong, 11 year olds should be left alone because no, haven't even become teens yet
