So just because Harry didn't pay attention to opposite (or the same) sex, in that way until 4 year in canon he can't do so in fanfics?

Or just because Harry and Draco didn't instantly fall desperately in love with each other at first look in canon they can't do so in fanfics?

Why do you have a growing dislike towards AU and more original stories?
