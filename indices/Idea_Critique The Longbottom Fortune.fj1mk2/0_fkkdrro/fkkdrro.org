Wasn't it canon that Augusta failed her Charms OWL? And thats why she didn't want Neville taking a NEWT in it?

I think your idea is interesting, that Neville's talents lie far outside what the family is traditionally known for. I don't know that they have to be super wealthy, just solidly upper middle class. Frank was an Auror. What if the Longbottom's have a tradition of ministry service? It'd be quite reasonable, given the small size of the UK wizarding community, that you'd have a few families known for always joining the Ministry, and always rising reasonably high within it. That sort of family history would likely lead to a reasonable level of wealth, nothing truly amazing, but definitely enough to become some generational wealth as long as no one too profligate took control of it. Neville being focused on herbology would put the kibosh on a Ministry career, which Augusta might think of as the only proper route for him to go.

Alternatively, if we assume that the Longbottom's are truly wealthy, part of the aristocracy of the wizarding world...maybe their fortune is based on Herbology but Augusta has a snobbish attitude that "one doesn't actually work for a living, one has people who take care of that". They used to do herbology themselves, now they employ people to do it all and rely on the Longbottom brand to sell the products.
