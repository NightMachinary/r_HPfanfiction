The Longbottom's wealth is never established at all, its just the assumption that as a pureblood family they're wealthy. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea that they're just 10 generations of mid to senior ranked Ministry workers. Maybe the occasional Department Head, Frank was probably on track to become Chief Auror in 30 or 40 years time if he'd survived. Maybe Frank's dad was Undersecretary for Magical Disasters and Catastrophes when he retired, and his father was Head of the Obliviators.

That sort of steady, solid job with a decent wage, in a society where magical talent results in reduced living costs, would definitely result in a good amount of wealth passing on to each new generation.
