Since you are looking for Fanon alternatives, one option could be Landed Genrty. You want the Longbottoms wealthy and in high society, but in such a way that Frank serving as a Dark Wizard hunter isn't a negative the way it would be if he was expected to carry on some sort of family business such as managing greenhouses or an import company, etc. Wealthy landowners works well though, they could own a number of wizarding properties or some sort of magical forest/preserve, collecting rent, subsidizes from the ministry for preserving magical plants and animals, and fees for collecting resources from their preserves. Something where the hard work was done generations ago, someone has been hired to manage everything, and the Longbottoms get a nice fat deposit in Gringotts every month.

Augusta is obviously proud of her son and his decision, if you want to tie in with that the original land could have been granted to them by the crown centuries ago for services rendered in defeating a Dark Lord.
