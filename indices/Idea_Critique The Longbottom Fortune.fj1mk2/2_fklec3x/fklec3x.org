I admit, I haven't really seen anything like this beyond the usual "House of Longbottom, Earl of Somewhereshire, Lord of Tuckus" things from Lord Harry Potter-Black-Merlin-etc-etc-de-Rollo-III-Huzzah! trope fics.

Do you have any recs where the Longbottoms are the Big Herb family of the Magical World? I'm curious what that might look like.
