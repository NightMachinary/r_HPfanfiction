There is no basis to think the Longbottoms were particularly wealthy, they were clearly in the middle of Weasley-poor and Malfoy-rich.

In 6th year when Neville want to do NEWT level Transfiguration clases, McGonagall tells him he won't be able to keep up with course-load with only an Acceptable in his OWL, but that he should take Charms (in which Neville got an E, apparently). And then Mcgonagall says that she is going to write to Augusta to tell her that just because /she/ (Augusta) failed her Charms OWL, it doesn't mean that the subject is worthless. So clearly Neville's grandmother valued Transfiguration over Charms (I think she called Charms the 'soft' option)

Maybe Neville's ability in Herbology was inherited from her mother's side and so it is not a Longbottom tradition. I truly believe that his ability in the subject was.uaed to show how it can be an useful area of study.
