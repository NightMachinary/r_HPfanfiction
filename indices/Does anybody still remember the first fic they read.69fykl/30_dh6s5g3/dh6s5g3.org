The Hog's Head, forget who it was by. I just stumbled across it and was hooked. However I was young and new to fan fiction and don't want to read it again because it will probably ruin my fond memories of it. At the time I had a huge crush on this red head in my class so I loved Ginny. Almost 10 years later I avoid Ginny pairings. Don't really know why but I prefer almost any other pairing.
