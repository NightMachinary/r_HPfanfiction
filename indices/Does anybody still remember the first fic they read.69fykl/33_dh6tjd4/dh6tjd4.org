The very very first fanfiction I read was Shinjii and Warhammer 40k, a horribily mishmash that is INCREDIBLY epic and awesome but entirely over the top with terrible spelling and grammar.

In the HP community, I first read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and decided that it stunk so bad I needed to write a story where muggles ACTUALLY introduced some science. And by science, I mean warfare.
