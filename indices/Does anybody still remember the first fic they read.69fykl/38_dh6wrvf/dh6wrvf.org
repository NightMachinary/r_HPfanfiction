The first, I can't remember the name of. It was on harrypotterfanfiction.com, and it was about Harry in a mental asylum being told that Sirius Black was another inmate, Draco was a good friend of his on the outside, but he had trouble beliving and it was up in the air on wether this was real or not.

Then I forgot about fanfiction. Came back later on a recommendation of a Jeconais story, This Mean War. And so my decent into fanfiction began.
