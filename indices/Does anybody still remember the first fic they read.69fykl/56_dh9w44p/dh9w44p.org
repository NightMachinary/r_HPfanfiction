I lived in a really small town back when OotP came out and couldn't wait until the next time I would get to go to the nearest city to get my copy so I went to Kazaa to try and find a copy. The story was about how the Potter family had saved a bunch of Phoenix back in the day and for that reason each member of the family is granted a one time wish to brig someone back to life. Harry wants to use it to bring back his mom and I don't remember too much about the story. The only other thing was that I was on a Neopets message board right after finishing it and someone mentioned who died in the real 5th book. I was totally confused as Sirius was alive and well in my version and that is when I learned about the horrible world that is fanfiction.
