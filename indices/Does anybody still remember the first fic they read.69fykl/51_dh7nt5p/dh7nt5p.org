Not the first I ever read but the earliest I remember was about White lighters at Hogwarts, which was a Charmed x HP crossover. Other is some story where Harry was the leader of the Privet Drive orphans and he loved Tootsie Rolls. He also had a childhood love interest in this one. I don't have links, unfortunately.
