Not sure if it was the very first, but one of the earliest I remember was the Eliza Diawna Snape mess. Another early one I read was I am Lord Voldemort by nemesis which I recently re-read and while it hasn't really stood up to the test of time, it's not nearly as bad as a lot of early 2000s fanfic.
