Very clearly, actually. It was a Harry/Draco fic, Irresistible Poison by Rhysenn. I remember staying up literally all night to keep reading it on the family desktop. I didn't want my mom to know I had never gone to bed because I'd get in trouble, so I didn't tell her and then had to stay awake all day while we ran errands. I remember being pretty loopy.

Harry/Draco is still my OTP so I think it made a pretty big impression. I go back to reread it every few years.
