I know I was about 11, and I'd lost my copy of OoTP, so was googling to try and find it online. I came across some weird fic on a website I haven't seen again since, all I can remember from it is Draco turning up at Harry's house before 5th year and them acting as best of friends.

I imagine it was a sequel fic, but it sure did confuse me for a while.

A lot of the early fics I read a few years later when I started reading fics on purpose were quite bad though, I found my old ff.net account and the favourites are /dreadful/, Lord Potter-Black-Sideous-Holmes-Nartu-Gallifrey-Slytherin types. But in a way that led me to finding the good fics, and DLP's reccommended ones.
