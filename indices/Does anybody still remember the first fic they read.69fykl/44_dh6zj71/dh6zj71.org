I think the first one I read was [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate by padfoot4ever]] on harrypotterfanfiction.com only about two years ago. It was pretty good if I remember, then again, I used to like the whole Lord-Potter-Black-I have more names than the entire population of the British Isles put together and enough money that I can destabilize the entire global economy in both the muggle and magical worlds, so that should give a fair warning. It was actually one of the only nextgen fics that I've read and the only fic that paired Rose and Scorpius. There was one other that I remember where it was Dramione(one of the few I think to have enjoyed) and she was potion high on love potion or something and she and Malfoy fuck in one of the spare classrooms or something and it actually had a plot, can't remember the name though.
