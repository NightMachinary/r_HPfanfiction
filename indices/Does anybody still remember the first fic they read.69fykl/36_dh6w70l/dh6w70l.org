It's no longer available, but I think my first was "The New Trio: The Helion Wands."

Albus, Rose and Scorpius are all sorted into Gryffindor and during an incident with Peeves, their wands connect and they create a massive fireball, far beyond the abilities of first years.

While recovering in the Hospital Wing, their parents are called and Hermione realizes that the Helion wands have found their masters.

Long story short, the Helion wands were a project that Ollivander and Gorogovitch had worked on together--attempted to recreate the Elder Wand.

Also, their DADA professor was a vampire.
