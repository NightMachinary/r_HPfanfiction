When writing the twin, there are several things you should definately avoid.

- Don't have them switch stealing every couple of words, whenever they did this in canon, they would usually only do it once halfway through the sentence, maybe twice depending on the sentence

- The Gred and Forge joke was only used once in canon and never heard from again, don't make it into a recurring thing

- Don't have them refer to each other as brother mine
