Look at what motivates each character. Why do they do the things they do. Don't write too much into a characters main traits though. Its likely to become cliche like many other fanfics do. Could you imagine the characters saying something like what you've written? The movie actor voices may help in this visualisation. Make sure to have your own character development though, even if its parallel to the books, make sure its still there, stories that don't rely on source material for detail and depth are better quality.
