I agree with you. Canon Harry would NEVER kill anyone, and Rowling did put a big emphasis on how bad Killing was. Harry almost killed one character in the show, and it's Malfoy with a spell he did'nt know the effects.\\
Even while facing Voldemort (both times) he uses a fucking Experliarmus. And technically Voldemort killed himself with his own Killing Curse.

At this point I want to add, if Harry had managed to disarm Voldemort. Then what ? 1st time you are still alone surrounded by Death Eaters and Voldemort showed he knew some wandless magic (at least enough to conjure his wand ) 2nd time you are still in the middle of a battlefield.

What was he trying to achieve with this spell ?
