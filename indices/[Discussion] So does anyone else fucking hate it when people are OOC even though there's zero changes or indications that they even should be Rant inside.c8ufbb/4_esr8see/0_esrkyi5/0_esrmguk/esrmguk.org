I wasn't arguing or anything, in fact I agree with you in principle. Ron, who I am more attached to as a character is often all of a sudden worse than a death eater with no indication of why. I hate that wholeheartedly.

It's just that I remembered this particular fic and wanted to explain my thoughts so as to reduce any frustration you may feel and start a discussion on more civil terms. No harm done.
