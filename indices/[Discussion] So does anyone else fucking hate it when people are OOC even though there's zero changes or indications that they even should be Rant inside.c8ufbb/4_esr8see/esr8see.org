I read it only a month ago, I think. Maybe I'm much much more immune to OOCness but it made a certain amount of sense at the time??

For context to begin with, this isn't Canon Harry. He has instincts of his Mirror self. The narrative made it very clear that he could not save all the children himself if he turned. There even was the chance of Voldemort joining the fight if Harry clearly betrayed him which Voldemort already suspected. To avoid a slaughter of the children he redirected the death eater's focus to the engine which had already crashed into a big tree trunk. He wasn't expecting anyone to be alive. Also, he was playing for time because he had already sent a message to Dumbledore and was expecting him any second. Now here Canon Harry's Instinct would indeed be to save everyone but this isn't Canon Harry. He has the instincts of a killer and judging the trolley witch to be a lost cause that would not survive this ordeal no matter what, kills her. The same Harry a few minutes later risks the whole charade to save a little girl since she was not a lost cause.

I did stop reading the fic soon after when Harry got led into a trap on a ship. It just didn't hold my interest too much because it didn't feel like anything that he would feel terrible about was coming out of Harry's other instincts. It was more of a switch when I like a slider bar.

I suppose OOCness never bothered me at all. My first proper fic was HPMoR so you can guess that the idea was practically shoved in my face. It's only when the plot stops moving anywhere significant that I leave a fic. It's also why I can't handle Canon-compliant character fics. I know the significant plot already so I can't bring myself to care. Same reason I never reread or re-watch even my most favorite things until I have well and truly forgotten them.
