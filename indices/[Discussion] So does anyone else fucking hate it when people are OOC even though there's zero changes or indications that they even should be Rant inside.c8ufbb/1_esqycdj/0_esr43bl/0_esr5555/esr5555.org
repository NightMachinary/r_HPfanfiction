Never, I consider this thing for the equivalent of Dragon Ball Evolution for the Harry Potter universe. Except Dragon Ball author decided to write a sequel after seeing it, he didn't go and say "Yup that's good, consider it canon ".

Whats your favourite OOC part in Cursed Child: ○Harry "it's ok to be in Slytherin " who treat his son bad because he is in Slytherin ? ○ Ron "a love potion almost killed me" who give love potion as a joke. ○ Snape "I'm proud he carries my name " ○Diggory the "I'm a ridiculously likeable character " who become a Death Eater cause he did bad in a Tournament ?

I also love how Rowling said Ron and Hermione are not a very good couple and would need counseilling, but accept that fic where Hermione is just miserable without Ron.
