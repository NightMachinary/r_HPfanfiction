I think linkffn(New Blood) does that. It's basically a Slytherin!Hermione who convinces everyone she's a New Blood instead of a Muggle-born (as in the first pure-bloods must have been born to Muggle parents. There is a lot of complex and antiquated courtship traditions and you really see the difference between wizarding and Muggle fashions and Hermione exploits her dormmates' lack of knowledge about makeup since it apparently doesn't exist in the author's version of the wizarding world. In a chapter of second-year she goes buying new robes with her mother as well as other clothing... commodities, and Madam Malkins tells her that with her maturing body she should buy herself some stays which are basically the name give to what we know as corsets for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Hermione tells her mother after this when they left how stuck in the eighteenth century wizarding fashion is. It's very slight wizarding world bashing and is a bit inconsistent considering the author chose to have the movie version of Hogwarts' uniforms which is laughable because why a society stuck in the eighteenth century would have its boys and girls wear trousers and short skirts when the former is simply undignified for a gentle man and the latter is scandalous for any lady.

Warning that basically every Slytherin in Hermione's year accept her has a New Blood somewhere in their first year and the author doesn't put hyphens for pure-blood, half-blood and Muggle-born and puts upper cases to the two formers as well as wizarding or magical in regards to â€˜wizarding world'. That last bit isn't really a problem for most but it's a pet peeve of mine.
