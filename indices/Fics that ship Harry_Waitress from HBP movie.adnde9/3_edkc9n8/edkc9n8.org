Thank you for this thread! I've followed both links and bookmarked them. :)

I've always liked that little coffee scene, and was curious about that girl must have felt. Then I had the thought 'can you imagine if she had gotten to know Harry and was sucked into Wizarding drama' whether she just became his friend, or dated him.

I also wonder about the other coffee waitress, the one freaked out by the Death Eaters. I'd love to read a little oneshot in her point of view.
