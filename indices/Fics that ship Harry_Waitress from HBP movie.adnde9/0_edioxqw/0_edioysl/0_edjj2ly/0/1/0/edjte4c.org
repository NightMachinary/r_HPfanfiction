Also in the UK, forgot to add that. I specifically remember my parents texting when I was a kid around '97 - my own phone was on the ETACS network, which was analogue and so didn't support texting.

In fact, I can say more on this because I'm a tech nerd and a history nerd, so I'm a tech-history nerd a little too - the first mass-produced GSM phone was the Nokia 1011, which came out in '92. It supported SMS.
