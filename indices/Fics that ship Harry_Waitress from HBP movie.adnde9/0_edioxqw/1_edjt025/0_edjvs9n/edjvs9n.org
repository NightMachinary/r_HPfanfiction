Rowling can do a lot of things, but writing a decent romance is not one of them. Case in point, there's something questionable about pretty much every shown relationship other than Cedric/Cho and maybe Percy/Penelope.

It's not unbelievable that someone goes from just met to crush to love in a short period of time, especially since we are talking about teenagers, but more time spent together would be required to sell this particular pairing.
