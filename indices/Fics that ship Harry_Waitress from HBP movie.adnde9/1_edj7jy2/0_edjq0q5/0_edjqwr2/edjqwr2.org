This is true but harsh at the same time.

In the books and especially in the films, Ginny is given almost no time to persuade the reader/viewer to her side. Bonnie Wright had a particularly difficult job as some of the best Ginny moments from the books were lost (no elbow in the butter dish, for instance). She doesn't even get a line in the epilogue.

So I can't disagree that she has zero chemistry but I'm not going to blame the actress. The couple of moments she does get are quite nice - the backward glance at Harry as he stays in the RoR with Cho, for instance, and her reaction when Ron tries to give her his dress robes in the mistaken belief they're for her.
