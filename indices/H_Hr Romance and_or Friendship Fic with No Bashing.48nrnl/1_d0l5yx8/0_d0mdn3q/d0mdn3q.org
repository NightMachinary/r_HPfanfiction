I would love to find a fic that has jealous immature Ron through the first 4 years but slowly growing up and then continue the growth 5-7 with a relapse in the hunt only to finally be the mature one when he comes back. Like Harry and Hermione be snotty or immature when he does because they don't know how to react to him.
