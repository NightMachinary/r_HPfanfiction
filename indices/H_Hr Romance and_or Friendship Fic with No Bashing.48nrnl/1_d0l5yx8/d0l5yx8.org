This raises the question of what "bashing" is. Some seen treat it as any negative portrayal of a character, which I'd say is ridiculous.

A jealous or immature Ron is canon, but I wouldn't call it "bashing" unless his jealousy overwhelms his good qualities, perhaps to the point where he's just two dimensional.

A manipulative Dumbledore is canon, too, and again I wouldn't call it "bashing" unless his manipulations are done with bad intentions and/or that part of his character overwhelms any good qualities.

I don't think it matters if the negative qualities are depicted in new, non-canon contexts or not (e.g., giving Ron something new to be jealous about). What matters is whether or not the character stays roughly three dimensional - with both good and bad traits.
