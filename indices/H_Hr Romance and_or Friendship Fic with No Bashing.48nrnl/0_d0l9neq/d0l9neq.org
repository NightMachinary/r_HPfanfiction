I'm very slowly putting together an FFN community of fics like this, but---well, they're hard to find. (One thing I've noticed that links a lot of H/Hr fics I don't enjoy together is that they're very stuck on the idea that Harry and Hermione are smart, rational Muggles and the wizarding world is bad, abusive, and childish. Once I see that I feel like love-potion-Ginny, senile Dumbledore, and Serious and Powerful Bookworm Harry are all inevitable.)

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing) is one of the newer ones I've found that meets these criteria. Really nice slow-burn romance that includes an OK canon-style mystery at its center and is honest about the faults and questions in a potential H/Hr relationship.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is an old, complete sixth-year fic I recommend whenever I get the chance---very confident writing style, interesting takes on canon characters. The end is a little abrupt, and the seventh-year sequel looks abandoned, but it feels complete on its own.

linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian) and linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) are both seventh-year fics written ahead of the release of DH. The writing isn't great but it's solid, and the writer manages to avoid a lot of bad H/Hr fanon.

One I really enjoy on Portkey is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7149&chapterid=&agree=1][Three Seasons to Closure]]. Different from the others in that there's no real adventure or mystery, but a very nice, slow-paced romance.
