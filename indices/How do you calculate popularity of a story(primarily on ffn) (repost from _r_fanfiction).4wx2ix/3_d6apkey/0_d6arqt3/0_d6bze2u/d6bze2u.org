I don't. Most communities usually are more of an archive, used by readers to easily keep track of the stuff they read and share them with people. Its more of a reader's tool than a writer's tool.

And on the rare occasion that a popular enough community accepts my story, I'll get a bump in traffic, and I thank the community's manager.

For example, out of the 82 communities my story is currently in, only 11 have more than 100 followers.

So communities aren't really that good of a metric about your story.
