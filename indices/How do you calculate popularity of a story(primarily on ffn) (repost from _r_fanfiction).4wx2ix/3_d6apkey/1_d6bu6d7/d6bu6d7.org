  However, they also the most inaccurate. If I review your story, I might not be praising you. I might just be pointing out shitty grammar, or a plot hole, or how I dislike your OC, or how I disagree with something you wrote.

I may have written a several hundred word review on a Mass Effect fanfic yesterday defending Ashley against the incorrect public opinion that she's a racist. I got to the end and realized I'd been ranting even though I actually love the story and had to end it with several sentences about how much I'm enjoying the fic. It was strange but the author responded within the hour saying they agreed with me and hadn't meant to portray her like that.
