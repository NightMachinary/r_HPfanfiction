I posted about it in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4wxo1i/how_to_know_your_fanfic_is_popular_heres_my_theory/][r/Fanfiction]] a while back, but here's my opinion.

Here's the measurements I think you should be taking into consideration, and in /this/ order:

#+begin_quote
  1)*Favourites* - Favourites are public, which means that a person favourites can be seen by anybody. If I favourite your story, it means that not only do I like your story, but I'm also willing to let others know that I like your story. Its pretty much the ultimate show of approval.

  2)*Follows* - Follows basically mean interest. If I follow you, it means that while I may or may not like your story, I definitely want to see more of it. Not the most ringing type of endorsement, but a very decent endorsement nonetheless.

  3)*Traffic* - Now this is a bit of a doozy. How do you know what amount of traffic is normal for a fic in your fandom? You don't. But you'll get a feel for it if you write for a while.

  That graph ff.net has showing your traffic. Learn to read it, and you'll be reading your readers' minds. Some examples of such deductions are:

  ---> If your view stats for a day is more than 2 times the visitor stats, it means that you're getting new readers.

  --->If the graph keeps growing every time you post a new chapter, people are liking it more and more. This one is obvious.

  --->And if you see a lot of views but a much lesser amount of visitors on a day you haven't updated, it means that people are rereading your story, which is always a good thing.

  4)*Reviews* - And this is the dodgiest thing of all. Let me preface this by saying that I do think that reviews are good measures of how popular your story is. However, they also the most inaccurate. If I review your story, I might not be praising you. I might just be pointing out shitty grammar, or a plot hole, or how I dislike your OC, or how I disagree with something you wrote. Remember. Reviews are a way to give criticism and a lot of highly reviewed stories can be a dogpile of shit. That being said, they are a good way of knowing where a story stands, but only if you judge the quality and not quantity of them.

  Do you agree? Have you used these measures to look at your stories in the way I do? Do you know of any other ways you judge your story's popularity?
