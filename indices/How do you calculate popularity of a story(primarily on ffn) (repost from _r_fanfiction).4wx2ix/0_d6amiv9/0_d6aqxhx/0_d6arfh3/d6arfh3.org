This may sound a bit arrogant: But if I read a negative review with a high percentage of spelling and grammar mistakes, I immediately see it as a good recommendation for the authors story. If the plebs can't handle it, its probably at least decent.

My threshold for this very subjective measurement is 1 well texted review that is more than 3 sentences long.
