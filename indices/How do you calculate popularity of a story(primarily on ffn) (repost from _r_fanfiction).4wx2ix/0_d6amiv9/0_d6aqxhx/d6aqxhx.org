So far I've had three bad reviews(just assholishness from one reviewer, one who couldn't read, and another saying 'old crusher and picard having a sex life is wrong'), lots of perfunctories('good chapter' or 'more' kind of thing), and a couple reviews that were pretty substantive with queries about how the story was going(which are being addressed in later chapters for the most part, they haven't brought up anything I haven't really thought of save for how the jjverse affects my story) and one review that actually made me rethink some stuff on vulcan tactile-telepathy but decided to keep how I had written it because 'magic.' out of 84 reviews.

Edit: also, I think it's the seventh most reviewed. Seven, pretty popular.
