I haven't managed three figures of reviews on any of mine. Favourites are all about thirty-odd. Does it hurt to compare myself? Yes of course it does. Does it mean my stories are shit? Probably yes. On the other hand at least I don't feel any sense of obligation to anyone else and there won't be howls of outrage when I delete them. It is a small consolation.
