Well, against itself, you have to gauge how many people are viewing the story, versus actually reading it through. Against others though, I guess you can just compare numbers (reviews, follows, favs). If they're similar, then you have to take into account when the story was published. The story that is newer but has similar numbers, likely means its more popular, though that can get skewed by chapter counts (but you can find an average count by dividing by the chapter count, and then comparing /those/ numbers against each other), and update speeds (letting a chapter sit for a few weeks will get more reviews than just jamming a chapter out every day.

So, for example, I have a really bad harry/rowena story that is about 7 years old. It's a rare pairing, with only 55 stories popping up on the filter at all, and that's not actual pairing, just where she's labeled as a main character. So I can look at it and see these numbers: Reviews: 660 - Favs: 1,813 - Follows: 1,777. Also, fifteen chapters (and half a million views). So, then I can look down the 55 stories, and I only see one that even comes close - it has about 80% of my numbers, with two extra chapters (while also being a little shorter), and it was published at the same time as mine. So it would be easy enough to say my story is the more popular of the two, and probably the most popular there (but that's not saying much since the story is shit).

But comparing it across the site can be difficult. I do have another story that I posted during the same timeframe as the previous example, except it is Harry/Daphne (and atrocious). These are the numbers: Reviews: 470 - Favs: 2,617 - Follows: 1,168, 16 chapters. Reviews and Follows being lower are easier to explain - this story is finished, while the other isn't. There's no reason to follow a story that isn't going to have any more updates, and the padded review count is at least partially people asking when the next update is. Perhaps the most telling number is the favorites, which is much higher. The explanation for that is that I don't thing the favorites system was around when the story first got posted.

So, then the question really is, is the story more popular, or is the pairing more popular? The answer to that is, the pairing is more popular. The Harry/Daphne story has 1.5 million views. And, amongst Harry/Daphne stories, that's not really remarkable at all.
