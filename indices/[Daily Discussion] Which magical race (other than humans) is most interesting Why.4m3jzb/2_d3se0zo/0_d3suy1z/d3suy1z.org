  What motivates them?
#+end_quote

Dementors are soulless miserable beings that consume the souls and happiness from others to fill the void in their hearts. Poor things.

#+begin_quote
  Can they be killed?
#+end_quote

It is stated at some point that the Patronus Charm is the only defence against them, as that does not kill them I belive they cannot be killed. /However/ they do die from age. At the beginning of The Half-Blood Prince the Minister of Magic says that the fog appeared because dementors are breeding. If they can breed then they can die, else the world would be covered in them.

  How do you control them?
#+end_quote

You give them a supply of what they desire most: happiness and souls, but dementors are smart enough to know that a soulless human cannot feel happiness so they know not to eat the souls of everyone else they run out.
