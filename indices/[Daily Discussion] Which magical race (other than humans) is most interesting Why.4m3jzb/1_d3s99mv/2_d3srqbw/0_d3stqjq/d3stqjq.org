I've seen 'the gnomes of zurich' in fanfics more than dwarven bankers. I usually use dwarves as stone craftsmen, humans as wood craftsmen, and goblins as masters of earthworks.

But while each race has an affinity, any creature can be a master craftsman in other fields, it's just i see them as having an affinity due to 'prejudice.' Since their people always work in those fields, they are considered the best for it.
