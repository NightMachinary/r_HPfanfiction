House elves. They are so useful, and so much of wizarding society seems to depend on them implicitly. Yet, they get ignored at best or abused. This is despite the fact that a house elf uprising would lead to a blood bath the likes of which magical Britain might never recover from.

I enjoy stories that treat house elves as valuable beings, not just background props or a punching bag for spoiled pureblood children. I particularly like some stories in which a wizard (usually HP) teams up with a house elf to create a very hard to beat first strike advantage, useful in either robbery or asymmetric warfare.
