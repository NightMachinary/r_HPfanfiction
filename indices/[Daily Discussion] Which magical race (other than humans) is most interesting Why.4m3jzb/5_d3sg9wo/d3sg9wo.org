I have two.

1. From a cultural standpoint: Werewolves. We learn a bit from Lupin, but I woul love to learn more about them. Are they all like Greyback? Are there different factions (those like Lupin, those like Greyback)? Did they all support Voldie or was there a civil war among them between followers and non-followers? How does their society exactly work? Do they live as packs like wolves, alone, or are they one big society? What kind of laws do they have? I think it's something interesting to dwell on.

2. From a more general standpoint: Inferi. Because they are fucking scary.
