I'm not sure, you bring up a good point. According to the wiki, it said they are human corpses. I don't think we've seen an Inferus (in the series) made of something other than a human corpse, although, as you pointed out, the possibility is there.

Many games/series consider "living dead" or "zombies" to be a race (like in WoW or how in TWD they emphasize that walkers are no longer human). Furthermore, they can no longer be considered "human" once they have become Inferi. So these points make it difficult to classify them.

Maybe more like a magical creature?

Despite all this, they're still scary as all hell and pretty interesting.
