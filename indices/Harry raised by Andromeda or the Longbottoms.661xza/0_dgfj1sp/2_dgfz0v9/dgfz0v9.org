As far as I know sadly there are no fics that match your request. The best I could offer is a sane Bella raising Harry but that fic never got anywhere (current progess has Harry in Bella's care for less than a month and it has a strange, very OOC Lupin thrown in the mix).

There are few fics where someone else besides Sirius or Remus raises Harry and most of them paint murderers like the Malfoys or even Riddle in a good light. I would love to read a story where Andromeda plays a large role in raising Harry but the closest we get is either the R-Series, which is mentioned above or "Old Friends, New Friends". The later is a story with an amazing and touching beginning but it really falls off after the third year and the ending and resolution is not really good.
