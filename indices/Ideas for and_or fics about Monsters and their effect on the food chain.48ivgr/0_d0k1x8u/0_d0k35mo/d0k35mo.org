Yeah, Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure. One of my all-time favorites that features an OC that is an actual Character (Timothy Faulks aka everyone's favourite commissar/sunbro in the wizarding world)-I cannot recommend this fic enough to anyone reading this that hasn't read that series of fics-if only to witness the awesome that is the God Emperor geeking out.

Apart from that, the food chain in the Wizarding World seems to be a lot more complicated, not to mention primordial, than ours. Ultra-large predators such as Dragons, Giants etcetera still roam the wilds and take a particularly large amount of effort to subdue/kill-which implies a food source large enough to sustain a stable population. Dementors and other creatures do not need to kill their victims to feed on them, but rather reduce them to a state of catatonia (that's how I picture a Kiss victim at least. I don't buy them stealing their souls so much as basically munching on their psyche, leaving just enough lower brain functions behind to keep the body alive) and are ridiculously hard to kill and/or injure. And then you have the artificially created lifeforms such as Basilisks to contend with, beasts that have terrible power yet could have potentially been created to fill ecological niches perceived to be unoccupied by their creators-or replace the current occupants of said niche with beings that can be controlled by said creators with minimal effort.

There's a whole esoteric ecosystem there that remains vastly underexplored.

As for not exterminating them, the answer is actually fairly simple-the flora and fauna in question generate resources with specific magical properties that boost the effectiveness or enable the creation of potions & artifacts that would otherwise not exist. Killing off the population of a particular species would be extremely expensive in terms of having to replace or replicate the various magical feats the species in question allows wizards and witches to achieve-and that is not even considering the number of races whose intelligence level is at the very least equivalent to a human's. Or the impact on the local esoteric ecosystem. Far better to corral and contain until a permanent solution to whatever problem these things exhibit can be found.

Oh, and then there's the fact that a fair amount of magical infrastructure (security systems, post, prison guards, banking & finance etcetera) relies on the involvement of magical creatures to function. Without them, an awfully large chunk of the magical world would simply cease to exist in any particularly meaningful way.
