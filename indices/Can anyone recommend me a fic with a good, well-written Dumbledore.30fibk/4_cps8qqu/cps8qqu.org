If you're up for a marathon challenge, there's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=6048&chapterid=&agree=1][Harry Potter And the Fifth Element]] by Bexis. I think it's around 1.5 million words, but is complete and has a very capable Dumbledore who avoids the master manipulator trope.
