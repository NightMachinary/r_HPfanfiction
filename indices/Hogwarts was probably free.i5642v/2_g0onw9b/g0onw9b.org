Hogwarts is a state school. There are no fees.

This is however inconsistent as in UK state schools you don't have to buy your own textbooks, lab equipment (cauldron, ingredients, and telescope in the magical universe), or paper, so I can see why people may get confused.

Buying the uniform, your own pens and pencils (so quills), sporting equipment (broomstick) is consistent with the UK secondary school experience.

Tbh I think JK had them buying the books and cauldrons and that just to world build somewhat. It's a nice touch that to go off to wizard school, one must own a cauldron.
