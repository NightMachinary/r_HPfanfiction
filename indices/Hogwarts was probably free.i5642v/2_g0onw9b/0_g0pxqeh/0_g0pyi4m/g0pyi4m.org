I mean, we had to buy our uniform and sports equipment - like tennis rackets and so on (but my dad worked in a gym so he just brought stuff home for me ðŸ˜…) and your schoolbag and your pens were your responsibility. But textbooks, notebooks, special lab equipment and so on, nah that was all provided by the school.

We had to pay for our dinner though, the one thing that seems to be free at Hogwarts! She's clearly got it backwards!

Hogwarts is absolutely based on private schools, that's really clear (or more likely based on the traditional "English boarding school novel"), but JKR has said both Hogwarts and St Mungo's are free at the point of use - which, when you consider she's a member of the Labour Party, is not surprising.

In fairness, it does explain how the Weaselys managed to put seven kids, five of them at any given time for many years, through the system on one persons wage. Some school provided textbooks would have been a blessing to Molly's budget, though.
