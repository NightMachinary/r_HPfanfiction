Canonical answer is it is free.

Of course, Canon had absolutely bonkers economics, so.

My personal headcannon is the wizarding world is a post-scarcity society. With Land and Food being essential free through magic.

This I call the 'heirloom' economy: There are rare goods (most magical artifacts are hand-crafted) and you might expect a wizard to create only a few of them in their life.

Thus 'rich' families are those who have multi-generations of magical artifacts, or having raided artifacts from others (clocks, wands, statues, whatever) built up, and 'poor' families only have what they themselves have built in the most recent generation. Thus being disowned (like Andromeda) is essentially banishment to poverty, all muggleborns are dirt-poor.

Those who are not creating new magic and the like (working for the Prophet, Ministry, etc) are paid to compensate for the fact they are not off building things that are worth value, but it is a small part of the economy. Rich families would have to sell artifacts to fund their needs.

While you could view Hogwarts as a traditional tax-and-provide education, through the lens of a heirloom economy, I'd like to think of it as a school based on philanthropy. Hogwarts is essentially itself super rich, with teachers 'paying' to teach there (by working at a the school for say a decade, and with the school retaining any magic you imbue into it, it is essentially increasing its wealth without the individual professors increasing their wealth.). Of course, in a post-scarcity world, it means people can afford to do something like that.

Any outside needs the school has would be met by philanthropy, giving the 'board of governors' power over the school (as they would buy the brooms, etc). But without needing to pay staff or for food or other basics, those costs would be minimal.
