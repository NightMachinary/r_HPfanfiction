It's not a debate. Everyone doesn't live in the UK. Private schools and colleges in particular have students pay tuition to attend. I previously classified it as a private school because of how the worldbuilding made it look and feel. Like something special. But if it's a state-run school then the rules of state-run schools in the UK apply. You probably get so many "debates" because of how schooling works in other countries because, again, everyone doesn't live in the UK.
