I understand. My basis is that, from my own experience at private school in Scotland, Private schools in the UK have a very specific culture surrounding them, and Hogwarts shares next to none of that culture. To me it always made sense the Hogwarts was an Academy (State funded but with a lot more freedom from the government, with a board of governors), and was funded from taxes, especially if we accept the low population and accept that Hogwarts is the only school in Wizarding Britain, then it stands to reason that it could be funded by the State. Couple that with the dangerous nature of magic, Education seems more of a requirement than ever. It seems to be incredibly short sighted, even for an incompetent Ministry, to remove access to that education.
