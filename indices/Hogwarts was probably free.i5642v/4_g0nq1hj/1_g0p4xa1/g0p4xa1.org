Honestly, there are holes in the canon worldbuilding big enough to drive a train through.

In this case, Economics and population size.

â€‹

A lot of fics go the route of "There are a lot more wizarding schools Hogwarts is just the best in the state". In that case, Hogwarts is an 'exclusive' school and there are two easy ways to make the school exclusive: Either you make it expensive (needing money and/or connections), or you have academic barriers (testing).

Usually the path that ends up down is "Expensive school + all muggleborns go to Hogwarts", thus justifying a larger wizarding world.

Plus there is the whole "Lets make wizards culturally backwards", which would lend to a more archaic funding system (ie, no progressive income tax).

My personal preference is a small wizarding world (ie, one that can survive on a yearly class size of 35-40, meaning a total British Wizarding Population of only a few thousand)

Anyway, I don't find this a problem. Filling in the holes in canon is kind of what fanfiction does, and while simply slapping tuition on the school to justify its exclusiveness is kinda lazy, eh.
