Canonically?

I'd say all of them, like at a certain point they are just going to stand in each others way, and adding more wont really do anything to improve their chances against Voldemort, while having them worry about friendly fire. And I honesly believe that point is reached before you could ever overwhelm him.

There is also the problem that Voldemort has no qualms about using the Imperius curse and each Auror you add is another possible enemy the other Aurors have to face, and definitely decreasing their moral. And before you say that wouldn't work on Aurors, we see the Imperius curse work on Moody in addition to Crouch Jr and Sr.

The only difference is if one of those Auror has access to significant magical knowledge Voldemort isn't fully aware of, like Harry did in the end with the whole wand ownership thing, or manages to somewhat catch him off guard like Newt did with Grindelwald.
