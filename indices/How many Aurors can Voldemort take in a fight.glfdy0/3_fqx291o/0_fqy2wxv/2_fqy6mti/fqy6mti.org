The problem is that in HP, the power of a spell depend almost entirely of the caster. Unlike in other universe where a wizard learn to cast "Fire lvl1", then "Fire lvl2" and so on, in HP, a simple Incendio, that can only do a weak little flame when cast by a 1st year, can be used by an experimented wizard to burn an entire forest.

So even in the case where Auror where "trained to resist the Imperius" (which is already discutable since the spell is an Unforgivable, and Crouch Jr using it in GoF is really shown as "Mad Eye Constant Vigilance ideology" rather than a Ministry approved training"), being able to resist the Imperius cast by a fellow Auror, or even a Death Eater like Malfoy, does not mean you can resist one cast by Voldemort himself.
