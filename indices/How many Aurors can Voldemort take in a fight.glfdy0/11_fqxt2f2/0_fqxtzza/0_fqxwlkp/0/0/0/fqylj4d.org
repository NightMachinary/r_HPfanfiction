  But their relative magical abilities don't really matter in combat nearly as much as their tactics and circumstances

Strongly disagree. Magical fights are almost always won in canon by the greater wizard, and are almost always won by the application of superior magical ability.

I agree that objectives matter - but then what you haven't isn't necessarily a fight, but something else (e.g. a chase scene, like the DoM fight).

Unless you are talking about how you prefer to do things in your fanfiction, rather than what you think canon shows? I find it's generally best to flag which one you are talking about.

Anyway, even without canon support, logically magical ability is clearly the most important factor. If Voldemort's magical ability is such that he can cast a single spell which can instantly obliterate 20 Aurors, then this is a game-changing ability compared to a world where Voldemort's strongest spell can only kill, say, 3 Aurors at once. Which is in turn game changing compared to a world where Voldemort can't immediately kill any Aurors, but rather has to work to overcome their defences. All three of those positions is potentially canon-compatible.
