Without objectives, you just have some thought exercise without any value. Like those vs. videos where a couple of soldiers are put against each other in "simulations" without taking into account how they actually were deployed. Morale also plays a huge role - few will fight to the death no matter the odds. Voldemort has a huge advantage in that his reputation alone will have a significant effect on his enemies, making them more likely to flee than fight as soon as things get tricky.

However, in canon, Voldemort couldn't even kill a single boy in a graveyard. So, the ability to actually hit what you're aiming at, and - for Harry - the ability to take cover and move - seems a bit more important than knowing spells. Also, the mere existence of the Killing Curse means that we've got a similar situation as with modern firearms - anyone with a minimum of training (and the needed hatred) can kill anyone else if they manage to hit them. You don't need superior magical ability, you just need to land the Killing Curse. And the only defence against it is not to get hit - meaning, using hard cover, movement, and concealment. Or, in other words, tactics. (Unless you fold all the tactics of how to use spells and how to move and take cover etc. into "magical ability".)

In the same sense, a spell that can wipe out 20 Aurors at once is useless if you can't hit the enemy - or if you can't detect them in time. Or if they are spread out so you can't get everyone even if you hit one. Also, based on canon, we can safely assume that if Voldemort cannot kill Harry in a rigged duel as soon as Harry starts running and taking cover, then he would have trouble killing Aurors as well if they used similar tactics. On the other hand, standing your ground seems to be asking for a Killing Curse to the face, and, therefore, an inferior tactic.

So, based on canon events, how powerful your spells are doesn't matter as much as how well you can use them and how well you can fight from a tactical point of view.

Actual combat is more complex than an arena death match.
