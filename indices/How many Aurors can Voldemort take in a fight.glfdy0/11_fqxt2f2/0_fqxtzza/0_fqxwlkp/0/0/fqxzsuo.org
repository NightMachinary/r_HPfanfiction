But their relative magical abilities don't really matter in combat nearly as much as their tactics and circumstances. What would happen in a magical arena deathmatch where everyone stands and fights doesn't have much if any influence on what would happen in an actual fight.

Further, what kind of spells are allowed? Canon's selection is kind of limited. Is conjuring cover allowed? Conjuring swarms of insects?

And, again: Are Killing Curses allowed for the Aurors, and how close are they to Voldemort? That's important for knowing how quickly they can set up a crossfire and outflank Voldemort. Once Voldemort has to turn his back to one Auror to face the other, he's at a huge disadvantage, and we know that he has trouble hitting a running target in a graveyard.
