What's the distance? How far are the Aurors spread out? What are their and Voldemort's goals? (That's important since if Voldemort wants to kill them all, he needs to cast an Anti-Apparition Jinx at one point to keep them from fleeing.)

Only their wands? No brooms? No potions? Have the Aurors trained for this, with standard responses? What do the Aurors know about Voldemort? Are Killing Curses allowed for Aurors?

I don't really think this "baseline" is actually helpful since this situation won't ever occur in an actual conflict. Unless one side is surprised, they won't be caught out in the open like this.
