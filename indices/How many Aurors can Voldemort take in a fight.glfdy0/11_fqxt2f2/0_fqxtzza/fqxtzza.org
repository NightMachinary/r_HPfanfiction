Let's say it's a fair and neutral fight:

- In an empty, flat field.

- Both sides facing each other and clearly visible.

- Neither side surprised at the other's presence or position.

- Neither side is armed with anything other than their normal wand.

This gives us what you might consider the "baseline" number, from which you can adjust your prediction of the outcome depending on different circumstances.
