There's no set number - it depends on the circumstances of the fight. An ambush by Aurors will go much differently than an ambush by Voldemort, for example. Generally, in most battles, the attacker has the advantage and initiative, at least at the beginning. The defender is reacting, perhaps caught on the wrong foot, and usually takes at least a bit to find out what is happening. If they're in their home base, so to speak, they'll likely have some preparations and plans, but if they're caught somewhere else, the battle might already have been decided by the time the defender gets a clearer picture of what's happening.
