I think when Dumbledore said that the Aurors were on their way it both meant Voldemort's game of staying in the shadows would soon end and that, as a powerful as he is, fighting both Dumbledore and a squadron of Aurors would no be wise. I don't think it's fair to upgrade the Aurors so much. In GoF they were /detectives//dark wizard hunters, still elite but you can't receive standardised training (made by a corrupt and seemingly incompetent most of the time Ministry) to become a quarter as powerful as Voldemort.
