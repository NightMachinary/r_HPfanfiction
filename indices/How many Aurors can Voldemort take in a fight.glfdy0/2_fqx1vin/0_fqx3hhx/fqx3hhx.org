There actually isn't any standardised Auror training in canon - they only recruit one new Auror every few years, per McGonagall in OotP. Nowhere near enough to populate any kind of "Auror school". Rather, they appear to have a kind of apprenticeship to an experienced Auror - we know Tonks was taught by Mad-Eye.

In any event, their training would not be what makes them "become a quarter as powerful as Voldemort". Rather, the Aurors would only recruit elite students - those who had that potential already. After all, as described [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gi2own/realistically_how_strong_could_a_wizard_be_at_a/fqcs331/][here]], most of the magic which Aurors use will be magic they already know from Hogwarts, meaning that Auror training is going to be focused on /applying/ that magic to hunting Dark wizards, rather than learning entirely new magic.
