  Dumbledore mentions that Aurors will be coming soon to Voldemort in OotP, as if their arrival would present a genuine threat to Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Doesn't mean he can't solo the entire Aurors forces, but there was also members of the Order and fucking Dumbledore here and he definitely can't take all of them on at once.

  Dawlish, Fudge, Umbridge and Percy in OotP presented no threat whatsoever to Dumbledore, who took them out with a single spell in an instant. I've excluded Kingsley due to his true allegiance, but it's worth noting that Dumbledore's spell took him out along with all the others.

To be fair he took them by surprise.

4 aurors is imo way too little to pose a real threat to Voldemort. He took three top tier wizards at once at the end of Hogwarts battle, Kinglsey and McGonagall are probably head and shoulders above the average auror, it would take more than 4 Tonks or Dawlishes to defeat Voldy imo.
