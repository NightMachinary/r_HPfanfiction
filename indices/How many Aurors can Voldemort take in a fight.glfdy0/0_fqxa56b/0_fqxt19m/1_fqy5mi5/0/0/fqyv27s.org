Yeah, I remember that dialog on and off too. For me though, I think it's because Professor Snape's death hit me so hard. With the exception of seeing his memories and "Not my daughter you bitch" everything after his death is fuzzy until someone mentions it. And even Molly's line I remember her audio from the movie more that reading or watching it.
