In canon he single-handedly fought Professors McGonagall, Slughorn and the auror Kingsley Shacklebolt who apparently was one of the stronger aurors in the force. All three were protected by Harry's sacrifice, and he still finally knocked them over with one single spell. Since I'd consider the average auror to be far weaker than Shacklebolt or Hogwarts professors, Voldemort could probably take on more than three. Though it might depend on how well they can actually work together and how afraid they are of him.

After all, when Dumbledore single-handedly demolished the Death-Eaters in OotP, they didn't even try fighting back. It might be similar for aurors against Voldemort.
