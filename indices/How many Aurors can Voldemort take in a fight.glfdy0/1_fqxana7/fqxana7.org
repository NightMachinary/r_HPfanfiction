I think the threat was about Dumbledore + a few aurors, not the aurors themselves. Like, as shown in canon, if Dumbledore is fighting Voldemort, Dumbledore can mostly keep up. Say Dumbledore and 1 auror focus on defense, and the other 3 focus on offense, it doesn't seem crazy that they could hinder Voldemort. If nothing else, they can cast Avada Kedavra, which might cause at least transient death or disembodiment to Voldemort.
