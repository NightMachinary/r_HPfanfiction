4 Aurors just sounds like too few in my head.

Given that, and given your criteria, I think with 4 Voldemort has the slight edge. ex.

- 1) A desperate fight for Aurors, but one if it were a story (particularly with Harry) the heroes could /just/ pull out of the bag, or otherwise delay, hamper etc.\\

But

- 2) if it were 'offscreen' then every chance it would be a shocking and terrifying news story 'Two Aurors Slain! Two more injured, one critical...' And would need to be given the sort of weight of major battles or countries being lost. Think Holland, Belgium, and France fall like dominoes, Dunkirk and Britain reel, the war has suddenly become bitter and desperate, and (on appearance) it's only a matter of time until victory of the enemy is assured.

5 could go either way (more like WW1 trench stalemate), and 6 Aurors gain a distinct edge.

Only other thing I disagree on is FB1/2, I sort of dismiss the specifics (like numbers, actual Aurors, even spells) and accept the broad-brush strokes that a single wizard bested many government wizards.
