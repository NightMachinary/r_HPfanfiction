Slughorn and McGonagall are masters of their fields and in HP magical mastery is directly correlated to dueling potential. We also see Slughorn as highly courted by Voldemort (though that could be personal connection or potion ability alone). All the jmportant Hogwarts professors seem to be about as powerful as a normal Wizard/Witch we see.

Tonks is a promising Auror and from what we have seen she isn't anywhere near as powerful or respected as the Hogwarts professors so I take most aurors to be a tier below such that you would need two or three aurors for a given main professor.
