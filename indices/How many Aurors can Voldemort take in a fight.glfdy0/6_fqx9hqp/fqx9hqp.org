Voldemort fought Kingsley, McGonagall and Slughorn at the same time. I don't know how powerful McGonagall and Slughorn are, but Kingsley once dueled Bellatrix who was able to fight Hermione, Ginny and Luna all at once and kill the likes of Sirius and Tonks. I'd say a little more than four, since I can't see 4 Aurors take out Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley.
