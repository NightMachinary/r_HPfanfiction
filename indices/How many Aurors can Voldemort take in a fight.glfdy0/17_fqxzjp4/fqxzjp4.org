tl;dr: There is no amount of Aurors that can defeat Voldemort. He is too smart to be overpowered. He is too powerful to be meaningfully opposed. He is too skilled to be outwitted magically. He is too experienced to let himself get into a situation that could feasibly end in his defeat. After all, the all-consuming driving force behind him is his /fear of death/.

This topic reminds me of this great quote: /“Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.”/

If you want to survive Voldemort wand-to-wand (not oppose him, just /survive/ a confrontation with him), then you /need/ to be Dumbledore-level (or one lucky AF scarface).

But I enjoy your intepretation.

  I would have it as maybe 4 Aurors being sufficient to bring Voldemort in

Big disagree. I think you're severely underestimating Voldemort's intelligence, and just how much MORE powerful he is than even powerful wizards. Quite simply: he would never allow himself to be in a situation where any array of powerful wizards can simultaneously oppose him.

As with the Ministry battle in "Order of the Phoenix" - he sends his lackeys in first, and not just shitty Snatcher-tier ones, but his "elite" - the Inner Circle of his followers.

I would say that Voldemort is easily the most powerful wizard in the "Potterverse". After all, he is decades younger than Dumbledore and can quite handily give him a run for his money. People always talk about how Voldemort has never beaten Dumbledore. But Dumbledore never defeated Voldemort when they duelled, either. Drift your mine back to the Order of the Phoenix, Ministry Atrium duel - at some point, Voldemort just screamed in rage and the sheer power of it threw Dumbledore off his feet and /forced/ Dumbledore to defend himself and Harry.

But to directly target your question - if we assumed that there is a cornered Voldemort, with seemingly no means of escape... then, simply put, he will kill everything around him and escape - there is no alternative. I like to envisage the Dark Lord as having "Hulk-like" power, whereby his anger magnifies his strength beyond what seems possible. We see this in the Deathly Hallows movie too (much as I hate to reference it); When Voldemort's diadem Horcrux is destroyed, he feels /something/, and that makes him angry enough that he single-handedly shatters the protective enchantments surrounding the school. If that happened in fanfiction, we'd say he was overpowered. We've already seen hundreds of Death Eaters being unable to take down those enchantments from the Outside, but when he got angry. He just fucking annihilated them

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV7jTYTK6Us][Seriously, just watch it.]] - Stupid-levels of power. One thing I'd forgotten from this scene, which is QUITE SIGNIFICANT - /His power CRACKS the Elder Wand.../ - This is the single most powerful application of magic we ever see in the movies.

Cue "It was at this Point, the students knew they fucked up."

Bonus: [[https://youtu.be/Dkxx0pKgkN4?t=186][Here's ANOTHER]] depiction of the Dark Lord screaming and wrecking stuff in his rage. Neat little thing to notice - when he destroys all that around him, he /isn't holding a wand/ (due to him using Malfoy Sr's and Harry just having broken that). That's just his straight-up hilarious amount of power ruining everything around him.

Think about it.

His power (with the Elder Wand) is greater than the /combined/ power of /every other/ mage who erected those protections.

Given that interpretation, which I quite enjoy, I would simply say that there is no collection of magical individuals in the "Potterverse" that can oppose him.

Aurors are nothing in comparison. I just think he's /too/ powerful. Once he is on the backfoot his power explodes out, and there is /nothing/ you can do to defend against it.

--------------

Assume there's - let's say twenty - highly-skilled Aurors battering him down, making him weary, cornering him and forcing him to defend himself. In my mind, no matter who is in front of him, at some point during their fighting, Voldemort will start unleashing ridiculously powerful magic that (some) of the Aurors are unable to defend from.

20 Aurors dwindles down to, say, 16. Errant Curses, still blisteringly powerful, slice through the weaker Aurors. They were too shocked at suddenly fighting /the Dark Lord/ to form adequate defence as he blasted them to atoms.

The Dark Lord continues throwing stupidly powerful magic around. One wrong move from the Aurors, one hesitant Shield Charm, one slow deflection - they are insta-killed.

16 Aurors becomes 12, becomes 10.

Perhaps he grows weary, or distracted, and is again forced to defend. His fury grows at his circumstances, these Aurors are /inferior/ to him and he needs to prove it. He either finds a means to escape, or gathers his magic in another explosive ejection. They are powerless to his might.

10 Aurors becomes 5 in an instant. The victims of his wrath are reduced to smears of blood and charred bone.

5 Aurors are insufficient. Maybe they retreat? That would be the sensible option. Their spells are too slow. Combined, they are vastly too weak against the fury of a Dark Lord. The Aurors tire too, they have faced no other opponent who throws stupid-levels of magic around like he can.

5 Aurors becomes 4, becomes 3... He's toying with them now, he's getting /creative/ with his spell-choice - his cruelty is refined, and without equal. The people cleaning up their bodies will known what it means to oppose a Dark Lord.

That is the level at which I think Voldemort operates. Dumbledore is his singular peer. His biggest enemy is himself.
