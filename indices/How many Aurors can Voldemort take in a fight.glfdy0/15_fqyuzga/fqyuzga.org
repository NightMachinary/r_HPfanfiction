Well,1 and 2 is less about the fight and more about losing the secrecy he had.... harder to lurk in the shadows when everyone knows you are lurking.

3,Dawlish,Fudge his lackey and Percy aren't exactly the toughest with a wand..... Kingsley went down willingly for appearances sake.

4,see my response for 3.

5 and 6,Grindlewald may actually be a better wizard than Voldemort...... From what I gather Grindlewald led an open war as opposed to Voldemort who used hit and run tactics and fear to rule the day.
