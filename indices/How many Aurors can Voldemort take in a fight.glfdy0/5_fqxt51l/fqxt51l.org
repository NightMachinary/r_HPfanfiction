  From the fact that he doesn't do so, we can assume that Voldemort is not strong enough to just waltz into the Ministry and take it over by force single handed.

To be fair, I got the impression Voldemort never did that because he'd draw the attention of the International Confederation of Wizards, and then have the whole world against him (instead of just the Order + the Auror Office). Also doing that might force Dumbledore's hand and he would want to avoid a duel with Dumbledore if he's no guaranteed to win. It just means Voldemort is paranoid and wouldn't take unnecessary risks, even if he wouldn't be in any actual danger from the Ministry alone.

  In fanfic, I prefer to make Aurors fewer in number but more powerful - elite dark wizard hunters, as they were originally billed in GoF, rather than general law enforcement personnel as JKR has come to use them as.

Personally, I don't think Rowling downgraded the Aurors to being regular police. Its just that Aurors are put against far stronger opponents.

- Moody vs Crouch Jr + Wormtail --- Moody was retired and outnumbered by two highly talented wizards, taken by surprise, and wasn't as good as in his prime. In DH, Voldemort believed Moody was more skilled than Kingsley.

- Moody vs Dolohov --- Dolohov is one of the most skilled Death Eaters (held his own against Sirius, dueled the Trio almost singlehandedly then later killed Lupin) so its not a bad showing for Moody, who was retired and not as good as his prime.

- Tonks/Kingsley vs Bellatrix --- Bellatrix is either the best or second best of Voldemort's Death Eater (depending on how you rank Snape). Tonks had far less experience, and Bellatrix only needed one direct hit on Kingsley so maybe she was just faster than him.

- Grindelwald in FB1 and FB2 --- Its Grindelwald, so the Aurors getting stomped was the expected outcome. Dumbledore could probably do the same to the Death Eaters.

Kingsley and Moody don't really represent the average Aurors since they would be much more skilled than other Aurors. I'd say Tonks is far more accurate of how skilled most Aurors are, and I'd say any Auror would be able to comfortably beat DH Harry 1v1.

Its interesting that after Voldemort's first downfall, the Ministry was perfectly capable of defeating all of Voldemort's Death Eaters using the combined numbers of Aurors and Hit WIzards Even the top-tiers like Bellatrix and Dolohov who could beat the likes of Kingsley, Tonks, Moody, or Lupin 1v1. So with Voldemort out of the picture, the Aurors is capable of dealing with even the best Death Eaters.
