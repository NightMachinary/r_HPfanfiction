Depends on the aurors. He, and Dumbledore, should be able to take most groupings of aurors. If we include Amelia Bones, who put up a good fight, and Barty Sr as Aurors, they should have a difficult time with those two + Moody, Kingsley, and non-confunded Dawlish.

I think they'd still win, though.

It would probably take every Auror.
