Death Eaters are generally more deadly than Aurors because of their willingness to use Dark Magic, and Dumbledore was able to stomp eleven of them with no effort at all at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Shortly afterward, Dumbledore and Voldemort duel almost to a standstill.

I think Voldemort would have little trouble trouncing the whole Auror department.
