Depends. Does he use fiendfyre? (Why doesn't he just always use fiendfyre?)

The way I've always imagined it is, as a rule of thumb - the average wizard isn't particularly skilled, the Hogwarts Professors tend to be at the top-tier of their respective subjects, the Aurors are highly-trained, but Dumbledore and Voldemort (and Grindelwald as well) are so beyond everyone else they're basically demi-gods. If you were rating the wizarding world 1-00 like in fighting video games, Dumbledore and Voldemort would be mid 90s and then the next best would be mid 80s, but there's probably loads of wizards in that cluster of 'next best', such as McGonagall, Snape, Aurors, Bellatrix, Harry by the time he's Head Auror etc.

I'd gather Voldemort could probably defeat a whole bunch of Aurors on his own, but it'd be a struggle, bothersome and cost a whole lot of time. He doesn't seem like the type to enjoy long or exhausting duels.
