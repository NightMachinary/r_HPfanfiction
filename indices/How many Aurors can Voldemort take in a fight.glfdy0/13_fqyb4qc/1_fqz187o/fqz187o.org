I agree with your number system adding the other 2 HoH to your 80s (high 80s), rest of (long term) professors high 70s and 80s, field experts high70s, field specialists low 70s, average wizards 60s. Poor wizards 30s - 50s, poltergeists and Squibs 10s and 20s (based on Mrs. Fig could at least see the dementors unlike Muggles), Muggles and ghosts 1 - 10, corpses 0.

This is the first time I've ever actually wrote all that out, normally it's just something I keep in mind when writing. I believe power and ability depend heavily on dedication and practise. Like a 13 yr battling how many dementors singlehandedly? I think if Harry applied himself enough he'd make demigod status like the old geezers. I also headcanon all souls have magic but it's blocked.
