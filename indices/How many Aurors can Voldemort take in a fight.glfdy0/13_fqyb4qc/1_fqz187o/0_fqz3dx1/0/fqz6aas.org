Agreed, I see it as potential energy vs. kinetic energy. Everyone has the potential to be level 99 or 100, and for some it's easier to level up. Neville was thought to be a possible squib until he bounced and that's when his internal power surfaced. I feel most of his 'energy' is internal making him great at herbology. I think if he could focus his memory he'd be just as good with arithmancy and other internalized magics. Take Mrs Fig, she communicates with her partial kneazels, but Hermione doesn't because she focuses her magic in other ways. I believe Mrs. Fig's internal magic is blocked from becoming external, but she focuses so much on her kneazels her interval magic manifests into communication giving Mr. Tibbles to literally spy for her. Just think, if Hermione knew that was a possibility she might have worked with Crookshanks and the whole mess with Peter resolved much easier.

Edit: forgot to ask your thoughts.
