I think the number system helps as a general rule of thumb (and makes me crave a Harry Potter fighting/dueling video game) but as you say, it's more about dedication/strength and practice (as well as intelligence etc). Obviously got to be careful not to fall into the trap of assuming that wizards have different inherent 'power levels' or 'magical cores' though.
