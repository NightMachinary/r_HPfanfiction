Voldemort is as strong as needs to be. We go in assuming the end boss is Voldemort, unless stated otherwise, so that many Aurors.

Voldemort's operation is based on the Terrors so he's at his best doing hit and run diversion tactics. Actually pinning him down and dueling him would probably show he's kind of a one trick pony.

A trained Auror, that I would write, on an even field should last a while, 10 would definitely bog him down and I agree 15 would ice him. However Voldemort, to me, wouldn't do that.

He'd surprise them along with scaring the hell out of them from all the stories they heard and would dip after he AK'd 30 cackling madly after.
