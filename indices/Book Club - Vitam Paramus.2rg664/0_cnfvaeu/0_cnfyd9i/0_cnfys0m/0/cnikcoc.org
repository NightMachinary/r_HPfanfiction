Well I'll certainly never claim to be Hemingway. But it does amuse me that your critique for VP is almost identical to the first critiques for the referenced novel. At least I left out the homophobia and anti-semetism, right?

I don't know if it's really fair, for lack of a better term, to think of VP as a story. I didn't really write it as one. It's my least planned fic and looking back on it it should have been much, much shorter (not unlike aSAR)

But at the same time, I understand there isn't really any other way to view it. I tried something rather out of my comfort zone and while I'm happyish with the final results. I'm going to make a long-winded post about my views on VP shortly. Although I'm not sure if the author is really supposed to interject his opinion in the discussion, but well, why not?
