I don't really know, which is half of the problem. I mean, as a whole, it can't /not/ be a story. Because it is. But I wrote it without planning a standardized plot. I wanted it to just be three months of the minutia of life, knowing full well that wouldn't entertain many people outside of myself.

It's why I can't really argue with people who say 'it doesn't really have a plot'. As a whole it doesn't. It's just sort of writing about life of people for a set amount of time. It would have probably been a better story if that set amount of time was like a week that focused a bit more on Harry before the accident, had the accident, and ended a few days after. But I got stubborn about the 'summer' concept and went from there.
