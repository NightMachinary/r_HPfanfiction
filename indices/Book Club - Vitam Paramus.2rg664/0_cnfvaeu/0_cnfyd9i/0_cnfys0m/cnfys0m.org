I actually liked the more adult, grown-up Harry. It was a nice change of pace from the usual fanfic (although not something I'd want to read a bunch of). And I'm fine with depths only being hinted at. I even agree with you that, from a realism standpoint, it makes sense that Harry didn't really develop, change, open up, whatever.

My point is that it's a story, and traditionally stories have things like conflict and development of themes. Stories traditionally have structures that center around rising action and some kind of climax. The fact that I didn't realize the fic was over until the author slapped a "complete" label on it means it failed - for me - to resolve itself in a satisfying way.

I'm not trying to trash this - it's pretty well-written, and like I said, I did enjoy the change of pace. In the hands of a once-in-a-generation writer, it could have been a phenomenally understated meditation on loss and ennui in the same vein as /The Sun Also Rises/. As it stands, it's more of a curiosity - a piece with some interesting pieces, some tantalizing hints at depth that are never realized.
