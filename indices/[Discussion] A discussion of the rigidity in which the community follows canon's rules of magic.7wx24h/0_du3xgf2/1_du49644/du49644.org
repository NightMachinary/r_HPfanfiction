I think the trace works in two parts part one is area specific and is applied to the residence of every underage student living in the muggle world. This why Harry gets in trouble for Dobby's magic magic happened at Harry's address he is at fault case closed. The second part is based on wands and applied by Olivander (and other wand makers) when underage wizards buy them. However, there is a loophole with the second part the magical protections most Wizarding homes have block this trace. This is how Tom Riddle is able to take his uncle's wand and kill his muggle relatives. It also adds a nice bit of antimuggle born discrimination which fits in with the setting.
