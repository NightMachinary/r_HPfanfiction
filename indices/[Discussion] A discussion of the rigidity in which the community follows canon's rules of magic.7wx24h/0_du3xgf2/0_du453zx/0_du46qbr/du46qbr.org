  I believe this was the way how Harry was caught in OOTP. However, when he wandlessly cast the Lumos a moments before, no alert was triggered.

Maybe it triggers on magic that originates within a certain radius of the underage wizard? Harry was probably trying to restrain Dobby when he did the Hover Charm, whereas Tonks might have been a few metres away when she packed his bag.

EDIT: Also, Harry was in the vicinity of Privet Drive whenever he was caught. Riddle's address was in London at the time, and he didn't commit the murders there. The muggles were dead, and Morfin had no recollection of his nephew, so they had no evidence that Tom Riddle was the one whose Trace was triggered. (Tom Marvolo Riddle would probably have been suspected [underage wizard with the same name as one of the victims] if his uncle didn't confess and possess the 'smoking gun' in question.)
