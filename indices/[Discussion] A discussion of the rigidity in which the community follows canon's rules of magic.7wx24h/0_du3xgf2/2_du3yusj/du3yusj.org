Aye a good example, but can you see how you've explained every loophole and everything that isn't right with the trace as per what's strictly written in canon? Writing about an exemption in the canon description of the Trace that allows the main character to beat it is a very typical example of the problem I'm trying to bring up and discuss.

Why can we not look past what is explicitly stated and go forward with what it's trying to be. Forget that there are contradictory bits of evidence, or things that don't add up, and go forward with the idea that kids can't /legally/ do magic outside Hogwarts? The execution of that presumption can be made to best fit the story, rather than trying to find ways to "beat" how canon did it.
