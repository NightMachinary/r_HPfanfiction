I agree. A prime example of Rowling not fully explaining an aspect of magic is The Trace.

Most fics relate The Trace being sourced from a wizard's wand. But then, how does Dobby alert the Ministry with his use of magic? Also, wouldn't Harry have gotten a letter about underage magic earlier from Dobby Apparating to his house?

How the fudge does the Ministry get The Trace activated onto children?

More importantly, contary to what some fics may say, Hermione never got a letter for underage magic before she boarded Hogwarts Express when she practiced a few spells.

Canon is murky when it comes to The Trace.
