The ministry was alerted when Harry blew up his aunt, and that was when his wand was stowed away in his trunk.

Also, it might have been something in the unforgiveables that interferes with the Trace, or Riddle could have found a way to disable the Trace (the bloke was a genious after all). In addition, Riddle used underage magic in Little Hangleton, and not in Wool's Orphanage, so they couldn't automatically pin it on him. There might also have been differences in how the Trace worked in 1943 vs 1992.

(If the DMLE hadn't gotten a confession from Morfin, as well as the Priori Incantado evidence, Tom Riddle Jr would probably be their next suspect.)
