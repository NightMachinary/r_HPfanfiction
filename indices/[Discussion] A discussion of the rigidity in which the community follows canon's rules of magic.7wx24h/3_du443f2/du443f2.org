I follow and keep canon things when there's no need not to, but if I come up with some new character, or place, or aspect of magic, or a species or a culture that I want to use in my story then I'm going to use it exactly how it is in my head, and I'm not going to try too hard to MAKE IT FIT into canon. It wouldn't be a fanfiction if it did, anyway. I could write giant flying purple monsters from another dimension or something, in an alternate world where Nazis won world war 2 and then discovered a way to create magical supersoldiers! Just, you know, if I really wanted to! :) And I wouldn't care what anyone else thought or had to say about it, cause fanfiction itself literally has the definition in a dictionary as being "Not canon!" :) That, and that I write my stories for myself and my own entertainment, so no one and nothing else matters ANYWAY.
