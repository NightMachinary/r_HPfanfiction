It's interesting that you use myself and [[/u/Newcomb][u/Newcomb]] as examples of willingness to depart from the canonical magical system, as (having spoken with him extensively about this) I believe we consider ourselves as operating largely within it. We expand upon it, make many things explicit which were merely implicit in the books, but ultimately our aim is to produce magic which feels like it would belong in the canonical world.

I suppose the distinction which may create the impression that we depart from canon is that we place thematic and tonal consistency with canon over factual consistency. Specific items of magic can be changed, or expanded upon, so long as the whole remains canonical in feel.
