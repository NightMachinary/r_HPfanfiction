Let me just say that this was always what I took from your writing, if you disagree then I apologize for making the assumption!

I feel however we are in agreement on this, though feel to debate me on it. My thoughts aren't about departing from canon, but rather letting yourself build on it and staying true to the tone and ideals, without limiting yourself to the specifics of how canon explains things. I feel both you and Newcomb are perfect examples of that, as is the movie clip (I really love that clip).

Some authors will just take canon as rote, only going by what is explicitly mentioned because if they break away from that then it would be going "against" what canon has defined. They're happy to create something new, but won't go against what's been previously stated in canon.

Others like yourself take the ideas canon presents and build on them, even if it may go against random tid bits from the books, because it fits your story better. To take an example from Victoria Potter, in the latest chapter you talked about the restricted section. In canon, the idea is about an area of the library students can't access, yet we're never told about other areas of the library, or if there are multiple levels of access.

You took the idea that canon was portraying and built on it without worrying that you were changing a canon element in execution (but not in theme), and it's something I wish more people were willing to do.

Does that help explain my thoughts?
