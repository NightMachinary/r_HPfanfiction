Only eight chapters in and starts pretty compliant to cannon, though it will divulge more and more as the story progresses and I already have the entire first year written, just not posted. Harry is quite intelligent, but he does bust his ass for the skill he will gain, and he is going to reach very prodigious levels, but not be god like (meaning he will not be unchallenged) I am actually quite excited for the story to play out, though it does start a bit slow.
