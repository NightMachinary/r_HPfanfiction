Wow did you low ball Snape here. I despise him as much as the next person, but /he/ is a generalist and probably the 3rd best wandholder in the series. Snape at 16/17 outpaced Hermione by a lot.

Just because you specialize in a branch doesn't mean you can't be really good at other branches. Harry and Snape were really good at curses, Lily was good at potions, Slughorn seemed to be good at transfiguration.

And while Harry is no prodigy, the second half of DH is him grasping magic in ways Voldemort couldn't.
