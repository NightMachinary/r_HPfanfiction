Hmm, I think you may be looking at Harry through rose-tinted glasses. In canon, Harry is talented, undeniably. He has potential and if he were more studious he could have been somewhat better. But what Harry is "specialized." Most wizards/witches appear to have innate leanings towards specific magics - Harry with Protection/Defense, Voldemort with Dark Magic, Snape with Potions, James and Lily with Transfiguration and Charms. The truly exceptional wizards/witches are those who despite their leanings are prodigious in all branches of magic, something akin to "generalists" as it were (there is a decent explanation of this idea in Ch. 4 of What You Leave Behind).

The thing is Tom Riddle (and Albus Dumbledore) was a once in a lifetime prodigy and likely close to what we would call a genius. They had a spark for creativity, instinctive understanding of magic, and intellect that only happened once in a lifetime (at least in Britain from what we see). For context, I see Hermione as more akin to Snape in canon (obviously not in behavior or beliefs). Both are fairly academic, have a drive to learn and improve, but they lack the sort of innate grasp of magic people like TR and AD have. Harry perhaps has such a capability (maybe), but I admit I am skeptical.

Now, I can supply you with fics that show Harry as "working for it," though its down to you whether you think its sufficient:

- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): canon Harry in Slytherin, without the more warm and supporting environment he received as a Gryffindor, Harry is forced to be more proactive, even straying into darker territory (at one point a Death Eater notes "you fight like us").
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): probably read this, but this is a fic where a more academic Harry had that "spark" I mentioned but wants to get out of his brothers shadow.
- linkffn(What You Leave Behind): Harry is much more interested in magic and learning than he is in canon, though still retains certain vestiges of his canon personality.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): this one starts a bit rocky, but changes to 4th year make Harry eager to increase his knowledge and skill base (throughout the fic too), and Dumbledore certainly obliges him.
- linkffn(Forging the Sword): long story short, a change in CoS makes Harry realize he needs to be better if he wants to prevent anymore tragedies. Slow but great worldbuilding and magical exploration.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light): has Harry who really works to be as skilled as he is (he even points this out to Ron in the sequel that he got so good at magic because he put in the time and effort).
