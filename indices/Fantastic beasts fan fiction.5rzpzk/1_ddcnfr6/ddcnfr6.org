You need more creative spelling--since the narrator appears to be speaking to the reader in a conversational tone, rigidly adhering to the tyranny of formal English spelling lends your writing an uncomfortable dissonance between the flow of consciousness of the narrator, and the rigid structure imposed by English when it comes to the written word.

I notice you've already taken some action there--the use of Hogwartz instad of Hogwarts, and the multitude of spellings you use in place of Dumbledore clearly indicate you understand how badly consistent good spelling can ruin a piece, but I think you should go bolder: use chatpeak whenever possible, maybe switch between "was", "waz", and "wuz" in place of "was" alone. Perhaps, you might even want to explore alternate spellings with "fantastic."
