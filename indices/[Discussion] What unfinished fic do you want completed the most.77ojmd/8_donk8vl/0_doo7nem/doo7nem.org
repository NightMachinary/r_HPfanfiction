Another vote for Para Bellum. It's freaking hilarious and I wish there was more. Delende Est, Linkffn(5511855) is pretty well known and great fun (at least before the time skip), but this sequel is awesome comedy that borders on crack. There's a pretty interesting plotline to boot and seeing canon HP characters trying to deal with the crazy that is Delende Est characters is truly a gem.
