I am with you on "Nightmare of Future's past" . When I started reading English Harry Potter fan fics there were two stories that really pulled me in. "Living with Danger" , and then,about a year later, "Nightmares of Future Past" . I followed the Dangerverse to the end, even if it sometimes was /weird/ , but NoFP just started having its updates longer and longer apart and now the last ones were in 2015.
