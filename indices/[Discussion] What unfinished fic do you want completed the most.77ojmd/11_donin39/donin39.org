I have my fics stored into groups and my WIP, Hiatus, and Abandoned categories are all well stocked.

WIP wise I want to see the Prince of Slytherin finished the most. I am not usually a fan of wrong boy-who-lived stories but I absolutely love what The Sinister Man has built and added to the world of Harry Potter. He's still updating so it's just an impatience issue right now.

On Hiatus I would have to go with Nightmares of Future Past. It was one of the first fan fictions I read and it really pulled me into the community. I know it has its share of detractors but I love the story and really hope S'TarKan continues with his recovery.

When it comes to Abandoned fics I'd actually say Mysterious Thing, Time by Blueowl. It was a collab and Blueowl and his writing partner were having troubles collaborating. It hasn't been updated since 2012 so I'm not holding out for a conclusion., but then again the last chapter came out a year and a half before the second to last, five years is not that much more right? It has a very strange premise with Dumbledore and Harry traveling back in time to their bodies the night Voldemort attacked the Potters and had Dumbledore raise Harry, whose mind is a mix between the adult he was and the child he is. The thing I loved most about the story was the OC Unspeakables. They are my favorite original characters in fan fiction and I would love to know more about their stories. It does end on a cliff hanger.
