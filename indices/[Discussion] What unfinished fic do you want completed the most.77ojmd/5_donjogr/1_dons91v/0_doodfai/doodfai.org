I check Inverarity's blog once in a while. He has good reviews of books and he does write updates about AQ there..

But AQ is supposed to be a long series (7 books I think). Inverarity doesn't do things half-ways; it seems to me he has the series very well planned out and I don't thing he would published work he is not satisfied with.

Many people have difficulties with finishing such long series. In my opinion there are two main problems -

1. As a story progresses, there are more and more storylines/characters/subplots and books are getting longer and longer.
2. RL - it takes years to write a series. Fanfic authors have nothing for writing. You may start when you have a free time, no worries, writing is fun for you.. But what happens after lets say five years? You may travel, you may get married, have kids, time consuming job and one million other things. You may want to finish what you started but even if you try, it is not possible anymore.. IMO longer the author is writing a fic, the less likely is it will be finished.

I don't think I'm pessimist, but if I would have to make a prediction, no fics mentioned by me will get ever finished. I think we can get AQ5, but I don't believe we will see ever AQ7. But I would love to be wrong :)
