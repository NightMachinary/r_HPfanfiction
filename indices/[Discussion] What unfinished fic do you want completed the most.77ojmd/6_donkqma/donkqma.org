The obvious answers are for me, The Santi's Boy who lived and the Fettuncini's Knowledge is power. While they both have tropey and questionable parts I love how different they are, how ambitious they are. These fics hold so much potential and in a way perhaps its better they remain unfinished so the author wouldn't have a chance to spoil it but still.

0800-Rent a hero is a fic I wouldn't mind seeing finished. The author might be an arse of the highest order and the story was for sure flawed but it was fun. A lot of great fics lack the fun element, this isn't an enlightening fic, its not one that gets you thinking but its quite good for being mildly amusing so long as you don't take it seriously.

The song of trees is an honourable mention for me. One of my favourites but I get the sense its close enough to being finished that I can piece together the end unlike the two others I'd mentioned which could go in many different ways.
