So many but most of all, Linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19). Watching the relationship between Harry and Abby develop has been such a pleasant read but also very much a slow-burn. It is kind of painful that the story is incomplete right as things start to get romantic between the two of them. Not to mention, there are few great romance fics with OCs and in my opinion, this is in the top 5 of the genre. Hope they update but it's been almost a year so it might be abandoned at this point. I never know when to consider fics abandoned since some writers reappear after 1-2 years.
