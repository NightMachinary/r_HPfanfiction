linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stones) is on top of the list, definitely. linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild) and linkffn(One World) would be nice too. I'd also say linkffn(The Handbook of Elf Psychology), but the author says they /might/ get back to it eventually and they /have/ been known to resurface after over a year, so I'm staying optimistic on this one.
