Since it's super fresh on my mind, Knowledge is Power by Fettucini. Just got around to reading this the other night and it was shockingly good. I love the fic and would do anything for it to be finished out.

Also Deprived and Thief of Hogwarts. Just please. I'll sit through a thousand other ghastly awful Harry/Fleur stories just to see those finished.
