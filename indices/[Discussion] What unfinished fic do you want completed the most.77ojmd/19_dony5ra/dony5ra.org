[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5200789][The Life and Times]] by Jewel5. 600,000+ words, and then it just stops so abruptly with SO MANY plot lines left to resolve. Basically a quintessential Jily fic that was well written and developed. It didn't seem contrived at all felt realistic.

I mean, it's not like we don't all know how it ends. It sticks to canon pretty well considering it was first published in 2009 before we got Pottermore. Yes. James and Lily get together and have Harry and die in â€˜81. But it 600,000 words to get where they are kinda together and I need to see what happens to Remus and Sirius and all the OCs.

It's the curse of reading a long fic- you get attached. And when updates stop randomly, you never know if the author just stopped updating, or died. Not bitter at all.
