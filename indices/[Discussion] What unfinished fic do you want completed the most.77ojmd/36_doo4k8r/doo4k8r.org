I can't believe nobody's mentioned this one yet, but for abandoned fics, Wit of the Raven. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) I like reading about magic, and AU magic is a lot of fun, and AU Hogwarts with AU magic is even more fun. I'm not sure it's the one I /most/ want finished, but it is one that I want finished and that hasn't been mentioned already.
