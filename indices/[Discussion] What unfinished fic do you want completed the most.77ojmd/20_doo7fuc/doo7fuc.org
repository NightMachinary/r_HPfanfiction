I'd be ecstatic if linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) updated anytime soon. I love everything about it and really hope it's not abandoned.

And linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) is probably dead but it's the best Snape re-do/time-travel I've read and I have an ember of hope that the author might come back to it.

It updates fairly regularly but I also eagerly await any new chapters for Laventadorn's No Journey's End.
