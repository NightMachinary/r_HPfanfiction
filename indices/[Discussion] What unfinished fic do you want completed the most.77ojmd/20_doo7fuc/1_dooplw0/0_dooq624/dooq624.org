Yes, it is! I think it's the best Slytherin Harry fic in the fandom. Even though Harry is in Slytherin, he doesn't immediately become a political-savvy, scheming 11 year old. He's quite recognizable as Harry, if more cynical, snarky and willing to use amoral methods. This fic has my favourite characterization of him. Some things don't change, like he's still enemies with Draco Malfoy. Side characters like Blaise Zabini and Millicent Bulstrode get the spotlight and they work well as his friends. It might seem a bit slow in the beginning but it picks up the pace in 2nd year and moves fairly quickly from then. I highly recommend it.
