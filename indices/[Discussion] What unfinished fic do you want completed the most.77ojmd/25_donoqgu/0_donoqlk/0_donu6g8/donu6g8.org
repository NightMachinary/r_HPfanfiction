Definitely upvoted for Reverse. That story is riveting as hell. I've read and reread it (even though it's unfinished) several times and I always find it to be amazingly well-written and wonderfully thought-out. The world Lady Moonglow paints is horrifying but fascinating, and definitely not for the light-hearted. I so badly want her to come back and finish it!!
