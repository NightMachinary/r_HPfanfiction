That is updating, not regularly but somewhat. And honestly, that fic doesn't have an ending, much like life. So once it resolves this current plotline I'm fine if just stops updating, as good as it is.

Speaking of little0bird, the story she really needs to finish is More than Words. It was a great insight into Ginny's struggle being in a real relationship with Harry since he wanted commitment for obvious reasons and she was desperate for her independence. Little0bird latched onto Ginny's desire for independence and "doing it herself" as a bit of a character flaw, which the books had shown to somewhat be the case. Moving in with Harry so soon after Hogwarts would be something her natural self would fight against but actually could be a good thing for her. It's a shame she stopped the story right as Ginny was coming to that realization. Very few, almost no other writers have tackled that storyline.
