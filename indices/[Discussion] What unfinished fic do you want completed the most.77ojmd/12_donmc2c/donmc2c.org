Definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5318075/1/A-Magical-World]]

It's part 3 of Miranda Flairgold's AU. It's one of the best AUs of the early fics. I'd like nothing more than to get closure on it, but it's not going to ever happen. The running theory is that Miranda has passed away. I've read a lot of incomplete fics, but this is the trilogy I keep going back to and re-reading without looking, just hoping that if I keep doing that it will update magically while I'm reading it.
