I really would like to see linkffn(The Thief of Hogwarts by bluminous8), its mostly silly but it is a good fun read, an unfortunately the author seems to be long from fanfiction. linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) is another, the author is apparently super busy but I really love what little there is of it. One that I do miss is linkffn(Retsu's Folly), it is the only good Bleach crossover I have ever read, and though the author is still rarely updating other fics, nearly 3 years since an update makes me doubt there will be any more.
