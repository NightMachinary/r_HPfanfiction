It's probably too ambitious to ever be finished (satisfactorily).

More of an honorable mention, since I'm not even sure where that story would go and it's more exciting for me because of its world-building than for its plot. So.. it's kinda okay for it to be abandoned.

An old fav from portkey, certainly abandoned.
