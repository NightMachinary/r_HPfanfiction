I really wanted to like that one, but it's very much of a Mary Sue fic and a very blunt canon rehash. It has this characteristic tendency of having people---hardened, selfish, suspicious, "Slytherin" people---just out and out give her things and trust her, without any reason to do so or asking for anything in return. It's also takes place in one of those bizzaro AUs in which Slytherins are nice and welcoming to an outspoken Muggleborn, while Gryffindors are the ones throwing the M-word around.
