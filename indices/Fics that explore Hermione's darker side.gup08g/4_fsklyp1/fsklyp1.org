I can't remember the 'ships for many of these, so apologies if one of the ones on the blacklist shows up:

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU in which Hogwarts is a school for superspies; everybody is pretty ruthless, though.
- /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus takes place a decade or so after canon and has Hermione leading a terrorist organisation against a backsliding Ministry. It went down with the original Granger Enchanted site, but there are copies of it floating around.
- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels have Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang (It's a long story.) with many of the attendant consequences.
- linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai) does have a 'ship with Harry, but it's not a big part of the story and only shows up at the very end.
- linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99) have Harry and Hermione working together, but I don't think they're 'shipped.
- linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) has Hermione leading a paramilitary group.

There is a number of Slytherin!Hermione fics that are decent and don't go too far off the deep end:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still the best one, IMO.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) takes a bit too much fanon onboard, and I feel that prophecies about Hermione undermine her ethos, but it's still worth reading.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady): a fun read.

Two more fics that are up and coming, but I am reserving judgement, given the disaster that /Mudsnake/ turned out to be:

- linkffn(Purple Like Violets by Flye Autumne)
- linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne)

That's what I have off the top of my head and from a cursory search of my library. I'll add more if I remember others.

*Edit:* Typo in a fic author name caused a mislink. *Edit 2:* One of the links should have been to AO3.
