Are you sure it was a dif dimension? I remember a fic where he was a bad guy in his home planet so he was drawn into a trap by Hermione and then a team of ward crafters and rune masters locked him in a crystal coffin and shot him into space. However there was an error with the runes to sapp his magic and he slowly regained consciousness when he was picked up by a science ship and they tried to scan the crystal which he sensed and then broke out of after pirates boarded the science ship and he killed like basically everyone.
