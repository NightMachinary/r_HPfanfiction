Oh, well, that's sad. I've run out of nice and romantic stories to read, considering I do have a limited filter. I just can't read H/Hr or slash fics, so my fic pool is quite limited.

Been looking for those fics that I had previously thought to be either bad or not appealing to me, and Jade was one of those that poped up.
