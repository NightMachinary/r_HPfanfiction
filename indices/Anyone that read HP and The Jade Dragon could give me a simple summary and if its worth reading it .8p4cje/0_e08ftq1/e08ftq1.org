Not a lot of actual Harry/Daphne present, save for some scenes and a single chapter. As for the story, Harry and Hermione basically go to "magical college", if you consider Hogwarts highschool.

So all the content is original a long with a washlist of OC's. There's a lot of fluff, the writing is in my opinion a bit uninspired.

As for relationships, it's basically some sort of upcoming harem, with Hermione taking the center stage with possible up to like 5-6 girls on the side.

I found the story interesting at first, but these days, I only skim through new chapters in a minute or so.
