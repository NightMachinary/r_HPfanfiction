I don't remember the name of the fic, but there was one I read where Grindelwald broke out while Harry was little to raise and train him. When Harry finally goes to Hogwarts, he ends up in a relationship with a Slytherin Ginny Weasley. Later, she gets thrown in Azkaban (because the Ministry has turned against Harry) and only barely escapes getting r*ped by an Auror. When Harry rescues her, he confronts the now captured Amelia Bones about it and she responds along the lines of "She was going to be Kissed today anyway, so what do I care what happens to her beforehand as long as it makes one of my Aurors happier?"

It did not end well for Madam Bones.
