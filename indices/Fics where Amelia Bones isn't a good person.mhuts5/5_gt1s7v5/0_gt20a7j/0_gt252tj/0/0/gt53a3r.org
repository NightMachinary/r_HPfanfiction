Tbh, I was fine with the attempt to turn serious. It was the way she tried to straddle the fence that worked so poorly in my opinion, along with certain weird elements like Godric's Hollow and Aquila Industries that just got bizarre. And don't get me /started/ on the kids at Hogwarts. If it'd either stayed crack or become entirely serious, it had a lot of potential. Trying to do both at once was where it went wrong, imo.
