The author kind of lost the plot and just digressed from the most amusing and worthwhile concepts that made the fic great. Mainly Carrow and his view of the Wizarding World. She went from crack into more serious topics and it basically killed the series. Even she stopped writing it, since she probably realised it sucked at that point.

But the first two in the series are pure gold. Carrow is a force of nature, since he's so stupidly overpowered that there literally are no obstacles. It was fun watching him interact with the normal people, which was the whole premise of the fic. Later, it became either repetitive or convoluted.

Also, the author seemed to abandon the insanity of the 40k universe for the in-fic world, which, again, killed all the humour and wonder.

It was a greatly written crack fic and should have stayed that. Trying to make it serious in any way was the way to failure.
