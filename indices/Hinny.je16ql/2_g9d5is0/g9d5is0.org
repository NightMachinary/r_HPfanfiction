I'm not the biggest Hinny fan so these stories are really good since I put aside my dislike and fell in love with it ♥️ no voyage aheartcalledhome Summary: The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he /had/ expected to be okay. Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.
