There's a prequel fanfic that's a crossover between /Harry Potter/ and /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, the only two BtVS characters that show up, as I recall, are Rupert Giles and Ethan Rayne, and the story takes place long before either series. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1375393/1/The-End-of-the-Beginning][/The End of the Beginning/]], and despite being a crossover, it fits in well enough with HP canon.
