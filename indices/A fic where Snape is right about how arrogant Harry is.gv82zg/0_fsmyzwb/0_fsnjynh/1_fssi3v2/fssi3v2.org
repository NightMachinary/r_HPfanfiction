I thought I had never seen a fic like that, or maybe the ones I saw were ones where Harry only brought it up when it mattered(like in the Wizengamot where Dumbledore was trying to patronize him or make people overlook his post).

Then I read one where everytime someone said Potter, he returner "Potter-Black" and it really grated me.

Honestly people, if he was adopted, just change it to Black, or let people just call him Potter, not even Royalty demands their full names to be used.
