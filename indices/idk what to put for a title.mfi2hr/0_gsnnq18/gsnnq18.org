If this was an actual fic search ("What's that fic?" is for when you are looking for a specific story), a hint about what you're looking for would make a great title... so people who, for example, don't read that pairing wouldn't have to click your post to see what it was about.

If you're looking for fics similar to this, the correct flare is "Request". An appropriate title would be "LF fics like Suspicions by XxXxDarkVampirexXxX, and then in the body you tell us what you liked about that fic (as you did) so we can better help you.
