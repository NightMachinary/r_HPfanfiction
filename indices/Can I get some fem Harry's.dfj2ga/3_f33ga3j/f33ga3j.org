1. Becoming Harriet, linkffn(11578510) --- Harry gets yet another birthday present for his seventeenth birthday (a gender-switch story) ... I like the story, but it is one of those where too much smut actually hurts the continuity of the story (I skipped a lot). Supportive of BSDM, but not in the disgusting amount. Detailed (but completely in-story, not superfluous) description of rape.
2. The Videus Charm, linkffn(13197260) --- this is Harry (err, Harriet) Potter born as such from the Triwizard Tournament onwards, T-rated, pretty nice.
3. A Fair Life, linkffn(13285012) ­--- another attempt to live through as Harry Potter (returned by the Death), this time as a girl. femSlash (Harry/Hermione), WIP, so far not much smut.
4. Snape's Daughter, linkffn(7618752) --- another “Harry turns into a girl”, not bad, but it seems to run straight towards Severitus mixed with Drarry (which made me to stop reading). Not too much smutty, so far.
5. The odds were never in my favour, linkffn(11517506) --- interesting setup. James Potter is suspected to be a Death Eater and he is now in Azkaban. Neville is viewed as the Boy-Who-Lived, and Alexandra Potter (i.e., the fem!Harry) is despised because of her father (Lily is dead). A bit of Gryffindor-bashing and Dumbledore-bashing, but interesting. Very well written. Unfortunatey, WIP and it tends to slide towards super!Harry and super!enemy (even worse than Voldermort).
