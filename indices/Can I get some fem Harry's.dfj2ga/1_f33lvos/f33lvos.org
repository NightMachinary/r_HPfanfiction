linkffn(9911469) is interesting, though neither finished, nor for everything, it has death!harry(called Lily here), and it is more of a philosophical one, really it is...strange, and the main character does not have the greatest morals ever.

linkffn(12793151) is from the same author as above but the main character has morals in it(it is also a time travel fic), and she is more...well, human.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/chapters/36865599][The fire that swallowed the world]] is about a fem!harry whose soul left them when they got hit by the killing curse, and who is now inhabited by a living flame.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930][Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis]] is an avengers crossover about a fem!harry who starts off as a cleaning lady for the avengers(she wanted a muggle life, apparently)

​

linkffn(9937462) is another one, though */WARNING:/* The main character is not a good character, and it has disturbing themes in it, you have been warned.

​

Those are the fem!harry fanfics I remember and/or I could find quickly in my favorites and follows, I am guessing most of them were not what you were looking for but hey, it is what it is.
