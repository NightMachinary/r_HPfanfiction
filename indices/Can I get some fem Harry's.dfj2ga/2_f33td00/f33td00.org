Fem!Harry isn't something I read very often, 'cause I find that too often it's just an excuse for writing lgbt pairings as straight couples. That said, I do have one but *it's rated E* so do NOT read it if you're underage.

The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419]]) is a Harry/Voldemort fic, which is usually not my thing, but it explores some interesting areas of magic, esp. horcruxes and ancient runes. As for the E rating, the author puts CWs in every end note so you know if anything graphic (thus far, just violence) is going to happen.

Other than that, I do have suggestions for trans!Harry. I'm a bit nervous sharing them, since I know slash tends to be down voted a lot here but there are some really good ones I want to share. And it /is/ female Harry, so...

The Girl Who Lived (Again) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]]) is one of my favorite fanfictions ever. It's Harry/Ginny.

Lastly, Magical Metamorphosis linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298]]) is cute. It has no pairings.
