I disagree with the other commenter. These names do sound like textbook names, but I don't think they're whimsical enough for the magical world.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Shopping_List][Here]] is the best list I can find for canon textbooks. Most of them have either an alliterative or otherwise whimsical name (/Spellman's Syllabary/, /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/, /Unfogging the Future/, all of Lockhart's books, etc), an author whose name is a pun or otherwise relates to the subject (Newt Scamander, Emeric Switch, Phyllida Spore, etc), or something whimsical about the books themselves (/The Monster Book of Monsters/, /The Invisible Book of Invisibility/). There are a few books that don't fall into any of those categories, so it's fine to have some like that, but I feel like all of your books are lacking in whimsy.

I suppose you could intentionally use the lack of whimsy to show that Harry is 100% serious business, but it still doesn't really fit the setting.

Also, do you really intend to list out every one of these books in the story? I can understand a few of them coming up occasionally, but if you're planning to list them all out at some point, that seems like entirely unnecessary detail. But if you're just using this as a reference material in case you need Harry to mention a specific book at some point, that's fine.
