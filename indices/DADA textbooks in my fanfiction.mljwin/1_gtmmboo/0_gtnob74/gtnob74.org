The main point of those textbooks, as you already said, is a reference to what will Harry be teaching in different years (like the basic outline). I only decided to write ones for every year if I ever had a chapter with that particular year.

Originally, I needed only fourth and fifth year at the time but then I realized that if a similar problem comes up with a different Harry's class then I will need to come up with something again. So I just wrote it all down together. When I was creating the names I mainly stuck up with DADA books which already exist (completely ignoring the ones from Lockhart). Apart from the Confronting the Faceless they all sound pretty much similar to my ones (at least for me they sound similar). But yeah, I will keep your advise in mind - like making an author's name the pun, I like that idea.
