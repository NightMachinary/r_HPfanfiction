I will definitely swap Morigalt's to Scamander's in the first year, thx. Honestly, I forgot about that book or assumed it was published later and didn't bother to check at all xD

I looked into Miranda after you mentioned her but I don't think it really fits into my time period. She was born in 1921 (according to fandom, but who cares). And if she graduated from Hogwarts somewhere around 1939 then I don't think the book would be published almost immediately after that. Yeah, it could, but the chances are quite low.
