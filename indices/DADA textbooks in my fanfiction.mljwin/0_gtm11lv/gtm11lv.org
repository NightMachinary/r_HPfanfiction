The names seem sound, whimsy and wizardry, so that's good. But I see you wrote down Juliana Morigalt's book for both 1st and 3rd years. Also, in the books, Harry is required to buy /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ by Newton Scamander in first year most likely for his DADA class (I checked and Newt was commissioned for the book in 1918, so it fits). Harry could either use this book instead of Morigalt's or he could use Scamander's book for first-years (since it would be more about identifying and advice on how to avoid and not anger creatures) while he uses Morigalt's book for third-years (which I assume would have more of a defensive aspect to it).

Another thing, /The Standard Book of Spells/ by Miranda Goshawk would be, in my opinion, a more appropriate repertoire of spells for first and second-years since they wouldn't have much experience with magic (basing myself on the books, which, admittedly, we don't see much about what they learn). The way I see it, first-year DADA would be learning a few spells and learn how to defend yourself with them (and some others they would have learnt in Charms) but the central objective for the first-years would be more fleeing and quick incapacity (say of a Muggle or mundane animal) so as to flee and then the curriculum for the later years adds on that and expends on other areas (such as creatures or curses and dark spells).

Sorry for the long rant, especially if this is unwanted advice. Still, I hope this helps.
