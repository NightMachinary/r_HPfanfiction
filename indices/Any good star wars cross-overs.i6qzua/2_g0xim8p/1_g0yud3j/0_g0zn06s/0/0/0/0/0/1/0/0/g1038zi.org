It was on this subreddit, and no variation would work. Tried the title, title with author, fic I'd, fic url, it's never shown up. Will try again here.

Edit: huh. Wtf. Well I guess I can go link this for the other person then now

2nd Edit: up on further attempts, i believe the problem came from trying to link something via editing a post. Instead of posting a new post.
