linkffn(8501689) An OP MOD Harry dropped just at the start of the Phantom Menace where he really lives in the universe and immediately derail completely from the plot of the movies. It's quite good but hasn't been updated in a year.

linkffn(8594589) The companion fic to the one above. Either events of the main fic seen from the point of view of secondary characters or completely new stuff happening by the ripples of Harry's presence.

linkffn(13569941) Complete crack fic. Harry follow right after Sirius by jumping in the veil. He is sent thousands of years in the past in the star wars galaxy and arrives at the begining of Phantom Menace, killing Jar Jar in the proccess. From then, cracky stuff and humour as the plot entirely derail and usual stuff from this author happen.

linkffn(10912355) An MOD unaging Harry survived the destruction of Earth by the Empire around ANH. He is taken as a slave and will stop at nothing to take his revenge against the Empire. He's far from the OPness of the fics above but still very powerful. I didn't read until the end because the middle aged Harry / young adult Leia creeped me out but if it doesn't bother you, the fic is more than decent.
