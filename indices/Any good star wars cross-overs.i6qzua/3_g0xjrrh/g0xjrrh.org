linkffn(In All Things Balance) features Harry learning from Darth Nox, eventually expanding into the greater galaxy. Currently 2 out of 4 works completed.

linkffn(Magic of the Force) it's a Vimesenthuaiast story, so your mileage may vary. Expect long chapters, with lots of plot lines.

linkffn(The Boy Who Fell) Darth Marss story, taking place in an alternate universe where Harry died during childhood. Ben Skywalker (From SW Legends) ends up on Earth. Ben/Luna.

linkffn(The Katarn Side) Harry is trained by Kyle Katarn.

linkffn(Last Second Savior by Plums) likely dead, 130K words, OP!Harry, harem story. YMMV.
