Robst “A Different Halloween”, Lilly meets Hermione's mother and goes to their house for Halloween. Because she isn't home James runs when Voldie shows up and the fic explores what happens next. (Note: Harry isn't marked in this but his and Neville's role in the prophesy is a driving force in the plot).
