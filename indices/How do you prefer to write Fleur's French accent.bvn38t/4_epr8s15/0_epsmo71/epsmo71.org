You can also add that use of French words is acceptable when the character is in an emotional state, be it anger, sadness, annoyance . . .

Like Fleur saying "Merci, merci, merci" after Harry saved Gabriel, or her saying "Merde" when something bad just happened to her (when the sleeping dragon ignites her robe for example).
