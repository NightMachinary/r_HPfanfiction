Ok authors, if you want to write french, please follow these rules:

You can of course write Fleur's accent, because JK Rowling did it, but please either be weary of the sounds used in the French language to know which words she's actually supposed to know how to prononce. I've already read some fic replacing the S with Z but the thing is we pronounce the S the exact same way in french and english. Either make a point in accuratly depicting a french accent or just don't do it.

Don't just use french words in the middle of a random sentence for no reason, do it if the character forget a word in english or something like that only.

If you want write full sentences in french, like for french characters speaking among themselves, find a french fluent to correct it first, Google translate does not count. You can just refrain from it at all, you should either be translating it in notes or narration anyway.

Everything here is valid for any and all languages I guess.
