I'm Swedish and that is actually what happens when I speak English.

Once I'm speaking it's a standard received pronunciation accent, standard grammar, probably more unusual words than native English speakers, but if I'm asked a question and am not totally focused, or if I'm tired, then I can absolutely start to respond in Swedish.
