There is quite a lot of truth to this. Though one thing Ieould say is that to me, it does not seem too odd. I was am a nativr English speaker but have been taught french, russian, and arabic at various times and have heard decent amounts of spanish as well. As such, I sometimes use words and phrases from those languages when talking to my parents without it seeming odd. Just little things like yes and no, numbers, etc.
