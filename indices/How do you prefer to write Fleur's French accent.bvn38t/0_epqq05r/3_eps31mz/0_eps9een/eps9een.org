Yeah, I grew up in a Latino neighborhood, I heard "si" and "de nada" mixed in with English all the time. Well, I guess it was basically Spanglish that people speak here, so [[/u/Achille-Talon]] is pretty correct (at least considering Spanish). I get a lot of, "no, /mija,/ no menudo today, check back /ma√±ana/." It's also called "code switching."

I get a lot of "yes" and "no" in Chinese, too, but not much else in that language, probably because it's harder to code switch.
