I'd rather write a /realistic/ French accent. The occasional dropped 'H's are actually pretty accurate, though it shouldn't be an absolute rule, but the thing I really wish people would stop doing is having her randomly pepper her English with common French words. It is utterly ridiculous for her to be going, “/Oui/, Harry, I will gladly participate in ze tournament". If a non-native-English-speaker uses words from their mother tongue in their English speech, they aren't going to be "yes" and "no"; it's the /difficult/, unusual words for which they do not recall the translation which will be in French.

Also, it shouldn't just be perfect English with accent and some French words (whichever words those are). If she speaks English badly enough to have a comically thick accent, her syntax shouldn't be perfect either. Her turns of phrase should be just a little awkward, using words in not /quite/ the right meaning.

So the example above would, in anything, be something more like “Yes, Harry, I will participate happily in ze, er, ze /tournoi/."
