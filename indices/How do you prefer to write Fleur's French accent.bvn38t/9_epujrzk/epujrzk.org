To complete a little the first answer:\\
It's unfrequent word and false friends that she would have problems with, not common words\\
When it comes to pronunciation, the H will pose problems, as will the TH; then comes words like "throughout", which are far from evident, and the difference between short and long vowels (ship and sheep for example)

But as a native french speaker, I admit I'd rather see a mention of her accent than badly mangled english that has few common points with the way a french teenager would speak english.
