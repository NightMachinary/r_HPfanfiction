This one is not Harry centric, but it's one of the better left of canon stories without too much shipping linkffn(The Arithmancer) it has the benefit of being completed.

This one is fits the bill, but the sequel will likely never be published linkffn(the lie I've lived by jbern) I haven't read it in a long time, so I don't remember how much shipping is in it, but I know it is mainly driven by the plot.

If you have just gotten into Harry Potter fanfiction I would recommend linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It is old and was published before a lot of it's plot devices became tropes, but it still had many unique elements that help it stand the test of time. For the longest time this was my all time favorite.
