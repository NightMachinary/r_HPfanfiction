Unfortunately, some of the best canon divergent fics are less than 100k words:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]], linkffn(11540013), is 879k words long! Here, Voldemort regains his sanity after his resurrections and decides to have a fresh start.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), diverges from canon after Year 4 and has 643k words. It has some shipping, but it's mostly a dark war epic. The good guys are giving no quarter in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), takes on a different path well before Hogwarts. This Hermione is adorably dark. Not long, but no shipping at all.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), UK military and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort after Scrimgeour was murdered. The Trio only needs to pitch in with the Horcrux hunt.

Dumbledore takes the Basilisk more seriously in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), and solves most canon plot with Amelia Bones. It's a short, but very entertaining fic.

After Dumbledore was murdered, Grindelwald breaks out to avenge him in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929). He and Harry join forces and international complications soon follow.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), diverges after Bill and Fleur's wedding. Things went very badly for them. In December 1999, very badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are throwing into a new dimension where things have gone very differently. No shipping, but I'm rooting for Harry and Hermione.

Gilderoy Lockhart found and raised Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363). As a result, Harry becomes a cunning memory charm specialist. He is sorted into Slytherin, and the first year already turns out very differently.
