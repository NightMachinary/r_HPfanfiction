Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - First fic that came to mind. A good canon divergent fic. Any shipping would be having to read between the lines so you won't have to worry about that in this story. Otherwise, it's a great story filled with interesting characters.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - It's only about 70k words but this is a complete story. It's another good story with Harry being artsier. Again no shipping.
