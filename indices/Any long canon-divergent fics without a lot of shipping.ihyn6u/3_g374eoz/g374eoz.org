Here's some more stuff you might like.

*Pureblood Pretense series:* AU where Tom Riddle became a leading conservative Wizarding politician instead of the Dark Lord. The worldbuilding and magic in this fic is incredible. Features a fem!Harry that's pretty much her own character.

*Victoria Potter:* A more tightly bound, refined Wizarding World, and a fem!Harry in Slytherin. My favorite in-progress fic.

*Forest of Valbone:* Twelve-year-old Harry steals the Sorting Hat and the Ford Anglia and goes on a rampage through Wizarding Albania. A magnificently written dreamscape followed by a violent revenge fantasy. Great completed fic.

*The Phoenix and the Serpent:* Written before OOTP was released, a really good AU featuring a mentor-figure Dumbledore, believably AU magic, and some great characterization. Incomplete but ends tolerably.
