I think the "soulmate" part also has something to do with it. It's a trope that screams "insta friendship without any character development", it suggests the author did not want to really think about how a friendship could develop naturally and took the lazy way out. That's the reason why I am hesitant to read the story. Not because it is slash. Also, it wouldn't have hurt if you had given us a little more to go on... Neither the story summary nor your recommendation tells us what this fic is about. Does it follow the canon timeline (Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Voldemort), what about Ron and Hermione, is it a lighthearted or darker story, what is so "amazing" about this story? I don't mean you should spoil the story, but a little more information would have been nice.
