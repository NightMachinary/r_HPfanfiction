Sadly that is the way of the world. A single example is often used as the excuse to exclude those that may even slightly be similar. Many people hate rational fics because Methods of Rationality exists. Many people hate the Harry Ginny Pairing because the movies ruined the Ginny character. many people hate Harmony because the pairing is so over worked. And as far as Slash is concerned, it is often because Slash stories are about the slash.

Heres the thing... Homosexuality does not change people's characters except for their dating preferences. While it may open a few doors, it also closes them plot wise. My issue with slash stories is that no one who writes them understands that slash should not matter at all in the story unless its a character basis. Most slash stories on this fandom deal with the fact that "OMG Harry is gay! Lets make that a major plot point. " Then they spend the next 30k words to communicate that Harry is gay and that he is attracted to Draco/snape/voldemort. Never mind the fact that in canon, while there was romance, it was a driving emotional force, not a central image. Thus, every single time that romance, slash or otherwise, becomes central in the story, the characterization of the characters is odd, uninspired and boring. This story also falls into the trope, and while it is an okay story, the fact that it is romance centered is the issue. nothing more, nothing less.

Also, the flair is wrong. you should have the Recommendation flair, not the request.
