Yeah, I understand. (Edit: I did get a little bit annoyed when I browsed through this subreddit and found a bunch of anti-slash stuff, so it did make me a bit testy. My bad)

It starts during chamber of secrets, and during the duel, Draco trying to quiet Harry reveals that they're both soulmates. They still hate each other, but it's awkward and they still try to make an effort to at least listen to each other. Each chapter follows a book. Both Draco and Harry's friends are kept in the dark at first, but when they find out about their soulmate status, Ron, Hermione, Blaise, and Pansy try to work together to keep Harry and Draco's soulmate status a secret from Draco's parents.

As of now, the fic is more about their slowly growing friendship and the hiccups along the way that tend to occur when you realize the person you hate is destined to be your greatest love/friend.
