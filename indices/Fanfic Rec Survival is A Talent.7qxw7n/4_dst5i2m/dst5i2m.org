It's kind of a shame someone decided to dislike this post just because it's m/m. Especially since if they read the fic it's not even shipping yet. At all. They're friends. I'm honestly kind of disappointed that this subreddit seems so instantly against any fic just because it's “slash”.

edit: I mean come on y'all, it's 2018. Why so much hate?
