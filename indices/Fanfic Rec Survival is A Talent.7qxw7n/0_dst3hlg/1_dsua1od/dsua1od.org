The only H/D I'm interested in are the Veela!Draco fics. I'm usually let down because I want Harry to reject Draco because Draco's an asshole. The author usually goes the angsty Harry route where he begrudgingly accepts Draco because he "doesn't want to be responsible for Draco going crazy and slowly dying because his mate rejected him" route.

Harry's all, "I don't want to be responsible for him dying," and I'm all, "Help him dig his grave, bitch!"
