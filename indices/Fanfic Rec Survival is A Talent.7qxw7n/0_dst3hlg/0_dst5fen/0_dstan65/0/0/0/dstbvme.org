You could, yknow, at least check out the first chapter before stating why you hate it. Or you could just leave if you're not interested in the fic? Like, I get it, it's not your cup of tea, but since you haven't read it so you can't offer productive criticism, why are you still here? I can't force you to leave or anything, but it just confuses me.

Edit: also there's another person on this thread who said that they liked it, so its not just my opinion on it. At least if you're going to drag it through the mud, read a chapter first.
