  Like, I get it, it's not your cup of tea, but since you haven't read it so you can't offer productive criticism

But the fic fails so hard, that I can offer criticism based on description alone. Why even bother reading the first chapter?

  also there's another person on this thread who said that they liked it, so its not just my opinion on it
#+end_quote

And? The number of people liking a thing doesn't say anything about quality, just see most favourited fics. Especially that neither you or the other fan of the fic wrote why the fic is good.
