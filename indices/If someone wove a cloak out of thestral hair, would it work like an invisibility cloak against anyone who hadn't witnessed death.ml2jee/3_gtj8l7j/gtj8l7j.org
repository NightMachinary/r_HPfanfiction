Depending on the treatment of the hair afterward. Regular invisibility cloaks are made from Demiguise hair, which can switch their invisibility at will and eventually lost the ability after few years. Since Thestrals appear to be permanently invisible while living, we can presume that even if the hair becomes visible when separated from the animal, magical treatments can activate that ability for at least a few years. Since Thestrals hair core so far are only seen on the Elder Wand, it's also possible that they might last longer than regular cloak from Demiguise hair.
