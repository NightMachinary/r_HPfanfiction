Thestrals look like bats, especially their wings. I doubt their hair covers their whole body, and the whole creature is invisible, so maybe you'd want a Thestral leather cloak?

I like to think that they would retain their magical properties, so i'm leaning towards yes, you are able to make an selective invisibility cloak with it. But it's fanfiction, you can do whatever you want.
