Tell me, why did you feel the need to use a passive voice, why did you consider to detach your readers from the events by emphasising on that Sasori did /feel/ pain to be preferable to actually describing what he feels?\\
What in "he felt pain" does in your mind make for a better story than something like "a spark of white-hot agony raced up his thigh" or "every nerve in his calf screamed itself hoarse as a spell carved its way through the flesh and left behind a coarse mince"?
