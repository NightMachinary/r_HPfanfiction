It's because this story is the current third rail in fanfic. People love it or hate it, for the reasons you mentioned.

I would say that linkffn(2107570) fits the OP request, as well as the oft mentioned Make a Wish trilogy. Blot writes a bunch of fics that fit this general mold, of varying quality.

However, if you want true Vizier style "power behind the throne" fics, I don't know many. Search up "grey Slytherin Harry" fics and you will likely have a strong correlation.
