One that sort of fits is the Travel Secrets series by E4mj. It's not finished, and the updates are scarce, but there is quite a bit up already. The premise is that Harry goes back in time to try to fix everything with really OP memory, skills, and magical power, but he has to keep it a secret from everyone. I enjoyed it. linkffn(9622538)
