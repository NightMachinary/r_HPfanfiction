Sounds good, although I have a question. It says only year 1 and 2 complete and yet is at 317k words. I don't mind super long fics but I also don't like sluggish fics that take FOREVER to get Harry old enough to allow for romance or more interesting aspects of life, not to mention it's sounding like it's not remotely close to complete and may take ages to get there. Any feedback?
