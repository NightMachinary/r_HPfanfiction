If my folklore recollection is correct, I believe Veela are spirits of women who had died just before marriage and they gain their power from seducing men lost in the woods at night. A Veela and a man can have a child but the whole spirit-of-the-forest essence gets quite lost. Quite like in Hagrid's case, where he is very big, he is in essence still a human (he doesn't even display the savage tendencies of Giants), so is Fleur... very beautiful but otherwise human.

Funny now that I think of it... Veela are kind of like the opposite of Dementors. Dementors feed on human despair based on their sorrow while Veela feed on human despair based on their attraction for them. What if Dementors are spirits of men that died violent deaths or lost their soul somehow? After all, according to Pottermore, Azkaban used to be the fortress of a dark wizard who lured sailors and then he'd torture and experiment on them.

That's a pretty neat headcanon. Thanks!
