Yeah. It does have a rather Breakfast-Club-esque Poignancy to it. I think that makes the story better though. Hope and melancholy all intertwined together. It might make an interesting prequel for a "For Want of a Nail" fic - in the Ministry, Harry says just the right thing to get Bellatrix thinking about that night and she swaps sides.
