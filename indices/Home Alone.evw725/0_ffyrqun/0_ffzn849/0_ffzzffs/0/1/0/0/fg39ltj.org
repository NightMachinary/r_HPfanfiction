I would love a fic exploring this more. Not something I have the time or inclination for really right now. It would be a good one though for anyone that picked it up.

/Bellatrix sat there in there chair staring in the mirror brush in hand. It was loosely held as she went through the motions of putting her hair back into rights./

/Andromeda had always said there was a special magic in brushing your hair by hand compared to using charms. Tonight, after everything she needed that magic./

It could be epic, really hope someone picks it up.
