I wrote it but couldn't see Bellatrix changing sides yet. I could see her focusing on that moment though. It being enough to save Sirius. Enough so Harry doesn't go after her with pure rage instead he is just pushing her back. It gives her room to not have pure hatred for him in her. She keeps recalling that night, comparing it to now.

How many friends she had, how many people they knew. How many were now dead. How few were left on both sides of the lines. How it was all so hollow. She served ten years and it's still the same. More dying, less laughter, less moments like that night.

Eventually it grows to be to much and she abandons the war. She can't handle it anymore. Turning to her sister Andromeda she breaks down.

Evil twisted bitch or not Bellatrix is her sister. She takes her in and cares for her. Bellatrix convincing Narcissa and Lucius to join her as well after Voldemort forces their boy to try to kill Dumbledore.

They pull Draco from school and stay in hiding. Sirius maintains his house and no Death Eaters sneak in.

7th year they aren't camping constantly but eventually destroy the horcruxes and Harry kill LV. Making oaths to put family above all others the gang accept each other again eventually. The Malfoy family moves back to France and takes Bellatrix with them.

At least that's how I would see the over arching story roughly go.
