The moment before the fighting really breaks out in the Veil Room:

Sirius knew this was not looking good for them. Still he would go down fighting and save his godson at least. Pulling Harry down he turned the boy to face him.

"Harry listen, it's not looking good right now. I want you to promise me you'll get out of here no matter what!"

Harry saw the look on Sirius's face. He didn't think he would survive this and wanted Harry to live no matter what.

Trying to reassure his godfather he smiled and replied.

"Only if you promise to have that drink with me you've been going on about."

Lucius Malfoy overheard Harry's reply from nearby. Smirking he felt the need to let a quip out.

"Potter you're not going to be missing much. Sirius Black was always a lightweight if memory serves."

Sirius barked back a quick 'oi' at Malfoy's remark.

Bellatrix had a one of her few happy memories resurface after a decade of dementors eating at them.

The fighting picked back up and it was getting close on each side. Soon Harry found himself separated from Sirius and keeping Neville from rushing in.

He saw Bellatrix sending out banishers like crazy until Sirius stopped in front of the veil drawing attention. Trying to make time for the kids to get free.

Bellatrix send a flurry of spells at Sirius who blocked them all accept the last red spell. Harry's scream tore from his throat as he tried to reach Sirius.

Instead of flying into the veil Sirius collapsed like a puppet with it's strings cut.

The fighting moved on and Harry heard Remus tell him Sirius was only stunned. Bellatrix and her crew were now retreating as Harry fought them out.

He heard a 'Renervate' and Sirius started yelling behind him. Haru didn't have time to look back or slow down. He pushed forward one step at a time.

After what felt like ages Sirius was by his side again as they battled it out in the Atrium.

Voldemort arrived and then things got intense. The minister and dozens of others had arrived at this point seeing Sirius Black fighting side by side with Harry Potter against Voldemort.

"Harry cover be for a second!"

Harry didn't even think twice and pushed even harder at fighting back Voldemort.

That was until Voldemort got hit in the head with a metallic bra.

Siruis rejoined him right away and laughed.

"Ha! The enchantment still works!"

With the minor lull in the battle Harry looked to see where the bra came from. As did everyone else including Voldemort.

"What the bloody..."

The statue of the witch and wizard were taking off their clothes while dancing suggestively together.

The minister yelled out as realization struck him!

"It was you wasn't it Black! You're the one who added that enchantment!"

Sirius smirked and went back to send a banished at Voldemort who yelled in rage at the humiliation and disappeared with a pop.

They didn't relax though as Siruis was still a wanted man. That was it!

"So minister going to try and call me a liar that Voldemort is back still!? Going to call me a liar again when like when I told you Sirius Black was innocent!? That after *you* arrested him he was thrown in Azkaban *without* a trial!?"

Fudge looked ashen as he realized he was screwed at this point. There were more witches and wizards pouring in the atrium by the second. There was no way he was getting out of this.

"I hereby pardon Sirius Black of all crimes he may have commited!"

There that should give him time to get this all back in order. Yes, that would work well indeed.
