Glad you liked it. It did kinda make me sad though writing it. I pictured this group of teens who are all family, or dating, and they are just ignoring all the shit in their life.

It's just this night of fun and enjoyment where they leave all the drama behind. Then they grow up and drift away. Always remembering that great night where they were just family having fun.

Like Bellatrix and Sirius didn't want to kill each other, they still remembered being family. Like Bellatrix was seriously distraught inside over accidentally sending Sirius into the veil but had to hide it.

It's this sad broken group that just wants to be family and live happily together like they did on that one special night.

Like I said, it was actually really depressing to write as I went on. Knowing what they would inevitably become and wishing I could make that night extend forever.
