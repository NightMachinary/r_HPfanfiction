Magic + LSD after smoking some weed means the Black kids are ready to become one with magic.

"Appiration is so easy. Just keep looking until you are there."

"Transfiguration is the doorway to God, I can feel my cells changing."

"My wand is me and I am my wand, it's all so clear now."

"We should cuddle unicorns. Let's go, this will be perfect trust me."

"See, if you cast the reverse of Fiendfyre you get Heavens Grace. The storms will stop eventually, Kent is shite anyways."

"I'm sure it's supposed to make that color, it's magic. Let's add some boggle tail and see what happens!"

"I told you we needed more Shark Oil. It's fine though, cause I'm seeing in sounds right now so something worked right."

"Well no one liked Manchester anyways."

"Okay, so you were right. The London tower looks way better dressed as a giant wang."

"Agreed, no more transfiguring monkeys to fly and giving them bottles of gin."

"Well how was I supposed to know all buses didn't dodge like the Knight Bus? I didn't take Muggle Studies."

"Well it could be worse, sure the lake's on fire but at least we have more booze."

"What the bloody hell! You know what, it's fine. Not even going to ask were you found a lethifold or how you got a leash on it."

"See he's totally not a 'useless blonde ponce'! Let me see you ride a damn Welsh Green! My fiancee is fantastic! "

"Okay, so maybe the muggleborn is alright. I'm not willing to steal a baby kraken as well to prove otherwise."

"I'm sure it will be fine, look how big the Black Lake is. Of course we can, it's got our name on it. We can do whatever the hell we want to it!"

"Alright I'll give you that, enchanting the statue in the atrium to strip dance when you cast a cleaning charm on it was brilliant."

"Okay, pretty sure I've mastered the universe enough, well at least mastered this bottle of fire whiskey, to make a portkey home!"

"Close enough!"
