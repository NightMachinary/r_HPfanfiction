Lupin, maybe, but I bet James wouldn't know what they were. And hey, she could have a supplier. Some enterprising Half-blood with ties to the Muggle World buys drugs there, then sells them to angsty Pureblood teens looking to rebel for a significant mark-up. Hell, for all we know, she took Muggle Studies and experienced a whole module on drug culture, with a practical experience element. You wouldn't even have to be up-to-present-date to study that - Victorians loved Opium and we literally sent care-baskets of Heroin to soldiers during WWI.

Personally, I was thinking that she'd get them from Andromeda. Imagine the shock and awe at the goody-two-shoes having Muggle Drugs, build up her fanon Muggle-loving Rebelliousness.
