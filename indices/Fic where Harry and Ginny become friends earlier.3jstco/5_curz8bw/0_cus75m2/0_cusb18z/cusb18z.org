In my opinion, Harry is very well done - often thinking more like a Kneazle than a human. I also think the changes to the canon plot resulting from his change are well-thought out. Dumbledore's handling the changes well, and Arabella Figg and her brother Sebastian are nicely-crafted characters. Most of all though it's very funny to read, with nice little touches and jokes. This Harry, for example, wants to enter the TWT since he thinks that's the best way to impress a female.
