There was one part where Harry starts talking about sex to McGonagall, and I just couldn't read it anymore. It's meant to be funny, but it was so strange and awkward I had to put it aside after that. I just can't handle humor that has a character unknowingly making a fool of himself. Combine that with the fact that Harry ran through the Burrow starkers at one point made me not pick it up anymore. To each their own.
