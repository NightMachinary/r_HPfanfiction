linkffn(Growing up Kneazle) has Harry befriend Ginny while wearing the form of a kneazle which he transformed into as a small child - she doesn't know that her best friend is actually Harry. He starts writing her in his first year as well. It's a very funny story, together with the sequel, since Harry sees himself as a Kneazle. Ginny's a whirlwind as well.
