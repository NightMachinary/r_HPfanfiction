Most of the fics that have them become friends after the CoS are already posted in this thread, so here are two fics that has Harry and Ginny become friends during GoF, when Ron's being a prat:

linkffn(A Friend Indeed): Not too long, nice story that follows the happenings of GoF.

linkffn(The Thorny Rose): starts duing GoF, the trilogy spans the next few years. Has a kind of different and slightly manipulative Ginny. Well written and very enjoyable, though!
