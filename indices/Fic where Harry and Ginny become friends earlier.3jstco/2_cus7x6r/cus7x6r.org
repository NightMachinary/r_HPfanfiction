linkffn(Down the Rabbit Hole by Accusatrix) is excellent. It was meant to be a Dark!Harry/Dark!Ginny story, but it was abandoned before it reached that stage. The set up is excellent though.

Book II of the Grey Maiden series has Harry befriending Ginny. Also, both Ginny and Harry are in Slytherin. linkffn(Gey Maiden II: Slytherin's Heir)

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) has Harrymort befriending Ginny in year 2. For a certain value of friendship, at least.

linkffn(Unspeakable Things) by Darth Marrs has both Harry and Ginny trained together by the DoM. Like all DM stories, it is entertaining in parts, but falls apart towards the end.

link(The amplitude, frequency and Resistance of the Soul bond) is a guilty pleasure of mine.

Sovran's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=11833&chapter=all][Meaning of One]] puts them together in Harry's first year. Never read it though.
