It's a bit disingenuous to portray her as entirely innocent. Near the end, I saw 4 or 5 threads where different people would start a discussion with her, she would bizarrely interpret their response as hostile towards her and get emotional, and then the situation would devolve into unnecessarily drama. Or she would make sweeping accusations while trying to carry a discussion over from one thread to another.

Point being, yes some people downvoted her for random stream-of-consciousness comments (which may or may not be fair depending on whether you think those kinds of comments are quality contributions) and other people downvoted her for instigating drama.
