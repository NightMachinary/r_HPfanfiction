When Alma started out in this sub she was super innocent (and clearly on the spectrum). She was particularly emotionally sensitive. People would then PM her mean shit and - perhaps not realizing her particular emotional sensitivities - be assholes in their replies.

She came to hate Reddit on the whole. You could easily see the transition from a bright-eyed young poster to a jaded, bitter, and hurt one. It was pretty sad.

Oh well. Hope she found a better community. God knows Reddit wasn't a healthy one for her.
