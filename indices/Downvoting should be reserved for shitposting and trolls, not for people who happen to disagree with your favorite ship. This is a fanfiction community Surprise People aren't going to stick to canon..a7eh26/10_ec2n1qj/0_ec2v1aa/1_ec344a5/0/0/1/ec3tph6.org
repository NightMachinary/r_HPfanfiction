Some of Alma's comments (sorry Alma if you read this) are the only ones that absolutely deserved to be downvoted. "OHhh CHIRU your name is so cuddly and cute. I like JAPANESE too! You have such nice opinions!" really adds nothing to the discussion and is basically spam.

It's not like she never made quality contributions, quite the opposite, but there was definitely some iffy stuff.
