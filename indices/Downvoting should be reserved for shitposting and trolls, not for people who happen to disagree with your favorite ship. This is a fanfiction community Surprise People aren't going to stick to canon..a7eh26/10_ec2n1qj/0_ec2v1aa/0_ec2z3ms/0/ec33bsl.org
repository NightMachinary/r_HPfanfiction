Valid point, although to get back to the subject at hand (downvoting), Alma wasn't treated very fairly in that 90% of the time she showed up in a thread, she would get downvoted not because of what she was saying but because those people thought she was annoying based on remarks she'd made previously in other threads. I don't believe the downvote was ever intended to be used in such a manner.

(Personally, I found her refreshing - if a bit hyper and slightly naive about internet etiquette. I'd welcome her back anytime.)
