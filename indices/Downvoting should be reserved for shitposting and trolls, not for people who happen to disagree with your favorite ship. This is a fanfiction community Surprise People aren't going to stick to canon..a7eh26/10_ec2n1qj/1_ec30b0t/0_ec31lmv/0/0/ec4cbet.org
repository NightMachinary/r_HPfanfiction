Yep, RES has the capability to tweak CSS. I use it to fix the UI on some subs that have design issues. However, I'd argue that's still more effort than most random downvoters are willing to put in on the spur of the moment. Thus, hiding the downvote button wouldn't stop a few people with malicious intent, but it would stop the vast majority of people who simply forgot reddiquete.
