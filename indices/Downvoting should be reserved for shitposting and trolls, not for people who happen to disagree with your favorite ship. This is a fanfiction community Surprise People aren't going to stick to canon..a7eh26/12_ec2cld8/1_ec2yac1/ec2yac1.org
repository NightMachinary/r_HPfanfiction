The issue is that all humans seek approval, even if they want to claim they do not. When you come somewhere and post something, which is your opinion, you want it to be heard and recognised. The issue with downvoting is being downvoted can make your opinion vanish.

Avoiding and excluding that, going against what is seen as the normal and popular is not a viable reason. Everyone has their own opinion and we should accept that. Abusing a system in place because someone said something â€˜stupid' is dumb. Could you imagine putting effort into a post only for it to be downvoted because your opinion was different from the masses? Most people have experienced this in life where they have poured their heart and soul into something and been told it is awful. It hits closer to home when it happens here, too.

It is even funnier because the Harry Potter community likes to claim they are the nicest and accepting people around, but they are not. They are the first to attack, defend, or belittle someone for something stupid like disliking a character or pointing out something that makes sense.

The issue has very little to do with karma, but more to the point is the masses of sheep are trying to play shepherd.
