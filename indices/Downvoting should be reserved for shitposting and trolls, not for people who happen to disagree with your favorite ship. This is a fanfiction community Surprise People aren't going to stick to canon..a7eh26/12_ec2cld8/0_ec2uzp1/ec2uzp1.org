Yeah, it's especially baffling to me when people go on a thread requesting a certain ship just to shit talk it. It's so common and rude, they deserve downsides and shouldn't there be a rule about it?

Like, I hate bellatrix, ESPECIALLY paired with anyone, but I don't find every request for fics with her so I can go there to complain or tear apart the premise of any paring with her.
