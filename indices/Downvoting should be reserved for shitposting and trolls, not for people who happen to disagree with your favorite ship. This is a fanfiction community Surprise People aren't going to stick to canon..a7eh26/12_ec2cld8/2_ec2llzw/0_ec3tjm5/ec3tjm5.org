It's not just about 'fake internet points' and caring too much about karma though.

1. If you submit a request for fics with a certain pairings your submission will not be visible (except for those that regularly browse the new queue) as soon as it is downvoted into oblivion.

2. AFAIK with the default reddit settings comments below a certain threshold are also automatically hidden.

3. If you have net negative karma on a subreddit you can only comment every 15 minutes or so because of spam protection (unless this has changed).

4. There's a sort of 'othering' going on by mass downvoting a comment. It's like putting someone on a block in the market place and throwing tomatoes at them. Suddenly all kinds of verbal abuse become allowed that wouldn't otherwise be accepted.
