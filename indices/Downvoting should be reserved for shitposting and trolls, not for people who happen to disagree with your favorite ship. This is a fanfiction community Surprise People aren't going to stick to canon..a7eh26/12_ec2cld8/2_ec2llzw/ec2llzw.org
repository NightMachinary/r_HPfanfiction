It might seem harsh, but that's the whole truth. Sure, seeing your comment upvoted a lot is nice because it means people agree with you or find your argument convincing, but having people disagree with you is not the end of the world.

If you really care about karma just farm some on [[/r/AskReddit]]. A community with 400 people active is not really a good place for that either way.
