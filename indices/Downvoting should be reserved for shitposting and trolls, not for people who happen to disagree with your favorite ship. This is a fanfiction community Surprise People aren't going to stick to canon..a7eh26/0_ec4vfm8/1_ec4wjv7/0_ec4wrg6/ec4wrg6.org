I would consider sleeping with someone due to the influence of a love potion rape, similar to doing it due to being drunk. However, I would /not/ consider a situation like Ron's rape -- because nothing happened!

Basically, the crime would, in my opinion, be at the same grade as if the victim was forced outside a love potion. So if, say, kissing happens, it would be sexual harassment /but not rape/. If they sleep together, then it is rape.

As for SS or Draco ships, I agree with your sentiments. I don't like reading SSHG teacher/student fics (by far the most common SS-centric fics is of this type), and Dramione or Drarry needs serious justification for me to take it seriously. That doesn't mean that I would downvote people who /do/ read and like those kind of fics (or even ships as politically wrong as Tomarry). It's their opinion after all, and it doesn't hurt me in any way.
