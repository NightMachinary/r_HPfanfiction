The problem with SS fics is that a lot of them tend to ship SS with school children. Ignoring the power dynamics and the question of if you can fully consent to someone who has power over your grade, there's an age discrepancy which is a real issue there. As far as Draco is concerned, you'll find that people really just don't like him being paired with the trio, especially Hermione who he exhibits racism towards throughout the entire series.

However, none of those logical reasons for disliking something apply to downvoting it. This is fanfiction and, frankly, we can do, change or modify whatever the hell we like.

I'm curious, though, why you wouldn't consider sleeping with someone who's been subjected to a love potion as rape. I'm open to your opinion, but you didn't exactly /explain/ it.
