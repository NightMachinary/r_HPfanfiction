This sub has a /really strong aversion/ towards ships involving any kind of Death Eater -- especially Draco and Severus (which is particurly strange considering that he's probably the only DE that could get away with not being considered one with canon context). I can see why it would rub peopole the wrong way with Draco's prejudice and Severus'... attitude issues, but if some people like fics pairing them, more power to them. Besides, there is plenty of fics involving pairings some people see as ridiculous that can be well written. I read a RL/SS fic once, and while I really don't care for the pairing and consider it a bit silly, the fic wasn't bad.

Once in this sub, I argued against love potions automatically being considered rape in all circumstances, even if nothing actually happened (see Ron's case in HBP), which turned out to be a really unpopular opinion, because I was downvoted into oblivion. I don't even consider them moral, and certainly wouldn't deem them legal in my perfect legal system, merely not rape-level evil, but even with that in mind...
