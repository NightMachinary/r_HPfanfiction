Agreed. I think regular posters have a bit of a responsibility to make this a more welcoming place to newcomers. I know I can be quite argumentative myself, but I try not to shit all over requests threats with pairings that I don't care about.

"Oh cool, there's a Harry Potter fanfiction subreddit, I'm going to go there and ask for recommendations about my favorite pairing: Harry/Voldemort" and then the only thing you get is being mocked and worse the people mocking you are being upvoted. No good. That person won't be back.
