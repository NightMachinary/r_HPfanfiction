The rule isn't about discussing the recommended fics, but the /requests/. Because a number of posters answered requests like "Good Drarry fics" and "Good Snarry fics" with "there are no good fics with that plot and you're a moron/deviant/have no taste for wanting to read that drivel".

Check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5v5f2v/new_rule_proposals/][the thread]] where the rule was discussed here. Just check how many people defend the "right" to insult a poster or their taste.
