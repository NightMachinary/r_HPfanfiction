Eh I think there's some room for nuance here: I think top comments in request threads should only contain recommendations or questions for clarification. I can't see much harm in discussing the recommended fics in child comments.

Same goes for prompts. Top comments should all be responses to the actual prompt and not a discussion about its merits. Discussing prompt responses is fine.
