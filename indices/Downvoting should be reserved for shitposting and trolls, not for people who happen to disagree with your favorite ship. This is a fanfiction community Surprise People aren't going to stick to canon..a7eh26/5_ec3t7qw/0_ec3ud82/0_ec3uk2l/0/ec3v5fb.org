Yeah, I wasn't really referring to the culture of downvoting in itself, it's more that it creates and fosters a general intolerance to anything that falls outside the forum preferences. But I would also say that this happens on most internet forums and reddit isn't special in that regard, but the upvote/downvote system makes it visible. It's definitely not all about ships though. There are other things that Shall-Not-Be-Named too.
