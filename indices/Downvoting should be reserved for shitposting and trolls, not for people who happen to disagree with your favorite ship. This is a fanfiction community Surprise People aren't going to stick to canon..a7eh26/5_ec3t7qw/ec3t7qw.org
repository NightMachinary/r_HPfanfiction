The culture on this sub definitely has gotten worse. Lots of combative attitudes.

There's nothing wrong in having opinions and fighting for them, but this 'my way or the highway' thing that's been going on is really unhealthy for discourse and our community. There's ways to disagree with someone without shouting them down or trying to silence them. Reminds me a bit of the worst of the shipping wars way back when... where people had to segregate into different communities over their pairing preferences.
