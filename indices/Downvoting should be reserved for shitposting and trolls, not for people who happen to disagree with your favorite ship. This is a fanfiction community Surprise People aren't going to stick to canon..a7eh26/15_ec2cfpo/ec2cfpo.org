I don't see how 'I am interested/not in this' resulting in a score saying how much this particular community is interested is a problem.

I mean, I think it would be better off with people upvoting/downvoting based on post quality/contribution, but lacking any standards (a sidebar rule), I don't think it is fair to criticize people for using other standards...
