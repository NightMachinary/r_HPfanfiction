  I don't see how 'I am interested/not in this' resulting in a score saying how much this particular community is interested is a problem.

Downvoting discourages people from posting less popular ideas, the downsides of which OP has covered fairly well. Wouldn't it be better for the community if the people using downvotes that way just used the "hide" button on posts instead? That is, after all, what the hide button is meant for.

  I mean, I think it would be better off with people upvoting/downvoting based on post quality/contribution, but lacking any standards (a sidebar rule), I don't think it is fair to criticize people for using other standards...

[[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting][Reddiquette voting guidelines]] are site-wide. A specific rule in the sidebar of this sub isn't needed when the default standard already exists.
