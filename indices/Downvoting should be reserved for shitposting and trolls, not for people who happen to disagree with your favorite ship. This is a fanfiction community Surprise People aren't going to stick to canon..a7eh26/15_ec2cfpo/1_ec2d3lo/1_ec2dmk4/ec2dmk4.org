Yeah the ranting structure and punctuation in your post that /oozes/ resentment isn't criticism, sure.

My point is not to be sarcastic. It's to remind people that irony can be used to get a point across.

But this is just my honest opinion, so you aren't allowed to downvote me or you'd just be hurting yourself
