Nothing. [[/u/ferisgrim][u/ferisgrim]] was talking about how excessive downvoting can lead to groups of people feeling unwelcome in a a community, and I drew the parallel.

Now, they're certainly at totally different orders of magnitude; no disagreement there. But both are displays of intolerance and the ugly side of tribalism. I don't think it was wrong to make the comparison.
