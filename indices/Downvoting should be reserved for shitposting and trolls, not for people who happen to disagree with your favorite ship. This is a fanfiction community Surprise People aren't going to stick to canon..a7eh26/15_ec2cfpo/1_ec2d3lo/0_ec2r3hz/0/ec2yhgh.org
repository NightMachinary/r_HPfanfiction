I'm sorry, are you seriously equating people downvoting your preferred fanfiction ship to /the holocaust?/

​

What is /wrong/ with you? I, you're unbelievable. This is honestly the single worst thing I have ever seen in this sub and I can only hope you're a kid that's seen that poem referenced before but never knew just what it means or where it came from.

​

Edit: Since they've deleted it, for anyone wondering just what I was angry at. They were paraphrasing the poem [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...]["First they came.."]] which for the unfamiliar was written by a holocaust survivor, about the complacency of the German people, himself included, that allowed the holocaust to occur. Only they replaced the victims of the holocaust with 'persecuted' fanfiction ships. I won't say who said it, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they really /didn't/ know just what they were referencing.
