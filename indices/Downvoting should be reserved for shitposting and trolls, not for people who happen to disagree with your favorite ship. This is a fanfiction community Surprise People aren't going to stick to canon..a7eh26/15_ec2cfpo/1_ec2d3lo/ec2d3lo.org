My point is not to criticize anyone, it's to remind people that discouraging people from sharing their opinions is both harmful to themselves and counter to the very point of a subreddit focused around fanfiction in general, instead of say a specific pairing.

If everyone is downvoted for liking Harry and Luna relationships, for instance, eventually you'll stop seeing people post those opinions. Sure, the people who downvoted that opinion will perhaps be happy with that, but what about when it's their favorite pairing on the chopping block, next? Or their favorite concept of magic?

They're setting themselves up.

So, no, this isn't a criticism. It's a reminder that everything you like isn't going to be "the popular" thing, so discouraging other people from posting because they disagree with you is setting a precedent that's going to bite you back, later.
