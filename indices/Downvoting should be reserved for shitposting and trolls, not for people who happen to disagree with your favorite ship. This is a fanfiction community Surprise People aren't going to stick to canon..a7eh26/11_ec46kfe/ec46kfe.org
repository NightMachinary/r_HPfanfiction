I don't vote down a post that asks for a certain ship, but I do vote down recommendations that I know to be crap.

That doesn't mean I think people who ask for certain ships aren't, frankly, a bit silly. There is literally no point in asking for HP/Hannah Abbott stories, for instance, given that there's nothing that distinguishes Hannah from, say, Tracey Davies. Or any of the other characters that are nothing more than a name in canon.
