My opinion has nothing to do with content. Considering I've written multiple stories of a M rating where sex occurs on screen. It's that 'shipping' has turned into an excuse for plot that leads to terrible writing.

Far too often writers are more focused on 'I want to write a Harry/Daphne story!' so because they didn't bother thinking of a plot or anything interesting, Harry and Daphne live happily ever after by chapter two.

This is backwards. Rather than thinking about the 'ship' they should think about the 'plot' and write from there. Then let relationships develop organically and you wind up with better practice at the craft and, likely, a considerably better story.

I didn't write The Pureblood Princess because I wanted to write a Harry/Daphne story. I wrote the Pureblood Princess because I wanted to write a story that explored if I could actually do passable female narration (people flirted with me so Imma say...maybe?) and because I wanted to write a story that told one of the books from a different perspective. Throwing in Harry was mostly just so people would, you know, actually read it. Which would then, hopefully, get me feedback about my other goals.

It's funny how almost daily there's comments and threads about 'why is 99% of Fanfiction crap!' followed by 'I NEED MORE OF MY SHIP'

99% of fanfiction is crap because it's exists purely to be about the ship. Sink the ships and the obsessive nature of them and you're going to wind up with better quality fanfiction.
