The downvote button is a UI failure on Reddit's part. The intended purpose means absolutely nothing if the UI itself lends a different purpose to the button.

If Reddit actually cared about this, the downvote button would have a similar workflow to reports. Very few comments /actually/ fail to contribute to the discussion.
