I think part of the problem is that the up-vote button clearly means "I agree/like/approve", while the down-vote means... "you're not contributing constructively to the discussion"? Not an intuitive dichotomy.

Personally, I have found that I will down-vote a good-faith post I just disagree with if it already has a bunch of up-votes, but I will hesitate to do so if it would send that post into the negatives.
