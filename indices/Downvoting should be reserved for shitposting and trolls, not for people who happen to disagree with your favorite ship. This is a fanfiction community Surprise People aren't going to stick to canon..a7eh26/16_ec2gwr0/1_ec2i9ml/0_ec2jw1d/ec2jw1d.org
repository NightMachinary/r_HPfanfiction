Then it becomes a popularity contest and yes, maybe a little assholish but I think an argument can be made about the validity of such s contest. If I show my disaproval of this request, the requests I approve would get more exposure. Most users give popular entries more time. Not saying it is okay but it's not exactly wrong. Still an opinion shared and reddit is for that purpose after all.
