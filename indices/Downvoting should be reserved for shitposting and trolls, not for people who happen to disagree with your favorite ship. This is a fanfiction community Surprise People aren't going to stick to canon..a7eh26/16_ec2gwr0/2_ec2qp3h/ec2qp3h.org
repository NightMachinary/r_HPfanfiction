  I disagree with your comment but don't want to debate over it so I share my disagreement by downvoting.

Hmm. That's interesting, because I view downvoting in just the opposite way. I would /not/ use it to express disagreement, only to express "your post is unparseable/unnecessarily rude/irrelevant/didn't read the OP, and should not have been posted."

Edit: Huh, there's actually [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting][a policy on that]].
