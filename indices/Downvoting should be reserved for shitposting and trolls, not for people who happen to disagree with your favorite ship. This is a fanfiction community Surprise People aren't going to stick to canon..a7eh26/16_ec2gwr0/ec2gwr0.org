I disagree with your comment but don't want to debate over it so I share my disagreement by downvoting. It a simple, effective method of putting forth my opinion, not an attack on you.

So why would it put you off posting? If the disaproval of a faceless crowd can put you off, then you don't respect your own opinions enough.

Same goes for fanfiction. If disaproval means you stop writing, your conviction in your own Story is lacking.

What I'm trying to say is dont try to please the crowds. Stick to your opinions and desires. Listening to critisim will get you far but perseverance will get you further.
