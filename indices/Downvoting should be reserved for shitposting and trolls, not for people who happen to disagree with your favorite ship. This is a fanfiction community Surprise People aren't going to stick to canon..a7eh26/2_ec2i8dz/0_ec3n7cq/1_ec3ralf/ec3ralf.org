Well, Fleur and Tonks may be background characters, but unlike Snape, they did not join the magical Waffen-SS equivalent. Unlike Malfoy, they did not commit war crimes. Unlike Riddle, they did not lead a fascist coup and later on executed a genocide. That's the reason why any pairing with them gets downvoted. In canon Harry literally took a killing curse to rid the world of pureblood supremacists, and it is impossible to ship "Harry" with any of them, with the people who murdered his parents, his godfather, nearly killed six of his friends, tortured Hermione and carried out their own Final Solution targeted at people like his mother or his best friend without making him incredibly OOC.

You can pull off a believable Malfoy pairing, but the story would have to diverge before the mudbloood incident and then Malfoy would be very far from his canon self.
