Draco has done far worse than that.

He almost kills both Katie and Ron and leads an invasion of rapist murderer Death Eaters into a school full of childrenat age 17. Stop with the "he was just a misunderstood 11 year old kid in a bad situation'' crap.

Boo-hoo! "I'm sorry your Honor, I just never got a push to re-examine my beliefs."

Again, I enjoy a good redemption narrative for Draco and I'm not against the idea of him turning good, but I will never understand what drives the HP fandom to make excuses for people who'd go to prison for a long time in any decent society (well, I do have my theories why, but I won't go there).
