  I don't know what's so problematic about children raised to be bigots changing their beliefs to become tolerable people.

I don't have any problem with that narrative or this headcanon, but I'm pretty sure there's zero evidence for any of that in canon. The only clear indication about Draco we get is that he's a big old coward and him realizing that being a slave to a insane Dark Lord isn't all that amazing. I'm pretty sure that Draco would still be very much onboard with the whole extermination of Muggleborns and pureblood supremacy as long as he doesn't have to dirty his own hands.
