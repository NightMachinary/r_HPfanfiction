I agree with you. I like fanon!Draco a lot more than canon!Draco, and the same goes for Snape. I don't think people realize that some of us were invested in these characters for literal years before the later books came out, and the assumption pretty much always was that Draco, at least, was going to get a redemption arc. That never quite materialized in canon, but guess what? I read a ton of fic where it did, and I'm still invested.

And if we can't talk about fanon versions of characters here in this /fanfiction/ forum, where are we supposed to talk about them?
