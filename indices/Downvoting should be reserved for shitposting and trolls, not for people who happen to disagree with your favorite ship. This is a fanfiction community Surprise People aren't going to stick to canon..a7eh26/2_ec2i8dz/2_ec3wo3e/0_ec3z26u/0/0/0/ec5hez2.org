  And if we can't talk about fanon versions of characters here in this fanfiction forum, where are we supposed to talk about them?

Yeah, you can talk about them. The expectations are just off. People who favour Draco immediately expect people to understand where they are coming from (why would they?) and people who reject Draco white washing expect Draco apologia instead of just a different AU Draco or Draco fantasy or whatever.

Communication usually just breaks down at that point. It's important to remember that we have many different degrees of canon adherence in this community and people who are more strongly inclined towards canon are just not going to be happy about "shipping Anne Frank with a Nazi" (as it has been so eloquently put sometime).
