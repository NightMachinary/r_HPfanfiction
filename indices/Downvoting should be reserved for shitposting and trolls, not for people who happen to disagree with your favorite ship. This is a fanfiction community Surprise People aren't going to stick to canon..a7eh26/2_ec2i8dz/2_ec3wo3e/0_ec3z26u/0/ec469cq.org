I think I've seen some pretty nuanced discussions about Snape here. Maybe I'm thinking too far back though?

Draco - I think - is a much different issue, because I feel that there's a much larger disconnect between the fanon and canon version of Draco. People who like Snape usually acknowledge his numerous flaws and there's a canonical basis for "good things that Snape has done", where some kind of common ground can be found.

Draco on the other hand is mostly fantasy. He gets ascribed all kinds of complicated internal issues, fighting his inner demons or whatever, fantasy rebellion against his family traditions or other stuff that's *entirely* made up. At best a single event, like him not identifying Harry, is stretched and pulled and extrapolated into the most ludicrous imaginations of his "true" character.

We don't have to discuss Draco here and I have nothing against stories that want to indulge in a fantasy version of Draco, but bringing that into contact with people who are not familiar with it is -- unsurprisingly -- not going to fly. Draco is not a complex character, unless you write him as such (and I have no doubt that you or other authors who favour him can do it). JKR's Draco is a very straight forward character in a complicated situation.
