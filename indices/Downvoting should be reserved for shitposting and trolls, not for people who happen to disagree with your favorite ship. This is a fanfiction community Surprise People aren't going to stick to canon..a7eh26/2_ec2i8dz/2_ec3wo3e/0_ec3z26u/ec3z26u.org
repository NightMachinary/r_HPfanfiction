Yeah. I mean, obviously my original comment was more sarcastic than anything else, but one of the reasons I don't especially participate on the sub, despite lurking, is it's just exhausting to have any discussion about characters whose complexities I enjoy interrupted by people who can't let a single mention of them go by with spewing venom.
