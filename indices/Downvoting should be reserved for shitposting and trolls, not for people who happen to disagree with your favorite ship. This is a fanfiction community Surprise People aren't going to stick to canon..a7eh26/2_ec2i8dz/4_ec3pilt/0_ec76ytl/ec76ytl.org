I wish there was more fic that involves Harry interacting with an in-character Snape. I've read a couple of Slytherin!Harry AUs where he goes from despising Harry to grudgingly tolerating him over the course of a few years, but there seems to be an awful lot where he finds out during Harry's first week in Hogwarts that the Dursleys abuse him and immediately adopts him or whatever.

I remember reading one where the author specifically said at the start that they won't be making Snape too nice. A couple thousand words later, he's fighting Petunia and an evil Dumbledore on Harry's behalf. This is the man who saw Harry's terrible childhood memory and mocked him for it, remember.
