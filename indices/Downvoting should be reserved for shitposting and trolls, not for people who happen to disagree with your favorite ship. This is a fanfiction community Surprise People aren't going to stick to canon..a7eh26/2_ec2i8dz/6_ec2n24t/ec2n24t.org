  This sub is TOTALLY welcoming to all ships
#+end_quote

Where do you get that this sub should be welcoming to all ships? All communities tend to settle into majority accepted preferences over time. Tribalism is a part of the human condition.

This is simply not true. I can only speak for myself here, and I don't mind slash, as long as,

#+begin_quote
  don't involve Draco or Snape
#+end_quote

Well yes. The three most popular slash pairings are H/Draco, H/Snape and H/Voldemort. The last two will never, ever be okay. Of the H/Draco stories I've read, there are only a handful I could stomach. It's not even the slash that bothers me, but rather the ham-fisted death eater apologism and the "misunderstood dark families".

*Edit*: Can I just point out how funny it is that my post is being downvoted, in a thread about not downvoting because you disagree, because I disagreed with [[/u/Colubrina][u/Colubrina]]? Sort of proves pretty convincingly that people will keep downvoting what they don't agree with, lol.
