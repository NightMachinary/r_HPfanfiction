You wouldn't really have to imperius Hitler. You could just help along one of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler][assassination]] attempts. Your best shot would probably be the one by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Elser][Georg Elser]] where just the timing was 13 minutes off.

If that's too dirty you could also try to warn the Wehrmacht or other participants in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oster_conspiracy][Oster conspiracy]]. Trying to prevent the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives][Night of Long Knives]] might also be a good idea.

Or just go to the allies and drop some keywords that will get their attention.

Lots of stuff that could be done, especially if you have Magic superpowers at your disposal...

... not that imperius wouldn't be useful ;)
