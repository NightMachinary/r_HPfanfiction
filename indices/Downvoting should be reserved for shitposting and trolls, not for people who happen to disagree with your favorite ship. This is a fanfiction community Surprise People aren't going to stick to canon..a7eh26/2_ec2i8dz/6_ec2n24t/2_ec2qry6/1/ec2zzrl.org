I mean, there's not a whole lot of scenarios where that could happen since any time traveller has bigger things than Voldemort to worry about. There's that small thing called Second World War, so as soon as the time traveller chooses to attempt a salvation of Riddle over 50 million people (and maybe another 20 if they know how to fix China/Japan), the protagonist entirely unrelateble.

And since success is not guaranteed, the options are kill Riddle or gamble with the lives of thousands and let the second world war play out like he did in history.
