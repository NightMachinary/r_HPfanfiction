To be fair though Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't angels themselves according to both the laws of the regime and the laws of the stable world. Harry uses Crucio and Imperio and Sectumsempra on Draco, defies the Minister of Magic to his face, Hermione deposes and is complicit in the assault of the headmistress of Hogwarts and kidnaps and unlawfully imprisons another human being, they break into Gringotts /and/ the Ministry of Magic twice, committing at every occasion theft and property damage... the list goes on.

Obviously this is glossed over mostly in canon for story purposes but there are mant interesting directions that could be taken there if you want to really follow to the letter the rules of the established world. Doesn't fake!Moody say that use of any Unforgivable curse is automatic Azkaban? How many years has Harry racked up then?
