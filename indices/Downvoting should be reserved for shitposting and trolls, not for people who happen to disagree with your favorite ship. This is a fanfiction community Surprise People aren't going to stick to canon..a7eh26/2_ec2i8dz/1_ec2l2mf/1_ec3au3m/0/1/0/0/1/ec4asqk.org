Well, let's start with the unforgivables. 1 count for Harry (the Carrow one) and another failed attempt. Sectumsempra was clear cut self defence. The goblins don't count in the magical law and there is no muggle equivalent to use here. And even then you could make a case for defence of others with excessive force since Carrow was clearly a hostile combatant and had spent the last year torturing children (unlike Katie Bell). So probably a few years on probation. Or simply claim unaccountability.

Anything with Umbridge is self defense. Defying the Minister is not a crime outside of totalitarian regimes.

Hermione, well kidnapping and coercion, both underage.

Gringotts is a sovereign nation and they have their own laws we know nothing about. But given that it was unquestionably necessary for the war effort I'd go with nothing and compensation for the goblins from the Ministry. Or count it as regular hostility since sheltering Voldemort's soul is a clear violation of neutrality. If you want a historical precedent, the Mossad kidnapped one of the escaped Nazi leaders from Argentina to try and execute him.
