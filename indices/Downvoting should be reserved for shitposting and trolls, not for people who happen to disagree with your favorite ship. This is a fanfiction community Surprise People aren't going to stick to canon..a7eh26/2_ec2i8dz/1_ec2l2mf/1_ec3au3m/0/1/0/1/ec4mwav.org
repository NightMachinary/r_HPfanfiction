In any kind of fair justice system they absolutely would take into account that he was an underage kid who did this stuff because his life and the lives of his parents were threatened if he didn't. I don't think you can even be convicted of a crime if you did it because you were threatened with death otherwise.

Regardless he didn't even kill a single person. There are people who take human life and get out of prison in a few years. It's ridiculous and cruel to put someone in prison for life when they never even killed anyone.

If you're going to be that harsh about "war crimes" and "treason," then Harry, Hermione and Ron ought to all be in prison for life too for using unforgivables, including torture, and defying the government.
