And here's the issue. Even with a mild sentence, Malfoy would have no hope of ever getting out of prison. He would be lucky to not be executed for such things as war crimes, treason, attempted murder and using unforgivables. And coercion is not a valid defence for these charges, neither is being underage. Just a year for each transgression would leave him with several decades at least.

A punitive justice system would simply look at his attack on Katie Bell, be done with the trial in half an hour and lead him to the nearest ditch.
