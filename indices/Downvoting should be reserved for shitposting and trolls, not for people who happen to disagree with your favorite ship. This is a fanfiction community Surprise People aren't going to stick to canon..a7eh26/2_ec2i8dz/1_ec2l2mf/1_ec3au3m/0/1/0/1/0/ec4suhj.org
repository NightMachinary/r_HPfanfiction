  that he was an underage kid who did this stuff because his life and the lives of his parents were threatened if he didn't

British Law is very clear that Duress is not an applicable defence to murder, attempted murder or crimes committed as part of gang membership (such as the Death Eaters) as long as the accused voluntarily exposed himself to the "sinister organisation". Malfoy clearly supported Voldemort before he had to get his hands dirty, so that's even two ways Duress is invalid as a defence in his case.

  defying the government

That on its own is not a crime. It is a crime to help a fascist coup, whereas helping to restore the rightful, disposed government is the exact opposite of treason. Harry did not violate the Geneva convention on land warfare the same way Malfoy did, he did not attack civilians. Using the torture curse was unquestionably wrong, but at the same time he can construct a pretty solid defence for that since Carrow is a known torturer of children and Harry carried around a part of Voldemort's soul, which clearly had an effect on him.

  Regardless he didn't even kill a single person. There are people who take human life and get out of prison in a few years. It's ridiculous and cruel to put someone in prison for life when they never even killed anyone.

He had several counts of attempted murder and if not for Harry and Hagrid, he would have killed two people (Ron and Katie). That is more than enough for attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. And while I don't know the cases you are talking about, I doubt that the offenders were helping magical Nazis bend on exterminating a race they deemed beneath them.
