I mean the thing with AUs is that they can remove those. That's the entire point of a lot of fanfic that isn't just retelling the story from a new POV; making a change so different things do or don't come to pass.

Having said that if you believe in rehabilitative rather than punitive justuce there's also plenty interesting stories to be written about someone who's served their time for crimes committed and come to understand the magnitude of what they've done and moved to atonement. It's not like redemptive arcs aren't common in many fandoms and baseline stories.
