This comment kinda strikes me the wrong way, given that F/F pairings are by far the least popular and least written.

I don't know where this supposed M/M bashing is happening, but I've literally never seen it for most of the popular pairings that don't involve Snape(and honestly, the pairings that involve Snape are usually pretty gross when they happen at Hogwarts...)
