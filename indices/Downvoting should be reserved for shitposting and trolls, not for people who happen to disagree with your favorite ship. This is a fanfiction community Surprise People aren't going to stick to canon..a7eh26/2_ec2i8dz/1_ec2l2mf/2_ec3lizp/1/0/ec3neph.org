You can literally say the same thing about gay men, and that statement isn't important for either of them.

Lesbian relationships are hardly even talked about in general here though-- I mean I agree with your overall sentiment that lesbians are more accepted by society as a whole than gay men are, I just don't really think it applies in this specific community, especially given how big the M/M ship scene is in both Harry Potter and fanfiction as a whole.
