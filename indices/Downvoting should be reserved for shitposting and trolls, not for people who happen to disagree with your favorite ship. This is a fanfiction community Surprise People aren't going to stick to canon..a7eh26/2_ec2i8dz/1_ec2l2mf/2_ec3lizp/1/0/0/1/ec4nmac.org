I've been reading Harry/Draco slash for nearly 20 years now, so I've read a LOT of it, and I can definitely tell you the most common way for that pairing to be written is with Draco on the bottom. Next most common way is them being vers (meaning they both top and bottom.) Harry being a pure bottom is the least common.

Also all the slash and yaoi writers I know are adults. I don't know where you get your ideas of what slash is like.
