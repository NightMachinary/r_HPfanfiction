Okay, I just did that. Went to Ao3, put in M/M as the search parameters and sorted by number of bookmarks (bc I think that's the actual best gauge of popularity) and selected to see complete fics only. Of the 20 on the first page I've read every single one (except for the crossovers) and NONE are like you're describing. The ones that have graphic sex have switching or Harry as top for the most part. And the authors I know of (I don't know them all of course) are 30+ years old. I think you should really really question your assumptions and not state your opinions about who slash writers and readers are as fact. You have no idea what you're talking about.
