When it comes to slash it's pretty easy to fall into motivated reasoning for male het guys. There's some kind of gut reaction that you /just don't like/ this and then you try to come up with good (!) reasons why you wouldn't like this. I think this is reflective of larger issues in society, where gay guys are (rightfully) afraid to come out. Luckily that kind of motivated reasoning there ("he might infect me with something!" or "I totally don't know this person anymore, because of their sexuality") is usually socially shunned.

Maybe [[/u/Hellstrike]] is entirely consistent here and is equally as harsh towards stories where Harry acts submissively or shows a lack of spine with pairings that he enjoys... I don't know.

For myself I know that the no. 1 reason for not caring about slash is that I'm simply not gay. I've read some Dramione stories (even though that ship is pretty bad and ridiculous), but I have no interest in giving Drarry fics a shot. On the other hand it's entirely fair to bring up the fact that the slash community seems to thrive on 99% problematic pairings (as opposed to 90% in het fanfics ;).
