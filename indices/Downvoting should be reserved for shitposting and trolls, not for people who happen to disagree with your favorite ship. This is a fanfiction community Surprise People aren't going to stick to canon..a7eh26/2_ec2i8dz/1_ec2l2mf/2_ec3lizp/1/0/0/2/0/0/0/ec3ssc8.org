Page one ships Harry with a war criminals 19/20 times. The 20th was a FB story. I can't comment on that one, but I assumed that no adult would think that you would want to bang your parents murderer or his thugs. Hell, Malfoy's actions during the third year paint a very good and unpleasant picture of his character. He took glee from Hagrid's suffering and misery, he wanted a sentient creature executed for his own mistakes.

Page 2 was more of the same, with a mpreg story at the top. But to be fair, there was one woldstar fic there as well.
