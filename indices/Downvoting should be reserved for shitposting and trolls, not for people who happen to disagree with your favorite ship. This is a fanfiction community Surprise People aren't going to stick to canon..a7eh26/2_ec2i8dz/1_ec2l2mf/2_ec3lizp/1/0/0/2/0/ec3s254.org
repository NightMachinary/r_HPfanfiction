Started a couple dozens. Got beyond chapter 3? Never. If you want to stare into the abyss, go to archive, set your filters to only M/M and sort by popular.

Harry is a completely submissive bottom in 90% of these and lacks a spine in 95%. In canon he literally died to rid the world of pureblood supremacists and in fanfics he bends over and takes it up the arse by the people who murdered his parents and repeatedly tried to murder his friends. There were one or two somewhat decent ones with Ron, but nothing with much plot. Same with the twins.
