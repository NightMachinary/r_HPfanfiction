But now we get to laugh at the idiots who say that. The more barriers to entry the less there will be a split second decision. Voting can be a split second decision that can be based of malformed reasons. Teenagers are the majority of the users here who already have a low impulse control, but that doesn't mean that they can't make rational decisions.

Put a teenager in a room filled with cocaine with people telling them to try it, and they may very well do so. Put a teenager in front of an email with a week to make that same decision and you'll likely find that they won't. The longer the period of time necessary before your decision is made the less likely there will to be knee jerk reactions. As a side effect, it would also make identifying bots much easier as well. This idea isn't foolproof by any means, but it can serve as a foundation to find better methods.

Downvote reason: Lack of effort on the reply and lack of sufficient explanation.
