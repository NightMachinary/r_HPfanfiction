I remember posting on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] back in the day (maybe 12+ years ago) and adding

A/N: This is SLASH, don't like, don't read it!

to the top of everything I posted. I would still get rude comments (flames!) from people really, really angry that I would pair Harry and Draco together. A couple of years later, it started to seem like everything in HP fanon was gay! The more representation the better! Hermione was accepted to be a person of color in canon, everyone was at least a little gay, people were asking how Hogwarts would accommodate a trans student and writing AUs to suss out their favorite scenarios. There was good fic, there was bad fic, just like always, but it was so cool to see how the conversation changed over the years.

This, where we are right now, is not better. This sub has an intense rigidity about what's canon and true-to-character that is seriously off-putting. With the death of Schnoogle and Fiction Alley, then LiveJournal, and now Tumblr, there's not a lot of comfortable places for fandom left. I definitely understand where you're coming from. It's not a fun regression to watch.
