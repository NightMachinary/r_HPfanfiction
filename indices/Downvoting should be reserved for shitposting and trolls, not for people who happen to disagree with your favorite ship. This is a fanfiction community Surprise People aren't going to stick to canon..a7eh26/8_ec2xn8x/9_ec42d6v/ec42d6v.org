And by the way: you are actively pushing the agenda of denying people their right to choose what they want to read and openly state it. People like you are just as bad if not worse than people persecutiing LGBT, because you are actively pushing the balance the other way.

Let me spell it for you: fair society is when /neither/ LGBT /nor/ straight ppl are forced to do anything about their tastes and can like/dislike whatever and /speak about it openly/ as long as they are not attacking each other. Shoving gay pairings down people's throats by refusing them the right to ask otherwise is exactly the attitude that makes people that would otherwise be welcoming, become annoyed and rejecting your presence.

Oh, and just as a reminder: "Being gay is not a choice" and "you can't pray the gay away" Well, news flash: being straight also isn't. Which means there's a very valid reason straight people dislike slash pairings: gay sex/romance disgusts them and they can't do jack shit about it. Please respect others as you want them to respect you and stop denying them their rights
