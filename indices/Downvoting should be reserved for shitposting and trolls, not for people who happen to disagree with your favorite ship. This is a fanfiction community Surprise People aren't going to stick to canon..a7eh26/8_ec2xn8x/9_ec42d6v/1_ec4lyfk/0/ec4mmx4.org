No? It's a physiological response from our body that is being confused by the wrong signals sent to it from the wrong gender.

Why is reeducating gays impossible because "they are born this way" but somehow straight people can't have their bodies working to reject what they deem unnatural?

Do you seriously think straight people shitting on slash and refusing to read it is just because they are bigots?
