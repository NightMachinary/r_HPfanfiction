I'm not anti-slash in general but I've yet to see any good examples of it in the HP fandom. And I'll admit I don't look all that hard for it.

The vast majority that I've seen have a stupid pairing such as Harry/Draco or Harry/Voldemort. The ones with a plausible pairing haven't been very good.

Sometimes you get two characters being gay just for the sake of it. I was discussing this with someone else earlier, how suddenly Remus and Sirius announce they're gay, we get a scene where Harry is nauseatingly okay with it, then that's it except they occasionally pop up as tokens in the background.

But my main problem is the same as I have with /all/ "pairing" stories: they're not about magic any more. Time after time I see a story that's set in the Wizarding World but doesn't use any of it. A story that's Harry and Susan could easily be... Buffy and Xander, for instance.

Beyond that I don't care if the characters are screwing men, women, appropriately-consenting animals, rocks or plants with usefully shaped leaf structures.
