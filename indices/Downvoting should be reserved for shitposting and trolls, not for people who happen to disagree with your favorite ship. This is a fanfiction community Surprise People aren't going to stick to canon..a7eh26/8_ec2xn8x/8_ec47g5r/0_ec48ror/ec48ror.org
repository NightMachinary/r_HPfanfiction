All I can say is, it will depend on the AU and the individual author.

Slash, just like stories with a heterosexual pairing element, (which, on that note, includes most action, thriller, scifi, fantasy, comedy movies, as well as the vast majority of movies aimed at children) is just an element within a story rather than a genre in itself. Or at least, it should be. With that, I think we're on the same page.
