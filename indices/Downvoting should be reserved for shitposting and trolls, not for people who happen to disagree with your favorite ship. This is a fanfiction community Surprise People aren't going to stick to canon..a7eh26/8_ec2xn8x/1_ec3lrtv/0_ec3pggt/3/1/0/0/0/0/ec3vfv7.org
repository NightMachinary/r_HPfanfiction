It's not equal because we don't live in an equal world.

If gay people were coming in requesting 'no het' 'I don't want to see HETEROSEXUAL pairings' 'its fine to have them but they're gross', /if we lived in a world/ that had a history of discrimination againts heterosexual people and glorification of homosexual people as the one true way of being, then that would be equivalent. Straight people would rightfully feel excluded, don't you think?

  the term â€˜No Slash' shouldn't be changed as it wasn't made with the purpose of excluding a group of people but to filter or select fics that better suits their preferences

But it literally /is/ excluding a group of people, whether that's the intention or not. You could just as well say that a restaurant that serves freshly-killed meat only on every dish at the menu doesn't have the intention of excluding vegetarians. Or that a restaurant that sells only dishes containing pork doesn't intend to exclude Jewish patrons.

What if both of those restaurants in my example insisted that they don't /intend/ to exclude those groups, they're a restaurant for everyone! /Everyone/ should come in and use them. While knowing full well that those particular kinds of people will be excluded by definition. It's not playing fair, then. That's what this situation is. People saying NO SLASH, NO SLASH, NO SLASH and then turning around saying "but I'm not homophobic, gay people should feel welcome, it's just a /preference/!" are just like non-Jewish people saying Jews are welcome to come and dine with them at their all-pork restaurant that's open to all. At the very least, it's being wilfully obtuse.
