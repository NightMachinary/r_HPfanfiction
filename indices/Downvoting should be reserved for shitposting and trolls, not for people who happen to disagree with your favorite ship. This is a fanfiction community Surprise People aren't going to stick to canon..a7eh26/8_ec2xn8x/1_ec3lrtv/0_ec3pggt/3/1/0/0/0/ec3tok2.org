The problem with this statement is that the two examples you give are not equal. If you make a request you are allowed to state a preference, whether that be slash or nonslash. PM_ME_YOUR_SCI-FI didn't say you shouldn't allow gay pairings, nor that you have no right to force them as you put it. He said the term â€˜No Slash' shouldn't be changed as it wasn't made with the purpose of excluding a group of people but to filter or select fics that better suits their preferences. No-one was being homophobic. So the point does indeed cut both ways, but the result looks more like this:

So if a straight person has the right to insist on straight pairings then by extension a gay person has a right to insist on a gay pairing.
