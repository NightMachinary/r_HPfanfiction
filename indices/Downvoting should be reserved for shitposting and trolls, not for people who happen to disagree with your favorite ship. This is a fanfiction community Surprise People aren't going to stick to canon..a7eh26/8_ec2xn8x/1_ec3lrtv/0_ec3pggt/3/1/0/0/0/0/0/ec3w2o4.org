I see your point of view, and while it is fair, to a degree, I can't say that I agree with it. I think that basing your views on past history as a reason to criticize the people that live now is unfair. As for your metaphor about a restaurant it is again flawed. In the case of fanfiction, the restaurant would be every fanfiction written, and subgenres and preferences woud be different parts on the menu. We aren't talking about excluding fics from existing, we are talking about people searching for fics they want to read. In doing so they ask the people of this subreddit for help. They therefor have to be allowed to specify what fic or at least type of fic they are looking for, so that people have a chance to fulfill that request. The whole debate is somewhat redundant as if someone requests No Slash you can chose to ignore it, and recommend any fic you want, as it is a request not a rule. You might not gain a lot of friends that way, but at least you can satisfy your mind. People are allowed their own preferences. It is the very basic right you've participated in fighting for so gay marriage could be legalized.
