Well, thank you for a measured response. You are, of course, free to disagree and I see your perspective as well.

For what it's worth, I don't at all feel everyone should be forced to read fics with a main slash pairing, far from it. I just feel that stating it boldly in the title can be offputting and unwelcoming. I feel like a solution that made the community more welcoming to everyone andalso didn't make specific (e.g. avoiding certain pairings) requests difficult might be to make sure those clarifications were in the body of a post and not the title. Phrasing it from the off as 'I /do want/ X' rather than 'I want X and /I don't want to see that nasty Y while I'm at it/', when the two requests have basically the same goal.

Ultimately all I wanted to draw attention to in this discussion was subjective experience of the community and particularly the experience of LGBT readers, as one myself, to a community where there might not be that many of us (or, vocal members at least), so that non-LGBT readers could come to understand that POV.
