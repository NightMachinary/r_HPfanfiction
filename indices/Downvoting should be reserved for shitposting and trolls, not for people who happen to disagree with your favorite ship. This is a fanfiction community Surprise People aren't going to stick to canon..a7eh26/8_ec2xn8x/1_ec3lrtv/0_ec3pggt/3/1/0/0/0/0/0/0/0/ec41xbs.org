And this I can agree with. It should never be the conclusion, intentionally or otherwise, to put-off or make people feel unwelcome. That goal however has to be tempered by common sense and some “thick skin”. Sadly a lot of these kinds of debates often occur around topics that is in the end inconsequential, and could often be avoided by letting some things roll of their back, resulting in insults being flung about, and heated responses. Today's society has little room for real debates and instead focus on creating drama, sometimes too such degrees that many doesn't know how to properly argue and discuss a topic.
