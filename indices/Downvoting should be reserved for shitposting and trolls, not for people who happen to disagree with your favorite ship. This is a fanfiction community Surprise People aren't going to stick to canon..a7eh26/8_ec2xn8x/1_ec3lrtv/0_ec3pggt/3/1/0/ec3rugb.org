False equivalence. Those terms deny people their rights. “No slash” is just another preference, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that because those are hardwired into our brains.

No one is denying you your rights or insulting you. They are simply stating that they do not roll that way. You have zero right to force /your/ orientation upon others.
