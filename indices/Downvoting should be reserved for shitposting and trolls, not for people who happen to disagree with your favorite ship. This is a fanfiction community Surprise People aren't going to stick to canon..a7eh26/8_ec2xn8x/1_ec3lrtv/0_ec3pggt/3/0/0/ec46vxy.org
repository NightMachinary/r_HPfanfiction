I'd totally request "no PoC!Hermione" if it becomes any more widespread.

I don't mind Hermione being portrayed by a black actress (everyone who was upset about this was probably racist), but she'll always be canonically white for me. PoC!Hermione in fics is a huge red-flag for SJW bullshit and identity politics that I don't care to read about. "She's an activist about elf slavery because she's black herself!" is so ham-fisted, it makes me gag a little. Or "Of course she's black, her hair is bushy!". PLEASE! STAHP.
