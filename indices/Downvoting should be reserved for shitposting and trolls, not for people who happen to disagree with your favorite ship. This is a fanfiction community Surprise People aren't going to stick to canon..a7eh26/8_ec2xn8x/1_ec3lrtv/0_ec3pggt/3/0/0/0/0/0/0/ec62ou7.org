While this example depicts a rude author, I still don't see evidence of retconning. It is clear that JKR wrote Hermione as white and drew her as white several times. I would not be surprised that it never crossed Rowling's mind that fans would require this directly admitted, considering these drawings and considering her phrasing about black Hermione where she is supporting an alternative interpretation (not for the first time, she has also supported a black Neville interpretation). Do you recall the platform of this fan and Rowling's correspondance? Even if you remember it being on twitter vs another site, then I can more easily find it myself.
