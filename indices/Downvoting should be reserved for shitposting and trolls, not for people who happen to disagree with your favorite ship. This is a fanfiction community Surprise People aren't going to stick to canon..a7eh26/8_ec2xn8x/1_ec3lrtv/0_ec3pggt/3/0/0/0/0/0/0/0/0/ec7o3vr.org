I don't agree with calling that girl racist, if it happened the way you describe as I'm sure it did, but I do think it's a stretch to then say that because Rowling did not state what I believe everybody agrees is obvious, that she is trying to deceive us. Whether JKR is rude is another matter and not one I'm attempting to disagree with. The matter that concerns me is whether or not she is pretending she always wrote Hermione as black, and on that count, I do not see any evidence. If one understands books as interpretive works, and this is the general understanding in literary circles, then JKR's phrasing is unquestionably about an alternative interpretation. JKR's interaction with that fan does not make me question JKR's viewpoints on interpretation, which is the relevant part, even if I feel her reaction was rude.

I think the way fandoms see canon and how literary circles see interpretation will continue to clash for a long time. I don't think one is more right, but I also think fans do not always understand the history of the medium they love.
