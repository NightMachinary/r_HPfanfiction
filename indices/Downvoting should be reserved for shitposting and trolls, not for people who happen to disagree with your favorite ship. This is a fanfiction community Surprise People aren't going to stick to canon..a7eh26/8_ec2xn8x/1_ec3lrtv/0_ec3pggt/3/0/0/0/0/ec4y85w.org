I hear people say this a lot, but I can't find where JKR said this. I've seen her tweet. She showed support for an alternative interpretation than her own, which I thought was what everyone /wanted/ her to do, to have her stop enforcing her own interpretation onto people, but when she finally did, nobody took it for that, took her word as god, and assumed it was a retcon.
