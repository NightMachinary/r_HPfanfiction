I remember reading about it on some site or blog but it was 2 years ago. I'll write what I remember but since it was few years ago I can remember things wrongly.

Rowling wrote tweet where she quotes Hermione's description from book and says that she has never specified Hermione's skin color. Some girl responded to that tweet with scan of page from book where is written "Hermione's white face". It would be good if Rowling would just say that she forgot about that line and while she wrote Hermione as white she is totally cool with people imagining Hermione whatever race they want. But instead Rowling called that girl racist and fans harrased that fan until tweets were deleted. Then Rowling in interview said that some "racists" tweeted her that in book is sentence where she wrote that Hermione has white face.

Like I said, I am totally cool with black Hermione. But I'm not cool with author who label people as racist so she could pretend to being so great person that fights with racism instead of admitting that she wasn't progressive in the past.
