Yeah. Perhaps it's that the one tends to come hand in hand with the other?

I think there's just something evocative about the phrasing. Fair enough if people would prefer not to read slash pairings and say so politely. NO SLASH stated boldly is just, very reminiscent of segregation and signs like 'no blacks, no gays, no Irish'.

It leaves you as a part of the community feeling excluded. The person is literally saying, in their request, "I don't want my fantasy created world to have GAY people in it, I would find reading about that offputting", which... sometimes stings a little when you are a member of that community and this is a space you come to to relax and take part in fandom discourse, and you see that qualifier on multiple threads off the bat.

Anyway appreciate your reply and your comments through the thread. I might just be an old fogey rambling.

EDIT: I have to say on a meta level it feels ironic that my polite replies are being downvoted by readers.
