Eh, I don't really know what to tell you. I feel like it's silly to infer that not wanting to read slash pairings is "excluding" anyone, it's just a personal preference based on the individual-- and it's not because of wanting a fantasy world to not have gay people, it's just about wanting to be mentally stimulated by the main relationship in the story, assuming we're talking about shipping stories.

I don't really give a shit if there are m/m pairings present in the story as minor pairings-- that's all fine and cool for me tbh, though I would skip any m/m lemon scenes due to just not really being interested in reading them.

Your concerns in general are valid though. I hadn't realized that there was a legitimate presence of people who seem to at least be mildly homophobic in this community, so maybe some people who do the no slash thing *are* a cause for concern-- I just don't think that that on its own is enough to imply anything about a person or a community though.

When people start calling you an SJW for calling them out on anti-LGBT sounding rhetoric, that's something that can be a bit of a cause for concern :P
