Thanks. Essentially that's just what I hoped I might bring attention to by speaking. I feel like we do have a number of LGBT readers who just don't speak out, and as an older member of the fandom I don't really feel threatened by doing so. (Although some of the responses I've got have been a little rude!)

As I've said elsewhere in the thread I don't at all want to force people to read slash, it's just when you come into the sub of an evening and see boldly in the titles of maybe 5 threads 'no slash', it gives you feelings, tbh. It feels a bit like, the lady doth protest too much. Like if you went into a movie recommendation sub and all the titles were saying 'no gay movies!' (As an aside, as it happens, despite being on that spectrum, I also am not particularly into reading sex scenes.)

I guess I wanted to raise that there's a difference between 'no slash' meaning 'no main pairing' - which /is/ a preference, sure, and it meaning 'no gay characters at all, period.', because I feel - and this thread would suggest it too, as well as some recent discussions in the discussion threads - that some members are quite happy with the second definition being used, and I do find that to be unwelcoming to boldy and unashamedly state that. That starts to fall into territory of encroaching on what people can imagine of characters, gatekeeping etc. of sexualities and AUs, and stuff that I remember happening in the early days of the fandom but which it had felt like we'd solved and moved forward from.
