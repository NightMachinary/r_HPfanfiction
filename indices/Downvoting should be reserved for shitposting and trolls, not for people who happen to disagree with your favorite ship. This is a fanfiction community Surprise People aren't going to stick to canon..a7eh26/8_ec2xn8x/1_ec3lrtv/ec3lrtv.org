Honestly, I don't really give a shit what that other person is rambling on about because they genuinely seem to be expressing a homophobic sentiment-- but for me, when I request non-slash, it's not about trying to exclude people who like slash, it's just not my cup of tea for reading. Hell, I barely like reading from male POVs in general, Harry Potter being the one fandom where I put up with reading M/F because F/F hardly exists, and most of it is boring anyways.

I don't think "no slash" on its own is that bad, considering it's fine to not want to read slash. Those discussions about "x character would never be gay!" though are fucking annoying, because that's the entire point of fanfiction. People complaining about the existence of slash pairings are annoying rather than just people who don't care to read them.
