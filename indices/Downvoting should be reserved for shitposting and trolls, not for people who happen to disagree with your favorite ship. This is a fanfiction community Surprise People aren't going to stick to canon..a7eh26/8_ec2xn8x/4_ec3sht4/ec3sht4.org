You are a hypocrite then. You want people to accept what you like but apparently do not want people wanting something different? Isn't this a clear example of lack of societal progress?

I dislike reading from a male gay perspective, but don't mind them otherwise. I also like certain characters straight and others bi or gay. In what way does this harm you? Why should this offend you in any way? It shouldn't, you should learn to accept it the same way people accept that not everyone likes tragedy stories, or horror, etc...
