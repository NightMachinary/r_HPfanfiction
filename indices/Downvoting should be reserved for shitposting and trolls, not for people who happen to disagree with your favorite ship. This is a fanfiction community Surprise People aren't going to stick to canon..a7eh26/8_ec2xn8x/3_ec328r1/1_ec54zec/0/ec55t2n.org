Because I also don't care for Weasley pairings other than Ginny (be it for Harry or Hermione), Marauder pairings, Neville, Hogwarts professors and so on.

The only ones I'd read would be name-only backgrounds if they have some background in the Muggle world as well (so Half-Bloods or Muggleborn). And since they are basically non-existent anyway, I simply say "no slash" instead of listing the dozen or so background characters I don't mind.
