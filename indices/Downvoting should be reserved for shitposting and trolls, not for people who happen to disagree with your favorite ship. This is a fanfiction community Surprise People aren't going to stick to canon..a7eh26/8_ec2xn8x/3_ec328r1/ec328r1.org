Well, speaking from personal experience, I'd rather write "no slash" than something like

#+begin_quote
  "no Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Tom Riddle, Harry/Draco Malfoy, Harry/Lucius Malfoy, Harry/Rodolphus Lestrange, Harry/Rastaban Lestrange, Harry/Ron, Harry/Fred, Harry/George, Harry/Percy, Harry/Charlie, Harry/Bill, Harry/James, Harry/Sirius, Harry/Lupin, Harry/Peter, Harry/Neville, Harry/Dean, Harry/Colin, Harry/Dumbledore, Harry/Flitwick, Harry/Oliver Wood, Harry/Lee Jordan, Harry/Crabbe, Harry/Goyle, Harry/Theodore Nott, Harry/Nott Sr., Harry/Blase... "

I think you are getting the picture, right? And before you ask, I'm not interested in seeing Hermione shipped with any of them either, but since most of my requests are Harry-centric, there's no need for a second list. It's not about LGBT, it's simply the fact that I find exactly one male character interesting (Well, 2 if you count Edward Tonks, but only due to his canon love with Andromeda). If someone were to write an intriguing Harry/Justin FF, I'd read that. Or Hermione/Justin FF.
