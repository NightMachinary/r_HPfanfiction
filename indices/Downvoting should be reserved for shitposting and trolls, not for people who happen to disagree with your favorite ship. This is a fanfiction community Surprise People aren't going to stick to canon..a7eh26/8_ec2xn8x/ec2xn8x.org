I've said it before but, as a longterm fandom member and LGBT person, it has become disheartening to see a community that was previously a welcoming refuge for all become so dominated by requests for 'no slash' and discussions about how any of the characters that date opposite sex in canon being possibly LGBT, even in AUs, is weird and wrong and "why would anyone do that to them??" Feels like we've gone backward rather than progressed.
