I'm not gay myself so I don't see how I'm a victim in all of this nor how I ever could be just because I found his comment to be homophobic-- but I'm glad that my eyes are being opened to what other people are complaining about in this very thread.

There really are pathetic, hostile people lurking here I guess. I thought better of this community unfortunately, but apparently not.

Hilarious how I'm told I have a "victim complex" and someone else said "I'm what's wrong with society" over a pointed comment made as a reply to someone who poorly worded a post that made it sound extremely rude towards LGBT people in general. You don't even have the good grace to attack my post itself before moving onto personal attacks-- even if I found the other dude homophobic, I managed to prevent myself from just flat out insulting him.

I guess people prefer their one liner insults and low-substance posts instead, though.
