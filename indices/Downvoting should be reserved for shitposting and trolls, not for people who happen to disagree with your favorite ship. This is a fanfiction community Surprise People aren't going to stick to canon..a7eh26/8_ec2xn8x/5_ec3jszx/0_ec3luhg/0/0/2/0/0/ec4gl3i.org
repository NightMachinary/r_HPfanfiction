You have basically called everyone who doesn't like to read slash homophobic, and even had the balls to compare it with racial discrimination! Comparing /reading tastes/ to IRL racial discrimination!!

You have a problem, every single one of your comments here show nothing but you getting offended by the existence of heterosexuality! I assure you than disliking slash is not homophobic but a normal reaction for most heterosexual men or women, and you calling people here homophobic simply because they don't like slash doesn't show your community in any good light. Learn to live and let live.
