You're speaking like an SJW, and at the same time being judgmental regarding someone else's preferences. That's exquisitely ironic, don't you think?

You /did/ twist my words. You /did/ take what I said out of context - so far out of context that it looks very much like you went out of your way to find the most offensive possible interpretation of what I said.

I took care to be objective and clear in my responses, while you were swearing at me and attacking me personally - and are now openly insulting me and admitting that your feelings toward me (based on exactly /two/ interactions) are colouring your views on what I say. Am /I/ really the abrasive one?

Also offering clarification on what one says is the whole point of discussions - that way, people learn more about what they're talking about and about each other. If I had realized you needed that context from the off, I would have cheerfully provided it.
