If you think I'm just an SJW trying to twist your words just because you worded your comment poorly, then I have nothing really else to say to you.

Most of this seems like an excuse-- maybe that's colored by personal bias, given the fact that I already think you're an asshole, and your abrasive tone doesn't exactly help that.

Regardless, I'm not wasting any more time on this. Your comment was worded in an extremely condescending way. If you want to acknowledge that instead of just saying "well ACTUALLY I'm not homophobic at all because <gives a clarification that wasn't at all hinted at in original comment>" then be my guest, but you don't have to be an SJW to get annoyed at people who take that sort of tone(figuratively speaking, of course, since obviously words on a website don't have a literal tone).
