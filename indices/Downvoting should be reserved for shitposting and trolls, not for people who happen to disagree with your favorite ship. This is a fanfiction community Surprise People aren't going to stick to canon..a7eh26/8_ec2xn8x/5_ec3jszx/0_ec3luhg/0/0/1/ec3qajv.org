  If you don't see how your first paragraph is a condescending tangent that can be taken as rude against anyone who identifies as LGBT, I don't know what to tell you.
#+end_quote

Does anyone identify as an artificial and ever-expanding blanket term? In this day and age, surely saying "I'm gay", "I'm bi", or whatever else, is not only acceptable - but preferable? Yes, I found "I'm an LGBT person" irksome. I am not going to apologize for that, nor for having atriculated it. I will, however, apologize that you find my preference for openness so hurtful - insofar as it's /my/ place to apologize for /your/ feelings.

  Finding gay pairings "offputting" is also a homophobic dig. I don't want to read slash because I'm not interested in it, not because it's "offputting" or evokes any negative emotion in me by acknowledging its existence.
#+end_quote

What I want to read and what I don't want to read does not make me homophobic. I shall not be called a homophobe for finding certain styles or genres of writing offputting or distasteful. I shall not be held accountable for my preferences. If you have a problem with that, then it's exactly that - /your/ problem.

It's no stretch of my imagination to believe that this logic would have me, if I didn't find black people physically attractive, branded a racist - or, if I didn't find members of both genders attractive, branded a sexist.

  This speaks for itself. *You're literally saying that queerness and the discussion of it makes you uncomfortable*, and saying that most people are uncomfortable with it as well.
#+end_quote

You might want to look up the meaning of "literally" some time. My OED has /in a literal way or sense/, and for "literal", /representing the exact words of the original text/. Just to be clear, I will /not/ have my words twisted by some SJW who wants to make someone look like an ass.

What I meant - and what I /said/ - is that people who are not queer (or LGBT, if you prefer) are quite likely to be uncomfortable when exposed to /some/ aspects of that culture. Some people are made uncomfortable by things that are outside of their tastes; this includes slash fiction, which is not mainstream and is thus the definition of a niche taste. If a lot of people are specifically requesting "no slash", then it's self-evident that a high proportion of people /are/ uncomfortable with slash fiction, or who simply don't find it interesting enough to want it to be included in what they read. That being the case, /why/ is it offensive that those people include "no slash" in their requests?

Note: I also never said that the discussion or queerness makes me uncomfortable. It does not. I have discussed it at great /length/, myself. In fact, as a bisexual, I've done much more than discuss it.

  Plus random snide implications like constantly putting quotes around LGBT ("LGBT" from you makes it sound condescending as fuck, given the context of your post)
#+end_quote

The term, as used in this context as a replacement for saying what you actually are, is pathetic. Why would you give your identity as LGBT when you're at liberty - and encouraged by society - to say what you are? LGBT is not itself an identity. It's a blanket term covering a myriad identities. I put it in quotes in that comment because I wanted it to be clear that I was using the other commenter's term, not my own.
