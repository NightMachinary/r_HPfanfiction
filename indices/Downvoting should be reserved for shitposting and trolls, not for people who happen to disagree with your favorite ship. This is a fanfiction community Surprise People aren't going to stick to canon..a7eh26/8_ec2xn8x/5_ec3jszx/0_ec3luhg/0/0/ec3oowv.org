If you don't see how your first paragraph is a condescending tangent that can be taken as rude against anyone who identifies as LGBT, I don't know what to tell you.

They didn't just mention it out of nowhere, it's directly relevant to the conversation.

  some of us acutally find slash offputting
#+end_quote

Finding gay pairings "offputting" is also a homophobic dig. I don't want to read slash because I'm not interested in it, not because it's "offputting" or evokes any negative emotion in me by acknowledging its existence.

#+begin_quote
  Queerness might be more openly talked about now, but it's still not mainstream, and people who are in mainstream culture don't need to be subject to whatever of it might make them uncomfortable.
#+end_quote

This speaks for itself. You're literally saying that queerness and the discussion of it makes you uncomfortable, and saying that most people are uncomfortable with it as well.

Plus random snide implications like constantly putting quotes around LGBT ("LGBT" from you makes it sound condescending as fuck, given the context of your post)

Really, the only agreeable and non-rude thing you said was your last paragraph. Otherwise, you're deluding yourself if you think you made that post without the intention of being degrading/condescending to LGBT folks.

Oh, my bad, I forgot that people like you aren't homophobic because "You're not scared of gay people" though. Sorry about that /s
