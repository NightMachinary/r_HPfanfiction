Your point coulda been made without the vague homophobic digs. Or maybe it couldn't, honestly, if this dumpster fire of a comment is actually representative of your views-- which would be pretty disgusting.

No idea how someone actually upvoted this when it's literally condescending as fuck towards people who identify as LGBT. I don't read slash either, as I outlined in my comment to the person you replied to, but phrasing it like this and giving this reasoning is just an absolute joke.
