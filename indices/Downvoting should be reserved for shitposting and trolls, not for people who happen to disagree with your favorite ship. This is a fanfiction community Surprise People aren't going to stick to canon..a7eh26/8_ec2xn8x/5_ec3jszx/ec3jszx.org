Aaah pride. So proud, your identity is "LGBT person". You are what you are but you want to get under a banner too. /Cor te benedic/, that's cute. What's next, "person of legabitry"?

Thing is that some of us acutally find slash offputting. Even those of us who are also "LGBT people" like me (but seriously, I'm bi, and wouldn't appreciate being called "LGBT" by anyone) find it offputting and distasteful.

In this era of freedom, we should retain the freedom to not be exposed to things we don't want to see, and the freedom to have and express an opinion - just as much as you have the freedom to read slash, just as much as you have the freedom to be "LGBT".

The thing is that most people don't want to see it, and if they /do/ see it they are going to react by saying 'please, no more,' aren't they? Queerness might be more openly talked about now, but it's still not mainstream, and people who /are/ in mainstream culture don't need to be subject to whatever of it might make them uncomfortable.

So if someone's writing a request for a story but they don't want to see slash, /why/ is it disheartening to you for them to request not to see it? They're only stating a preference - the same as if you requested /all/ slash.
