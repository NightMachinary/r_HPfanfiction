Hmm, for me personally the main problem there is that 90% of HP slash involves either Malfoy, Snape, or Voldemort, all of whom I dislike (as people, not as story characters) far too much to actively ship them with anybody.

I can get behind some good Remus/Sirius or Harry/Cedric, but there aren't all that many of those in comparison.
