I didn't actually tell anyone what to do, just sent a reminder that you /shouldn't/. And I'm not sure I /am/ spitting into the wind. 171 comments (most of who agree) and 175 upvotes makes it one of the more popular threads in this subreddit. /Obviously/ that's not indicative of quality or whether or not it will /work/, but a lot of people /are/ in agreement, similar to yourself.
