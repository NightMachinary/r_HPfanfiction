  pointless to argue with LGBT social justice warriors

  people don't like slash in this sub

Look. Like, I understand you didn't get the response you were hoping for. And I do /NOT/ agree with the first poster in your image. But, honestly, those two statements are not mutually exclusive.

There's no reason to downvote every thread which requests slash, just the same as there's no reason to downvote every thread which requests that this is /no slash/. "Arguing with LGBT Social Justice Warriors" is not the same as /requesting/ to read a story with slash and I fail to see why we would push slash out of this sub.
