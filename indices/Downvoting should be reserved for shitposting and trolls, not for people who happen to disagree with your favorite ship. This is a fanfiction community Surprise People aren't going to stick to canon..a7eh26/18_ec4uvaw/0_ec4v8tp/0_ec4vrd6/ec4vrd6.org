I never said we should push slash out of this sub. Just that people like the one from the screen above come off as pushy and poison the relationship between slash and no slash communities existing on this sub by calling "no slash" posters homophobic.

I barely even notice slash requests here because I never enter those I and certainly never bash those, it's when I am confronted with people like above I start arguing.

I am certainly against downvoting slash into oblivion, both parties can perfectly live together on this sub as long as slurs aren't thrown around pointlessly.
