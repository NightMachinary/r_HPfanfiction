Oh, well then you'll find me agreeing with you. Sorry, perhaps I misinterpreted your "don't like slash in this sub" as a kind of all-encompassing thing. So long as the requests are treated fairly (though, understandably, non-slash requests are inevitably going to be more popular), I have no problems.
