Lol! So it's called a Family Like None Other, the third book in the series.

But you should know.. It's not complete. And it kind of looks like Aspen may be done with it, it hasn't updated in... Oh. Three years. That long already, I guess.

Anyway, it's still pretty good, for what's there. Also, I'm a super lurker with no idea of the proper format for posting links so, I'll just give you this one?
