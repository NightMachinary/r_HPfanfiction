I would enjoy it if death was some kind of incomprehensible alien consciousness (like in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)]]), but I've never seen that before.

Or if death is like, a small girl. Very polite. No overly cheery stuff, just like "hi harry. youre my dad now. *grabs harry's hand*"

Or if he's Jeff Goldblum.
