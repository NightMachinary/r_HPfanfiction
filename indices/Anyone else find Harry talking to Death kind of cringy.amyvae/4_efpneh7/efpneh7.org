I like "Master of Death" stories, but I prefer that there not be a personification of Death that Harry talks to. If the story does contain a Death Personified, then it should be something so far beyond human that its presence is innately unsettling, not chummy. Stories with a chatty Death don't appeal to me, maybe because that's not my kind of humor, but there are a few fics I like in which Death is a rarely appearing side character, and it makes sense in context.
