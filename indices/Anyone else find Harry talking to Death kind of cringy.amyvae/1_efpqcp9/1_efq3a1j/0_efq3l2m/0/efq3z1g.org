  Is it then so strange to accept that something incomprehensible may be displayed in some familiar fashion?

You seem to have missed my point. Harry's subconscious providing something that he's familiar with to represent Death isn't the weird part. The weird part is that it's Dumbledore.

Why not a Dementor, or Voldemort, or the Grim Reaper, or any number of other things?
