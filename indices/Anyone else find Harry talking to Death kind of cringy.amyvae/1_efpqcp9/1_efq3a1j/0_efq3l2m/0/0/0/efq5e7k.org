Accepting death isn't the same as being comforted by it. Not by a long shot. He accepted that he was going to go walk up to Voldemort, but Harry doesn't find him comforting.

It makes far more sense to me that Harry would project an image that he feels most closely represents Death. Even if it's not something horrible and scary, it's not going to be something /good/.
