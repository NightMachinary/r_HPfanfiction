  "Sorry sir." Harry interrupted the old headmaster, the manipulative bastard whom he couldn't help but love as a grandfather of sorts. "I need to derail a train."

  [...]

  A wind blew through the station, rattling windows heavily.

  "It appears as if you just missed them." Albus said, eyes still twinkling merrily.

  The wind hissed and twisted voicelessly at his words.

  "Oh yes, they were never very good with rules." Albus agreed with a fond expression.

  The windows rattled, and the building groaned underneath the weight of the wind.

  "Well, most governments work with some form of democracy nowadays." Albus pointed out.

  The wind retreated in a huff of disapproval.

  Albus smiled. "Perhaps so, but perhaps even such things are meant to change in time."

  A rattling sound traveled along the rails, causing both Albus and the wind to pause.

  "I do hope that train was insured." Albus mused.

  The wind pulled at the windows making the concrete groan as it tried to express its voiceless frustration at the chaos that the trio had already managed to cause in its orderly existence.

  Albus most carefully did /not/ laugh at the sound of it.

  The next great adventure, indeed.
