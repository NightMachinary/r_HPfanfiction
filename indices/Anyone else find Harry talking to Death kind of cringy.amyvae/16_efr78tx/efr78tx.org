I don't mind if they do something special with it. Either make death part of an alien kind of bureaucracy and Harry doesn't fit in the red tape of all the regulations for some reason, or make Death not appear as a person but as an artifact that harry needs to figure out....

Personally, I always saw the master of death thing as in de MoD not being in any more control over death as entity or power, but having power of his own death, falling outside the power of death. It fits the best. Though I don't mind an new connection with soul magics or some such.
