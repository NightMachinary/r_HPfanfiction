Well Death is a cosmic entity in Marvel so its not like the idea is wacky. The use of Death as a character is usually shitty in most HP stories though. It's an execution thing, not the idea itself. I'm drafting an Avengers crossover where Harry meets death at the end of DH, but it turns out the whole MoD thing is more propaganda than fact. Death should be shown as mysterious, foreboding yet impartial, incomprehensible in some ways and yet be understood as necessary. That's the point of the Hallows story, anyway. It's what I'm trying to do.
