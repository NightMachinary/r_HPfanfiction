Harry would probably be an emitter. His nen ability would allow him to force a opponent to play a game. The game would challenge both players to catch a small flying gold ball. Who ever catches it first sets the opponent into a state of Zetsu for a duration. During the game both players are unable to manifest additional Hatsu.
