I've rescinded a bad chapter after reviewers called me on it, and rewrote it entirely. Thanked the reviewers for it in an author's note. If I make a significant change in a prior chapter, I'll mention it in an author's note to let continuing readers know of it.

In the end, your story will be re-read and read anew, so if you feel a change is needed, you should put it in. The great/awful thing about fanfiction is that the readers are the final editorial oversight.
