Haven't had that happen yet. But I would think so, yes - internal consistency is important to me. However, I would likely look for a way to correct a mistake that doesn't require rewriting the plot. Once I had Nagini kill Snape despite Nagini having been killed earlier in the story. I fixed that - but it didn't lead to Snape surviving; since he was facing Voldemort at the time anyway, he simply got killed in a different way.
