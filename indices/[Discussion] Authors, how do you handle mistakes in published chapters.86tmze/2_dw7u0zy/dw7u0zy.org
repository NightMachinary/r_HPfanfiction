I do finish stories before I start posting, so hopefully any major plot points have already been sorted out. Characterisation and interpretation is more subjective but if I think the commenter has a point I might well make some changes. If a mistake is pointed out and it's definitely a mistake (an inconsistency or canon error, something like that) I go and fix it asap. Frankly I'd be embarrassed to leave it.
