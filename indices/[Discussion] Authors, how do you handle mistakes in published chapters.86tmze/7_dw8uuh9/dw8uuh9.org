If it's just typos, I usually won't bother unless it's something that significantly detracts from the clarity of the chapter.

#+begin_quote
  in a new chapter something happens that contradicts earlier chapters;
#+end_quote

When this has happened, it's usually minor enough that I can do a quick fix by changing a few words. It might be a bit clumsy, but I'll do a small edit.

#+begin_quote
  or your character does something that look alright on the first sight, but after publishing you or some reviewer makes a note that it OOC and move the character where you don't want;
#+end_quote

I think there's been twice that this has been serious enough for me to go back and do a major rewrite. There have been times when I've been called out on OOC actions, and I had to change it. But most of the time, I have a pretty good handle on where I want the characters to go. Thus:

#+begin_quote
  or readers see in the plot or characters something different from what you wanted to show;
#+end_quote

If the reviews are angry about the direction I took the plot or see a character more negatively than I intended, I'll usually defend my position in an Author's Note, and I will often change future chapters to mitigate the problem. I rarely see the need to change published chapters, though.
