Ahaha okay sothis is the dilemma that's been bothering me for months. The first 4 chapters of our fic, the first one is fine (my-cowriter did a wonderful job) but the second and third, I hadn't written the characters or fic in general in the universe in a long time and they stick out like sore thumbs. We got our groove back from around 4 or 5, but whenever I go back to reread (it's like 200k, when you have that much, rereading is essential for canon keeping) but I constantly wonder if we should go back and rewrite those couple of chapters now we're both more comfortable because honestly I'm not proud of them at all.
