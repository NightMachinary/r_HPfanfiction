Barring small typos I find while re-reading chapters, my personal rule is not to fix mistakes. The keyword there is personal; I'm a perfectionist, and if I allowed myself to go back and constantly tweak already published chapters, I'd never get anything new done. It's also a personal growth thing, learning to accept my mistakes and move on.

That said, the exception I allow is the first chapter of my fic, Girl in Red. It's the first impression readers have, so I want it to be good.

My beta catches most of the crap I try and pass off as "making perfect sense in my head", and I keep a comfortable pad so I have some wiggle room when I'm writing something that turns out didn't work.

I don't get many reviews, so I can't speak on that topic.

Ultimately, the advice I will give is this: try to incorporate the changes into your story, if at all possible. Trying to figure out why one of your characters acted strangely may help stimulate your creativity, or it may frustrate you to no end. Either way, I think internal consistency is important. Readers lose part of their connection with a character if established events around that character constantly change (unless that change itself is part of the story).
