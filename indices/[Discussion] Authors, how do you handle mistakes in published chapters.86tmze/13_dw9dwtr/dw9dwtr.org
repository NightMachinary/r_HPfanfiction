In the first installment of my "A World Unseen" series (Vol I and Vol II), I came up with some worldbuilding details after the fact, which I had brought up in Vol II, with a bit of fridge brilliance in that the characters in Vol I already knew all that, but the character to whom the details are explained to in Vol II is a muggleborn going to Diagon Alley for the first time, and thus doesn't know the details.
