In the first chapter, I'll usually put up an author's note encouraging people to send in mistakes they see, whether it's just spelling mistakes, or even plot holes. I'll go back and edit all the grammar mistakes. I don't usually use a beta, so outside eyes always help. But for bigger stuff, it is what it is. I'm not going to rework 5k words on the whim of a reader, but if it's a quick fix, I'll at least think about it. Once the story is complete, I usually don't go back and do anything.
