Well, in the plot I have written, the Minister (Scrimgeour) uses his executive powers to restructure the DMLE, dissolves the "ineffective" Auror corps and integrates them into the Hit Wizards. That would be sacking the local authorities and sending in the federal/special forces. Simultaneously, he makes some grand announcement, asking the Wizengamot to codify those changes after the winter break, since he is not a wannabe dictator but someone driven to use drastic measures in the face of a dire threat.

He then gives them the order to "clean house" and take care of all opposing the Ministry. One of the non-Death Eater suspects is under observation and bumps into Harry. The suspect is prying for some information and Harry, seeing that he is not dealing with a Death Eater, relaxes and is therefore caught with his pants down when the Hit Wizards arrive. They find a powerful, dark artefact on the suspect and after watching the interaction from a distance it looks like Harry wanted to buy it. To use an analogue, they are taking down a large-scale drug operation and someone caught on scene is claiming that he did not want to buy the briefcase full of Columbian White.

One of the Hit Wizards is from the Nott family, known supporters of Voldemort. She sees an opportunity to do something about Harry Potter and putting him into Azkaban means putting him on a silver plate for Voldemort. She presents her interpretation of the situation to her partner (Johnson) and since the evidence is there, he takes the word of his partner over the word of a suspect, stating that the court will sort that out. He does not understand Harry's reluctance since the Black case is not on his mind and Johnson is kinda the naive, good-meaning cop. Meanwhile Nott would be a corrupt cop abusing his power to help her mobster boss take care of an enemy.

Is that legal or good? Hell no. But, that's life and there is a canon precedent which paints that kind of scenario as possible.
