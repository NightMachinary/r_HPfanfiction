Well, I might be biased due to cop shows here, but I can totally see a police officer telling a suspect that they will end up in prison since all evidence makes them look guilty. By handing over solid evidence and the suspect they are basically throwing people into prison, where they await trial.

And history is full of services which were police, judge, Jury and executioner. The NKVD, the Gestapo and the KGB, just to name a few. While the Hot Wizards don't have the authority to just take people to the next corner and put them im front of a firing squad, they aren't simply the town police either.
