Considering that I had Slughorn brutally robbed and murdered in his office and a couple reviewers concluded that he drank the poisoned mead, I think that's the issue. People are expecting the average, trope filled fanfic and I'm writing a story unlike any I've seen in this fandom (that's why I'm writing it in the first place), there seems to be a disparity between expectations and writing because I'm doing something different than the usual fare.
