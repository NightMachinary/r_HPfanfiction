I see what you are talking about.

And you raised an interesting case. Below I'm not asking about your plot, but about how you're handling logic of your reviewers.

Using common sense and parallels with the real world we can conclude that the Hit Wizards are just special forces. They can't make decisions about sending a person to prison. In case of Sirius all decisions were made on the level of the Minister (PoA) or head of the DMLE.

How are you dealing with reasons like this one, which appeals to appropriate analogues from real world?
