  or your character does something that look alright on the first sight, but after publishing you or some reviewer makes a note that it OOC and move the character where you don't want

If you note that it is wrong, change it. But don't go change stuff just because some readers are bitching about it. In the recent chapter of "Dawn of Darkness", I had Harry caught at the wrong time at the wrong place and a pair of Hit Wizards, who promptly assume he is guilty and talk about getting him on a fast track to Azkaban. More than one reviewer pointed out that they cannot do that or that it was wrong.

Hit Wizards were the ones who arrested Sirius Black despite him being the best friend of the Potters just because he looked kinda guilty. You know, the guy who unjustly spent a decade in Azkaban. I am not going to change that part because people expect "the bad guys" to act fair.
