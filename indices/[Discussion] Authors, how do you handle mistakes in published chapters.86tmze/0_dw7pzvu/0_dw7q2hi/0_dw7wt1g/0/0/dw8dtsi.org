Don't make those huge mistakes in the first place. The biggest change I have ever made is cutting a somewhat redundant dialogue part from 1.2k words down to 300, but even that did not really "change" the story much, it just increased readability and removed a few somewhat obvious insights about Harry's thoughts.

I do a lot of edits to my works, but 95% of them are either fixing the odd typo here and there or small changes to wording, when I had an idea after waking up. For all intents and purposes, it is still the same story.

And I think that updating your stories as you get better at writing is quintessential. When I took a look at my first one-shot after publishing 30k words, I was shocked how bad it was. I could do better so I fixed it because it was not the written to the best of my increased abilities. Same goes for the early chapters of my other stories. While the content did not change much, they are now far more polished and yet, I'm sure that I will revamp them again at some point.
