Does it matter? You have to think about the bigger picture. When I release a chapter, it gets around 800-1000 views on the first day. If I make a change, the next few thousand readers will definitly read the reworked version and that number is significantly larger. Worst case scenario, delete the chapter and reupload if you really made significant changes (like someone not dying or stuff of similar magnitude).

As for fixing typos or changing minor stuff (how a room looks). Just change it, no one will remember the details and if it is really necessary, drop a reference to the updated version in the next chapter and the three people who remember it differently will go back, see that it is not like they remembered and shrug it off.
