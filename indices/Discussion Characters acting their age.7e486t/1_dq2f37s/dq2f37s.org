There's also a big difference though between teenagers not acting like teenagers and teenagers not acting like literally any normal person would. I recently dropped a fic for the exact reason that it seemed like the author had never heard a teenager speak before, but that was less because they sounded like adults and more because it was obvious the trying to be edgy teenage author thought that this was what cool, mature young adults sounded like and the result was stuff literally no one would ever say and me trying not to cringe as I read it before giving up.
