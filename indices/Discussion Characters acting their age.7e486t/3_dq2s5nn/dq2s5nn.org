I think there is a huge difference between what you see in the books (which is certainly a bit more that you expect of kids at their age) and what you see in some fanfictions, which manages to go from 'stretching belief', skipping 'that isn't even possible' right into 'ok I'm uncomfortable now'. Like any romance fic set during their 11th year.

And honestly, having your characters be more mature than cannon is more of a 'you are out of character' problem than anything else.

And I still maintain that Hogwarts chemically castrates all its kids through Pumpkin Juice. /cough cough/ The exact effects of doing that to a school of kids left the the imagination of the readers (and helps cover up other problems)
