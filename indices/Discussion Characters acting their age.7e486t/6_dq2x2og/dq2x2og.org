We do need to keep in mind that wizarding world teens are not exactly going to be comparable to muggle world teens (OUR WORLD) to begin with. There should be no reason they would act "exactly" how we would. The Wizarding world is a vastly different environment to be growing up in and you are literally carrying around what amounts to a possible weapon and dealing with an entirely different cultural environment.

So lets not think of Wizarding 11-16 year olds as being comparable to muggle 11-16 year olds (coming from a muggle world that we, as readers, live in).
