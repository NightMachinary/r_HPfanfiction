Just think about the time period the wizard world is still stuck in, Basically the 12th or 13th century for most of it. It makes an unfortunate amount of sense to have arranged marriages, marriage contracts, and kids acting much more mature than their modern day counterparts. In that time period there were "Men" cutting down trees, building log cabins or other such country houses, raising some crops and +getting+ looking for a wife before they turned 16. That doesn't make them more... experienced, just...they had to grow up faster in that society.

That being said, its yet another reason to look down on the naive muggleborns who have no idea how the world "really works" and are still children well into their mid teens.
