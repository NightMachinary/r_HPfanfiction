It's... /not/ stuck in the 13th century, though. For one thing, there's no opressive clergy breathing down everyone's neck. It's a rather liberal society (Death Eaters notwithstanding, and Beings are another issue entirely; let's focus on the hupmans), life expectancy is centuries ahead of the muggle one, wizards scarcely have to truly a work a day in their life anyway because magic, there's no nobility (the Wizengamot as an inherited body of lords is pure fanon; Lucius Malfoy himself is never given a title in the books) even if the purebloods wish there was, it's a democracy...

You only get the /feeling/ of a medieval world for cosmetic reasons, essentially; the wizarding world's fashion sense seems medieval to the muggle eye, and because magic can repair most things most buildings are really old.
