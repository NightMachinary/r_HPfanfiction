I already posted here once about how you can not compare 11-16 year old muggles to wizards, but I want to bring up another point that has been somewhat glossed over.

The average life expectancy for Wizardkind in the 1990's was just over 135 years of age. However we also know that many Witches/Wizards can reach much higher with Madam Marchbanks supposedly nearing 200, and Dumbledore at 150 and still going strong. If you do the scaling math... this means that a 70-year-old witch/wizard is the equivalent of a 40-year-old muggle. 100 would be 60. And so on.

This brings up interesting aspects because it means that Witches/Wizards are expected to grow up extremely fast (partially due to the culture and partially due to the fact they wield a weapon), but then once they hit their late teens the aging is DRAMATICALLY slowed. That is to say, children are children from 0-10 or so, then develop extremely quickly from 11-15, and then are basically adults at 16+ and just finishing their school training (remember you can graduate with just OWLs).

But than because of the length of life, you have to delay what amounts to "middle age" and other such "tags" we put on life periods as muggles. Effectively, there is much less difference between a 40-year-old and an 18-year-old wizard, than there would be between the same 2 aged muggles.

So in leymans terms... basically think of a 40 or even 50 year old wizard/witch as still a "young adult".
