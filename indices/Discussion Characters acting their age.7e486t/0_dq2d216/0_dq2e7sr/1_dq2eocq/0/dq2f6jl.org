Well obviously thats fine then, in canon it seemed like it was kind of hinted that Luna was suffering from some form of mental illness(maybe she is autistic?).

What I was talking about was characters that are 11 being portrayed as 5 years old in the way they throw tantrums, act all "cutesy" and use very childish language.
