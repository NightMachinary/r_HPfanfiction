You just reminded me of a really weird scene of a fic that I read, in it Lily was alive and raised fem!Harry and she put her shoes on even though fem!Harry was already eleven and the way she was described hiding behind Lily was also weird, because it was written like a six year would hide behind their mum. ItÂ´s generally worse the younger the characters are, especially in the 1 to 6 age range. Though it is more obvious to me because I see my niece and nephew at least twice a week since they were born.
