This is the exact thing I was talking about, you would have to really 'baby' an 11 year old to get them to the point where they have to hide behind their parent when meeting strangers.

You also see a lot of this kind of thing in fics that feature angst/hurt/comfort, Harry usually breaks down and devolves into a literal man child. it's really creepy.
