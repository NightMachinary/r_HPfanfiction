This.

Harry, Hermione and Ron were way ahead of the curve in canon. Heck even some of the other characters like Draco were ahead of the curve too. I mean in first year Draco had the foresight to trick Harry and Ron into going out after curfew. Thats pretty good planning for an 11 year old kid.

Personally I think that authors that try to write 11 year olds actually make them act like toddlers which is kind of creepy to see. I would honestly rather see a character written to be a bit more mature than see a character written to be immature, it makes them seem mentally handicapped.
