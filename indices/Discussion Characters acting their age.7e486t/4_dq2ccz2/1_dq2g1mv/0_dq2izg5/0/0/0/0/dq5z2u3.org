Considering people have called my story "the crackiest of crack fics" and "the next Seventh Horcrux, but with more gingers" everything in that story is played for laughs. The Death Eaters being mostly incompetent ninnies (save for all the "spies" that end up joining them) is a running gag, as is Voldemort being essentially a saturday morning cartoon villain who comes up with elaborate and zany schemes that always fail. However, it's also poking fun at how Voldemort comes up with bonkers plans in cannon (seriously the whole triwizard thing as well as the stealing the stone one is something Emperor Pilaf would be proud of) and how Harry and Co manage to keep foiling the death eaters and voldemort despite being kids.
