/Scene: Gryffindor common room. The place is a mess, as a result of a celebration that every Gryffindor would swear never to mention for the next twenty years. Harry, and the twins are snuggled together with not a hair on their heads, while Ron lies on the floor only in a pair of boxers next to a sleeping camel. Harry and Ron begin to stir, only to gradually take note of the equally groggy camel./

"Harry... please tell me that the camel beside me is actually a witch in her animagus form?"

"If I said yes, would that make you feel better?"

/Ron takes a moment to process an answer./

"I wish it would."
