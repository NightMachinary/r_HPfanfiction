Truer words have never been spoken.

Ive always been a notorious reader and I started reading fanfic in what, 06? I would read fanfic on my computer after school everyday, so I would still read actual books on school. I didnt get a smart phone until 2013 and now i exclusively only read fanfic.

And that reason is because I have over 200 fics in my backlog and I add more everyday.
