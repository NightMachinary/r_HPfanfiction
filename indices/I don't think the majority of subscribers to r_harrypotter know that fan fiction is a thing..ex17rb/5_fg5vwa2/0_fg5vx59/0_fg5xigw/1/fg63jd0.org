  All I can think of are the plot holes and the crappy world building canon has. My sister gets really annoyed when I point out those things

I'm sorry, but I agree with your sister. It's supposed to be entertaining, not logical. I just don't understand the authors that have whole essays on their pages about how much canon sucks. Crappy world-building? I am genuinely curious about what people would consider "not-crappy world-building"? (And no easy answers like Lord of the Rings).

Sod that- *I love canon.* Without canon none of us would be here.
