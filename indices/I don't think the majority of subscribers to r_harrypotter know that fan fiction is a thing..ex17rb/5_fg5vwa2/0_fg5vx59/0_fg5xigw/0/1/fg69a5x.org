Rowling has created a very interesting world, but she left many holes. The map of the British Isles hasn't really changed that much in the past three centuries (Irish independence is pretty much the only change). But as soon as you cross the Rhine, her world building stops working. And if you cross the Oder and Danube, it becomes a big clusterfuck.
