Sort of agree, I think the completely canon divergent ones are really where I got hooked though -- it was the snape chronicles that made me be like "ohhhhh not all of this is kinda weird and /surprised pikachu/ are Harry and snape fucking?!" But then it was prince of the dark kingdom where I was like "oh shit some of this is amazingly creative and holy shit these are seven (almost) whole new books!" Wouldn't want to leave those out, but that's what the categories are for right?
