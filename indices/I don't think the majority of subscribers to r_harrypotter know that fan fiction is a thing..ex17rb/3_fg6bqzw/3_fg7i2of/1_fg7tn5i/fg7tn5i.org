I don't think only canon-compliant would be necessary though, personally I wanted things off canon when I started reading fanfiction. I wanted to be surprised by how writers took the characters and the world I love and make something completely new and interesting, but still make it believable. But that's what the categories would be for, to easily make out what you would want to read and what you would not want to read.
