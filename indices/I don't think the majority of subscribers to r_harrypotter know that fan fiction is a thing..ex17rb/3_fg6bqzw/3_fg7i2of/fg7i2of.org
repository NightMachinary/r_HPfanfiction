For a "getting started with fanfiction" list, I think you'd want to emphasise canon-compliant stories or at least close to canon characterisation, and being complete is pretty important.

Also, you probably don't want to shake up the pairings all that much for someone's first time; some new-to-fanfiction readers might be excited to find a Harmony fic, but Harry/Bellatrix or Hermione/Snape is probably best left for those with more experience.

The most important thing would be clear labeling, though. People who don't really know what's out there or what to expect need to know what's in a story before they can be expected to take the time for it.
