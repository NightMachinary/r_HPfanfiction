There should be a "Getting started reading fanfiction" thread over here, with safe, truly good options with categories of ratings, au/non au, era, pairings, first war/second war/after war/no wars, etc, with the option of a long/medium/short fic for every category. Make it extremely easy for someone who's new to fanfiction to get into it and explore, but also let the experienced readers discover new things they might never have thought of wanting to read. There could be a sort of contest over here where we vote on which fics should represent a category and so on.
