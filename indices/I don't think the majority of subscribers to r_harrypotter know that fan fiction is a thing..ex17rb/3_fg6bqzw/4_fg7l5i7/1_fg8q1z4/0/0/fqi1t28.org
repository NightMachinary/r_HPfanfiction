If you're still looking for somewhere to start, I recommend this author:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall]]

She writes from the PoV of Prof. McGonagall and has so far gone up to the end of PoA. The last chapter where she shows the orchestration of the time turner events from the PoV of Dumbledore/McGonagall is worth the read alone.

She also has some other fun short stories, all following canon.
