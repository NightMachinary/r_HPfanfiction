wait I totally thought you were going the opposite direction with this argument.

Young people know fandom and fanfic! You have books like fangirl, casual mentions in other media, etc. Twitter alone! I will totally recognize that the OG fans lead the charge with things like LJ, but ao3 involves (/has in the past) so many teens! I always thought the harrypotter subreddit was full of older folks who didn't get into the fandom scene when they were younger. Those of us who grew up with smartphones and social media have always been at least tangentially aware of things like that. But if you weren't internet savvy in the early 2000s, you can totally have missed it!

it is also late for me lol
