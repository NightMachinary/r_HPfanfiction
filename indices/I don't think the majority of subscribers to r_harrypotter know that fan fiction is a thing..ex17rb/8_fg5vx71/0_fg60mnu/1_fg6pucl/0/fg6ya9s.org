Hm I think it's a combo of all the above --

HP fanfic was a bit revolutionary and definitely carried by the group that you mentioned, the now 30s - 40s. However, I think teens today grew up with the books. I know that my sister and her friends (think high school tiktok kids) all read the books as kids but might have been too young at that age to really get into fan stuff? They don't grow up with the books the same way we did since they're all out and can be read in a row. So they read them in elementary/middle school, and they encounter fan things like the subreddit as they're getting older. But I think they're more aware of things like fanfiction in general because its part of pop culture, where as a lot of adults just never encountered it when they were younger.
