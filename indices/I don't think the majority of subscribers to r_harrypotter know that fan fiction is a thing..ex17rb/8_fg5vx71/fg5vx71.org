A couple of things to consider:

1. The original HP generation is pushing 30+ now. First book came out in 97 and was aimed at ages 8-16 which means that currently that group would be 31-39 years of age now (I am a member!)

2. While Reddit certainly attracts people of all ages the largest user age bracket for Reddit by a large margin is the 18-29 group, which is obviously younger than the original HP crowd.

3. Finally, Harry Potter Fan Fiction was arguably unknown by the average HP fan early on, really only coming into its own in the mid to late 2000's, but as that first group "aged out" to some degree, activity slid as many moved into other phases in their life and knowledge of the world of fan fics as it pertains to Harry Potter slid with it.

I bring up these points because we have to remember that there are several new generations since the original generation enjoying the world of Harry Potter. But they, like the original generation early on, may not have stumbled across fan fiction yet or before. This is likely especially true on Reddit communities since the ages skew younger. And the slide of HP fan fiction somewhat as one group ages out, has not been countered yet necessarily by new generations aging in and starting to write their own fan fictions.

So ignorance is to be expected until the wave pattern or cycle comes back around.

They are younglings.

Give them time.

Also its late here and maybe I am simply just overanaylizing everything.
