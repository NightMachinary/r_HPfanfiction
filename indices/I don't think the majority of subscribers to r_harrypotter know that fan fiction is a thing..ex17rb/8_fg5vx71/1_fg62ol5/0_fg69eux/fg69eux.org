I'm part of the OG crew age wise and I remember using the first book storyline as a bedtime story when I was babysitting (the kids wanted me to tell them a story I made up, not read them a book, but I'm not terribly creative so I 100% plagiarized JKR). I really hope I didn't ruin the books for those kids when they were old enough to read it themselves!
