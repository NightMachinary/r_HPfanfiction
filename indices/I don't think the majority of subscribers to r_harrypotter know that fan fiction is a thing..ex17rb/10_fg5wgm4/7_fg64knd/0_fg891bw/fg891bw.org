Naruto; My Hero Academia; Fruits Basket*; Harry Potter; Hobbit; Avatar: Last Airbender; Danny Phantom; Rise of the Guardians; Big Hero 6; Supernatural; Stargate SG-1; and Merlin, would be my top recs (not in order of preferance or quality).

*Quality Disclaimer: I haven't really found any GREAT (as in 'well written AND engaging') Fruits Basket fanfic. But the fanfic I did read prior to testing out the (then early-2000s) anime gave me a great idea of what the manga/anime is all about, which was partially the point. I did abandon that fandom for the anime mainly because its core ideas were cool but the writing quality of most fics... did not satisfy me. At all.

You will notice that most of these titles are top-tier popular fandoms, which is what drew me to trying them out in the first place. A bigger pool to go fishin' in means a larger chance of catching good eatin'! That said, I will grant an honorary mention to one (astronomically) small game fandom on FF.net: Cinderella Phenomenon. There is a long-fic (the only one there, at present) which I read on recommendation. The writing is... heh, /'Phenomenal'/... and I had a great time going through it and sifting out what was simply the bones of 'This Story' and figuring out what the core canon story was primarily about (aside from clearly being an otome romance). Since there are not enough fictions in that fandom to compare and more accurately figure out what is a canon depiction and what is not, however, I did quickly end up trying out the game.

TvTropes Fanfic Recs are a great place to start delving, once you have picked a fandom - instead of blindly choosing random one-shots to test the waters (I highly Do Not Recommend that method... if one can even call it a method). You could also sort by number of favorites/kudos to see what the top 3/5/19 are about. In my experience, though, For Want of a Nail AUs are great for figuring out character dynamics and Peggy Sue fics are the best for learning canon. Ship-fics can be fun but are extremely unreliable character gauges. They are, IMO, way more fun to indulge in /after/ one has sorted out who everyone is and what each person's place in the world is. Otherwise it's confusing. But hey: do what you want!
