Well, it's a pity that you feel this way, because I've never read a fanfic that really captures the essence or the charm of the original series. You might well know everything there is to know about Harry Potter...or you might not. I don't know what fanfics you've read. For all I know, you could think that Ron is a big dumb arrogant wanna-be tagalong who thinks he's entitled to be Harry's best friend.

That being said, the original Harry Potter book series is a wild ride. I don't know how impactful it will be if you read it now, because you most likely certainly have got the basic timeline down, and you'll probably have a lot of fanon ideas popping up in your brain, but as a person who read the series first, I'm sorry that you missed out on the experience. They're well-written mystery novels in a fantasy setting with plot twists that melted people's faces off.
