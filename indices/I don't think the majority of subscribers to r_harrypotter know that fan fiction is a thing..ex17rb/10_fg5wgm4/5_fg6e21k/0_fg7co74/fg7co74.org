*/Kindred Spirit!/* 0~0 Someone /Understands~!/ And has expressed it in better words than my own, as well! "... divine an interesting tale ..." Precisely!

For me, Plotholes are like gaping archways between what we have been explicitely exposed to (in canon) and a hidden realm of /Opportunity/. Still a part of the world, but unexplored territory. It begs my consideration. "What If...." I feel like an adventurer mapping (or attempting to map) out a previously uncharted course in my daydreaming of *"Story-Land"; Sector Insert-Fandom-Name-Here*.

I am like a child in a sandbox. It is a sandbox with someone else's name to it, but open to public perusal. I pay a bit of money for unlimited access. And then, once in, there are few to no boundaries. The sky is the limit to what my imagination can, as you say, 'divine'. The existing 'story' surrounding this sandbox is fine as it is. But the /world/ has many toys for my imagination to poke, prod, and play with, and is, therefore, much more entrancing to me than the original story it was constructed for. And, with the existence of fanfiction, I get to wander about and peruse other peoples' tweaks and inventive creations. Like some kind of Literature-based crafting fair!

Yeesh... do I even make sense?

I am quite possibly addicted to Stories. =P

EDIT: I am also quite possibly something like a covert pirate, because I can skip paying my entrance fee to other worlds by jumping straight into the 'Crafting' Area of fanfic for foreign (i.e. different) fandoms.
