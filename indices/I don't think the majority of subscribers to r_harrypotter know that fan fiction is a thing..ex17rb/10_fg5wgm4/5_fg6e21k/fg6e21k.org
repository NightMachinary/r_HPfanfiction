Hey, putting HP aside. I too have that really high appreciation for and maybe addiction to stories. Terrible movies, badly written books, and poorly programmed games, I have gone through them all as long as I can divine an interesting tale from them. My measure of a good story doesn't involve plot holes or worldbuilding though. I hate complex, rigid and perfect worlds with no substance. I hate tightly woven stories with no purpose. When ever I read a good story, its a direct window to the author's soul. His/her thoughts, desires, wants and feelings laid bare for all to see and experience.

The reason I said all that is because as I read your "story", I saw something that looked like my own mind or heart or whatever. So just wanted to see if you get a similar feeling or not.
