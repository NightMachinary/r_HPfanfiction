That reminds me of my view of Teen Wolf. I've seen the pilot and that's it. Through fanfiction I have a general knowledge of the show but I know my view of the world and characters are incredibly different to the show which I am perfectly happy with since the show apparently went bad. I suggest reading the original Harry Potter books and/or at least see the movies since they're all fantastic.
