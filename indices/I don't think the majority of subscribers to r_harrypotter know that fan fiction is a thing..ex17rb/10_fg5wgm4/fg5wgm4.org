Funnily enough, I myself have never read the HP books or watched further than the first movie. But I do know /E-ver-y-thing/ about its story because I am SUCH an avid fanfic reader. I occasionally 'try out' new or different fandoms containing quality writing without having any pre-attained knowledge regarding anything about the canon story or characters existing within it. That is what I did here. I had limited knowledge, true, but not nearly enough understanding to not be pleasantly confused through my first half-dozen fanfics here.

(And, well... HP is /fairly/ popular, so there /is/ a large pool of quality fish - I mean, stories - for me to choose from, so that was bound to draw me in quicker. It was an inevitability, really.)

I like to see what I can glean from a story that is presented on a platform upon which one is quite expected to already have /some/ idea as to what is being referenced and referred to. It is as much an intellectual challenge (to see how fast I can learn what is and what is not canon material, and how fast I can pick up on "what-the-heck-is-happening" in a brand-new world with new names, lingo, and inside jokes) as it is a gauge for how well and how thoroughly different authors will present well-known (to them) characters and scenes, as well as it is a mere temporary release from pure undiluted boredom.

What is even funnier is that I wouldn't even call myself a fan of the HP story itself; I am only really a fan of how authors have so much sand in this box to play around with inside of the realm of the HP /world/ and to such an enormous extent. What if... What if... Oh! And What If ....

So... it's a bit... /incomprehensible/ to me... that normal fans of the book/movie series... would be so darn oblivious. Actually incomprehensible.

I read on another thread that there are people who resurfaced from the realm of fanfic long enough to re-read the HP books, and quickly came to the conclusion that the canon material reads like a bad fanfic. So now I'm not even halfway curious enough to even look at them!
