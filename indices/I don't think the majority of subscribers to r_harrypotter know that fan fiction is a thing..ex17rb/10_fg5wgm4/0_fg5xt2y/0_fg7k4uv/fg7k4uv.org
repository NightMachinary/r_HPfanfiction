  People who say the books are bad fanfic are about as wrong as someone can be about something that isnt objective.

I mean, that is objective, and it's objectively wrong. By definition fanfiction is a fan's writing of an original work set in that work's universe. Harry Potter, being an original work, is objectively not fanfic.

Unless you meant to say it's /as poorly written/ as bad fanfic, in which case that can also be objectively proven or disproven by comparing poorly written fanfic to the original work and seeing how they compare in terms of writing quality.
