You really should read the books. People who say the books are bad fanfic are about as wrong as someone can be about something that isnt objective.

The main complaint people have of the books is apathy from harry and lack of plot coherency and direction. Despite these claims, pretty much everyone agrees that the books have a sense of magic about them unmatched by anything in fanfiction. The writing is obviously high quality too (especially compared to most fanfiction).
