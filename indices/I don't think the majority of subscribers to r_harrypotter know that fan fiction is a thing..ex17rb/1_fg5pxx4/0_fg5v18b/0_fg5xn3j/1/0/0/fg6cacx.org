The three I have seen:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hrcRtu45TU][The Black Sisters]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSbXEFmc9Qk][Neville Longbottom and the Black Witch]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6SZa5U8sIg][Voldemort - Origins of the Heir]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHBwk0quxs][Dumbledore and Grindlewald - The Greater Good]]

I would recommend watching "The Black Sisters" and "Neville Longbottom and the Black Witch" right after each other. They aren't by the same people, but the second one basically takes off right where the first stops. They are both great though.

Origins of the Heir, is ok, but has a very dissatisfying ending.

Dumbledore and Grindlewald is good. But I haven't watched that in a while, so I could be wrong.

​

Other Youtube Fan Films of decent length I just found, but haven't watched yet:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsntGGjxiw][Severus Snape and the Marauders]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj6O_8sbxiY][Mischief Managed]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVtO-GKmCnE][Lily Evans and the Stroke of Midnight]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhkHbHSOzHs][Son of the Moon]]

They are all of the Marauder Era.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKpDo_kGVI][The Tale of the Three Brothers]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKZLeDQJ1oU][Battle of Hogwarts]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBEVM9QHn_Q][The Battle of Hogwarts - Chapter 1]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=406OZJ4YQHI][La Maitre de la Mort]] (with subtitles)

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaP4ikxrubw][The Conspiracy of Wyrm - Part 1]] (I have no Idea what this is about)

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBB_VAMGXqc][The Conspiracy of Wyrm - Part 2]]

Shorter ones I have also found, but can't tell you anything about:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fq6cuNLykY][Minerva & the Wicked Heist]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpP3jm03IBw][The Day the Muggles Found Out]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpNp8WdQOoo][The Omen Chronicles]]

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiPdtQ9SBfc][The Last Follower]] (this comes recommended by others, but I can't seem to find the full film. If you find it let me know)

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgY0_Kq0m1c][The Wandmaker]] (this one also comes recommended, but there also seems to be no Film yet, just the trailers)

​

I don't know which ones the brinorton says are decent though. These are just the ones I found on YouTube.\\
I know what I will do today though haha. Watch all of them and see which ones are good :)
