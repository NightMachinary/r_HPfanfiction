Same here really. I generally thought it was a bunch of poorly written smut. My how 20% wrong I was!

But for real that 20% is pure gold. I think I figured it out around the time cursed child came out and everyone was like "I've read 10,000 fanfics that are better than this" and I was like... aight imma head over to ff.net and see for myself. Got hooked when I read the snape chronicles.
