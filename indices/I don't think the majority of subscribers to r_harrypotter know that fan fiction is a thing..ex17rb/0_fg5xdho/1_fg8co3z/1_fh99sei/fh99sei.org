Dodging prison and stealing witches unfortunately is not well done. I've written it out before and I can find my post again if you want. Cliff notes? It's weird that an adult Harry is getting several witches. And the way they become because of him - barf. Daphne who wants a fertility ritual at 13? Why not intellect boost or something? Why railroad her into being the matron and mother of the group at age freaking 13?

And the way he won over the "badass" daughter of Sirius. Aww yeah, adult Harry overpowers her and that makes her fall in love with him.

The harem aspect severely undermines character growth. Harems are tropes on tropes on tropes.
