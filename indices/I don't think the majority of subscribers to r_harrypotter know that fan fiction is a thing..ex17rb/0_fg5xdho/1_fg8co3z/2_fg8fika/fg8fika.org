All of my fics are Harem fics (Searching for the Power, Hogwarts Shuffle), and giving every character depth and purpose and agency is important to avoid InsertGirlName issues.

I was speaking of poorly written harem fics that are nothing but empty, graphic, badly written porn with little to no redeeming plot or other value.
