  Like, have they never heard of fan fiction??

Quite possibly. I read Harry Potter for the first time around 2002- 2003 in Bulgarian since I didn't know English yet. I don't think there is a lot of (if any) fanfiction in Bulgarian. I only discovered it around 2015 quite accidentally. I was watching a video on youtube about easter eggs in the puzzle game The Talos Principle and one of those eggs was a reference to The Methods of Rationality. Things escalated rather quickly after that.

Anyway, my point is some people started reading Harry Potter as children/ teenagers in their first languages and only later discovered the ton of fan fiction that is available for English speakers.
