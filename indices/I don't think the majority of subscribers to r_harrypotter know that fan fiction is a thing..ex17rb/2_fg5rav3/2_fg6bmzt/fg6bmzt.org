Same, I only found FF in 2016 I think. Though I remember finding one many years ago, I just didn't know what it was at the time : it was a blog with a very simple Hermione/Draco "fic" made with screenshots from The Sims 2. The author had made the characters in the sims and created a "set" that kinda looked like Hogwarts, and every blog post was a screenshot + a few lines of text/dialogue. I remember I loved it, since I was playing TS2 a lot at the time !
