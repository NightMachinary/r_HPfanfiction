Sorry, I wrote a big long reply and realised I was rambling so cut it all back to that and didn't actually explain myself.

I meant they, as in people outside our fandom, probably can't understand what's so great about a series of kids books about wizards going to wizard school. Sounds boring. You're telling me the main character gets into the same life or death situations around the end of school every year, for seven books, and you don't get bored reading that? Why don't they just get a gun and shoot the bad guy before he can make a shield?

It's about the story. Which is apparently part of the draw to wrestling too.
