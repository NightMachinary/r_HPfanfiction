I really miss when wrestling was just wrestling. No storylines. No fixed matches, no dog and pony show. Just 100% sport.

(It feels kind of weird to go watch high school sports when you aren't a student any more.)

I'm so glad they didn't drop it from the 2020 Olympics like they were talking about doing.
