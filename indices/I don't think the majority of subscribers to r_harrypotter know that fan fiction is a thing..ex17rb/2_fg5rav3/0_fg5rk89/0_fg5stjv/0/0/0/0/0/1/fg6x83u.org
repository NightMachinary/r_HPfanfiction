I miss the good old days of wrestling. Tlc matches, I loved Lita, she was one of the few females that kicked butt. I kind of fell in love with some characters, the hardy boys Matt and Jeff. I looovee Triple H, Shawn Michaels, what was the little group, X factor? I can't even remember. I enjoyed it as a kid.
