As someone who enjoyed this fic I feel like I have to respond but... You are not wrong. The entire thing is entirely ridiculous, if you can't bring yourself to like it you really don't have to stick around because it is very consistent in the kind of tone and ridiculousness throughout the fic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
