This is probably one of the greatest speech I ever read by Percy Weasley.

  He paused to scan their faces meaningfully. “Fear leads to a lot of things, very few of them positive. It leads to hatred, and to mistrust and to thoughtless action, all things that we as people cannot afford!” Percy slapped the podium for emphasis, and everybody jumped.

  “Fear blinds even the sides of man to the truth. And the truth that everyone is missing here is that we have rode out the worst of the storm. We have outlived the menace of tyranny---Lord Voldemort is dead.” Percy let the name roll off his tongue for the first time. “Our greatest fault was that we expected his death to be the end. It isn't. There is still much work to be done, and it will not be accomplished if we do not work together.” Another pause, another scan of the faces. “I know that nothing I can say will make you believe that everything will go back to being happy or easy. And that's because there is no simple course to take, no simple path to returning to the way it was before the war.”
