Since you did not specify the fandom my favorite quote is:

"After all, she'd had her facility invaded by the enemy - pretty much. She was working on improving means to kill anyone who dared to try a repeat performance.

So long as it wasn't her, Chell was okay with this"

Chell recalling what happened in the past few weeks. The other being mentioned is obviously GLaDOS.

Seven Devils chapter 12(according to fanfiction.net), 11 (according to the story)
