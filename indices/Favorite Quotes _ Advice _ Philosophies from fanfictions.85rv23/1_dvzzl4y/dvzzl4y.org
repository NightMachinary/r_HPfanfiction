Plans, plots, ideas, schemes, and so much more whirred through the mind of Albus Dumbledore. His brilliant mind dissected each item, mercilessly probing for weaknesses, for flaws, for imperfections. But never did he reject the methods. Empires would fall, regimes would change, and the world itself would burn.

People became no more than pawns, to be ruthlessly used and discarded. He would use his great knowledge of the human mind and his ability to read people to manipulate them. They would be his puppets, dancing to his bidding as he worked to his greater goal.

At the center of his web of conspiracy was the Fentons. Yes they were key. It was only because of them his goal could be accomplished.

Yes, Albus Dumbledore would be getting a pair of thick woolen socks for Christmas. And the Fentons would be the ones to give them to him.
