I've got a real head for quotes so honestly, so many. The only two I can think of verbatim (because I know where they are): - " James was crazy like it was a phase he was going through---like he'd wake up one morning merely eccentric" - "My right shoe is missing, my left smells like dragon dung, and my trousers are thoroughly scorched. Highly unlikely I would've survived a dragon attack, so that will remain a mystery. (If I did meet and escape a dragon, but am too drunk to remember it, I'll never forgive myself.) Was woken by a Muggle law man this morning. No idea what he was saying. (You'd think I would, wouldn't you, with Sirius cursing at me in French for the last seven years?) He was angry that I was sleeping on a public bench. Minor detail, but the bench was in Paris under the giant monument of Gifford Ollerton. Y'know, the one camouflaged as that tower you told me the Parisian Muggles think they made."
