  The anagram. I mean to be serious Tom. The Dark Lord is a murderous dictator who tried to take over the world, slaughtering anyone who opposed him and practically enslaving half the purebloods in Europe. He would never do something as sad and juvenile as using an anagram of his given name for a title. That's like something a bad guy in a children's storybook would do. I'm eleven and even I can see that.

Luna's words should be held as philosophical.
