What exactly are you looking for when you say "fun adventures"? Visits to a magical waterpark? A treasure hunt? Harry becoming the king of the Underground Racing League with an enchanted 1999 Nissan Skyline? Magical Zoology expeditions?

Give us something to work with here. Also, how much danger can be included before it stops being fun?
