- Harry and Luna go on a muggle safari where Harry touches a stone age ritual circle and gets a vision of some prehistoric monsters about to break free from their bindings because no one renewed them.

- Harry babysitting Teddy while Andromeda carries out assassinations (but he doesn't know). Until one day she gets Harry as a target and they have to hunt down her organisation.

- Padma, instead of marrying some guy of her families choosing, runs off with Harry and they use his money and what he git as spoils of War to finance a private space company that utilises magic to build better ships. Can go anywhere from establishing colonies on foreign planets or a peaceful first contact with hot space babes up to defeating an Alien invasion or hunting down space pirates.

- Harry Potter monster hunter, with Hermione as Q (from James Bond) equivalent that makes badass weapons and gadgets.

- A Kim Possible crossover with Ginny in Kims Role, Harry as sidekick and Hermione as Ginny's best friend and mastermind behind the whole operation. Voldemort and manipulative Dumbledore as cartoonosh villains while Bellatrix Lestrange is Shego (competent enforcer). Not a Muggle or High school AU.

- A story where Harry is thrown into the seventies, gets together with Lily (who knows who he is), they run off and play international firefighters who make sure that the cold war doesn't go hot and no other conflict escalates.

- A racing AU where the four Hogwarts houses are motorsport teams but the sorting hat puts Harry in his own house with just some crappy car and a couple of house elves as mechanics. He wins the first year championship after some initial struggle and suddenly the sorting hat starts sorting more firsties to his team. Keep most of the book plots but resolve them with magically enhanced street racing instead of simple magic. The dementors are some gang set up by the government to infiltrate the scene but go rouge, Voldemort is some sort of evil mobster who is believed dead but keeps making comebacks, the Tournament is an international rally where Dragons are obstacles and one race uses small submarines, and so on.
