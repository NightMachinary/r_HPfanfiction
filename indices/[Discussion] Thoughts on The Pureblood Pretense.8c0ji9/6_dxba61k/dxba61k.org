It has been a while since I have read it, but I do remember stopping for the reasons you described. The fact that she is so amazing that she can run a potions business on the side, impress Snape with potions skills, perform insanely advanced spells and find a miracle cure for a disease all at the age of 12 just made me lose interest in her character and the plot.

I do tend to prefer a more realistic approach to characters and plot though. I avoid overpowered character tropes unless they are written in a very certain way (such as in the seventh horcrux or Lily and the art of being sisyphus).

It is likely that the reason you see more positive than negative commentary on some fics is that the readers who are not interested or who have a problem with the plot/characters stop early on. Big fans of the series are more likely to recommend the fic or comment with details and specifics.
