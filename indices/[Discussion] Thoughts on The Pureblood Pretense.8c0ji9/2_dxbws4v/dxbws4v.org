This fic actually has a lot of things I hate meshed together, and somehow is still one of my favorite things EVER and I'm absolutely obsessed with it right now lol

A lot of the things you said get addressed in the future, and most people agree that Book 3 is the best so far, so keep reading, yay~!

I'm really excited for fourth year, but holy sh** this book is gonna be LONG. It's currently 132k words and not in Hogwarts yet. Yikes. I'm in love with every word, though.

About Harry being OP, I think the main reason I don't mind it is that she treats her power like a liability. Firstly, because it's a difference between her and Archie, and anything she has that he can't replicate is a risk to The Ruse, and by extension, her life. But also because she's scared of not being able to control it, or worse, being able to control her power, but not /herself/, and ending up doing something tragic and irreversible.

It's certainly not the kind of OP that goes I AM HARRY JAMES POTTER SLYTHERIN BLACK, HEIR OF THE FOUR FOUNDERS OF HOGWARTS, SMARTER AND MORE POWERFUL AND COMPETENT THAN EVERY ADULT IN THE WIZARD WORLD AND THE ONLY HUMAN THE GOBLINS EVER LIKED EVER SO NOW I'LL USE MY ULTIMATE POWERS TO START A REVOLUTION AND EVERYONE WILL LISTEN TO ME EVEN THOUGH I'M 11 AND JUST HEARD ABOUT THE WIZARD WORLD LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO, either XD
