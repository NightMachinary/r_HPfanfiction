I agree it's full of things I normally hate; overpoweredness, contrived situations, Potions revisionism, bizarre misrepresentations of Occlumency, but is somehow excellent despite that. I don't really know; it just shows that when these things are done well they can be entertaining.

My main fault with it is it's far too long; the series just gets longer which really drags and probably doesn't help the extremely slow updates lately.
