Being well written makes up for a lot. It's also partially that a lot of those things are usually bad because they are accompanied by bad writing. With good writing those annoying tropes are handled a lot more tastefully and are less problematic.

There are several other fics I feel similarly about, that have tropes I usually don't like, but are well written and I like anyway. Pureblood Pretense is one of my favorite fics despite all those things you mentioned, and several more you didn't. Prince of Slytherin has a ton of tropes, but is has them in a self aware way and attempts to subvert them, which is fairly well done imo. Lily and the Art if Being Sisyphus has one of the most OP depictions of Harry I've ever seen, but is probably my favorite in progress fic in the entire fandom. Though to be fair, OP protagonist doesn't actually bother me much, especially if they have other challenges that can't be solved by their OPness, which both Lily and Pureblood Pretense do. Sarcasm and Slytherin has a ton of tropes, and they are annoying and make the story worse imo, as it has them completely unironically and they aren't handled as well. But the story is otherwise well written, so it's still enjoyable to read even with them. It's basically a not self aware version of prince.
