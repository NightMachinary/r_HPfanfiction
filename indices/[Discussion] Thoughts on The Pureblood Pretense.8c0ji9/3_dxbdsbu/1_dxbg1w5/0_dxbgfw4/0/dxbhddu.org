Yeah, fourth year is looking promising on the things possibly falling apart front. Can you imagine what will happen if (who am I kidding, when) someone puts Arcturus Rigel Black's name into the Goblet of Fire? Harry couldn't compete, it would have to be Archie because it's a binding magical contract, and I don't know how they'd handle that. And it's looking like they might end up stuck being their original selves this year anyway.

Who knows what will happen. As you can see, I am still very into this series despite finding it unbelievable.
