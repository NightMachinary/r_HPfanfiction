Yeah, I think it was likely just a plot device the author decided she needed and decided to steer into the OPness. Although I'd be so impressed if the author eventually reveals that it HAD been discovered in the past, but it's not being used for some really important reason (like it makes you sterile or gives you magic cancer) and Harriet was just too headstrong/secretive to ask an expert about it.

Part of the reason I like the series is because Harriet's entire life is so reliant on luck to not fall apart. As you get into the later books, she starts adopting more and more masks and you can see the strain of juggling all these lies get to her. I'm hoping for an eventual collapse of her house of cards, just to see what the fallout would be.
