You make good points.

1. From what I remember with the potions selling, the profit margins were reasonably thin. What made her able to earn so much money out of it was using tons of money from her parents' bank account for supplies and counting on them not noticing. Really luck based and also a major risk.

2. I guess the main reason I don't buy that Harry could make this discovery is that I think of Potions as the magical equivalent of chemistry or physics. There are genius 12 year olds attending college and majoring in those fields, some even at the top of their class, but even so, those kids aren't making major breakthroughs. It can take decades to get to that point. It just didn't seem realistic to me that Polyjuice Potion has existed for hundreds of years, and no one has figured out a partial Polyjuice before a 12 year old with 1 year of research experience

2B, 3 and 4 make sense. It just seems like they're relying on luck to not be found out a bit too much.
