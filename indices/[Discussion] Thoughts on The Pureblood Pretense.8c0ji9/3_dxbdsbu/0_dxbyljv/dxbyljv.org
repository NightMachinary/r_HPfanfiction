1. yeah, and she has a cheap apartment and no aditional bills, because she doesn't actually live there, haha

2. I don't think it's really a breakthrough. Didn't the book say specifically to use the hair with polyjuice (and give it to a muggle, obliviating them later lol)? I think people just don't have that much use for the partial polyjuice. I mean, it serves her purpose perfectly, but polyjuice is mostly about transforming into a specific person, for anything else there are other ways to change your appearance.

3. yeah, and she's taking the bare minimum amount of classes (though they sent her letters for her to take more classes, since apparently she's their best student XD)

4. she told the landlady she'd be using the floo to come and go, so that's why no one would see her much. Also, later [[/spoiler][after Leo discovers the apartment, he mentions the neighbors never heard any noises, so he goes there sometimes just to walk on the floor and stuff, so it's not suspiciously silent]]
