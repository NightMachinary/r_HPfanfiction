You're not incorrect, Harriet is definitely an OP protagonist, but I think depending on how you interpret the events you listed, it could still be within the bounds of possibility. I'll address them point by point (feel free to disagree, I'm interested in other people's takes on it!):

1. I'm not actually sure she's making that much money off the potions selling? We know she has a pretty generous allowance from her parents for study supplies (she never mentions having to skip buying ingredients due to a lack of money when younger, even though we know she experimented a lot then too) and Krait seems far more impressed with the QUALITY of the potions than with how much money she's making him. Might be the margins on potions are very thin and she's not making much per case.

2. I agree this seems like a major breakthrough, but keep in mind that Harriet is arguably an actual genius in Potions. She's spent her entire childhood studying it instead of doing normal kids stuff; she might be the equivalent of Bobby Fischer or Magnus Carlsen, far outstripping most people in the field, regardless of their age. Honestly, what makes her truly OP is that she's that good at potions, but ALSO good at most other types of magic AND she's got any social skills whatsoever. For your second point, this is addressed later and relates to Archie and Harriet's shared Black lineage. If you apply Occam's Razor from their family's point of view, which is more likely? These two 12 year olds are masterminding a plot to switch places AND developed a potion that allows them to do so? Or "Magic did something weird"?

3. It's stated that it's a pretty shitty correspondence school. I think of it as the equivalent of getting registered as a wedding officiant online XD

4. I think we hear some neighbors discussing it later on in the story and there is some resolution later on that puts some people in the apartment day to day. You could also argue that it's an area where people don't get too inquisitive about their neighbors' comings and goings, for their own safety.

TL;DR You're not wrong, but there are IMO plausible interpretations for the issues you described, if you stretch your bounds of belief a bit. Plus, I dont mind an OP protagnist if they are still challenged by the story.
