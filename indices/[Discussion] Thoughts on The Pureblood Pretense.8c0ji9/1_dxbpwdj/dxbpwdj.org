God I love this series. I love it so much. It's one of those fan fictions that I can read a hundred times and still be excited for reading the 101st time. The characters all seem true to themselves even in the AU, fem!Harry which I'm always a slut for, more on wizarding culture and sane Voldemort, which makes him so much scarier. I love it so much. I literally went out, bought and read the Alana the Lioness series because I loved this fanfic so much and wanted to read the source material.

Edit: I saw the words Pureblood Pretense and went mad with love. There are a lot of unrealistic things in the series circa Harry's ability level, but I think the writing makes up for those stretches of the imagination. The only thing about it that bothers me is the very beginning of Harry's time at Hogwarts - it's quite stuffy and purebloody, and then the author seems to remember these are just kids, and we get the series we all know and love. Still hoping for a continuation. I know better than most that WIPs are pains in the ass.
