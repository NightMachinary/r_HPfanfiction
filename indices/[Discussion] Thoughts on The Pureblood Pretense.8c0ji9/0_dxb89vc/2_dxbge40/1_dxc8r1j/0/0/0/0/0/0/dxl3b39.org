The faults of the source work don't really apply here if the fanfic does not exhibit them. I think that is where we disagree.

  Also, the last I checked, though many on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] seem to disagree, having a discussion about an author's personal views and books is hardly constitues an "attack".

If you wanted to discuss /murkybluematter/'s views, I would consider that on topic. The source author's are irrelevant unless the fic author adapts them.
