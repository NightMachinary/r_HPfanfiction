  If you really wanted to attack the author of pureblood pretense for some deficiency for one reason or another
#+end_quote

I don't. If you read my post, I was merely commenting and adding context to OP's comparison using Tamora Pierce's works. I have nothing to say about /The Pureblood Pretense/, and I'm tired of people jumping to conclusions on this thread about it. Mentioning Pierce's works does not automatically mean I'm also talking about TPP.

  Your post is just way off the mark...You basically used a lot of words to attack the wrong author.
#+end_quote

If you don't like having a calm and mature discussion, then don't reply. Also, the last I checked, though many on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] seem to disagree, having a discussion about an author's personal views and books is hardly constitues an "attack".

  Whatever faults Pierce has as a writer/person don't really apply to a derivative work where those faults don't appear.
#+end_quote

Except that, as I've provided in my replies, her personal views /do/ affect her works. If derivative works are based on Pierce's works, by common logic and extension, they could've easily taken the less savoury personal views and messages (i.e. "black people pretty much didn't exist in history") that Pierce incorporated into her books. Sometimes, this happens without actually noticing how, and why, a particular aspect was included in the original book(s).

By addressing the faults in the source material, it provides full knowledge and context for those reading the derivative work to make an informed opinion on it, whether it be good or bad.
