Your post is just way off the mark. This thread is about /The Pureblood Pretense/ which is a fanfic. It takes plot ideas from Alanna but avoids on screen pregnacies and teenaged sex. At least none that I see. Even at that, there are a ton of crappy fanfiction on FF.NET, AoE, and elsewhere that have first and second year hogwarts students thinking in a sexual manner. Thankfully /this/ fic does not include that fault.

You basically used a lot of words to attack the wrong author. Whatever faults Pierce has as a writer/person don't really apply to a derivative work where those faults don't appear. If this post was in a subreddit about alanna the lioness or Tamora Pierce you would be ontopic. But we are not.

Not all source works of fanfiction are perfect. Not even Harry Potter.

--------------

If you really wanted to attack the author of pureblood pretense for some deficiency for one reason or another, you could start with the fact that she cannot write 11-12 year old children well. I believe she admits it, and rather then try, she handwaves it away as "pureblood training". She gets somewhat better over time, but it's still a thing. I accept that and admire her work in spite of it.

- That is a critique that is relevant to this post, granted not this subthread. But I could post it as a child of the original post and be on topic.

You are not strictly against the rules of the sub as I understand it, but your post was in poor taste, hence the downvotes.
