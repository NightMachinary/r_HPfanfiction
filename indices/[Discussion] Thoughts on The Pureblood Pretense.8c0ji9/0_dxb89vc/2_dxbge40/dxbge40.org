I also used to read Tamora Pierce's books. While I think she's a great writer, it always severely bothered me that she always included underage sex / pregnancies in books marketed and written for the /Percy Jackson/ age group...I've also seen this a lot in quite a few /Harry Potter/ fics, especially with /Ãœbermensch/ Harry. Pierce uses the line, "but it's historically accurate", but the way she literally goes out of her way to write in something like this in every one of her books / series rubs me the wrong way.

  "With the fourth Alanna book, I had Alanna drinking wine, as people who could afford it in the Middle Ages did. My editor objected to this (not the sex, mind, but the alcohol). I reminded her that it was historically accurate; as a historian herself, she knew that, but she still objected." - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8adoeb/my_name_is_tamora_pierce_awardwinning_author_of/][Tamora Piece in a recent AMA]]

As an edit, Pierce has also used "historical accuracy" as an excuse (sometimes very incorrectly, and very clearly, without doing any research) to defend not including POC / LGBTQA+ characters in works, despite some them taking place in a completely fictional / fantasy setting. When people objected to this, particularly when she told people "but having black people as main characters in /Agent Carter/ isn't 'historically accurate'", Pierce did /not/ react very well.

  "Which is more offensive to you: black help and blacks in service, or no blacks? I would like to see more POC, yes, but that was the time, and I'm not sure I'd like to see more POC if they're always going to be in service." - Tamora Pierce

Meanwhile, Pierce included several POC characters in her own books, which, by her own account, were "based in the Middle Ages". So, according to Pierce, it's perfectly "acceptable" and "historically accurate" for her to include POC characters in a historical setting, but not others...for whatever reason.

Pierce also reacted in a poor / negative way to the "non-white" name of a well-known black actress:

And also worth a read as to Pierce acting like Cassandra Clare in some regards:
