  , it always severely bothered me that she always included underage sex / pregnancies in books marketed and written for the Percy Jackson age group

As gross as it makes me feel to consider teenagers having sex, the fact is that they do. And for Alanna, Kel and Beka getting pregnant during their respective series would have been the end of their careers. Daine maybe not so much, but she would still have faced a lot of stigma. So it's kind of understandable that the heroines are at least /worried/ about it. Her Emelan series doesn't feature any of that, in part because the protagonists are that much younger for that much longer.

The Lioness series is nearly 35 years old at this point so I find it amusing that you're calling it marketed for the Percy Jackson age group.

  With the fourth Alanna book, I had Alanna drinking wine...I reminded her that it was historically accurate;

Perhaps she should have instead reminded her editor that by the fourth book Alanna is a fucking adult and old enough to drink wine anyway.

And this is why I don't follow authors I like on any kind of social media.
