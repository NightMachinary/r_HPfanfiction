  I would much rather have them reading about a healthy sexual relationship

I don't think a sexual relationship between a student and her much older teacher / mentor is exactly "healthy" (i.e. how Pierce wrote Daine and Numair). As I pointed out, the very reason why this kind of relationship is off-limits to begin with is because the student cannot consent while the teacher is still in a position of power and authority over him/her.

/That/ is decidedly unhealthy, and portrays abuse of power and trust. This article also explains why I have this view well: [[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-raphael/why-studentteacher-relati_b_1435275.html]]

Another aspect I wanted to bring up is that this isn't the only time that a grown, older adult directly discusses sex, or the possibility of sex, with an underage person / child / teenager in Pierce's works. In /Protector of the Small/, one knight even confesses to Kel (if I recall correctly) about "being so physically ugly that he might have to rape a girl in order to have children".

Speaking of Pierce writing about rape in her books, there's even an entire rape trial / case that happens, also in /Protector of the Small/: [[http://tamorapierce.wikia.com/wiki/Vinson_of_Genlith]]

That's...a pretty messed-up thing to include in a YA novel, and way beyond what you mention as a "healthy sexual relationship" or "YA life including sex". That's not what I'm referring to here.
