  As gross as it makes me feel to consider teenagers having sex, the fact is that they do.
#+end_quote

This is true, some do. But the question is, did Pierce really need to include the underage sex in her works, especially when it's marketed towards YA, and children are reading these scenes? Even Phillip Pullman of /His Dark Materials/ (at least, the American version) didn't go that far in /The Amber Spyglass/, nor did J.K. Rowling with /Harry Potter/.

(In fact, Rowling herself directly cited "children would read these sex scenes" as the reason why she wanted to avoid putting anything overtly sexual in her books.)

Meanwhile, we have Daine directly talking about having sex, quite bluntly, with Numair, who is her /much/ older teacher and in a position of authority over her, in /In the Realm of the Gods/ (Pierce's /Immortals/ series, book #4). Even here, the area of consent is incredibly dubious: [[http://www.mlnlaw.com/articles/can-students-consent-to-sex-with-a-teacher/]]

  The Lioness series is nearly 35 years old at this point so I find it amusing that you're calling it marketed for the Percy Jackson age group.

Because I'm quoting what the OP cited in their post: that it's marketed towards /Percy Jackson/-age readers...which it is. Tamora Pierce's books are classified as YA. No matter how old they are, they're still considered YA. If you look up books online, or go to a bookstore, you'll find them in the YA section.

Tamora Pierce even directly says this on her official website:
