  did Pierce really need to include the underage sex in her works

Underage by whose definition? Alanna's seventeen when she sleeps with Jonathan. Kel is sixteen when she and Cleon are considering sex. Daine is sixteen during ItRotG. The only character to actually *have* sex is Alanna and that happens entirely off screen.

All of those meet my country's minimum age of consent. Hell, most of those meet America's minimum age of consent (which, given the ongoing state of child marriages in the US is kind of morbidly laughable).

I acknowledge that the Daine/Numair relationship is certainly potentially creepy and definitely could have benefited from aging Daine up.
