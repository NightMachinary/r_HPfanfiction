I explained the exact scenarios I have issues with in my other reply. They deal more so with older male/very young girl dynamic, as well as the focus on much-darker topics like [statutory] rape, that sometimes features in Pierce's works.

  The only character to actually have sex is Alanna and that happens entirely off screen.

Pretty sure Aly and Nawat have a sex scene in the /Trickster/ series. Aly's pregnancy as a direct result from "mating" with Nawat is also depicted.

Likewise, Pierce herself said the following:

#+begin_quote
  "...not all marriages are going to be the same; it's a world where *most people of the middle and lower classes begin to marry at 15 and 16 and many young women marry around 18*; and not everyone is going to go into marriage with a solid and sedate marriage plan or way of dealing with one another in their relationship. Some of us--most of us--make it up as we go. Remember, we haven't seen the Contes or the Coopers in their married life before the kiddos arrived.

  Also, if you look at post-war populations, marriages and childbirths skyrocket. People want to prove they're alive; they want to prove they survived. They want to get married and they want to have children. That's what Aly and Nawat did. They lost three people they were close to, and they were still alive. *Also, they weren't exactly counting on having three kids at once.* No, Nawat didn't do things as we think people should do them. He is what? Three years old? He's still learning." - Tamora Pierce, "Marriages and Naming in Tortallan vs. Raka Cultures"

The thing is, Pierce - again - uses "historical accuracy" and "research" as excuses to write this sort of thing. She also uses these reasons to justify it as "acceptable". However, just because you /can/ write about something, i.e. underage marriage and sex, doesn't mean that you /should/.

Since Pierce cites research, I'm going to cite this study, which demonstrates how (and why) teenage marriage carries with it a host of problems, none of which Pierce displays in her books: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000061/]]

My problem with Pierce is that she claims that her books are written with "research" and "historical accuracy", as well as "moral lessons", in mind. Yet, just from browsing her many instances of answering fan questions on her website, as well as reading her books, she more so uses it (by her own admission) for "wish fulfillment" and "because she prefers older men".

To me, that comes across as dishonest, and disingenous. If she simply wants to write such a dynamic because "wish fulfillment", then she shouldn't be seeking to try and justify or defend it. She should simply just be open and honest about what she prefers.

I also take issues with how Pierce tends to heavily romanticize, and portray all of the positives, but few, if any, negatives and downsides to characters to some of the topics (i.e. teenage marriage, teenage sex and pregnancy) that she writes into her books.

Despite claiming to want to include "harsh realism" in her books (i.e., again, with her citing "historical accuracy"), she often times portrays her favored (teenage) romances as very "fairy-tale-esque", with always having "happily ever afters". (In fact, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter][Babies Ever After]] seems to be one of her preferred tropes, particularly with the Tortall series.)

It's that disconnect between the two things that I have problems with, not just the underage sex / marriage aspect. To me, these two, contradicting things break [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief][suspension of disbelief]], as well as completely undermine Pierce's attempts at "realism".

Simply put, it's utterly implausible - and /impossible/ - to have a "fairy tale" ending in world based on "realism". The "fairy tale" ending, especially given the setting of constant war that the Tortall books seem to be set in, comes across as nonsensical and inconsistent with the rest of the books / series.

  I acknowledge that the Daine/Numair relationship is certainly potentially creepy and definitely could have benefited from aging Daine up.
#+end_quote

Yup, this is something I directly mention in my other reply as well. It's probably one of my biggest gripes with Pierce's works: her overlooking the /very/ big problems and moral issues raised by this relationship, simply because "she personally prefers older men / the younger girl-older man relationship".

This thread also touches upon this, and I'm not the only fan who's weirded out by Pierce's "preference": [[http://fiefgoldenlake.proboards.com/thread/18446/age-differences]]
