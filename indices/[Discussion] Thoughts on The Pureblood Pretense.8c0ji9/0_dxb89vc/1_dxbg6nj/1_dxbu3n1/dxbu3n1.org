Currently Draco seems to be on his way to putting things together, so you might get your confidant after all. Though we won't know until the next chapter, coming in... may, I think Sister said?

I do, however, recommend you keep reading. In my opinion, the story gets progressively better, and fourth year looks like its gonna be pretty great
