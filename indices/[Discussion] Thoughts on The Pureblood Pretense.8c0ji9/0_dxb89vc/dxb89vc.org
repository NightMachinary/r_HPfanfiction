SPOILERS FOR SONG OF THE LIONESS BELOW, SORT OF, AND THE FIC

I think this series really follows the tone of the crossover a lot more than it does the tone of Harry Potter. Alanna the Lioness is a bit like the later Narnia books, crossed with Brandon Sanderson, but written for the Percy Jackson age group. It is a weird thing to describe honestly, its been a while since I've read them. However, I think Harriet's character is a great mix of Alanna and Harry Potter. Some of the events such as a contagious sickness happen in the book too, but they are quite different in execution.

Some things you are not meant to question too closely, and one of the things that the fic does best is utterly ignore the being discovered as a girl trope. This doesn't really happen in the source material.

She has great capacity and power, but not much control over it, and all of the things that you mentioned have in story explanations. Snowhit and Aurora's Breath aren't beyond her ability, people do wonder and gossip about her apartment leading to its discovery, the correspondence courses are supposed to be easy etc etc.
