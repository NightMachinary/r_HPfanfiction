The fact that she is talented/strong/whatever makes the storyline interesting. It's all about the pretense more so then beating the big bad. I feel like this story is more about when/how she will be detected then about the individual OP things she does. I have a feeling that the pretense will break in her 4th year and things will come to a head.

If you think about it, a perfectly ordinary Rigel has fewer chances of being detected. As it is, I cannot figure out how she makes it through the 4th year without getting detected by Professor Snape. Or failing that, the goblet will have Arcturus come out and it falls apart then and there. Hermione also has experience now with Harry who brewed a super difficult potion... But Harry won't be able to replicate the feat in America or even really talk about it as it's a super detailed potion. Hermione might just get curious...
