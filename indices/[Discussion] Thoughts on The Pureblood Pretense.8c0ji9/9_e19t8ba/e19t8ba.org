A bit late but I've been thinking about reading this fanfiction and I heard a few stuff about it. Mainly that Harry here is a Potions genius and she develops her own kind of mind magic and invents her own potions. You mentioned a partial polyjuice thing, what's that? Is it too overpowered because if that and the mind magic are too strong for someone who's just eleven I don't think I'll read it. Also, would you recommend it to someone who doesn't like AUs that much? It also seems to be Harry/Draco...

Thanks =)
