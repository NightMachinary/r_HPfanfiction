The partial polyjuice basically gives you some features of the other person, but you don't look fully like them. The plan is for Harry and Archie to slowly increase how much they look like each other over the years in order to maintain their disguise if someone sees them in public. I don't think the partial polyjuice itself is OP, just the fact that it was made by a 12 year old.

And yeah, Harry is straight up overpowered, though not in the same unbearably obnoxious way as the average OP Harry fic. I don't usually like these types of AUs either, but The Pureblood Pretense has an entirely different tone and vibe from most fanfiction, and for all its faults it's strangely readable. I recommend at least giving it a try, you'll never know if you don't.
