[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There is a List for That]] by GatherYourStrength is a very recently completed Hermione-centric fic. It is a time travel fic to the Marauders Era. No romance whatsoever.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27530344][Dancing with Darkness]] by TheSword is an ongoing fic. No romance thus far, and the author assures that any romance will be minimal and not the focus. It is another time travel fic to the Marauders Era. It has just started but it looks pretty promising.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31242809][Professor Granger, Occupation; Defence Against the Dark Arts Post.]] by Camk475 has an alternate universe Hermione Granger coming to teach DADA. It is an exploration of duelling, and pretty much exists to show off a competent Hermione. It is ongoing.

There is also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30109236][Coming of Age]] by Cernuns which is pretty much a retelling of the Hogwarts Years from Hermione's POV. It is a character study primarily and focuses on Hermione's friendships and such. It is ongoing is on 4th year right now.

If you don't mind femslash, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28159545][Hermione Granger: Tomb Raider]] by Artistia is an Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider AU. It is marked as Fleur/Hermione, but aside from sexual tension, it is pretty devoid of romance. There is a kiss due to spy stuff but not much else. The focus is on the action and plot. Pretty good world-building.

Lastly, if you don't mind crossovers, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20618525][Uncle Bobby]] by GatherYourStrength is another good Hermione-centric fic. It is a crossover with Supernatural, but you don't need to know anything about Supernatural to follow it. It deals with the fallout of Hermione removing her parents memories.

I hope you find something you enjoy!
