#+begin_quote
  Redirected and rebranded, the Death Eaters have dismantled and destroyed everything the Light holds dear. With their society on the verge of extinction, Hermione is the only one who can fix the future. At least, that's what she keeps telling herself. Armed with plans, lists, books, and a house elf, she won't stop until things have been set right. But what will happen when she doesn't arrive at her intended destination? Will her plans to work alone still hold water? Or will she sink among the endless waves of memory and regret?

  Harry Potter's Fifth Year is turning out to be unlike anything he expected. Voldemort is back and he is swamped with homework and studying for his OWls. And he for once has a competent teacher who is not trying to kill him. A professor from an alternate dimension.

  Suffice to say, after her parents received a message that their daughter had been turned into stone and would miss a month of studies because something had attacked her... Suffice to say, after Hermione had woken up after missing a month of studies and being attacked... The summer after her second year Hermione fervently agreed with her parents that perhaps she could stand to talk to someone who understood why she covered all her plush toys so that their beady eyes didn't gleam in the evening light.

  Chaos has erupted in the Veela clans with the death of the queen, and corruption in the High Council would threaten the selection of a new queen, possibly sending the clans into civil war once more. Only the rediscovery of a lost ancient Veela relic can prevent a hostile regime from seizing power, and Fleur Delacour is determined to find it, with the assistance of renowned historian and archaeologist, the nicknamed Tomb Raider Hermione Granger.

  Bobby and Hermione finally meet. Secrets will be revealed. Relationships will be built.And a trip to Australia is definitely in order.This work is meant to follow a series of letters between (primarily) Richard Granger and Bobby Singer. It may help to read at least the last few from 1997 and 1998 to get an idea of where this is starting.
