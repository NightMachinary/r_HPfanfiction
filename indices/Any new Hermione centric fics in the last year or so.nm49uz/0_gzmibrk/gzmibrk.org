linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13843116/1/aberration]] ): a decent Slytherin!Hermione fic; romance is a significant component, but most of the fic is Hermione interacting with other people.

linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28045281/chapters/68705625]] ): my self-promotion; I don't know how often I'll be able to update it, but I intend to keep each chapter individually entertaining enough that even if I don't finish it, it'll still be worth reading.
