Now that you ask for it, the number of non-romantic Hermione fics is troublingly low even though canon!Hermione doesn't show much romantic inclination.

The latest installment from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is nothing to fear]] series is from Hermione's POV. A unique Voldemort Wins AU.

Linkffn(New Blood) is still going strong. Somewhat OP Slytherin!Hermione in the style of Riddle.

Linkao3(Six Pomogranate Seeds) Is probably the closest you will get to an aromantic Hermione. This one is just too pragmatic.
