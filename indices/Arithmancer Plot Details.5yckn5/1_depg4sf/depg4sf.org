White Squirrel is a great writer but that's basically my biggest complaint with that story. During fourth year there's actually an A/N where she writes something like "Haha did you really expect me to put Hermione into the tournament?" .... and I was just... why didn't you? It would have been cool and at least somewhat unique and would have put canon on its head.

Generally IMHO fanfic writers should embrace the "Rule of Cool" more... I'm willing to go along with the most flimsy of justifications if it gets the story, plot and characters into a cool place. But most people seem too afraid to try something like this... and maybe there's a good reason for that. As others in this thread have pointed out, it requires a much higher level of writing talent to do something like this.
