I get the impression with White Squirrel that she deliberately takes common tropes, cliches, and fandom specific plots in Harry Potter and aims to subvert them or write them as well as possible.

Think about it. The Arithmancer is basically just the 'Hermione knows everything' cliche given new life, The Accidental Animagus is loaded with early-Animagus, wandless magic, politics, Harry-gets-adopted-by-someone-else, family Gringotts vaults, all woven together in a way that's actually good. Her new one is the 'someone finds the Harry Potter books' plot given a makeover too.

So with Ron being good at Ancient Runes, she's just subverting Ron-bashing by making Ron a genuinely competent and likable character.
