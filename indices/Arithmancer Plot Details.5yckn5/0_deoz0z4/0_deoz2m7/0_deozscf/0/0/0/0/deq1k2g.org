I just read the story on your recommendation, and I'd have to contest that. I couldn't get through to the beginning of first year because of the flurry of cliches that weren't used in particularly good ways. I didn't see anything particularly impressive about her writing Harry getting a black belt before the age of 11, or about Harry and Hermione developing wandless magic as young children, or about Hermione's parents being named Dan and Emma Granger for the n-th story in a row...

It just reads like a really formulaic HHr adoption/Super!Harry story. In fact, I didn't see a single scene that wouldn't be seen in the probably-two-dozen other >100k word stories in the genre until... I want to say, the last scene of chapter 13? The one with the cute Twins scene. And by chapter 14, we're back to the same trite, formulaic events again, with Harry holding conversations in ultra-formal Pureblood Style, then dropping it and admitting he doesn't like talking so formally very much, at which point his conversation partner responds with relief and gratitude- come now, how many times have we read through that exact same scene in other stories?
