I normally defend Hermione-centric fics and /Arithmancer/ in particular, but, yeah, there's at least one cringeworthy moment I can remember off the top of my head where Harry shouldn't have needed Hermione's help. I even wrote the author about that. (Perhaps I should've volunteered to beta-read back when the fic was getting started. I don't know if White Squirrel would have accepted, though.)
