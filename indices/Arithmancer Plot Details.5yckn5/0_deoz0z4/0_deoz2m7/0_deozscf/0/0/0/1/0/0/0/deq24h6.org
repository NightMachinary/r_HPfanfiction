I don't have that much of a problem with Bubblehead Charm. (He didn't use it in canon, either.) I suspect that he might have actually been able to cast it, but would he bet his very life on being able to sustain it deep under water for several hours, while focused on other things and possibly fending off attacks?

The bit that comes to mind for me was when Draco casts some slipperiness spell (or something like that) that sends Harry falling over the railing of some staircase, and Hermione casts a cushioning charm on the ground. Harry's a talented athlete, with excellent reflexes and dexterity. He would not fall, he would not need Hermione to save him in this case.
