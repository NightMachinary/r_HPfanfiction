I'm not disputing that. But she also took the "harry is useless sometimes" impression people can get from canon, and turned it up to 11 by taking out a fair few of his redeeming qualities. And highlighted it by making everyone else more competent. So this major supporting character who is usually the main character in my reading is brave and a good flyer and supposedly likeable, though I don't really see why. But he's the slow kid that the rest of them just put up with. At best, he's ordinary. And that just annoys me to all hell to read, which is a shame because I'm enjoying the rest of it.
