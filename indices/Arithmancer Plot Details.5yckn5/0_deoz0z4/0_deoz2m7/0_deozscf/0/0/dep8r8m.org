To me the main downside is how infuriatingly ordinary Harry is. At least up to the beginning of Lady Archimedes. You're going to tell me that Hermione is a brilliant Arithmancer? Awesome. You uplifted Ron into a decent student in Runes? Man that's really cool, what did you do for Harry? Oh, he's a bit less moody and way more dependent on Hermione. I also crippled his ability to learn anything he needs to learn, once he's sure he needs it. Now when the pressure is on and he needs it most, sometimes he chokes.
