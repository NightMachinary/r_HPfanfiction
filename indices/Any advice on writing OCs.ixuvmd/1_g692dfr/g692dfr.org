For Ginny, the easiest way would be to simply make Ron her twin. Other than either him being a year younger or her a year older, you don't have to change much, if anything.

Draco's sister would likely be just as much of a cunt as he is, only that she would be less likely to seek out confrontations with Harry since he is a boy.

Harry's sister is the most difficult to judge because a lot of the abuse which flew under the radar with Harry would be noticed if she was a girl (eg Dudley and his gang beating him up). So you could either have this result in less abuse for Harry since the sister protects him or have resentment because she does not get treated as badly as he does. It could also lead to some unhealthy dependency. Potters against the World by TemporalKnight goes down that route really well by showing them in a twisted incestuous relationship which everyone, including themselves, sees as wrong, but they are too broken to care.

As for general rules, don't make them overpowered. In fact, the more ordinary they are, the better. OCs are hated because they are often overpowered Mary Sues who have the whole plot revolving around themselves rather than blending into canon seamlessly.
