Spitballing, as I'm solidly a pantser, but I'd say think about at least 3 central motivations for the character that may sometimes conflict and one or two central flaws. once you get the personality down, then work on the backstory. What happened to the character, how did it affect them, and how did they respond?

Next, think about how the character views themself and how other characters view them.
