The best advice I ever got on writing characters was just to write everything you know about down, work out what niche you want them to occupy (ie. what purpose/role do they play in your story), then sit back and ask yourself questions about it. Like:

Why are they like that?

What might someone like that want? Why would they want that? What happened to give them that motivation, or to heighten/specify it?

What would they think about situation X?

What would they think about action Y?

What would someone meeting them for the first time think about them?

What might they be hiding?

What do they value? What do they not?

Who do they care about? Who do they hate?

(If they're not your main character) How do they know the protagonist? What's their relationship?

What would they do if A happened? How would they feel about what they did?

Do they have any distinguishing marks or features (eg. cheesy movie villain scar under the eye)? How did they get that feature?

And so on and so forth. Just keep following those questions (not just the ones I provided, I mean, but any questions that occur to you, if there's something you want to know about your character) where they lead until you feel you have a good understanding of who that character is as a person. That's basically what you want you're trying to do with a character - introduce them to your reader, then help them get to know them.

Oh, and you should write down the answers to those questions. You'll probably never use, mention, or even really allude to three quarters of it, but it'll help the stuff that does come up feel more real and like its part of a person, rather than just a collection of traits and characteristics. I tend to end up taking eight bulletpoints of personality, demeanour, behaviour, and attitudes and using those as my 'main character profile' to keep at my side whenever I'm writing that character, but your mileage may vary.

One of the most important things to remember about people is that everything within them interacts with something. There's nothing separate or distinct within you, it's all just parts of a whole. Sometimes those interactions will be synergistic - they'll work well together and make things greater (in the sense of bigger and of higher magnitude, synergy doesn't only affect the good stuff!) - and sometimes they'll interfere with or distort each other, which could hide motivations behind each other ("I want to do this because I'm angry at the world! No, no I'm not. I'm angry at you!") or give people doubts about things, or give them a 'time to find your bravery' type storyline.

So, yeah. Questions, answers, more questions about the answers, keeping in mind why you want this character to exist and that you want them to be a complete person.

EDIT - Also I very much second everything Floreat said. Consider this a "PREACH!" to that. :)
