Think about why a new character is necessary, how they can authentically get close to the main characters, and why the reader should care given that they have probably come to read characters and places familiar to them. This sounds harsh and obviously there /are/ some readers who want someone completely new, but for the most part writers of OCs have a mountain to climb in that fanfic readers don't want to read new characters and can resent feeling like a self insert has randomly been shoved in as a sibling/exchange student. It can absolutely be done well, but that purpose of the OC should be thought about very carefully.
