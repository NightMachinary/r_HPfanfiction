Not really, but it helps. A little bit of research into the Cthulhu mythos, H.P. Lovecraft (the original author), and the Necronomicon may be useful, but I think it's fairly self-explanatory. Basically imagine all sorts of eldritch horrors and beings of unimaginable comprehension intersecting with the Potterverse. Hope you enjoy!
