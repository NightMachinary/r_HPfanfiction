By the Divining Light and it's sequel Conlaodh's Song ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song]]) , as well as Dagger and Rose ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]]) fits as well as any fic I've read.

I really recommend them! Dumbledore trains Harry in dangerous, secret magic in both these fics.
