Best Hermione-centric fic I read is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]] by DianeCastle. Magic-less AU (though part of a series that includes crossovers with canon HP), Hermione, Ron and Harry are going to a school for spies - James Bond style. Covers the full 7 years and is complete. This story made me change my "HP without magic is garbage" opinion.

With regards to my own work, I aim to write a different story/theme each time I start a story, so I don't really have one I would value over the others.
