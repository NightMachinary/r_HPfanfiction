Because magicals either see muggles as cattle or the kind of 'adorable boii' we use to refer to our pets? Why would they waste money or magical paper on what they deem as barely above an animal - whether that animal be a lolcat or a tiger, it's still a waste to that mindset. Between that and the fact that magical medicine can apparently heal most injuries, they've no real reason to care. Why obliviate him? To Rowling-Magicals, the real question is 'why not obliviate him?'.
