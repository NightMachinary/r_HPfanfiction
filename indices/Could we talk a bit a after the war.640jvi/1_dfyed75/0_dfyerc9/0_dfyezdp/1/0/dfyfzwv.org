I'm currently writing a story dealing with the aftermath of an alternate Second Blood War. (The original idea was to start at the end of the war and handle the war in flashbacks, but that was dropped in the planning phase, and the story started with the lead-up to the war, then covered the war and is now in the aftermath stage.) It's just one of the possible ways to handle it - I've written other stories with different endings - but it's the first story of mine that focuses on all the trouble following a civil war.

I'd say most characters who lived through the war would not show much mercy to Death Eaters and their supporters. Not after showing mercy led directly to the second war. Harsh punishment, confiscation of wealth, and a campaign to wipe out blood purity as a culture would be their demands. How much of that they can push through depends on how powerful the bigots are, relative to the muggleborns and blood traitors, and how much purebloods bought into Voldemort's propaganda.
