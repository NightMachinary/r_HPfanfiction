  If you are too lenient, you'll likely end up with another war - as was shown with the Death Eaters happily flocking to Voldemort as soon as he returned

If you're too harsh, you might end with a "Hitler"-type persona who capitalizes on the disgruntled public after the treaty of Versailles - which was a big talking point of Hitler.

It's all a hard balancing-act. A big problem is that the NÃ¼rnberger Prozesse (Nuremberg Trials) had tried 200 just as the elite, and in similar trials over 1600 others were tried. That would be a sizable chunk of the wizarding population that would need to be tried, and a lot of people were killed, there is polyjuice, alibis are unreliable (Time-Turners and polyjuice) and everything is a huge clusterfuck. Death eaters are as ruthless (or even more ruthless in some cases) than the Nazi party was, so fear for your family was real.

The lenient approach hadn't worked last time, so maybe a more harsh approach is appropriate? What is the right balance? I'm totally for using veritaserum for all suspected adults, and also questioning them about suspected others - basically a 'web of distrust'. If you get accused by enough death-eaters that obviously can't resist veritaserum you're out, no matter what you can do.

The thing is: No method is perfect. The more strict you get, the more likely you'll get innocents. It's really a bad situation. I'd just hope that the worst offenders died during the Battle of Hogwarts.
