Colubrina's Lady of the Lake has the Order Of the Phoenix as corrupt, vindictive, and dissolute, but very much enjoying the fruits if victory by Pureblood expropriation. (She's a Slytherin AU writer, so a Ron-scorned Hermione and Malfoy organize a Slytherin countercoup against Griffin dorsal whose worst traits come on because they've not process the trauma of the war) but the politics feel as vicious as I'd expect.

Vera Rozalsky's Amends has that kind of phenomenon, too. Child soldiers dusting and bystanders wearing muggle clothes under open robes (it's a fashion, since Harry and Hermione did it) and a death squad in the Aurors killing Slytherins.

More on this later, I'm at work.
