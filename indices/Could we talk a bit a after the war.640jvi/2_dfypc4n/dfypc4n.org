Before going into my thoughts on what may have happened after the battle, I just want to say that I am torn about wanting Rowling to actually write a narrative about this time period.

On one hand, it is infinitely interesting to read about what happens next, both on a very personal, character-driven level and on a more macro-level. Harry and the others have just gone through an incredibly emotional experience and now can focus on themselves without the specter of Voldemort getting in the way.

How does Harry cope with the possible survivor's guilt? What about the fact that he completed his life's purpose at 17. Does he pick up with Ginny right away or do they struggle to come back together? How does their relationship even work with everything that's happened? How does he deal with being vindicated but also now the most famous and admired wizard in the world?

On the larger scale, how do they round up the Death Eaters and how do they go about pursuing justice in a world run by bribes, fear and enough bigotry to allow such persecutions of muggle-borns? How do they bring muggleborns back into society? How does kingsley reform a corrupt Ministry? How does he balance justice, freedom and security? Does he restrict freedom of the press since the press was complicit in allowing Voldemort's rise in the first place?

These questions are really interesting! But...

If Rowling were to actually try to tackle this story, it would vastly different in tone than the original series. And then, is it really Harry Potter or something different? Harry Potter worked and was so beloved because a series of different elements created it. My fear is that actually writing something that explores this post-battle world takes away the magic that made the series so great.

Regarding my thoughts on what actually happened, I think it was a very tough balancing act between seeking justice on those who were Death Eaters and sympathizers and not falling into another repressive regime that stifled the rights all in the name of restoring order. The actual heroes of the war, specifically Harry and the DA, were still too young to take control. They all either went back to school or entered the Ministry at low-level positions. I'm sure Kingsley wisely decided to get so many into positions to start rooting out the old elements, and I'm also sure a lot of the Ministry staff either fled, were arrested, or otherwise had disappeared from their roles, necessitating a lot of new blood to fill them. People who sympathized with Voldemort were ousted and people like Arthur Weasley elevated.

Since Rita Skeeter is canonically still around years later, my guess is the press was largely left alone.

I think years after the battle, the DA is still widely popular and thus the reforms Hermione wants to push are able to be made.

The big issue that I'm not sure they solve is what to do about the families of death eaters. You need to reintegrate them into society, but judging by how Draco is treated in CC, I doubt society allowed that.
