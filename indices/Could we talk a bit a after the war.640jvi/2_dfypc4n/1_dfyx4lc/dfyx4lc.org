  If Rowling were to actually try to tackle this story, it would vastly different in tone than the original series. And then, is it really Harry Potter or something different?

Since they made it to the top after 20 years, I guess the new story will be a mixture of "CSI", "Homeland", and "House of Cards". I thought about the "West Wing", but the politics in magical Britain were a lot dirtier and the struggles a lot deadlier. Probably JKR was probably right in not writing more, because there would be no way our heroes could avoid doing lots of nefarious things or 'necessary evil'. Politics and power struggles are inherently ugly, just following JKR on Twitter will give you an idea how much mud is being sling around, and she's not even fighting for control or engaged in personal life and death struggles.

  Regarding my thoughts on what actually happened, I think it was a very tough balancing act between seeking justice on those who were Death Eaters and sympathizers and not falling into another repressive regime that stifled the rights all in the name of restoring order.

After falling to 2 coups within 10 months, I think Ministry's authority and reputation were in tatters. First, it rolled over without a fight against Voldemort and his genocidal terrorists; then its own fighting force got destroyed mostly by teenagers. If this was a RL institution, it would become a laughing stock in the eyes of the public and lose its legitimacy. This Ministry had to be rebuilt from ground up.

In such revolutionary times, a coherent and organized armed force would be the ultimate arbiter of power. Purging the Wizengamot of the Old Regime and making it an elected body should be a first step.
