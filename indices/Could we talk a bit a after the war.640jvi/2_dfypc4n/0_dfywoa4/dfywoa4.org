At the very least, they should have rubber stamped Hermione's house elf reforms right away, and then hired her at a high position in the Ministry upon her gradutation. She might be young, but too many Ministry employees have disgraced themselves irrevocably during the war. In a similar way, the DA should have formed - those willing - the backbone of the Auror force. With regards to the press, the Wizarding Press didn't need more freedom; it needed accountability. It was running rampant even before it became the Ministry's mouthpiece. I think those Death Eater family members who were not involved in crimes were integrated easily enough. Draco, which many seem to forget, committed horrible crimes before he finally changed sides. He almost murdered several people, was instrumental in letting a horde of monsters enter Hogwarts, and was a mouthpiece for Voldemort for years before that.
