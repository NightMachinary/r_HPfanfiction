I think the previous commenter meant the US government, who had instituted wide reaching government programs and regulations after FDR was elected.

--------------

In my version of postwar magical Britain, I see the government tightening in following areas:

- Expansion of police and surveillance powers
- Increased protection of Muggles, which meant more surveillance of magic use in the country (actually very important for maintaining SoS, ICW would like it)
- Zero tolerance toward Blood Purity ideology
- Vetting of Ministry staffs and of positions in other public institutions
- Anti-discriminatory laws (e.g punishments for denying services to Muggleborns, half-breeds, and other magical creatures)
- Establishment of an intelligence agency as a counterpart to MI6 (Auror office would be the equivalent of MI5)
- More Ministry involvements in investigating criminal activities at Hogwarts

But the government would be more accommodative in other areas:

- Turning the Wizengamot into a democratically elected body (my head canon says it used to be hereditary)
- Separation of legislature and judiciary (Wizengamot used to assume both roles)
- Equal legal status for all sapient magicals
- Social welfare programs for disadvantaged magicals, such as foster care for orphaned children
- More involvement and representation for parents of Muggleborn students, such as periodic visits of Hogwarts, demonstrations of magic by their children, legal status in wizard court...
- Remove Dementors once and for all
