fantastic write up! This is exactly what I think would happen as well, and it makes me really happy that someone expressed it. The first 2 paragraphs are definitely a bit understated among other discussion sometimes, good points.

I think that the Aurors were mostly FBI-esque, but I bet now there will be specializations like you mentioned, with a CIA branch/intelligence gathering effiency development, and some sort of SAS group. The Hitwizards would have to then adjust their responsibilities as well.

I think something we haven't touched on is foreign relations with other ministries, and the lack of intervention or lack of communication. I'm sure its because Fudge delayed any progress by denial, but even after getting sacked we get no canon for it. I think that besides any reasonable fanon for HBP int'l relations, we will see a huge boon in int'l relations come the New Wave in the ministry. I think that we'll see the understaffed ministry get huge infusions of staff, money, and updated magical infrastructure akin to the WWII rebuilding era from governments around the world.

You bring up a good point about Ginny. *Digression*: I had this idea of some interesting one shot where Ginny is too limited by the market monopolizing Daily Prophet and is continually seeing how their revenue source has increasingly pushing their institutional gossip/rumor mill agenda specific to each department, and ends up joining another paper, poaching all the best sports journo talent (and eventually more) and weakening the Daily Prophet's market and cultural domination. *Anyways*, your point about Ginny's inherent power gave me pause, and made me think about how she really does have sway. How she uses it would be interesting, because while the paper could definitely fold under the pressure of her connections, it could definitely swing the other way if things become unpopular for whatever the Ministry is doing vs the Prophet readerbase demographic.

It's funny you say Harry's private army, because while Aurors are usuallymuch less about direct fights than say, hitwizards (right?), his Aurors could be his Special Ops or SWAT team, if you wanna run within this fun idea.
