How to finish off Voldemort's remnants would be a delicate matter, consider following cases:

1) Ex Snatchers A and B were opportunistic thugs through and through, and decided to exploit Ministry's temporary lack of manpower to curry favor with the new regime. After all, that Potter kid offed the immortal Dark Lord and that Weasley matriarch killed the dreaded Lestrange Bitch in single combat. Such powers were not to be trifled with. Better join them now when they still needed people. Cook up some sorry tales about being press-ganged (partly true) and deliver some marked ones to the Ministry would set you up nicely.

2) The Dark Lord's Inner Circle was among the richest of magical Britain, pissed off winners would undoubtedly make them PAY. Poor Death Eater C didn't have much gold, hadn't really committed any major crime apart from a few vandalism and a couple imperiuses for fun. On the bright side, he happened to know a fleeing Inner Circle member's hideout, so C stood a good chance in avoiding prison if he turned early. He might even profit handsomely if he offed that inner circle member.

3) Ministry bureaucrat D was a believer in blood purity, although D rarely expressed his/her opinions publicly. However, D had access to many Muggleborn addresses, and D happily supplied these to Voldemort's regime. After the Battle, he/she tried to escape justice by staying low again, like last time, but his victims were not that easily fooled.

How should the above people be punished (or rewarded)?
