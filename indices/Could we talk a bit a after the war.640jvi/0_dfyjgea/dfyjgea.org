The Battle of Hogwarts created a huge power vacuum as a result. Not only did most Voldemort's Inner Circle and Death Eaters go down, even the Ministry's own forces had to be decimated since Minister Thickness himself was drafted to the frontline. This Battle had to be so bloody that JKR skimmed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/54c4y9/battle_of_hogwarts/d80mg1b/][those gory details]] mostly. By default, the DA and what remained of the Order became the only credible and organized military after the Battle.

Harry had to be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would get themselves organized and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. The Ministry would be in no shape to resist their wraths.

I think their entire generation was fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. Many more traumatized people of magical Britain would also demand massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major shortcoming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

After the First War, the public went easy on Voldemort's sympathizers, and watched where that led to. But as the phrase 'Fool Me Once, Shame on You; Fool Me Twice, Shame on Me!' goes, they would more likely to go overboard this time. Harry and his friends, in their zeal to prevent the rise of another Voldemort, might have created a much more controlling government as the result. Harry apparently was very successful in his job, since he became the youngest police chief ever in 2007. He seemed to often fight on the front lines himself, and would have earned the loyalty of his troops. It would not be too far fetched to consider Aurors to be his private army.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?
