OK, how about she wss staring at Draco and added an explosive ingredient. It explodes and Snape confronts her in the Hospital wing, she blames the Gryffindors but Snape does a bit of subtle legimency and gets so pissed off at her for both lying to him and paying no attention at all to her cauldron that he actually gives her detention.

Then you could have that Malfoy laughed at her when she was covered in corrosive potion goo whereas she sees HP looked worried bish-bash-bosh set-up for your detention.

Sorry mate but I haven't read enough good HP/PP fics to give you much help.
