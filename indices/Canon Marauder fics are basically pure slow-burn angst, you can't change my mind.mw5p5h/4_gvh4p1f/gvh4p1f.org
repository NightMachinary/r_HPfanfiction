And that is exactly why I don't read them. Give me an AU with a happy ending and a weird premise/pairing any day of the week and I'm there but I literally can't sit and force myself to read something when I know how unbelievably tragically it's all going to end. I read fiction to get a break from all the heartbreaking sadness in the real world and those stories do not (IMO) lend them to that kind of “escape”
