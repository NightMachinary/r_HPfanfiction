I love these types of fics honestly. I can't enough of good canon-compliant Marauder era stories. I love the Pride and Prejudice element of Lily/James, the coming of age of a group of friends in the backdrop of an imaginably horrible war to come. It really brings home many things that fans often don't really appreciate in the series which is the tragedy of the situation at the start of PS. Basically these kids who lost their lives having just found love in the middle of the war. This tight group of school friends growing apart in the real world and distrusting each other. A kid who's racked by insecurities and jealousy who ends up killing his first real friend. And of course, the baby who never really knew any of it.

I genuinely think if JK was smart she'd stop making new stuff to bolt onto the books and start a proper prequel series detailing the rise of Voldemort and the lives of the kids and make it a similarly aged series of books. It's got many complicated characters. You have a spoilt rich kid growing into a mature and responsible person, a muggle born girl learning to grow out of a toxic friendship, a boy slowly descending into darkness, a werewolf, black family drama and a ton of adventures to tell.
