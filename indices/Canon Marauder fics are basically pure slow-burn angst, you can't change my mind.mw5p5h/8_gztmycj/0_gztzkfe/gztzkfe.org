Yeah we agree with all that. And JK writing for a YA audience is actually not bad, I rather liked Cuckoo's Calling.

The only catch is that everything ends in a few short years and we all know that and god it's so fucking tragic I just can't do this to myself for long. MWPP is good in small doses when I want a cry but not otherwise!
