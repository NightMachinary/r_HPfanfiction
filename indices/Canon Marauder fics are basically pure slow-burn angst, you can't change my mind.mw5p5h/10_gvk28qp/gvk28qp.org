There's a reason I don't read canon-compilant Marauder-era fics at all. Sure, I typically read Snape-centric, but I can't say his fate is any better, even if he does survive the first war in the end. I wouldn't read canon-compilant fics if I wanted to read Marauder-centric either. I detest downer endings.
