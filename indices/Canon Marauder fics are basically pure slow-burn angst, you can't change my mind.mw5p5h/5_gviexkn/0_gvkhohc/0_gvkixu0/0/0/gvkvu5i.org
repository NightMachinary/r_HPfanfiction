I think we all enjoy it a little too much...

Werewolf girlfriend? OC or Lupin m-f transgender? I wrote a fic with Lupin being the main supporting character dealing with identity. I didn't want to write from her actual perspective because I only know that particular struggle on a second hand basis. Some of that story was quoted directly from my friend Michelle telling me how she felt growing up after she received bad news from her doctor. Lupin's identity as a werewolf added to her struggle as well, of course.
