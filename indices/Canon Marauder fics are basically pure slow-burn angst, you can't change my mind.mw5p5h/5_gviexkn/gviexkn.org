I just wanted to say, I love how you called it Vold War I. I hadn't heard that yet.

As for your actual post, I agree with your assessment. I still read them once in a blue moon if it seems like the author is attempting to give us their perspective of a character's view or development. I enjoy AU Mauraders' Ear fics though. Especially if it's somewhat canon compliant and you get to question which canon occurrences will be kept.

A /very/ LF I'm writing now, (starts during ME) I killed off Vernon and shipped Sirius and Tuney. I renamed Dudley and put him in Ravenclaw bc Harry barely knows any of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Considering there's 2 or three Gryff girls in his own year we don't know in canon, I figured why not. I'm having fun with it.
