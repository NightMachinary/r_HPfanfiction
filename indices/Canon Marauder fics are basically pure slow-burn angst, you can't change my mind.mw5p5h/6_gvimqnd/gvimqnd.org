i read all the young dudes and i basically just cried the entire second half of the fic. during the hogwarts years, it's easy to avoid the fact that it's all going to crash and burn. but during the war? oh god, it just breaks my heart. i was sobbing the entire time. idk how i even got through it.

these days, i tend to only read short canon marauder fics because any longer and that will just make me dehydrated from the tears.
