It's for sure on Spotify, but I think it's on Apple podcast too. Be prepared for tangents, but overall Claire and Kat do a great job at keeping me engaged. Season 1 is pretty rough, but if you can hold out until season 2 it gets much better. They update every Friday!

Because of rule 8 I don't think I can link it. While any sexual content involving minors is between minors, I don't want to risk it. If you go to either ao3 or ffn and type in Debt of Time you should be able to find it.
