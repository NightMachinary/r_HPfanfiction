THE DEBT OF TIME BY SHAYALONNIE!!!!

Sorry, it's one of my favorite fics. It's a novel length (like equal to books 1-4 plus some of OotP iirc) sirimione where Hermione gets sent back in time and lives through the marauder years. It's seriously amazing. Like, I don't even consider Deathly Hallows canon anymore, Debt of Time is my new canon. Just make sure to have a box of tissues nearby because there are some serious cry moments. Shaya (the author) does a very good job of combining canon moments with her story, and honestly her continuity is better than she who shall not be named. Some things will stay the same (James and Lily will still die) and some things kind of change. I won't say anymore, but yeah. It's amazing. I won't link it because there are some incredibly explicit scenes and I'm not 100% on the rules, but there's two versions. The ffn version is the tamer version of the two, and the ao3 version is the incredibly explicit version.

There's also a podcast going on right now called Firewhisky and Honey. The hosts read a chapter every week. Right now they're on chapter 72. So if listening is more your thing, that's an option too! They're reading the ffn version, though I still wouldn't listen to it with younger ears around or in public. You can find it on Spotify for sure.

Edit: put in podcast location
