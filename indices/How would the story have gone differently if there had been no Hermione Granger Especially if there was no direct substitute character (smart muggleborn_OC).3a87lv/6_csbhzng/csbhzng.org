Harry and Ron would probably actually get into /less/ trouble on balance since Hermione wouldn't be acting as an academic crutch. Less free time to screw around and poke their noses in.

That said, their background research and problem-solving would involve a lot more magical duct tape and considerably less information. They may or may not pick up a different "circle" of people- Ron was reasonably social, but Harry was just as much of a loner thanks to (lack of) nurture as Hermione was at first.
