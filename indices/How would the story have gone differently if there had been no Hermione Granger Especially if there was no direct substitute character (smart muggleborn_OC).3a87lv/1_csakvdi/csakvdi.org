Well, there are two ways that story could go-one, Harry does actually descend into an academic tailspin. However, there are two issues with that idea, namely the degree of isolation Harry experiences with Ron as his only friend and the level of support he's likely to get from teachers once it becomes obvious that his studying discipline is as bad as Snape suggests it to be.

The second direction is the one I would choose, though, especially after first year; essentially, Harry is discouraged from doing better than Dudley at school in most fanon stories (cannot remember if it's canon or not, so I'll just put fanon there) and is reprimanded when he does better than Dudley. When he gets reprimanded by the staff (possibly by Dumbledore himself should he get more than one troll grade), who know full well what he is capable of and cannot understand why he seems to be worse than Ron, well, I think that would change a few things.

Basically, he was never encouraged by his relatives to study, so despite the fact that he hides in the school library before Hogwarts and probably, as a result, enjoys reading, he does not see good grades as worth working towards.

In canon, Hermione becomes somewhat of a crutch, allowing him to focus on topics of interest while the girl basically points out the bits he absolutely /has/ to study. Without her, he is not told what is and what isn't worthy study material and therefore ends up having to check it all out to figure it out. And given his parents' smarts as well as the crazy insane level of curiosity the boy exhibits (not to mention his Deus Ex Machina-level eye for detail, especially when noticing Chekhov's guns all over the place), it wouldn't be long before boy wonder stumbles upon something of interest that gets him to study.

Now then, academia aside, Hermione played a key role in the series. Without her, Harry wouldn't have had a third opinion on whether to go Gryffindor or not ('Dumbledore went there' indeed). He wouldn't have had to go after the troll. He would probably have been thrown off his broom during his first quidditch match. Ron would have been his only companion to Draco's duel, meaning no alohomora spell and, thus, no Cerberus encounter. And even if he did, the whole 'there's a trapdoor' would have gone unsaid/unnoticed. There would have been nobody to point out that Hagrid raising a dragon in a wooden house was a bad idea, there would have been only two people dragging said dragon through the castle, the search for who Nicky Flamel is would have either taken a lot longer or never happened and Neville wouldn't end up petrified on the floor. Oh, and she wouldn't be there to set Snape's robes on fire either.

More widely, Harry would have had no direct emotional involvement in; muggleborn rights, house-elf rights, pureblood discrimination, general creature rights etc. There would have been no polyjuice potion in second year, time travel in third year, implicit support in fourth year, DA in fifth year, UST in sixth year and camping companions in seventh year.

That is, if Harry survived until seventh year which, without either additional support or a very, very thorough change in attitude when compared to canon/vast majority of fanon, is practically impossible.

Basis for reasoning here; Harry's the most passive wizard this side of Rincewind. Motherfucker spends the entire series reacting rather than trying to get ahead. What's even more frustrating is that there's so much fanfiction trying to make him 'independent'-i.e. more active-that Sturgeon's Law comes and bites us all in the ass on this one.

Quite honestly, I think Hermione's one of my favorite characters in the series simply by virtue of kicking Harry in the ass whenever he gets stuck in a rut. Without her, prepare for canon to be derailed via nuclear detonation very quickly.
