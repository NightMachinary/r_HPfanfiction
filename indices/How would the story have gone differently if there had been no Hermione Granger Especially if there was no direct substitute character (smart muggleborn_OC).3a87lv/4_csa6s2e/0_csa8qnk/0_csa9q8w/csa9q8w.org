It depends on how the OP is read. If you remove Hermione from the stories as is, with no change to Harry or someone(s) stepping in, then there is very little chance that the stories can remain very familiar. In that case no Harry wouldn't improve- but then he would be a bystander to the Philosophers Stone and so on down the years.

However Harry Potter if anything is a boy who gets into situations beyond him and somehow overcomes. This being the case and if reading the OP as 'what would change in the stories?' (and still retain a resemblance to canon) it would be that Harry's persistence leads him to overcoming the obstacles. This would almost certainly necessitate an academic improvement. for example: follows/overhears Snape- find out about the PS, hit the books and find info on the stone, hear growling behind locked door- find and learn charm to unlock, look beneath trapdoor- identify plant, find weakness, and learn spell etc. i.e. Harry puts himself in situations that require him to overcome his usual tendencies (duress) therefore he improves even though Hermione isn't there. Again the alternative, you are right, is that he remains mediocre, probably a little more so, in many magical fields. But not 'much more' mediocre as I somewhat disagree that Hermione's study guides, lectures, and useful spells did /that/ much to make Harry a notably competent wizard- at least he doesn't /show/ that he has continued learning loads anyhow.
