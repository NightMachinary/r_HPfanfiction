Lolwut. You make it sound like Hermione would /crucio/ them or something if Harry and Ron didn't do their homework.

I doubt either Harry or Ron would be affected too much as far as academics is concerned. They would put off stuff for longer at first, but they would learn soon enough after they get in trouble for unfinished Homework.

For all the Hermione masturbation in this thread, I'll point out that Hermione would have spent a long time in social isolation had it not been for Harry and Ron. Not that she would have lived for long -- the Basilisk would have killed her had Harry not been her friend and told her about the voices in his head, which was what led Hermione to figure it out and carry mirrors at the first sign of hissing.
