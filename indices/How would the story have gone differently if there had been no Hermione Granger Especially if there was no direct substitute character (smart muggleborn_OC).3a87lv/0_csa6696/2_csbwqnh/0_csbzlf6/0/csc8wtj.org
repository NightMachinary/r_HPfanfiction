15y/o Muggle!Hermione from option 1 would presumably still be hugely intelligent, so she could be a scientist perhaps. It's not too far a stretch to have her possibly in a university course a few years early, and her grounding in natural/chemical sciences at that late stage could possibly surpass/match some of the teachers or professionals who (going by canon) only learn the magical versions of those subjects.

I can see her catching up on and making new forays into at least Potions and Transfiguration based on her existing knowledge of how chemicals, atoms etc. interact. She'd probably be balanced by struggling with charms and any of the more esoteric elements of magic.

In fact I can almost see her being brought into the fold and then quickly recruited by the Order as an advisor, perhaps striking up a quirky friendship with Tonks, rather than with the (at this stage) more immature Ron, Harry, and Ginny, who might have thus far been allowed to grow up just as normal kids.
