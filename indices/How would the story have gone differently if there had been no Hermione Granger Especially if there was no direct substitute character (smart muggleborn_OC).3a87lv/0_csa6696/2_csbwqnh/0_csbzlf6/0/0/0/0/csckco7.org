There's a line about them wanting her to use muggle dentistry/braces to shrink her teeth, but noting about her being a dentist.

Her parents might push her, but normally pushing a kid involves making sure they're taking honors classes or maybe maybe skipping ahead a year. Pushing normally doesn't involve a 14yo girl taking college-level chem classes. It can, but that's not the norm even if you're the parent who pushes. Also, I don't think we can presume that because her parents were educated (and it's worth noting that being a dentist in the UK only takes a 5 year bachelor and about 1 year of training) they would push her into much much higher levels.

And it comes back to what I said earlier about Hermione falling apart in PA. She's smart and motivated, but she really did not handle extra classes well.

You're right about the switch having an impact, but Harry performs on the same level as Ron and never really suggests that he believes his muggle upbringing to be a significant barrier to his academic success.

But she doesn't know anything about magic at this point. Maybe she's already taken her Chem GCSE at 15, but I'm not sure I genuinely think that would help her understand magic. I remember what I learned in chem, and I don't think it's that related. And even if there were parallels, Herminoe wouldn't notice them right away because she knows nothing about magic at all. She's not going to walk in and go "I know exactly how to mix the lacewing flies and the frogspawn because I already took my Chem GCSE." It's more like "I know how to correctly measure out the frogspawn."
