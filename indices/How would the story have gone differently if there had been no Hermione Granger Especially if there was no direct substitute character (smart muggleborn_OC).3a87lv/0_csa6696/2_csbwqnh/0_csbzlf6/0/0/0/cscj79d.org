Well, possibly. Canon/fanon is hazy on Hermione's intelligence.

I would also add though that there might be an argument for muggle/magical being a divide here. Pure-muggle Hermione would have been learning the same kinds of things from age 1 to 15; her middle-class, medical parents would likely aid if not push her (I'm pretty sure there's a line from canon that they wanted her to be a dentist), rather than shifting from one educational system into a completely new one at age 11.

In that context, to /still/ be top of her class despite presumably having had 11 years less magical education - at least in terms of theory and introductions, as well as picking up things from family members, she may be more intelligent than you give her credit for. That same intelligence honed from her early years on the same subjects without a switch in focus might be more advanced, if not quite a prodigy - and switching focus to magic at a more advanced level of muggle knowledge might well open the door to some innovative new understandings.
