I'm not sure. Hemione's smart, but she's not a prodigy. Her abilities in the books are in part because she puts in the effort. We see her at the top of her year, but we don't see her taking her N.E.W.Ts at 15. You could argue that she would perform better if she wasn't distracted by Voldemort-related adventures, but she kind of fell apart when she tried to take extra classes in PA. If she hadn't made friends with Harry/ron maybe she would have been more advanced in a few of her classes but I don't think she would be publishing papers in Transfiguration Today. And I'm not sure I think things would be significantly different in the muggle world.

And while she would be a fast learner, she wouldn't be able to master 5 year's worth of magical knowledge in a few months. Even with a scientific knowledge that might (or might not) help her.
