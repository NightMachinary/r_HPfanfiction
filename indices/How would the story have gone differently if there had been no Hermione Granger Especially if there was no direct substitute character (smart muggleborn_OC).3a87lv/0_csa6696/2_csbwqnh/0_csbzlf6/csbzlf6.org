I was trying, but I can't figure out the best way to go about it.

Option 1 is to throw 15yo Hermione into the wizarding world as it would be if she didn't exist. So she shows up at Grimmauld Place, Ginny/Ron/Harry (?) are BFFs and she's an outsider who slowly forms a friendship with them that's still substantially different than the one we see in canon.

Option 2 is to throw 15yo muggleworld!Hermione into the canon universe, where she did enter the wizarding world. So either she's interacting with canon!Hermione, she's switched bodies with canon!Hermione and Harry/Ron want their best friend back. Either way, Hermione is presented with the person she could have been if she had entered the wizarding world.

The problem is that I still want Hermione to be useful and grow to be a solid member of the “team”. I don't want her to be a damsel in distress. And unless I portray her as a magical Mary Sue who's O.W.L.-level within two months, she's going to be lagging behind Ron/Harry magically. So she has to have some other skill or value that puts her on equal footing.

She also has to have a reason to enter the magical world (and stay for at least a short amount of time).

One idea I had was to give her visions of canon!Hermione's life or make her some kind of weird seer, but I don't love it.

Seriously if you (or anyone else reading this) has any ideas, I'm totally open. Would love to actually write this (even though I have like 8 other things going on), but can't figure out how.
