Those sound like fun reads.

Option 1 would be a massively handicapped Hermione from what I can tell. Two main drawbacks:

1) she is behind five years in magical education compared to the others. And for all the genius!Hermione that seems to show up in fandom I don't see her catching up to all the rest in a short amount of time. That's not really a problem since even Harry with tutoring is nowhere near Dumbledore's or Voldemort's capabilities at similar ages. (Note: I actually like her much more as a character since she had to work for her ability instead of naturally being talented)

2) What reasoning would have a Hermione without any magical talent show up at Grimmauld Place? If this is around 5th year then it is serving as the HQ for the Order of the Phoenix. The only ones allowed would be people involved in the organization or those with close ties(i.e. the Weasleys and Harry).

Option 2 sounds iffy to me. Never been a fan of alternate universes for OOC reasons. And without canon Hermione it'd probably be much more of a crutch in the trio's quest to defeat Voldemort not being able to depend on canon Hermione's knowledge (unless it'll kick them into gear?).

I actually like your seer idea(Trewlaney 2.0, the irony). It could work to combine both options, toss a sheltered Hermione with no magical education into the Wizarding World a la option 1. Have her be of use by giving her visions of canon Hermione's life in the fight against Voldemort like in option 2.

P.S. Just found out you had an ff.net account from that Ginny diary thread! And a tumblr account! I really like your discussions and perspective on things so you now have a new follower on both. Nice job!
