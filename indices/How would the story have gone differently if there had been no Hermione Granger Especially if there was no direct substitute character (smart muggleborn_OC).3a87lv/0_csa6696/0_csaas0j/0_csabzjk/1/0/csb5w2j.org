I doubt it would be an extra year. After Quirrelmort failed to get the stone he would still be possessing a wizard. He would probably carry on with some other ritual to regain form. I doubt the time between PS and GoF was spent coming up with the idea, instead he was just regaining strength and waiting for another sap to show up and help him out.
