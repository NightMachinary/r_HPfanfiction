Good chance it would only be an extra year actually. Canon isn't all that clear but I suspect Ginny was an intentional target due to how the Malfoy's view the Weasley's.

The chances of the COS being found and Ginny saved drops dramatically without Hermione to piece together the puzzle. You now have a dead Ginny and a very alive Tom Riddle that has the benefit of only being recognizable to those that knew him before Horcrux production.
