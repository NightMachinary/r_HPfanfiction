  I actually had an idea for a fic like this, Hermione rejects Hogwarts and life goes on, and then she's somehow pulled into the wizarding world just after Voldemort returns.

But that would mean that she would miss out on a whole year of magical education! :D Seriously, I'm curious. There is a number of fics where Harry rejects/leaves the wizarding world, and the wizarding world (usually in the person of Dumbledore or Hermione) eventually comes to him, begging for his help with Voldemort, but Hermione doesn't have a Prophecy that makes her "indispensable".
