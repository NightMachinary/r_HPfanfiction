It's an intriguing premise, and if anyone knows of any fics with this idea, I would be interested to read them.

The sarcastic answer is that Ron/Harry would have been dead before their 12th birthdays, but I'm not quite sure.

I think Harry/Ron wouldn't have been as motivated to do the background work, Hermione was not only spearheading things like the research of Flamel, she was prodding them to make sure they looked into it too.

I actually had an idea for a fic like this, Hermione rejects Hogwarts and life goes on, and then she's somehow pulled into the wizarding world just after Voldemort returns.
