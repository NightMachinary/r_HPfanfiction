At the very least, the school shuts down second year after Ginny dies. Otherwise, Harry gets poisoned on Snape's trap first year and Voldemort likely gets away (without the stone, most likely). In fact, Harry would just by lying there poisoned when Voldemort gives up and heads back out...so I think that's it for Harry one way or another.
