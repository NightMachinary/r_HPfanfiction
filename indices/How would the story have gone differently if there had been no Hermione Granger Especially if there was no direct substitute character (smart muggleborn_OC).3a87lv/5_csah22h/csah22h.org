If it's one of the manipulative!Dumbledore stories --- the ones in which Dumbledore is the grand designer of all the unlikely events with “lucky” outcomes that Harry undergoes --- then all that happens is Dumdledore simply readjusts his plans and pulls on some different strings.

So, for instance:

- In the 1st year, Hagrid is much more obvious in his “accidentally” blundered out clues and the Potions puzzle is much more easier;

- In the 2nd, Ginny is able to “fight for” enough control against Diary to send a SoS letter to her saviour with all the necessary explanations before being spirited away to the CoS;

- In the 3rd, Malfoy's self-preservation doesn't let him act like an idiot risking his life of an heir to a dangerous beast and the chaotic events at the year's end develop differently to allow Sirius to escape and Harry to cast the full-fledged Patronus;

- and so on.
