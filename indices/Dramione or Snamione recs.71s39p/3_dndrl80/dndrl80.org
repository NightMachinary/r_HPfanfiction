[[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607120210/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html]] Fire and the Rose. Due to a potions accident, Hermione and Snape end up switching bodies and have to live as each other without letting anyone know. Really well written and has some seriously funny moments. It has great characterizations as well.
