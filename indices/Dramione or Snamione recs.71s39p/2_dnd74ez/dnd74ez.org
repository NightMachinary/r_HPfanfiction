Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels). Not sure if this fits since it does have a fair amount of smut and a weird premise, but it's good. The plot gets kind of crazy at first, but this fic has surprisingly good and well thought out plotline so things that don't make sense may actually make perfect sense later. Definitely gets quite dark, and has some dubcon and some messed up parts and does have a good amount of explicit smut scenes but the plot is really good. Everyone is very in character (Snape is very canon and dark, with his sarcasm and cynical attitude) and the writing is good.
