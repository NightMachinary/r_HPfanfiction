A year or two, sure, to fit in with contemporary crossovers like SG1 or Buffy, but a decade or two is too much. Too much changes. For example, if you moved Buffy up by a decade everyone would have cell phones and half of the plots would fail, because they depend on things happening in multiple places at the same time and communication requiring meeting up somewhere. Similarly, if you move the Potterverse up by a decade or two, cameras would be everywhere and the statute of secrecy is long dead. The world changes! If you have Youtube, you have lots of other tech elements that kills the Potterverse working as it does in the books, and writers who do this NEVER keep track of that.
