If you have an epic idea and know what you want to do with your story, then take the time to get it right. Your readers will appreciate it and you'll feel happier with what you've accomplished. The downside is you have to come to terms with slower updates and having stories unfinished for awhile - This is really hard to do, but it's worth the effort/wait.
