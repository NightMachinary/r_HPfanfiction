Why not write it and take your time writing it? I have a full time job and a husband in med-school. I just write when I have the time. I started my fic in October 2013 and it's at 465,657 and it's barely half way done. And that's just the first story... I have two more after, but I love it and my readers don't mind waiting for the next chapter to come, because they understand I have a busy real life. If it's that you don't enjoy writing anymore, that's another situation, but if you love your story there's nothing wrong with just writing when you can.

And you can turn those boring chapters around. Maybe focus on character development during those scenes or other things like that. If you still enjoy your story keep at it. If it takes years, let it take years. It's a novel length fic, it's okay to take years to write it. Novels take years to write after all. AND hashing out the harder chapters will only help you improve for the more exciting ones! You could also just write those boring chapters, ask your beta how to make it more intriguing and just save them till the exciting chapter is ready. So post your other chapters with the exciting one.

You said your story was epic. To me that means you really care for it, so I just think a summary wouldn't make you feel good at the end of the day.
