  It's not that I don't enjoy the writing or Holly's story- usually I can bully my way through a blah chapter or two if I have an awesome scene to share. There's just a little too much blah between the beginning of Umbridge at Hogwarts to the fun point after Christmas, and then a gap of blah until we get to the crossroads chapter.

Skip the blah parts. Do the important parts as memories interspersed into the action, when needed, or have a summary/montage sequence covering some of the down-time. Readers don't like the 'filler' any more than writers, IMO.
