It's not that I don't enjoy the writing or Holly's story- usually I can bully my way through a blah chapter or two if I have an awesome scene to share. There's just a little too much blah between the beginning of Umbridge at Hogwarts to the fun point after Christmas, and then a gap of blah until we get to the crossroads chapter.

Maybe I just need to jump into writing those fun chapters and then back-write the path to get there. Usually that ends up requiring a rewrite of the fun chapter because the filling-in events deserve their own measure of cleverness- if it's boring for me, it has to be excruciating for the reader.
