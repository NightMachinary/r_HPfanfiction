Calibre with FanFicFare plugin is best for long term but for short term ( you're unsure about a fic but like to download and check it out) [[https://fanfictiondownloader.net/#/download][FanFictionDownloader]] is better. It's much faster than FFF.

By the way, FFDL requires Calibre for conversion (to epub for example), so if you're on Windows and don't have Calibre installed then download the following version. It has everything necessary.
