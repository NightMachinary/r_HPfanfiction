For what it's worth, this one is pretty good linkffn(10205249)

It's not perfect, there are some things that I don't agree with, and it is overly wordy, like, unnecessarily so. Aside from that though, it's pretty good, the characterization in particular (at least for Harry and Delphi) is very good, the others are a bit questionable, but I LOVE their characters.

Fair warning though, it's unfinished and I don't think it will be finished since it hasn't been updated in over a year and a half. Also, it does touch on some rather real world issues, racism and religion in particular. It doesn't get offensive or anything, but it definitely touches on it.
