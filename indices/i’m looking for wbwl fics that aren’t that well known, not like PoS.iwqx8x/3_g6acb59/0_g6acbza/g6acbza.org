  On that faithful Halloween night Nick Potter was hailed 'Boy Who Lived' his twin Harry was ignored in favour of the favoured famous son. Harry is pushed aside, when it comes to it what will happen? will Harry fight for a world that didnt want him or care about him? will Dumbledore, the Potter's and world grovell at his feet praying he will save them? Snarry/slash. What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that faithful halloween night? oh so many years ago?
