[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is probably my favorite WBWL story. But for less visible ones you could try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23149174/chapters/55401934][The Forsaken's Ascension]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]]. I'm also not entirely sure it counts, but I'll include [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1588111][Red Hair and Grass Blades]] which switches the roles of Neville and Harry.

Edit: removed Ink and Parchment | Blood and Bone as it is not a WBWL.
