linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) pairs Harry with an OFC who appears at Hogwarts. I won't say who she is as that is actually a fairly major twist in the fic's plot though.

Also, one of the very /very/ few vampire fics that is both decently written and not a twilight knockoff. Cheers
