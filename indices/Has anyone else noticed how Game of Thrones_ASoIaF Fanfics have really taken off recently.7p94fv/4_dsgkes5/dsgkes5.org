  Is it due to an older writer base or perhaps a writer base that attempts to mimic George RR Martin's attention to detail and world building?

Yes, absolutely these. I love Harry Potter, but absolutely anyone can read and understand HP. You kind of have to be at a certain level to get into Game of Thrones. I'm not trying to be elitist and indeed, the level isn't super high or anything, but I've seen so many friends tell me they couldn't understand or get into the TV show and not even try to read the books :(
