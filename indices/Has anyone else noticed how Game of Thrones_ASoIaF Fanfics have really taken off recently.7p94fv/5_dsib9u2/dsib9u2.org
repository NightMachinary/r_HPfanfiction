So a few things:

- As Anarchy mentioned, HPFF has been done /to death/. I've been reading HPFF since at least 2001-2002, and I'm fairly sure I've read every single possible idea that could come out of this fandom.

- I don't actually think GoT FF is all that much better on the whole than HPFF. Sure there's more /shit/ in HPFF, but it's been around longer and is much more popular. I tend to check the new/updated posts on Ao3/FF.net for GoT/ASoIaF, and there's plenty of terrible fics to go around.

- GoT FF is new and full of novelty, so of course we're going to love diving into it.

Don't get me wrong, I love reading GoT fanfiction and have actually stopped reading most HPFF simply because most of the stuff I like is either dead or complete. I just think that on the whole the level of quality is about the same (though I would argue that GoT needs more brilliant fics to rival the top level of quality in HPFF).

The one unfortunate thing about a new fandom (or relatively fresh at least) is that stuff you might really want to read isn't always there. I'm a huge fan of fics where Jon goes to Essos and travels around instead of going to the wall (or even leaving a few years before), but there are only a few fics that really do it. I /really/ want to read a good fic where Jon meets Aegon and works with him, or with Dany and invades Westeros. There just isn't that much out there unfortunately.
