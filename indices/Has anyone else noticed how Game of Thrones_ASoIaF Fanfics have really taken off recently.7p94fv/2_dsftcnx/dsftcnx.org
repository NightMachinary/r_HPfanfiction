Unfortunately, HPFF has been on the decline for years as the source material we have is a decade old (I don't think Fantastic Beasts will do enough to really boost writing) and the most popular ideas have been written to death already. However, the fandom is far from dead. Our 16k subscriber count that posts regularly is proof of that.

ASOIAF and GOT on the other hand, are at peak hype levels with the 6th book and last season on the horizon (hopefully). More and more fans will join the fandom, and with them will come writers with fresh ideas and a vast world to build on.
