Yeah, I think it's because of the older audience. HP fandom ranges from like 12 to 40+ year olds. I know authors in the HP fandom who are established authors with published books, and I know authors who haven't read a book in ages. GoT and ASOIAF, because both book and movie are for mature audiences, has older fans. Now, of course, if someone has a college degree and writes a fanfic, it's going to be better quality than someone who has yet to pass middle school.
