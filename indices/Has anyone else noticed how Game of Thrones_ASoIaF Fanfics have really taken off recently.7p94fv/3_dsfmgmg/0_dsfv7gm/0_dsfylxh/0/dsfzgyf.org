Yeah I agree. I feel like its alright to have Jon and Dany develop into slightly different people in an AU, but Oberyn is just so different than canon!Jon. Hopefully we don't end up with a character is Jon in only name.

I hope it gets back on track, introducing Oberyn to mentor Jon makes about as much sense as a fic where canon!Snape mentors Harry. Theyre just too different.
