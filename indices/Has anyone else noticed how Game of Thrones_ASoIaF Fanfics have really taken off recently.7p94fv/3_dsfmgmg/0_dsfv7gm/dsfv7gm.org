In regards to the no tolerance for san/san arya/anyone, I'm mostly in the same boat.

Speaking of boats though.... I've found that a critical mass of the Jon/Dany fics end up at the very least being highly entertaining. It helps that they are a canon pairing, and there are a lot of very clever AU fics where they meet much earlier than they did in the series. If you browse Ao3 for fics, I'd highly recommend checking out that tag. In particular, "Her Life and Her Death", a "Song for Dragons," and if you like fluff "Court of Bastards" are all worth a look.
