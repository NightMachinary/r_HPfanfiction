I haven't really seen any truly brilliant GoT fics yet, and I look fairly often. I have a bit of a hair trigger when dropping stories when author does stupid shit, so I might have missed a few gems (like, I have pretty much no tolerance for san/san or arya/anyone).

However, I think I can address this line -

"HP fanfictions put out nowadays aren't nearly the same quality as these aforementioned thrones fics."

I've been saying it for awhile now, but I think the HPFF community has been in a downward slide for years. I usually peg 2012 as being the turning point, as that was the last year where multiple great fics were being written. Like, I look back to 2017 and I can't think of a single long fic that I would consider a masterpiece that was written during that year. Sure, there's a few that have potential (Half-Blood Romantic gets thrown around a lot, but I don't think it's there yet). But, like if you look at all the popular writers of yesteryear, barely any of them write any more. When's the last time a story like Wastelands of Time or Forging the Sword came around? He'll, at this rate I would settle for an update to A Long Journey Home, squandered potential and all.

I think it important for a fandom to have some pillar stories, but they don't write themselves.. That and my reasoning above is why I think the Worm fandom still has a long way to go, but everyone keeps retreading the same few ideas. That fandom doesn't have A Black Comedy or a Skitterleap to point at and say "this is an example of a great story" so that's why there's just miles upon miles of decidedly average-to-mediocre time wasters and very few that I would even call good. If the GoT fandom can bridge that gap, I look forward to it.
