I agree with this sentiment. Especially because some of the fanfic about his own work is almost if not surpassing his quality of work. For example, "Dragons of Ice and Fire" by serpantguy is one of the best pieces of fanfiction (as a whole not just Thrones) I have ever read period. The world building, characterizations, and tone are so pleasant to read.
