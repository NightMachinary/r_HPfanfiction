I think it might look something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1921201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dance-of-the-Warrior][this]], one of the very early stories in the genre (dating back to 2004). While Harry indeed is furious with the Headmaster at one point (justifiably so), he nevertheless recognizes the need to work with him. It's a good example of how the IndyHarry theme can be done without bashing.
