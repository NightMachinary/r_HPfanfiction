A Marauder's Plan is literally the opposite of an Indy!Harry. Direct quote from chapter 62:

"Harry shuddered and squirmed closer to Sirius again, wanting to feel his warmth, hear his heartbeat and the steady rise and fall of his breathing; all the signs that told him the undeniable truth that Sirius was alive.

'Don't leave me!' said Harry desperately. 'Don't ever leave me! Promise!'"

Bear in mind that Harry is 14 in this scene, and not 6, as you'd assume from the text.
