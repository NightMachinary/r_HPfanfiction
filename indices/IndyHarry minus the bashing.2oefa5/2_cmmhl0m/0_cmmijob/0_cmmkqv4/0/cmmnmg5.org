Is there a category of fics where the adults make sane decisions? Cause I feel like most of the adults in Harry's life in canon are cray-cray. Thou I generally just rationalize it as simply "magic removes consequences from early childhood... so no learning to make sensible decisions for you Mr Wizard!"

Oooh! A shiny dark lord magnet! Lets hide it in a school full of children! And then all the teachers go along with this plan.
