True!

Hmm. I think White Squirrel's "The Arithmancer" makes a stab at this (although it's the adults in Hermione's life we really get a look at, and they make some sorta iffy decisions, but they clearly wrestle with balancing what Hermione wants, their desire to keep her safe, and what is ultimately best for her in terms of learning and growth- I think that's kind of my working definition of sanity, too.) And WS's other fic, The Accidental Animagus also does this too, some.
