Yeah, the categories themselves are pretty fluid, depending on who you talk to. At least for me, Indy!Harry carries a strong connotation of Harry giving the middle finger to everyone over the age of 20, consciously breaking from support systems, and going his own way. That's not a good thing in and of itself, by the way - that class of fic can be horribly cliched and stupid.

Nor is a Harry with a supportive family life a bad thing. I actually enjoyed most of what's in A Marauder's Plan - but that quote definitely rubbed me the wrong way. There's having a support system, and there's having a security blanket, and the Harry/Sirius relationship in that fic veers into the second category at times, and it's very grating.
