Hmm. I think I see the categories as a little bit more fluid than you are defining them? (Also, I think you are taking that scene way out of context, given the fact that Harry's spent a lot of the fic leading up to that point adapting to you know, an actual family relationship, and then had it yanked out from under him and put back together.)

Sirius is driving a lot of the action but Harry also has a lot of choices. I'm not sure- maybe there needs to be another category "Reasonable And Sane-ish Adults Helping While Teaching Proper Life Skills!Harry Fic?"
