Have you read A Marauder's Plan ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]])? It's not exactly an Indy!Harry in that he's not running the show on his own, but he's making a lot of decisions about his life and getting support to do so (From Sirius, primarily). He does have more resources, but they're not as out there as in a lot of the Indy!Harry fics, and a lot of them are social rather than financial, as well as indirect. One of the things I think it does particularly well is deal with the fact that relationships are rarely as cut and dried as canon Harry percieves things, and that you can feel more than one thing about a person at a time.And ooh, interesting stuff about forgiveness vs absolution and some other things around the edges- plus just a plain good solid AU what if plot. :)

I think one of the tricky things is that depending on where you diverge from canon, well, to get a kid who is very CLEARLY underage, 14 or 15 and looking younger, and have him manage to not just get shipped back off and told to listen to the adults, you've got to give him some pretty major guns on his side and fairly quickly.
