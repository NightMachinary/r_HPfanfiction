Majors guns... or a willingness to run and hide. I don't see Harry having anything against buying a cheap wizarding tent with a muggle repelling charm and living in a park. Honestly, even a normal tent would probably be an improvement in living conditions over the cupboard.

...Wait... why not a muggle repelling tent in the back yard of #4... Granted he only finds out these things exist in later books... but that seems like a distressing lack of curiosity for a small child that just discovered magic is REAL. Any Harry destined for independence would likely learn more random details like that much faster.

I have read Marauder's Plan... or rather I read the first 60 chapters... It seems I forgot to follow it, and missed 9 updates. IIRC, Sirius is the driving force behind Harry's independence tho... Its not anything Harry did for himself.
