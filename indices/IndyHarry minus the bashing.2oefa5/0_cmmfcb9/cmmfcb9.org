I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] is what you're looking for. It's a slow start, but after Harry gets to Diagon Alley it's pretty much exactly what you're looking for. Harry is 15, has only the resources he does in canon, and is pretty firm about just doing his own thing.

It's very much a character piece; the writing is good and the pace is slow at first. I remember really enjoying it, though.
