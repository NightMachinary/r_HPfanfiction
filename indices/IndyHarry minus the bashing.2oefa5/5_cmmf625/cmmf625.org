I would think Indy!Harry is Slythern!Harry, or maybe Ravenclaw!Harry.

I would imagine that one of his primary goals would probably focus on figuring out how to use magic outside of school (e.g. a la the now-removed Nos Tres Reges story).

Certainly Harry would be more proactive. In canon, Harry seems mostly reactive. Indy!Harry has goals (ambitions), and works to achieve them. Assuming he is still the BWL, he exploits that fact. Maybe he plays up his home life to the paper. Maybe he plays it up to purebloods.
