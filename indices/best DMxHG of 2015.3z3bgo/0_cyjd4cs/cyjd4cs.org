I just finished *Presque Toujours Pur* and I enjoyed it - linkffn(11153333)

A lot of people here seem to like *The Green Girl* - linkffn(11027125). Personally I didn't care for it. To me, Hermione was written as an OC that was given Hermione's name and I had a hard time getting over that. But like I said, many people like it and you might also.
