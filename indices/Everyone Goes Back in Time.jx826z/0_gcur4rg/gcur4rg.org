I think that Quirrell would die to massed spellfire from everyone that knew that he was possessed by Voldemort. Given that there were a lot of dead Aurors, and importantly Amelia Bones, there would be a lot of imprisoned death-eaters. Especially Malfoy. Add to that the absolute chaos that would run through the wizarding world as the people that didn't die try to come to terms with the foreknowledge of the people that did.
