No, I've read that fic and it's definitely not it. That one has four people traveling back and killing most of the Slytherins, but they also end up there themselves. The fic I'm thinking about has literally everyone in Harry's year coming back together. And then they all decide that the world will turn out better if none of them end up in Slytherin. The only other thing I remember is that Hannah has to be the one to convince the Hat to go along with the plan, which she does, except it swaps two students from the houses they planned. I don't know if the story even continued much after that.
