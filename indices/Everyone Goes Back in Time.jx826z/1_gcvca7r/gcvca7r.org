linkffn(Too Many Travellers by Inusitatus) has Harry, Tonks, Cedric, Sirius, and Remus all appear in their younger bodies when Harry is getting sorted. It then gets rather cracky. That's probably the closest you'll get.

linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram) has pretty much everyone except Harry independently traveling back in time. It doesn't really match your plot, but it's at least the same general theme.

I also know there was a story I once read where after the war, Harry's entire class travels back in time to before their first year, and I'm pretty sure they arrange things to ensure that none of them are sorted into Slytherin. But I can't find it now, and it's not exactly a perfect match anyway.
