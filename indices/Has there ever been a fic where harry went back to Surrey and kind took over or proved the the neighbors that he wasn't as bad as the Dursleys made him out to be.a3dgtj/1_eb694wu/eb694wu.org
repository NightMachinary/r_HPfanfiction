Self-promotion, and it's not set in Surrey, and this neighbor technically didn't know Harry had a bad reputation, so....... it doesn't really fit most of your criteria, but I feel like we have similar interests and that you might like this story anyway. Not sure how to link ff.net stories, it's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Runs Into An Old Muggle Classmate]].
