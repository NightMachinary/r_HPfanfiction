Same here.

I've been reading Hp Fanfic for 20 years - so at this point I have to be open to reading weird and wacky fics. Also, I've put off reading fics because I didn't think I'd like them and then they've been amazing enough times that I'll give pretty much anything a try for at least a couple of chapters.

I have been burned many times by AMAZING stories that have been abandoned though - that still hurts.
