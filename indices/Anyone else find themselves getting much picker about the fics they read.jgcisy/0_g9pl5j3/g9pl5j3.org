Yes. 100% yes. I found an old floppy disk (yup, been reading HP fanfic that long) with a bunch of really old fics saved on it. I tried to read one and holy shit was it horrible, but years ago I thought it was so good it was worth manually copying and pasting every chapter into a word doc to save it.

If anyone is interested in some ancient shit tier fics that you've probably never heard of let me know and I'll send them along.
