Go for it, a lot of that was written in the 1960s and 1970s. It might even be collectable. Yeah that's the way they published stuff back then, since there was no internet. If you know what's there (titles, authors) I know someone who might be able to make some recs. I'm not into slash myself and don't know much of the og Trek fic. The stuff I read was later and online.
