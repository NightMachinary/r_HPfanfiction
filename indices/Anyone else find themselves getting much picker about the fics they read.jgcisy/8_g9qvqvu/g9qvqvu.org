Yes.

Personally I think its because I'm getting older - and in particular because I have so much less free time.

Back in high school, or even university, I would read anything to pass the time. Especially since I didn't usually have the money to buy books, fanfiction was a blessing. (Although in hindsight, I regret the fact that I didn't ever think to go to a library...)

But now I have so little free time that I demand a higher level of quality. Plus I also have more spare cash, which means I can more easily fill what reading time I have with published fiction. So any fanfiction I read has to be able to compete with published fiction to be worth my time, which is a high bar to cross.
