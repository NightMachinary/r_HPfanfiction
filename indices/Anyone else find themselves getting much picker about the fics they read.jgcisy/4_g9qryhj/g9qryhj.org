I'm definitely not as far into extremes as OP.

For me to read it, a fic has to have the following:

1. Decent writing + minimal spelling mistakes.
2. The premise is interesting
3. The summary is well written
4. Does not have unannounced crack.
5. Does not bash characters.\\
6. Does not bash settings.

I would also like to see the following, but it is by no means required:

1. Old tropes used in new ways
2. Creativity
3. Places larger Author's Notes at the bottom of the chapter, not the top.
4. Addendum to 3: A large author's note is fine in the first chapter to talk about your fic before jumping in, particularly if it has problematic elements.
5. Avoids engaging in power level wankery. Does not nerf things author dislikes and buff things author likes.
