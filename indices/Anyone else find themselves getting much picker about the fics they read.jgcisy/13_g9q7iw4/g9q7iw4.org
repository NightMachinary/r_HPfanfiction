Not really. I find that restricting myself too much means I miss out on the fun stuff. I like clever ideas and seeing interesting concepts be explored and I'm not reading for ships so I'm not limited there (although, some dynamics I am not terribly fond of and some ships have characterizations that I don't really enjoy when they're paired together - but there are always exceptions). I might be on a Harry Potter binge or a Ginny Weasley binge or Nagini binge but it's usually because certain concepts and tropes tend to favour certain characters.

I love WIPs, rarely read anything that is complete unless I just happen to click on it, and tend to bounce between fandoms depending on what tropes and ideas are more prelevant in them when I'm binging (this week has been a lot of demension hopping and Time Travel, for example, so a lot of HP, Naruto and BNHA).

Good written stuff can be terribly dull, badly written stuff can have an entertaining and interesting core concept that makes my brain whirl so I don't consider grammar a measurement for how good something is as long as I can get through it.
