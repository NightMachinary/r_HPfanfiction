Oh yes! 100%! Sometimes I look back at the stories I've read before, not even fan fictions just on wattpad, and I have to wonder how I thought /this/ book was the best thing ever when the only “plot” was “he/she doesn't like me!” and has many spelling errors and ridiculous nicknames like “Slytherin Prince”, “Ice Price”, “Golden Boy,” “Gryfindork”, “TBW” (the boy who lived; literally that was what the author used the entire book).

My standards are higher than ever. Before I didn't have standards besides that the book had to be capital “I” and have proper punctuation. Now I have to have a great plot, small angsty, strictly slash, strictly bottom Harry; with certain people or I don't read, must be at least +20,000 words (longer the better!).

And oh my god, your #12. Must change my life. I usually don't get to pick those, I usually find life changing books by pure accident and don't realize what I'm getting into until I'm utterly destroyed (but in a great way) then I must question my entire existence whilst knowing deep down it'll take me months or even years to find the next book that will wreck me - which is sad but at the same time gives me good motivation to keep reading and searching for that next diamond among all the silver and gold.

The pickier one gets the harder it gets to find great reads, but once we find them it's so worth it all in the end!
