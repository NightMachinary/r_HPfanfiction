Yes and no. There is so much rehashed characters, scenes and themes within fanfiction (perhaps by definition) that it is easy to burn out on the stuff regardless of the writing quality.

When I was younger I found time travel and what ifs more interesting, so i was willing to forgive more errors and mistakes I think and become more engaged. 8 years later i dunno if my tastes are that much better.
