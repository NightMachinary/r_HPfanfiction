I'm extremely picky as well and I hate it. I miss the days where I could open any fic and have a grand ol' time, but nowadays it takes really subtle things like the author's choice of words for me to drop it instantly. It makes me feel like I'm such an insufferable snob, like I'm only worthy of Tolkien-level writting.

I'm trying to change though, and I think I'm making decent strides. I started 'The Black Book' by mosteveryonesmad yesterday and did not drop it at the mention of Harry's full name, though the whole "Blacks destroy their enemies!!!" spiel really did test my patience lmao.
