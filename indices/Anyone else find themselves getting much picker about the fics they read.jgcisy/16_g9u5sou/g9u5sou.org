Definitely. I think it's because fanfiction at first managed to get by in my mind as a gimmick, knowing the characters beforehand and the setting just made it such a comfortable read. But once that stopped being a gimmick and instead became just a regular accepted part of what I expected... Good writing is good writing. I went from well written original works to shitty fanfiction, and now I won't read anything if its not at least well written fanfiction. Though I do obviously accept lower quality when I latch onto a new gimmick for a while. Specific pairings, crossovers, self inserts, that kinda thing. Eventually gimmicks in writing always burn out, but good solid writing is always a great read.
