Yes: most fics these days are just rehashes of rehashes. I don't even give fics that have "bashing" or "Lord Blah Blah Kitchensink" in the summary a glance now.

Originality is dead (well, mostly: including crossovers, there's like 1/1000 fics that aren't trope-filled crap now?).

It's why I mostly like niche sites/areas than FFn: more originality comes out of these areas than on there.

Hell, this sub is one of them: it frequently has a ton of good ideas that aren't tropey and are unique.
