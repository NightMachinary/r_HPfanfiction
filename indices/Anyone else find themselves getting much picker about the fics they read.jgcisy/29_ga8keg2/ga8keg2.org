Definitely. I think it's a feature both of tastes refining as we age, and in the case of HP in particular, of having enough variety to allow for choosiness. For my smaller fandoms, I'll read just about anything that looks even half decent if I want fic, because that's the only option. HP, on the other hand, is such a massive fandom with such a vast quantity of fanfiction that you don't have to settle for scraps.

I actually just dug up the first couple HP fics I ever read back in 2005-6, and I'm a bit nervous to reread them, hah. I have such fond memories but the odds are good that they will not have aged well.
