First rule, if it has slash, its a no go, girl boy don't care. If its Dumbledore talking or recalling past events fine. But I find all slash fiction tedious to read. Same with op harry, lord harry, Harry getting treated like a half elf, same applies to evil Ron duplicitous Hermione. Essentially I want a coherency to what I read. OC characters that are gay is fine. Another pet peeve is saving fics which goes along the harry as a house elf bit. Finally shoehorning romances into a fiction also. It should not be the focus of the story. Also out of character. I am sorry but the idea Draco would just magically fall in love with Hermione is idiotic to me, just like Snape having a good side. Essentially I want a story, but I don't want to read an oc pretending to be a character.
