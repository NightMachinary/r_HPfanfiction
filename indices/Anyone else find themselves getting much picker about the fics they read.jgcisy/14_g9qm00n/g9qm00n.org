I've only been reading Harry Potter fics for a year or so and I definitely have standards. Of course, I was reading fanfics long before I started with these, and was writing some in my head even before I heard the term, so some standards do tend to migrate from one fandom to the next.

Decent writing skills are important (spelling, grammar, etc), but I have made exceptions, depending on plot and the author. New to English, sometimes, early story but later ones have improved, that sort of thing.

Related is I'd rather not read the 13yo's first story, since they don't understand a lot about life and it shows. They also tend to gloss over or rush events that should be expanded upon. I read my own efforts from when I was 16 and wince and shudder, so not being that harsh.

My preferred ship is Harmony, and I find I've started avoiding HP/GW ones unless I've already read it. Other pairings I will not read is Harry or Hermione with an authority figure (Snape, McGonagall, Dumbledore), the undeniable bad guys (Voldemort, Bellatrix), or incest. Not a fan of a lot of slash (although background WolfStar is OK), so forget Drarry as well. There are others I reject because the characters are unappealing or I don't know them very well. Luna's usually just fine, though!

Don't mind most Weasley or Dumbledore bashing (always disappointed when the twins are full bore gits), but I'm happiest when Hermione and Sirius stay on Harry's side. And it's nice when Neville gets developed.

I also don't mind covering old ground if presented well. I've read a lot of 4th year fics and post 5th year ones where Harry gains his independence, for example.

Not interested in fem!Harry and not a lot of WBWL ones, although I've seen some good ones.

If you're reforming Snape or any of the Malfoys, I need good reasons for the turnabout.

Tone down the rhetoric and the repetition. Reading the same revolutionary concept 5+ times /in full/ in one fic is dreadfully wearying. Also, this isn't a soapbox. Please be subtle if you can.
