Yes and no. What really kills new fics for me nowdays is lack of novelty in something. The first time I read a Marauder-era fic for example, it was a new and exciting era for me, and I read more or less anything that was part of it. A while back I asked in here for the first Marauder-era fic I read since I forgot the title. Someone delivered and I tried to re-read it again, but wasn't able to stand it.

But a fic that can stand on its own, not just for the novelty? I could probably re-read most of them today, and new fics of similar quality.
