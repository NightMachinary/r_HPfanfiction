Absolutely. I've been reading fanfiction since the early 2000s, so I've seen a lot of tropes come and go. I've gone through phases where some ideas where more popular. The main thing I look for now is great writing and moderate pacing. I don't have the patience to sit through a 13 year olds first attempt at fanfiction or a major, philosophical debate slowburn. I will always have a preference for M rated, smutty with plot stories.
