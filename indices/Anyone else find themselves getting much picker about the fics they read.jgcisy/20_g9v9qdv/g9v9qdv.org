Don't worry, you're gonna grow out of that. You'll slowly get more and more disgusted with the fandom and abandon it for 2-3 years, to cleanse yourself. Then one day you'll stumble on a recommendation or alert and you'll read it in one go... and you'll feel your addiction rise up again. You'll start reading in a frenzy, trying to discover everything you missed the years you were asbent. Afterwards you'll find yourself parched and your standards will lower again, so that you can get your fix.

Yes, its what happened to me.

Tl;dr Fanfic is crack and low quality crack is better than no crack.
