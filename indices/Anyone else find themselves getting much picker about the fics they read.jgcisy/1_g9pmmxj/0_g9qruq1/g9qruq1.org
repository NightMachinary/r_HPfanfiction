For some bizarre reason I also LOVED the fem!Harry fics and I have seen a lot of young readers, specially females, get caught in this "phenomenon" lol

Maybe when we are young we don't see gender too much or maybe it's a representation or a self insert thing?

Nowadays I can't stand gender bender of any kind!
