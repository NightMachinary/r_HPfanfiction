Yeah, that happens in Breeding Darkness. It was why I mentioned it.

​

It's not a long scene, but this is how it goes:

  "So you smoke?" Harry asked.

  "Yes..." Draco hesitated for a moment before smirking. "You want one?" Draco asked, digging the pack out of his robe's inner vest pocket.

  "Yeah, sure." Harry said, accepting one of the thin cigarettes. He placed it between his lips and lit the tip with his wand. He took in a long slow drag before blowing the smoke out slowly and heaving a long sigh of relief.

  Draco watched the entire process with obvious surprise. "This is clearly not your first cigarette," he observed.

  Harry laughed lightly and took another drag. "About half way through July I started bumming smokes off the Dark Lord whenever he lit up."

  Draco choked and looked at Harry with utter incredulity. "Are you joking?"

  Harry laughed. "Nope. Not at all."

  "The Dark Lord smokes... and he let you bum cigarettes off him?" Draco echoed, incredulously.

  Harry grinned and nodded his head, amused with Draco's reaction. "Is that so hard to believe?"

  "Yes." Draco replied instantly, earning him another laugh from Harry.

But I think there might be something similar in another fic, whose name's just on the edge of memory. Sorry. Though if it /was/ this scene, I have downloaded copies of the fic and it's prequel (I imagine quite a few people here do, if you need one).
