Dumbledore said that the Peverell brothers made the Hallows themselves, and that "Death" never existed---its an in-universe fairy tale. Contrary to fanon belief, Death never created the Hallows nor were they remotely as powerful in reality as in mythology:

*Cloak of Invisibility:* The ONLY advantages it has over a regular cloak is its durability and the fact it is immune to certain spells (i.e. Accio). Other than that, however... Harry's cloak was never special at all---not even in DH.

- The Human-presence-revealing Spell bypasses the cloak as proven not just by Dumbledore, but also the Death Eaters in DH when they go to the Lovegood's house---the latter of which obviously occurred after we learn Harry's cloak is a Hallow.

- The Marauders' Map also sees through the Invisibility Cloak, too---possibly because it works similarly to the Human-presence-revealing Spell. Contrary to fanon, the wizarding world isn't stagnant. Its obvious modern magical creations like Moody's eye or the Marauders' Map could see through what is a glorified, overrated cloak with little going for it aside from its long-lasting nature.

- It can't hide him from Nagini in DH, who called Harry and Hermione over despite them being under it. IIRC, Mrs Norris does something similar in one of the earlier books (maybe PS?).

- Also failed to resist the Full-Body Bind Curse twice in HBP.

- The Disillusionment Charm makes you invisible and is easy enough that Crabbe and Goyle can use it in DH. The Cloak was so garbage that the likes of Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or Voldemort could equal/surpass the Cloak's abilities using their own wand. If they wanted to make a superior cloak, any one of them certainly could. They just don't need to because their Charms skill is enough to make an invisibility cloak redundant.

*Elder Wand:* Hyped up to be an unbeatable wand, but really isn't any greater than any other wand and despite being Dumbledore's equal, it wasn't good enough for Grindelwald to win. Its ability to repair broken wands might come from being made from Thestral hair, or possibly a unique combination of Thestral hair and Elder wood---something wand-makers might not even consider if Thestral hair was deemed an 'inferior' wand core, or if they took the legend about "Death" seriously. We only see Harry repair his OWN wand, so its possible the Elder Wand only repairs its master's wand rather than just any wand. Most wizards would likely be too arrogant to consider using their original wand if they possessed the so-called 'unbeatable' Elder Wand.

*Resurrection Stone:* Doesn't actually revive the dead, but mere spirits who may or may not be illusions conjured from the user's mind rather than their actual souls. Grindelwald believed he could make an Inferi army with it, but Dumbledore heavily implied such a thing was impossible for the stone.
