Don't forget linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being a Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin).

linkffn(Lost Magic, First Contact by MightyFish) is a Mass Effect crossover that does some cool things with the Deathly Hallows and space magic, but this isn't really a MoD fic.

I seem to recall their being some really interesting Game of Thrones/ASoIaF crossover premises where Harry has some special relationship with the Many Faced God/Faceless Men and the Stranger. Unfortunately, to my knowledge none of them were well written.
