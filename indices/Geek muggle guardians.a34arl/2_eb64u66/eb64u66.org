I have a rough draft of the beginning of a story in which a Muggleborn kid, the son of a modern-day blacksmith, got his hand crushed by a power hammer and the only reason he didn't lose more of it was that his accidental magic animated a suit of armor to pull him free. His dad, a fan of scifi and comic book, incorrectly came to the conclusion that he was a telekinetic mutant (X-men style). The father geeked out (after the whole arm trauma thing was done) and encouraged the kid to practice his talents. By the time the kid went to Hogwarts, he was fairly good at telekinesis, could heat up metal hot enough to forge and weld with, and could animate his custom prosthetic. When he discovered he was a wizard and that there was a school for wizards, he decided that he was going to build a working Iron Man suit if it was the last thing he did. And his dad was cheering him on every step of the way.
