Ah okay I haven't come across that particularly as a trope so I was reading the very smart thing as the characters being over skilled and knowledgable for their ages which while justified does happen a lot in this fic.

Having looked up the author and realised what you're both talking about I remember reading some of HPMoR several years ago so I've got a clearer picture now.

And yeah I think that authors note shows why this story came to my mind for the OP's request!
