I think any fic which involved muggle parents will fall into some [[/r/iamverysmart]] tropes because they don't have magic. Literally all they have to offer is their emotional support, their brains and maaaybe their muggle political connections if it's a Finch-Fletchley fic.

So it just comes down to whether the author makes it tolerable with good writing and story setup or not. Like the Dodging Prison... fic, the author gets into really deep detail for basically all branches of magic, and as a reader you have to at least respect that level of thought, even if you don't like it (personally, WBWL, student 60 year old politicians and harems are just not my cup of tea).
