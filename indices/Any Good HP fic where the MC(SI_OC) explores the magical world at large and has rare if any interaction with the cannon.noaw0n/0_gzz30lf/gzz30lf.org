Hmm, that is a difficult request.. moving away from canon would require Authors to bring out their own worldbuilding and characters. Authors who are capable/interested in doing that do not tend to write SI fics. Plus the HP SI scene is a bit weak relative to other fandoms. linkffn(No Gryffindor) for example is a demonstration piece which avoids the problem by summarizing it.

OC fics on the other hand:

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] series is probably the most extensive in terms of non-canon exploration.

If you want to stay in Britain, there are several next-generation series which are technically filled with OC's. Linkffn(Ignite by Slide) and sequels is a good one. The Albus Potter Series (/both/ of them) are also worth a try.
