Indeed! Harry does have lingering trauma - otherwise he would have told the wizard world to go bugger themselves and solve their Voldemort problem themselves because frankly they don't deserve his sacrifice after what they put him through (the Dursleys (don't they have child services and if so: How come Dumbledore can so easily override them?), school itself (bullying - especially heir of Slytherin and the "Potter stinks!" badges, which even the supposedly fair Hufflepuffs wore! Bad teaching by Snape, Lockhart etc. etc.), the TWT, press slander (Fudge!) etc. etc.)
