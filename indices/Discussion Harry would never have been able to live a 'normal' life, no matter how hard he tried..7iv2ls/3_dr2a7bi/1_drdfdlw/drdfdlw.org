He wants that, but would it really work out like that?

We all know Harry has all sorts of baggage - he believes his life isn't worth much (compared to that of other people!), he doesn't think he deserves happiness or love or respect (he lets Ron and Hermione get away with betrayal too easily! Like his trust is worth nothing!) and he still has all sorts of complexes because of his upbringing by the Dursleys, not to mention PTSD from the war!

Would Ginny really put up with him having screaming nightmares every night? Would she wait till he's healed (as much as all that can be healed, especially if society doesn't have psychiatrists! We don't know if there's "mind-healers" in the wiz world!)? Would his abuse and lack of knowledge how a normal family works (no: The Weasleys aren't a normal family and Harry hasn't lived with them for long either!) not lead to him screwing up any children he might have (damned, he gave one kid the name of two of his main abusers! That's a clear warning sign IMHO!)

Yeah, he isn't critical of the Weasleys at all, he overlooks their obvious flaws (a mother packing food for a child but either ignoring or not giving a fuck about what that child likes? Not great! Not to mention that Molly stifles their children - that's why Bill, Charly and even Percy and the twins left as soon as they were able to!)...Harry's view of the world is seriously skewed and he needs "fixing"
