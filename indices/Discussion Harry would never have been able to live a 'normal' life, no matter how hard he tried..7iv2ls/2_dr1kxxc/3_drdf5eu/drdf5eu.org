He always wanted to be "just Harry" - so yes, he did!

As for "a dark lord with a badge" - Harry isn't a dark lord! Those have an ego, Harry doesn't (in fact he believes himself worth much less than other people, he thinks he's not worthy of protection, he doesn't think it's the job of the adults to fight the war etc. etc.)

ps: Malfoy is free, that to me shows that nothing much has changed...sure JK said otherwise, but then criminals and terrorists should either be in prison or dead (treason carries the death penalty!)
