BTW, can you find evidence in canon that says Harry wanted to be 'normal'? Of course he didn't like the fame and being at center of everyone's attention, but I think that was very understandable.

  I don't like the epilogue. It feels so cliche - a tack-on to the events of Deathly Hallows, with no real changes and unrealistic outcomes.

The Epilogue itself really didn't say much and only gave up a 'normal' feeling, but underlying things changed dramatically, if you take everything JKR later said in consideration.

We had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qxmgc/are_the_weasleypotters_the_new_super_wizarding/][a long discussion]] here about the future of Weasley-Potter after the war. Here is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6qxmgc/are_the_weasleypotters_the_new_super_wizarding/dl0rnll/][my take]] on this subject.

Instead of going alone, Harry obviously chose the option of using Ministry's security forces as private army to protect his interests and push his agenda. The Ministry of 2017 would be populated by their allies, followers, and sycophants. The only thing better than a Dark Lord is a Dark Lord with a badge.
