I've stated on this subreddit many times I feel the epilogue is too clean. While I have no issue with Ginny it does come across as if the series is wrapped up with a happily ever after when book by book we see more and more failings of wizarding Britain. There are many takes on post-Hogwarts stories and I can buy the idea behind many of them partly because there is such potential.

Harry's life in the wizarding world was defined by Voldemort. His whole life prophecy had forced them against each other. Ideological differences and the whole killing parents things too, who is Harry Potter when Voldemort is no longer a factor. To the world he's a hero but for Harry who is he? His formative years have been spent focusing on surviving he never really stops to think about what comes next. He considers becoming an auror in the 5th book and we see progression towards that in the sixth and in JKR's post-series works (Which I tend to stick my fingers in my ears, shut my eyes and pretend never happened.) It would be understandable if Harry said, I'm done and took a long holiday. He's never had a holiday in his life, not one. If he went alone, say while Ron and Hermione went off to Australia and Harry just vanished for a while I suspect he'd come back a different person.

We know Harry feels guilty for those that died. He has a history of doing so. What effects would that have on him? Would he speak to a professional about it? Would he join the aurors or some other group looking to find redemption. To continue to help and to serve since its all he knows how to do? What does Harry Potter want now he's survived Voldemort? He says to be normal but surely at some point he accepts that he wouldn't know where to start with normal and even if he tries, nobody will accept him being normal.

It seems to me Cross-Overs in general pick up on these themes more so than regular HP fanfictions. Whether that is because they use it as a device to start the cross-over or it reflects their actual views I don't know. Perhaps it relates to them knowingly twisting canon in merely creating a cross-over that they feel no need to guide Harry to the future laid out in the epilogue.
