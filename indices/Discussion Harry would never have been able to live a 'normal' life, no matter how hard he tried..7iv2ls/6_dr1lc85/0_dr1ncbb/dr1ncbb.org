  We know Harry feels guilty for those that died. He has a history of doing so. What effects would that have on him?
#+end_quote

Even if Harry feels guilty for all those deaths, it would be an old, comfortable guilt. I believe in the years after the war his friends would convince him that the war was much bigger than just him. It would be the height of egomania for him to continue to believe that he was the only one responsible for a confict that raged for 20-30 years. I think Harry would intellectually accept that he was not responsible for the majority of shit that went wrong, even if he kept an emotional gut reaction of feeling guilty about everything.

  Would he speak to a professional about it?
#+end_quote

Extremely doubtful. He would speak with his friends and maybe someone that could understand what he went through, like Andromeda. But not a stranger.

  Would he join the aurors or some other group looking to find redemption
#+end_quote

Redemption for what?

#+begin_quote
  To continue to help and to serve since its all he knows how to do?
#+end_quote

To continue to help, sure. Serve, however? After the way the ministry fucked up everything, I think Harry chose to go that way in order to shape things the way he preferred and to keep an eye on things, much more than wishing to "serve". I don't think that Harry would ever willingly serve anyone. It makes sense that after defeating Voldemort the new ministry would give him a lot of informal power, if only to keep the public happy - out of the understanding that should Harry speak out against the government, it would basically crumble.

  What does Harry Potter want now he's survived Voldemort?
#+end_quote

I think his #1 goal is to keep his friends and family safe. Especially with Teddy, he would probably feel that for the first time, there's a person that is almost totally dependent on him. That is powerful motivation for wanting to fix the corrupt cesspit that is the wizarding world.

  He says to be normal but surely at some point he accepts that he wouldn't know where to start with normal and even if he tries, nobody will accept him being normal.
#+end_quote

Where does it say that he wishes to be normal? I believe that he wants not to be stared at and gawked, rather than have a Dursley-ish version of normalcy.

Anyway I think that Harry would sooner realize and accept that he can never have anonymity and would have to settle into his fame with some amount of grace, even if it would have to be faked.
