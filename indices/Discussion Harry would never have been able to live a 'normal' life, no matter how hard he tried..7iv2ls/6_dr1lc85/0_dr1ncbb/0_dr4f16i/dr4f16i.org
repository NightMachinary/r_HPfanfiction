I'm not so certain Harry would come to terms with his guilt without speaking to a professional about it; guilt doesn't tend to be rational for your average person and Harry really seemed to struggle with it in canon. When he's actually the Chosen One who had to defeat Voldemort (and he knows that's the case), do you think it'd be that easy to shake off thoughts about whether he could have finished the Horcrux Hunt or finally defeated Voldemort just a little bit faster or better? And who might be alive if he did so?

I agree that rationally, he SHOULD realize that prophecy and Voldemort's obsession aside, lots of people were going to die in the 2nd Wizard War and there's not a lot he could have done about it, but he's in a uniquely bad position to think logically about it like that.
