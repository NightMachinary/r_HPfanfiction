This is a popular thing for fandom!Harry to want, but I don't think it particularly fits with his canon character. As you've mentioned in another comment, Harry is an extremely reactive person. He'll become an Auror because he doesn't know what else to do, but what he actually wants is to be left alone both by the general wizarding public and dark wizards in particular. He has his 'saving people thing', but that only pushes him to act when people have already been wronged. If that motivation kicks in enough for a fulfilling life, magical Britain is a pretty crappy place.
