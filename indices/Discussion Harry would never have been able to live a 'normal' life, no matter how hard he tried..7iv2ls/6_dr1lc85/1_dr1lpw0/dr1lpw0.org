  What does Harry Potter want now he's survived Voldemort?
#+end_quote

Exact retributions on Voldemort's remnants and make them PAY.

Destroy them economically, financially, politically, and if necessary, physically.

Reform/Revolutionize Magical Britain so people he cared about would NEVER have to go through that again.

I think he had plenty of worthy goals to pursue.
