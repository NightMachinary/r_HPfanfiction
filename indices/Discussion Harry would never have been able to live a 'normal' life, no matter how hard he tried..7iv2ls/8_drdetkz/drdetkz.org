Can't stand for themselves? In a society where everybody carries the equivalent of a tactical nuke in their pocket? Yes, tactical nuke! A wand can deal a lot of fucking damage, so comparing it to a gun or even a rocket-launcher doesn't do it justice (Fiend-Fire anybody?...Cast that a couple of times all over London and a lot of the city will be destroyed, especially if the wizard or witch doing it apparates around and lets the fire go out of control on purpose!)! So yes they could fight for themselves, they just don't - sure some have good reasons ("Can't endanger my family!" or "I am no good in a fight!"), but that still doesn't make it ok! You can hide your family (send them away or errect a fidelius!) and then you can fight!

I totally agree with you however that Harry wouldn't be able to live a normal life! The guy thinks he doesn't deserve that, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to sacrifice himself as he did (for a world that has hurt him a lot! From placing him with the Dursleys to forcing him into the TWT to smearing him in the media and locking him up with the Dursleys again and again!)!

Harry would need treatment for PTSD etc. and he would need people who, unlike most of the adults in HP, stand up for him and make him realized that he does deserve a certain respect (especially for sacrificing himself!) and that he deserves love (and that betrayal comes at a cost - Sorry Ron, but a mumbled appology doesn't cut it when you endanger somebody's life twice (during the TWT and when he leaves on the horcrux hunt!)) and Harry also needs somebody to help he re-take his OWLs (after making an effort in his subjects, which he didn't really...probably out of fear because he probably wasn't allowed to outperform Duddley in primary school and because he didn't want to fight with Hermione (look at how miffed she is about being outperformed in HBP, despite that fact that Harry kind of does have to shine in this book to get closer to Slughorn! Harry offered to share the Prince's book with her, too but no, she was a prissy little bitch about it!)) and to take his NEWTS!

Harry being an auror wouldn't help matters IMHO especially since it doesn't seem that justice was allowed to happen (all the Malfoys should have gone to prison for a long long time!) and that the pureblood elite (who control the ministry!) are still in power...Harry would hate to be their enforcer!

Hell, I don't think Harry would adopt as easily...then again I also don't think he'd marry straight out of Hogwarts (he was muggle raised and marrying at 18 or 20 isn't the norm anymore, hell it's highly abnormal!) and I don't know if he'd have kids!

I agree that Harry might take up traveling and dealing with Dark-Lord-Wanna-Bes and that life really isn't great for having kids (you can't protect them easily and raising a kid in a wizard's tent? I don't think so, especially since that kid would never have any friends because of all the moving around (Harry wouldn't subject a kid to that IMHO!)
