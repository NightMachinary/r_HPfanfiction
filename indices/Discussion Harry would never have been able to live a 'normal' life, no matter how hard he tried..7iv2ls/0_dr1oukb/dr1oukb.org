There's some interesting discussion going on in this thread about what Harry would or wouldn't want, but I think there's something else that needs to be mentioned:

The epilogue in no way points to Harry having a normal life.

If there's /one/ day of any year that everyone would put on a mask and pretend to be normal, it's the day that all of the children are sent off to school. For all the epilogue says, Ron and Hermione's marriage could be dissolving, Teddy could be a high-functioning alcoholic playboy, and Ginny could be a closet lesbian using Harry as a beard because of her somewhat old-fashioned parents and wizarding society. Precisely none of that would have shown while the kids are boarding the Hogwarts Express.

Not saying that any of the above is my personal headcanon, but it's impossible to judge entire lives on a really narrow sample of a day where all of the characters have strong reasons to wear masks.
