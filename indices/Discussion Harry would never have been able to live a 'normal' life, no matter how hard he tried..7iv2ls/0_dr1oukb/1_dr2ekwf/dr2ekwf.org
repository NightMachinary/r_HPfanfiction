True, but we can deduce from Rowling's comments since the series was finished, along with the line "all was well" that Harry ultimately was leading a happy, good life at least. I mean, technically, yes, it all could be for show at that moment, but do you really think Rowling intended us to interpret that scene in such a way?

At the end of the day, it is still fiction. While in reality Harry probably would have a hard time dealing with everything as he starts to come to terms with the trauma of his childhood and teenage years, I personally am happy with the belief that he made it through and is overall a well-adjusted, happy adult with the family he always wanted.

And even within the context of a more realistic view of things, I believe that the support structure that had built up around Harry would allow him to make it through those first few years when he theoretically would be at his worst. For example, one of the reasons Ginny works so well for Harry is her ability to comfort him and provide the exact thing he seems to need in the moment. She would be able to handle his mood swings and be there for him when the past sneaks up on him; in fact I think comforting Harry during this period allows Ginny to deal with her own issues.

I forgot what fic it was (think it was one of little0bird's post-war fics) but the author wrote about how Harry led a normal, happy life but every so often he'd have a bad few days that forced him to relive the war. I think my headcanon follows that, that Harry is able to have his happy life, but there are always moments where he gets really down and depressed about his past, but the support structure around him allows him to deal with it in a healthy way.
