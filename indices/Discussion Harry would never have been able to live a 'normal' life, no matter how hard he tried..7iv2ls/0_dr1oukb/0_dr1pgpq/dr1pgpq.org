This is exactly what I was thinking. We saw one moment 19 years later of them, and they were having a happy moment. They could have a happy family with still MANY issues underlying.

Whether or not you want to consider Cursed Child canon, considering JK said it's canon, and we see Harry's life is definitely NOT that great, it is very clear that the epilogue moment is probably not an entire telling of their future life.
