Yeah right, Ron's the only one insecure...right! WRONG! Hermione is just as insecure! Her studying and being the best stems from that, in fact I believe Hermione's home life (which not abusive!) wasn't all that great, especially since she seems to emulate adults more than her fellow teenagers! Not to mention that Hermione doesn't know what fun is and how to relax, kick back and not study for a change!

Hermione also believes she has to be right all the time - and can't admit it when she isn't (Firebolt! Sure her heart was in the right place when she snitched about it, but she shouldn't have nonetheless! If she was so concerned then she should have taken her Gryffindor bravery and taken out the broom for a spin herself, just to check if it's cursed etc.! Then there's the Malfoy thing! She abandon's Harry to moon over Ron who finally moved on from carrying a torch for her (and she's unhappy about it, despite the fact that she treats him like shit!) and in the end the DEs invade the school because she didn't want to believe that Harry was right about Draco "I am a bully and a traitor who deserves to die, painfully!" Malfoy!

No, old married couples don't do that - that's such a stupid idea! People who argue all the time don't stay together, especially if it's fundamental stuff like society's problems (anti-muggleborn bias and slavery) or manners (Ron's manners don't change over the course of the series, he eats like a pig - Hermione is more refined than that!), don't stay together to even become "old married couples" (good natured ribbing ok, but not actual fighting which devolves into fucking shouting matches without a buffer - Harry!)
