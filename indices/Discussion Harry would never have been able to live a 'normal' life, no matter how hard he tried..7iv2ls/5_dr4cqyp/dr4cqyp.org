  Ron and Hermione may have a relationship, but it is filled with bumps and pitfalls, and it is NOT a smooth ride.

I'm gonna have to disagree with that. Ron and Hermione's problems always stemmed from outside forces, aside from Ron's insecurity, which was pretty much done away with by the end of the series. Fight third year was about their pets. Fourth year was about Krum. Sixth year was about Lavender. Deathly Hallows was the locket and Harry. They bicker all the time, but that's just their way, like an old married couple.

Out of all of the endgame pairings, I think Ron and Hermione would have been better off than anyone else.
