There's a lot of conjecture here, and it all starts with how you consider Harry's upbringing. I'm firmly in the camp, that Harry suffered very little physical abuse-if any at all-and loads of isolation and bullying from his peers. The immediate effect? A desire for family and companionship, more than normality.

I also believe that Harry and Hermione joined the Ministry because they were intent on changing the world. A lot of the fandom's thoughts on Harry's post-ministry life was based on the idea that he's "tired" of saving the world. In canon, he's never /not/ wanted to fight Voldemort. For him, he has a personal stake in it, he wants to kill the man who murdered his parents.

I also think Harry's an auror because it's all he knows how to do, and enjoys it. He's spent his entire life "fighting" the Dark Arts. He doesn't know how to be an Arithmancer, or a regular ministry worker, or a professor. He knows how to fight, and so he keeps on doing that. By the epilogue, I see The Potter-Weasleys as the equivalent of the Clintons or the Bushes. They're effectively the family in charge of the ministry, and they push their ideology. I wouldn't be surprised if they did their level best to have their children replace them.
