Very little? - Frying Pan anybody? I mean sure Vernon might not have punished him by beating constantly him or using a belt on him, but he was denied food, told he was a freak etc. and we know from the frying-pan scene that it did get physical every once in a while, so yes:

He was abused, mentally as well as physically!

Could it have been worse? YES!

Was it ok? No!

Did it leave Harry damaged (just like Dumbledore wanted, he admitted to knowing about the abuse (...ten dark and difficult years...))? Yes, deffinitely!

As for "changing the world" - Not with the Malfoys etc. getting off, again! Lucius should have been sentenced to death IMHO (treason normally does carry a death sentence!)

Enjoying being the enforcer of a corrupt ministry which still has discriminating laws on the books and wealthy purebloods running it? Yeah, how about: No? I don't think Harry would enjoy that (he'd come to resent the ministry even more! Hell, they might only use him as a poster-boy, like Scrimgeour wanted (not to mention Fudge!), without any half dangerous assignments!

They don't, Malfoy money (not to mention them being part of the wizard parliament which reminds me of the house of lords!) makes sure they can't! They would like to push their ideology (just like Dumbledore, but not even he could, not even with him leading the wizard world against both Grindelwald and Voldemort!), but they would be hindered at every turn!
