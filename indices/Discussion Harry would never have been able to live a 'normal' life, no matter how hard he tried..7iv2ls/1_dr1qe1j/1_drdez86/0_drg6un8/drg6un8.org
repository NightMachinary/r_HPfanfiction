  Did it leave Harry damaged (just like Dumbledore wanted, he admitted to knowing about the abuse (...ten dark and difficult years...))? Yes, deffinitely!
#+end_quote

First, I detest the manipulative "evil" Dumbledore trope. Dumbledore made his share of mistakes, as any human being, including Harry, has done. But he is a good person, and did work for the betterment of the wizarding world.

I've explained multiple times on different comments on my thoughts on Harry's abuse at the Dursleys, and his character. My most recent is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7izrsn/best_truly_grey_harry_working_fully_for_himself/dr3zzau/][this]] The final conclusion is this: /Rowling didn't write Harry as an abuse character, and presents several facts of evidence contrary to that conclusion/ This is important to keep in mind when analyzing Harry's actions and motives.

  As for "changing the world" - Not with the Malfoys etc. getting off, again! Lucius should have been sentenced to death IMHO (treason normally does carry a death sentence!)
#+end_quote

Treason doesn't necessarily cause a death sentence. Bradley Manning wasn't sentenced to death. Capital punishment is a big deal. It's not handed down lightly. Again, the end of the 2nd war is radically different from the first. The first was closer to putting down a terrorist cell. The second was a civil war. The end created a power vacuum, allowing Harry and the Order to establish themselves as the leaders.

  Enjoying being the enforcer of a corrupt ministry which still has discriminating laws on the books and wealthy purebloods running it? Yeah, how about: No? I don't think Harry would enjoy that (he'd come to resent the ministry even more! Hell, they might only use him as a poster-boy, like Scrimgeour wanted (not to mention Fudge!), without any half dangerous assignments!
#+end_quote

This is all conjecture. But, Harry /isn't/ a poster boy. He's not a kid anymore. He practically runs the ministry with Hermione and Kingsley. Twenty years later, Harry is the head of the DMLE (think Secretary of Defense/Homeland Security) and Hermione is the minister.

  They don't, Malfoy money (not to mention them being part of the wizard parliament which reminds me of the house of lords!) makes sure they can't! They would like to push their ideology (just like Dumbledore, but not even he could, not even with him leading the wizard world against both Grindelwald and Voldemort!), but they would be hindered at every turn!

That' just canonically false. Lucius Malfoy isn't a part of the wizengamot. I assume that's from fanon. In OoTP, Malfoy is waiting outside the courtroom for the result of Harry's trial. Considering Harry's trial required the full Wizengamot, by basic deduction, we can conclude Lucius Malfoy /isn't/ in the Wizengamot
