I don't remember Lucius being freed. Several issues here:

- The biggest difference from the first war is that the Malfoys learned their lesson. They fell out of favor with Lord Voldemort and learned the ugly man that lay behind the pleasant facade.
- Draco is a bit of a pariah. He married another pureblood that supposedly didn't want to raise their son how Draco had been raised. Rowling notes that he's independently wealthy, but not influential. I imagine he leads a quiet and solitary life.
- Narcissa saves Harry's life. If she doesn't lie, Harry dies there, and who knows what happens.

Forgiveness over punishment works properly if used properly. The reason the Malfoys needed punishment after the first war, is that they hadn't understood the wrong in what they had done. The second war, they understand the mistake they made, and they paid dearly. Lucius loses influence, Narcissa loses family. Draco becomes a relatively decent person.

It's not confirmed, but I believe that Lucius Malfoy received leniency for giving evidence for several Death Eaters, allowing them to truly punish rabid followers like Dolohov, McNair, etc.

The Malfoys walked free, but the inherent problem was on it's way to being solved. Voldemort wasn't the problem, but merely the catalyst. The idea that muggleborns are taking over wizarding culture had been around for several centuries, and tensions rose to the point that Voldemort set them off.

By the end of the second war, there's a considerable power vacuum, allowing Harry & co to take control, and do their best to erase that line of thinking. So, yes, they did succeed.
