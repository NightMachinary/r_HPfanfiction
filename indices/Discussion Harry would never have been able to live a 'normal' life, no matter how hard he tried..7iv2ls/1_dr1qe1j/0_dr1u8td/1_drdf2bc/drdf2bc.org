They did repeat it! All the Malfoys are still alive and free (Draco after all got married soon after the war!), despite the fact that they were aiding and abetting a known criminal, not to mention that two of them were members of a terrorist organization and all of them commited treason (they helped in a coup d'etat!)...not to mention murder, assault, breaking and entering (into the ministry, but also into peoples homes!), illegal detention, kidnapping etc. etc.
