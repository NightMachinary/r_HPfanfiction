Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace. linkao3(15833898)

When Trelawney predicts "the thing you are dreading will be on the 16th", Hermione makes Lavender make a list of everything she's dreading and then gives her sensible precautions to take. Lavender's rabbit is rescued just before the 16th and everyone praises Hermione as a great Seer. She gets irritated at Lavender and predicts dOooOm if she goes to Hogsmeade. Meant as a little pettiness to take her fun away. Coincidently, during the next Hogsmeade visit Death Eaters attack. Lavender and everyone else assume that the Doom Hermione Saw was Lavender's death at a Death Eater's hands. Thus sealing Hermione's reputation as a great Seer.
