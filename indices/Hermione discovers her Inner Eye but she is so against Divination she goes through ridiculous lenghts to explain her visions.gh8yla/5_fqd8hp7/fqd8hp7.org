Hermione ridicules Divination by making a random silly prediction. Next day it comes true and everyone is like "WOOAH, you're a seer." Hermione says it was just a coincidence and makes another even more ridiculous prediction. Next day it also comes true which makes everyone even more inclined to believe that she is a seer. Hermione gets increasingly frustrated and makes a completely nonsensical prediction that absolutely can not become true just to prove a point. Due to a series of improbable events it becomes true and Hermione gets really angry and sets out to prove everyone that she is not a seer while failing miserably.
