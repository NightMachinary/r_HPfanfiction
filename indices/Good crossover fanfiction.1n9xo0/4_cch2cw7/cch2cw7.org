[[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]]

Summary: A step to one side in time, a shift to another in space, and you would be surprised at the changes one might wreak on an unsuspecting world.

UNFINISHED. BtVS::Addams Family::HP 1st-4th year so far

My absolute favorite epic crossover fic. Unfinished, but still an awesome fic.
