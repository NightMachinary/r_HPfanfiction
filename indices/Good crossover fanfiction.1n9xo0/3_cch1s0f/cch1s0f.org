[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds the Image]] by TheAngelsHaveThePhoneBox (XOver with Doctor Who)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

#+begin_quote
  Something is threatening Hogwarts mere months after Voldemort's downfall. When it needs help, the Wizarding World calls on the Doctor, but will he be able to find the intruder before it kills again? And can student John Watson learn to move on after a fight for Hogwarts that claimed some of his dearest friends and nearly himself?

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093023/1/The-Book-of-Dobby-Reboot-Per-Arcana-ad-Astra][The Book of Dobby Reboot: Per Arcana ad Astra]] by Doghead Thirteen. (Slight XOver with Girl Genius). Sadly abandoned, but /the/ best five chapters I've read in a while.

  Harry Potter has had enough, and now - with a little help from his friends - he's decided to bring the fight to the Death Eaters in a way they cannot understand. Turn out those lights! Don't you know there's a war on?

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-Who-Was-Promised][The Prince Who Was Promised]] by cxjenious (XOver with A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones) is shaping up to be very good. It's written more in Martin's style than Rowling, but Harry is still Harry, even in Westeros.

  He remembered being Harry Potter. Dreamed of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature of ice and death, with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a 'spare', but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/840721/chapters/1602566][That We've Broken Their Statues]] by nagia (XOver with Labyrinth) is also shaping up to be very good.

  Sarah stumbles into the Leaky Cauldron. She stumbles back out again with a Gringotts account she didn't start, a part time job at Hogwarts, and an awkward truce with the Goblin King.
