Mainly because it started good and decent with long chapters and good story ideas. Then sudden bam! Cringe smacks you upside the head like a kitten after catnip. You are invested and try to push threw hoping it gets better. None of them where graphic in what happened otherwise I would have just stopped and not cared it was stated but not written like a sex scene basically is what I mean.
