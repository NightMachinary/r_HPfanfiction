There was one I read where Ron becomes the Boy Who Lived. His entire family dead he is raised by the Malfoy's I think. Harry is from another world (alternate reality) where he had a harem and they and he arrived together rewriting the minds of the local them. Then in Hogwarts Ron rapes Harry's sisters and uses a ritual to bind them into his slaves with many others. However towards the end the Ron Harry knew in the other world comes over and takes over bad Ron and is forced to live with his evil selfs choices because he can't undo it. It's cringe inducing because the sisters are young lit 12 or so. But the oldest is forced to help Ron rape the other.

Only other one I know that bad was one where Harry had a twin and everyone believed the twin was the BWL. Harry starts dating Hermione and his brother gets angry about it and jealous. Then he finds Slytherins locket and gives it to her and it makes her betray Harry and sleep with his brother nearly driving him to kill himself (Harry).
