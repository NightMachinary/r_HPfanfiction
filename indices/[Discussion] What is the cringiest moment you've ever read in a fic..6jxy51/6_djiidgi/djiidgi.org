It was a Draco SI, which is why I began. The reason i kept with it was for the wtf factor, and I'm not even sure that the author meant for it to be crack, but I've read Crack that's way less out there. Like the grammer was alright and stuff, but the story was crazy bizzar and and first I refused to believe that it was a SI because the protagonist 'Draco' was a massive Alcoholic and Drug consumer.

Spoiler form here on, but don't read it seriously.

And at first it was somewhat clever in that his actions resulted in Voldemort gaining the Stone. So like any rational person he tricked Voldemort into consuming massive quantities of drugs while building a spaceship with Hermiones help behind Voldemorts back. That was rather neat, but then it got fucking weird, like 'my immortal' made sorta sense in comparison, weird.

And the cringiest moment was when he raped a refugee alien from the starwars series, the story became a crossover when they hit space, to death literally. The alien was described as weighing a near ton and having several fat rolls and 6 tits and sorta cow looking. And then he kidnapped the resulting child, let it grow up, and then forced Hermione to rape the alien cow child with a bed post... Which resulted in her becoming fat, "pear shaped 250 pounds" which in the eyes of the protagonist is an improvement over the previous Emma Watson form.

Don't do drugs kids... because I think the author might just have hit the SI bulls eye.
