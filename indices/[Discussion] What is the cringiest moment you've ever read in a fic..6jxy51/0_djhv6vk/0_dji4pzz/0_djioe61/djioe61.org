50% of the fic is super dull and generic post-canon EWE fic. It's full of unnecessary description of characters' daily routines, uses words it doesn't understand, the works.

The other 50% is BATSHIT CRAZY. With nudist children, Harry and Hermione falling in love, Ron being a werewolf, Ron falling in love with an American woman who had Draco's child, Ginny's non-canonical sister being Snape's dead lover, Ginny and Snape falling in love, and lots and lots of underage children in sexual situations the author clearly kinks on.
