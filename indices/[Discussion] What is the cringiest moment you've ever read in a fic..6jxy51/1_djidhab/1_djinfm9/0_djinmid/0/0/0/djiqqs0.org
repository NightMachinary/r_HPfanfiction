  Still pisses me off how rare femslash is compared to general slash, in most fandoms (aside from Overwatch, Carmilla, The 100 and Once Upon a Time) it's like 10% of the overall content

TBF, a lot of fandoms only have 1-2 female characters who may or may not interact. It's a lot harder to ship them if you're not into crack pairs. The fandoms where femslash takes off are fandoms that have lots of female characters-- with bonus points if they are interesting and flawed and interact in fun ways. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has a pretty decent proportion of femslash, for its size, and so does Wynonna Earp (although that's to be expected, with a canon f/f couple). It's a media problem.

OTOH, ugh, yes. I just want femslash that's as interesting as the slash, where the authors don't act like they have to play it safe and make everything fluffy all the time.
