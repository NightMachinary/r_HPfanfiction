In some ways, yes. Speaking generally, femslash tends to be centered around fluff and canon-compliant fic, and unless the fandom has tons of femslash fics, there's not a lot of tropey femslash. It's easy to find m/m arranged marriage fics, or space au, or whatever you're in the mood for. It's a lot harder to find any particular trope for f/f, because the authors tend to play things safe.

Plus, femslash suffers from the “if you squint” problem. In most fandoms, explicit slash is the norm. I've read countless stories (some written for /femslash exchanges/ that feature 2 female characters sitting and talking, with nothing sexual or romantic happening or being discussed. It's friendship fic that the author slapped a f/f tag on.

It's not the fault of any individual fandom or author; it happens because slash is much more prominent than femslash. But still. I want more femslash that's free to be dumb and tropey, or dark and fucked up, or just generally something other than canon-compliant fluff or mislabelled friendship fic.

TL;DR: when I say I'd like femslash to be more like slash, I mean I want more variety in my femslash. Even in my femslash heavy fandoms.
