So, so true. There's a bunch of pretty good oneshots, but anything longer and you're pretty much screwed, especially if don't want to read Fem!Harry. Most Hermione fics involving Luna, Fleur or Ginny are so full of fluff with practically no conflict they get really boring really fast, with Minerva they're usually average at best, with the Black sisters they are either bad, unfinished or the plot went totally nuts (or any combination of the 3), and the other females are extremely rare in femslash.

Still pisses me off how rare femslash is compared to general slash, in most fandoms (aside from Overwatch, Carmilla, The 100 and Once Upon a Time) it's like 10% of the overall content
