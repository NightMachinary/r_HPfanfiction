Don't recall the exact name right now, but Harry goes to an alternate dimension where it's the Girl Who Lived.

Everything is fine for the first couple chapters, then it suddenly drops the bombshell that Ron went crazy when Hermione and Harry got together, raped and killed Hermione, and then killed Harry's child.

There was no flashback to it, and it honestly came entirely out of left field. Harry was just walking or something when the narrative just calmly dumps that onto us.
