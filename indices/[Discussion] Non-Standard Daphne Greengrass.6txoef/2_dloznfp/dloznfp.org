I toyed with the idea, in Nature's Nobility, of taking inspiration from Gossip Girl and having Pansy be based on Blair and Daphne based on Serena.

For those unfamiliar with Gossip Girl, this means:

Pansy: Social climber. Lacks natural charm so has to make up for it by trying twice as hard, planning and scheming and treating popularity as a competition which you win by being ruthless to your rivals. Pretty but not beautiful, always very put-together. Openly disdains those of lower class.

Daphne: Party girl, naturally charming and popular. Lacks airs and graces, and often dresses in a very casual, just-out-of-bed way, but pulls off the look thanks to her beauty. Does not openly disdain lower classes and indeed likes to think of herself as open minded, but in fact lives a life of extreme privilege which she does not fully appreciate.

The two of them are simultaneously best friends and rivals.
