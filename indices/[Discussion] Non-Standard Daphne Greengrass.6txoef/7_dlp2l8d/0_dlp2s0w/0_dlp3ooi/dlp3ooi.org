He's an up and coming fanfiction author who I personally believe could be the next Ruskbyte or Perspicacity. His favoured pairing seems to be Harry/Daphne, and he makes it work. She's basically what you might expect a business tycoon's daughter to be like, but less "spoiled brat" and more "high expectations". I can tell you'll probably have no idea what I mean by that (I'm known in my friend circle for being bad at explaining things to people), so I'd recommend just reading a couple of his stories. Start with this:

and then maybe this: (?)

and this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12381694/1/Validating-Occurrences-A-Study-in-Emerald]]

You may want to start with the second link, now that I think about it. It's a one-shot so...

Oh, looks like the top reply has already linked it. You should know though, the other two do not have exactly the same characterisation. Uncle Harry was meant to be funny, and he's exaggerated some of the quirks he associates with her in the other stories.

Bitte sehr.
