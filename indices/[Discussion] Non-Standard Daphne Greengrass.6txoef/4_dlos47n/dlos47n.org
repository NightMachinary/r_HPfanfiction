I like the idea of a Daphne who is friendly but also coy: someone who is good at navigating around back-stabbers and avoids being manipulated by anyone who tries to step on her. One of the few things we know about her from canon is that she is from a wealthy and prominent pureblood family. As a result, I imagine that, somewhat like Fleur, she might seem a bit standoffish at first but then you realize that she would 100% step in to support you if she thought you were a nice person.

"Flower and Serpent" by BrokenWingsHealed is a nice little story that I think subverts the "Ice Queen" trope quite a bit.
