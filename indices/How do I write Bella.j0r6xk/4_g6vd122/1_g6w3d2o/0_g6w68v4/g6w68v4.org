I think it is actually quite well written personally.

I end up going back to it whenever I want some Bellatrix.

She is scary and intelligent but she hasn't been sucked into Voldemort's charade long enough to be a fanatic. Also the torture she suffers and the threatening of rape would be a deal breaker for an independent woman like her.
