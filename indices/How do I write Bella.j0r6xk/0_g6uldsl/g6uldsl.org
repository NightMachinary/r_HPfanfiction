Ok, so, this is kind of a lot of big questions. I can't be too specific because I don't have your story in front of me, but here we go.

The way I see Bella, She was raised in an ultra conservative family where she was told, from day one, that she was special and better than everyone else and she believed it. She went to Hogwarts and wasn't treated like the superior being she believed herself to be. Then she met Lord Voldemort, who told her that she really was special, but no one could see it through all the mud in the blood around them. She latched onto him. She got her power and she liked it.

It's difficult to change your morals, that alone could take years. But through constant exposure to people from outside her ‘superior' social group and having someone she can ask about things without fear of judgment would help. I'd assign Molly to that roll. (There could be some good comedy in Molly explaining basic concepts, like sharing, to Bella, who's trying her best, but just doesn't get it.)

Honestly, I think she Would choose self preservation. People with power are terrified of losing it and will generally do anything to hold onto it. But if the options are death or living with your muggle-loving cousin until you can get back on your feet, very few people would actually choose death. Though, I don't think she wouldn't be quiet about her displeasure.

Have you ever seen American History X? That might be somewhere you can look for inspiration about ‘switching sides' from one extreme to another. Though it is about racism and being in prison. It's not a light and fluffy movie.

A starting point for her opening her mind a bit, could be one of the good guys going out of their way to save her, maybe getting injured in the process and her not really understanding why they didn't just let her die.

I find that trying to understand a character's motivation and beliefs are a good way to figure out what they would do differently in different situations. I can't help you with the slowburn romance, that's not really my jam
