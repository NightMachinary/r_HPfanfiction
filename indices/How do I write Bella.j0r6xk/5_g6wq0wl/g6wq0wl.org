The problem is, she doesn't have much characterization other than "pure blood fanatic", "obsessively loves Voldemort", and "sadistic"- none of which lend themselves to being on the good guys' side. Possibly some sort of psychiatric disorder relating to lack of emotional control/emotional volatility as well- I don't know the best diagnosis, and its debatable how much of her apparent instability is a product of her time in Azkaban. Its also possible, given that she supposedly taught Draco Occlumency*, that she has more emotional control when she needs to than is immediately apparent.

Its important to remember, though, not to make her just generically "crazy" (far too many female characters get shoved in that box), or stupid- she's evidently quite intelligent, given her magical ability and how she saw through Snape's duplicity well enough to force him into an unbreakable vow.

The easiest way to "redeem" her given the little we know about her known characterization that I can think of is to simply have her switch the subject of her obsessive love from Voldemort to someone on the good side, with her adopting her new crush's views on blood purity as well. But I worry that might be kind of sexist as a basis for her character arc. Unfortunately, as I said, Bella doesn't have much established character to work with.

Edit: A couple other things-

1. Bella seems to admire power. I may be reading too much into it, but if this is the case its possible that someone who rivals Voldemort's power might gain her respect or admiration.
2. Bella seems to have a strong sense of loyalty/duty in general- I base this on both her loyalty to Voldemort, and the fact that she went into a "good pure blood marriage" and stayed there, despite her seeming lack of interest in her husband (admittedly we don't see much of their interactions).
3. She's definitely not a coward- to the point of having a reckless disregard for her own safety, at times.

If she was motivated, either by love or respect for a great power, to transfer her loyal to someone on the other side, she'd be a potentially immensely valuable asset, given her magical prowess, intelligence, and wealth, as well as inside knowledge of the Death Eater. However, she'd also likely be difficult to control, especially if she retains her tendency toward sadism and emotional volatility. Its unlikely her usual tactics and spells would sit will with anyone in the Order- even those who occassionally use dark spells, like Snape and McGonnagle, don't seem to relish them the way Bellatrix does. Bellatrix doesn't seem to be terribly subtle in combat- she's not the person you use for covert ops, she's the person you use when you want someone to go on a murder spree to terrorize your enemies. And that's not really how the Order operates, nor am I convinced they would benefit from operating in that manner (it would cost them support of some of their members and antagonize the Ministry, while not really deterring the Death Eaters because they'd still be more scared of Voldie).

*While Snape IIRC suspects Bellatrix, I think it more likely that Narcissa was the one who taught Draco Occlumency, given their relationship and the fact that she was able to fool Voldemort about Harry being alive in Deathly Hallows.
