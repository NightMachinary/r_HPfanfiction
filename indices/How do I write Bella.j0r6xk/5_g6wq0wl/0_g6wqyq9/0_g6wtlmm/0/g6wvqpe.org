Firstly, thank you for the feedback! And secondly, I completely agree with all the points you made, most of all, the last one. I want her to be nonchalant about the Longbottoms death first up, but eventually have some form of empathy, and for her to facing her crimes. I know it's extremely hard to have a story after she escaped Azkaban, but I'm trying to challenge my writing anyway.
