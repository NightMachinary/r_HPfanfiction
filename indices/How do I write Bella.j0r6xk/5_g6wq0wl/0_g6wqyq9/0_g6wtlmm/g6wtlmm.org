Harry/Bellatrix is a very hard plot to make work, for two reasons.

First, of course, there's the age difference. That's not an issue (to me, anyway) as long they're both adults and capable of consent, but that means Bellatrix has to live a good deal longer than she does in the books.

Secondly, there's the history. If the point of divergence from canon comes after she goes to Azkaban, then she's already guilty of, at minimum, being a Death Eater, and participating in the torture of Neville's parents to insanity. Harry is canonically an immensely forgiving person, but there are limits. And even if he's prepared to forgive her, Neville probably isn't, and Harry values that friendship.

I could actually see Bellatrix becoming infatuated with Harry, with a little squinting and a few assumptions about her personality (underdeveloped as it is)- mostly because he's one of the few Wizards (the other being Dumbledore) who can compare to Voldie in power and status. And there's a certain symmetry in light side Bella being drawn to Voldie's light side foil. But realistically, it would probably be a one-way attraction (much like her attraction to Voldie, actually, Cursed Child aside- and even in Cursed Child, it comes off more as her being used to achieve an end rather than Voldemort actually having feelings for her).

I think its very, very important that her redemption should not be a result of Harry or anyone else falling in love with her- you can't change someone by loving them, sad to say. The redemption has to come first (preferably before she kills Sirius), then the romance, for it to work.

Its easier to do, frankly, if its before her involvement in the Longbottoms' torture as well. That's a hard crime to forgive. But if you're set on her changing only after she's been in Azkaban, then I think it would be a stronger story if you face that head-on. A lot of authors would try to let Bellatrix off the hook by minimizing her role in that crime, or trying to handwave it away by saying she was under the Imperius or something. But that's just evading the issue, and in a very obvious way. I think to make a Bellatrix redemption really work, you have to have her face up to her guilt in that atrocity, to own it, and to try in some way to atone for it (even though there is no way to really make up for something like that).
