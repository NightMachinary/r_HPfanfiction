Most people in my opinion have a hard time understanding why bellatrix is deranged in the books. The primary reason for it is cause of Azkaban, the only way to keep your mind with that much exposure to dementors is by obsessing over something she obsessed over Voldemort and the cause. The easiest way to begin changing her character is by changing the obsession to something like her loyalty to family. So really her character is dependent on if she went to Azkaban and if she did how long.
