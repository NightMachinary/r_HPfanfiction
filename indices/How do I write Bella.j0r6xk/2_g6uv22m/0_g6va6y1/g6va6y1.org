What if her hell started before that?

What if she started to break when Andromeda ran away?

What if Cygnus, Druella and Walburgha punished Bellatrix for Andromeda's wrongs?

What if Voldemort saved Bellatrix from her own family and that is why she sees him as a saviour as the man with the answer? The man who saved her from the hell that was her home?

Sirius made it clear that he was being beaten. What if Bellatrix was too for protecting her sisters?

Why didn't Narcissa join the cause if she believed in blood purity? Was it because she saw the way her oldest and dearest sister (Especially after Andromeda ran) was broken by that very same belief?
