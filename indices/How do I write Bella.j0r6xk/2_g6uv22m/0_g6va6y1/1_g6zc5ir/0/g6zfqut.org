The running away while he was sixteen and the abusive language from Walburgha's painting and kreacher. The fact that a house-elf (Which should be loyal to it's master by magic) could participate in getting him killed.

Quite a few serial killers had abusive childhoods. Now that is not a casuistic connection but it lends to the narrative.

On the notion of why Bellatrix would be punished for Andromeda's wrongs? That is a typical pattern of most homes. The oldest shares some of the responsibility for the younger siblings.

That isn't fair necessarily but the combination of age (sometimes) equaling maturity makes it an opportunity for the oldest to learn some responsibility whether it is through playing with their younger siblings or looking after them while Mum or Dad is out of the house.

Of course this is purely taking that responsibility to the logical extreme and combining it with a supposed black school thought on punishment (The meaning might have gotten lost in cultural translation. A Black school is a translated name for a type of educational institution which was prevalent in my country during the 1900's where corporeal punishment was seen as the best way to raise children. I digress) in the Black home (Pun equally intended and unintended) would lead to Bellatrix taking a rather sinister punishment for not keeping Andromeda on the straight an narrow.

This is all conjecture from WAY too little evidence. We are given maybe 500 words worth of knowledge about the Black Family in the seventies and gaps are being filled by just that hypothetical information.

That is usually how you would work a case study in psychology. You would try to find the most plausible explanation based on whatever information you have got leading to asking the right question.

If I had Bellatrix (The canon version) in for a diagnostic interview. I would definitely start at her childhood home and then further moving on to Azkaban to try and find out some of the factors for her current condition.

Or it might all be nature and she was born to be mad and insane. Everything is genetics and no amount of social nurture had anything to do with her fanatical way of life.

Either way I don't know if there even are a "correct" answer. I have tried to explain my thought process and how I came to my conjecture by whatever limited information I had. All in all you are correct when you said "Then it simply comes down to how you want to write her character". However, I personally think that a good story doesn't break the base material (Canon, Wizarding World/Pottermore) and just write whatever we want. If that was the point then write your own character instead.
