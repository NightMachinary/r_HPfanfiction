Then it simply comes down to how you want to write her character. I personally do t remember where it was implied or stated that Sirius was beaten outside of fanfiction. But like I said it comes down to how someone wants to write her character. Naricssa not joking the death eaters even when believing in blood purity purely means she's not a fanatic and realizes the muggle borns have their place. As for being broken in a abusive household given I honestly doubt that would have happened abused people don't typically become deranged killers. I also don't see why it makes any sense for bellatrix to be punished for andromeda's wrongs.
