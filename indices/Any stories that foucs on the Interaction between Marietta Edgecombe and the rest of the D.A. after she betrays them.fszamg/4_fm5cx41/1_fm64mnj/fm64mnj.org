Agreed I was sort of looking at it from a hurt/comfort angle, were hermione and the weasly twins go way to far in their retribution.

So th D.A. Would eventually sort of be split with the weasly twins and hermione on one side that want to keep makeing Marrietta suffer and Cho and eventually Harry on the other who start feeling sorry for Marrieta.

At first I think the whole D.A. Even Cho should be on board with what they are doing to Marrieta and then first Cho and then others start feeling sorry for her.

One thing to remember is that Kingsley obliviated Marrieta in Dumbledore's office so she only remembered the first meeting. So Cho and eventually Harry would find that out About the memory charm and help undo it and by the time the Memory charm was fixed Marrieta would have warmed up to Harry and genuinely feel bad about betraying him and the D.A.

I do think that for embarrassing her Umbridge would have made Marrieta suffer.

So Umbridge probably made Marrieta at the very least Write lines with a blood quil for the embarrassment Marrieta caused her.
