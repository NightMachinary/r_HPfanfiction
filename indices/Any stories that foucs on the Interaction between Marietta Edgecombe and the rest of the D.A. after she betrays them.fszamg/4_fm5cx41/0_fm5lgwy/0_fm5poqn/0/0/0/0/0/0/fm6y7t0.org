I don't sympathize with betrayers. There were muggleborn among the DA whose lives would've been in danger had they been expelled or sent to Azkaban. At best, the rest would've had the future careers compromised and might've had to repeat the year. She deserved the hex, and the memory modification was expedient.

The consequences of her betrayal, had it succeeded in its entire scope, were very great; the retaliation against her was tame in comparison. Not to mention, she also betrayed Cho, /her best friend/.

Why would Umbridge punish Marietta? Her information got Dumbledore out of Hogwarts and made her headmistress. That Harry and the rest got off was because Dumbledore took the blame; it had nothing to do with Marietta. It would've been pointless and counterproductive to punish her.

In canon, the Weasley twins retaliated against Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad, not Marietta.

Hermione's hex should've been preventive rather than just punitive; it should've made it impossible for anyone to betray them, but maybe that was beyond her abilities then.

IMO, I would like a story where she genuinely feels sorry for the betrayal and makes an honest apology to the DA, rather than just one to get them to stop attacking her, and Hermione's hex is automatically lifted because of it.
