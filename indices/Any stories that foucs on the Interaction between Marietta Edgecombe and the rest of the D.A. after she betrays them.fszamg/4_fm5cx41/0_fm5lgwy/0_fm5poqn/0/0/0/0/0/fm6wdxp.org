From a certain point of View she is, Her face was permanently scarred,she had her memory modified by Kingsley, she was man handeled by Umbridge(whats the Bet the Umbridge Interrogated Marietta again in the day after dumbledore left the Castle, and had Marietta right Lines with a Blood quill for embaresseing her infront of Fudge( make you wonder if Marietta and Harry both have "I will not tell lies." Scar or would Umbridge have Marietta right something different).

I was also thinking of The Weasly Twins (and other D.A members) more actively seeking revenge against Marietta.To the point were She Goes to the D.A. to apologize and get them to stop targeting her.

I wonder if Cho thought Hermione was behinde Kingsley's Memoery charm, after all Permanetly Scaring some and then Taking away the memory of what they did would be a pretty nasty thing to do.
