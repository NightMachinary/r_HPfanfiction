You really think Marrieta was knowingly helping Voldemort? That is a bit out there even for you?

I also doubt that she knew about umbridge style of punishment after all Harry is a very private person So I really doubt that he would have told the whole D.A. About Umbridges use of Blood quill.

If you don't have anything on topic to add like a story to suggest then don't bother Commenting in this thread again.
