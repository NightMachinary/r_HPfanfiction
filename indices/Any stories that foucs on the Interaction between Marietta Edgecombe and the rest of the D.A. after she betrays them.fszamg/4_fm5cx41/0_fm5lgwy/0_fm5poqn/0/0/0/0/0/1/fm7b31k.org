You know whom Marietta directly and knowingly helped with her actions? Voldemort. She was ensuring that Dumbledore was driven out of Hogwarts and that the other students were less able to protect themselves. Not to mention that the entire DA had to know about Umbridge's brand of discipline, which is outright torture by any definition. And yet Marietta, without any need, went to that woman and told her everything.

Traitors and collaborators were usually executed for their actions. There is footage of firing Squads from postwar France on YouTube, and those who were shot there did less to help the Nazis than Marietta did for Voldemort and Umbridge.
