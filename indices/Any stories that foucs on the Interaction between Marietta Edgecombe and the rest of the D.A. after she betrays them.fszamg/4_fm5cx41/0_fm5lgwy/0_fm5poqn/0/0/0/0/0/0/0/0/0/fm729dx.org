Really a lot of the Other stuff in Harry potter fanfiction has been done to death, and I want something that dosn't deal with Voldemort, Death,eaters, Slytherins,ect.

A a story that focuses on theD.A.& Marietta would be something new that the Fandom hasn't dont anything with at all, apart from Bashing Marietta. After all in most Fanfction she seems to end up as one of the Ringleaders of the Girls that bully Luna.

So a stories that Stick insdie Hogawrts and just follows the D.A.& Marietta. with Umbridge and the inquisitorial squad as Background Characters Forcing Marietta to reconcile with the D.A.( because you need some reason for Marietta to go Crawling back to the D.A.)
