The whole purpose of the DA was to prepare its members for the coming fight against Voldemort because Umbridge failed to do so. Their training might have been ineffective against the likes of Bellatrix Lestrange, but would certainly work against the average snatcher.

  I also doubt that she knew about umbridge style of punishment after all Harry is a very private person So I really doubt that he would have told the whole D.A.

Unless he wore gloves, everyone would have seen the scars. Lee was also tortured, and it stands to reason that they were not the only ones.
