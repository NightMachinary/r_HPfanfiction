  I think its stupid that Death eaters seem to be held in higher regard by the fandom than Marietta.

I won't speak for the rest of the fandom but I certainly don't hold any Death Eater in /higher/ regard than Marietta, /including/ Snape and Malfoy. I just don't think she's a good person just because she's better than the Death Eaters.

  ... Cho goes to Harry and the D.A. to talk about the memory charm thinking it was part of the charms on the D.A. List, Harry and the D.A. are suprised and then start Working with Marietta, ...

Ugh no. In an AU, maybe but this certainly contradicts canon so you'll have to make several changes.

Harry /knows/ that Kingsley modified Marietta's memory (and why) and he's definitely not going to give that information to Marietta (or Cho) after he's already been betrayed by her. It would only lead to Kingsley being fired. The DA certainly /won't/ help Marietta regain her memories because that would get them expelled if Marietta betrays them again. She'll have to feel terrible for what she did /first/ because she /knows/ she betrayed the DA and her friend; only her memories of prior meetings in RoR were modified.
