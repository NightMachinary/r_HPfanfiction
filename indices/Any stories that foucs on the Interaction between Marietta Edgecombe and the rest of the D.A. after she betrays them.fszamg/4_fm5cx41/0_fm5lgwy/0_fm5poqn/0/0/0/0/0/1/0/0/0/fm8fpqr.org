That would involve Marrieta beliveing that Voldemort was back which she Probably Didn't.

Pretty sure Lee was punished after Dumbledore was kicked out, but I might be miss remembering.

Yeah a discussion about how such a story might go.

Edit:The D.A. Also can't really leave Marrieta out to dry after all Harry knows that Voldemort can break memory charms, after all he broke the one that Barty crouch senior put on Bertha Jorkins.
