I think its stupid that Death eaters seem to be held in higher regard by the fandom than Marietta.

Really the Type of story I would be happy with is one were Cho goes to Harry and the D.A. to talk about the memory charm thinking it was part of the charms on the D.A. List, Harry and the D.A. are suprised and then start Working with Marietta, Marietta warms up to harry and the D.A. while they are helping her regain her memory and then have Her feel Terrible when she remebers what she did.
