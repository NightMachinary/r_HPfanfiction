I do. Read Wizard first. It will slowly get away from Lungs then about two thirds through it just goes bizarre.

To give you an idea Harry is very much Sasuke and Hermione is Sakura.

But not in the way you think.

In retrospect Lungs predicted how Sasuke turned out well before Kishimoto let his own creation get away from him.

Fractal is cleaner but became one of the reasons now only read completed. To me its good. And Lungs realized Wizard got away so cleaned it up and changed a few things.
