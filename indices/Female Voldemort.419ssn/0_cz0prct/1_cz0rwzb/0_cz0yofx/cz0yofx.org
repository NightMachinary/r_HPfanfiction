Do you recommend reading The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope OR Fractal?

Fractal says it's a rewrite, but with 100k less words and not updated in two years, and the other being complete I'm not sure where to start. I'm kind of assuming the rewrite won't allow me to simply switch chapters after reaching the end.
