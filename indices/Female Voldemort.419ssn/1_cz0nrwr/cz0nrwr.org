Thunderstorm linkffn(7186430) :

The best fem!Voldemort fic I have read. I normally avoid fics that have Voldemort paired with Harry (slash or one character is fem) because the age gap between the characters makes anything of that sort creepy and unrealistic for me. That said, thunderstorm is written with Harry being paired with a fem!Tom that is as old as him.
