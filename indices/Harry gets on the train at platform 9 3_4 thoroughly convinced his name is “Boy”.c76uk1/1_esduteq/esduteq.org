I don't doubt thats what he thought his name was up until he had to go to elementary school. The Dursley's probably had to drill it into him before they sent him to school, otherwise the abuse would be pretty obvious. I'd like to believe no teacher of children would call him 'Boy'.

Fics with child abuse also give me creeps, and like Liristorm said, make me far to sad and angry to enjoy.
