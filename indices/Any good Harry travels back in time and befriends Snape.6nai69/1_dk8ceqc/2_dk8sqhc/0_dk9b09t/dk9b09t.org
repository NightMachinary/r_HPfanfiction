Hm, it has been a while so I can't say if it gets better, but I found it decent enough to read for me at the time. I do remember that the plot is original and that's it's not a canon rehash which is always nice.

If you are interested in deaged fic concept, this one is written better although it's a SS/HG fic and he doesn't really get deaged exactly so much as thrown forward in time. linkffn(Severus, Redux) Snape created a time potion in his 6th year that time travels him forward 20 years to Harry's 6th year. His older self is still around though so he is a clone. Fic is WIP and not complete yet.
