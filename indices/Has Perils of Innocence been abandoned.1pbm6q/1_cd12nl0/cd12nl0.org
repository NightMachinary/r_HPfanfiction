I feel jaded, but I've given up on reading WIP. I LOVE reading stories and there is nothing worse then getting to a story that is highly recommended on ff.net and it not been updated in like 1.5 years or 2 years.

The worst to me is when there is a story and then they say it's going to be part of a multi-part story and the author completes some of it, and then abandons it.
