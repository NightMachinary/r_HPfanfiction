Linkffn(Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage) is my favorite, personally.

Linkffn(Child Of The Storm) has a few crossovers. One of which is Dresden Files. Dresden is a fairly important character himself in some parts of the story, but I wouldn't describe him as a main character. The Summer Lady and Knight also make an appearance, iirc.
