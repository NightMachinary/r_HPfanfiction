  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Harry Potter has had many titles in his life: Boy-Who-Lived, Auror, Master of the Mystic Arts. But after an assignment in the United States he gains one more, possibly the most important one yet. Avenger. MCU and other Marvel elements. Pairing undecided. Will be a Marvel character though, not a Harry Potter character. No Slash for main pair. Strictly Harry's point-of-view except the rare occasion I think it can add something.

  When Pepper leaves Tony, he reverts to his old habits. He's not expecting much when he picks up Hari, but is pleasantly surprised when their hook-up turns into something more.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
