Well, most Avenger fics have that premise, one way or the other. I'll just link a few that have this. From other fandoms as well.

linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlifecrisis; On Punching gods and Absentee Dads; Harry Potter and the Responsability of Ability; Ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece)

linkffn(Wand and Shield; Slowly and then All at Once; By Courage and Love; FILFY Teacher; Invincible; The Archmage of Arda; Post apocaliptic Potter from a parallel universe)

Those are the ones of the top of my head.
