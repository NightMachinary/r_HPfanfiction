  This is an alternate timeline in which Regulus survived The Cave and brings the locket to Dumbledore in hopes of destroying it. He, instead of Snape, becomes Potions Master after the fall of Voldemort. Like Snape he begins as an untrustworthy character, but over time becomes a more trusted ally.I'm rating it 'General' because there's nothing that I'll include that would be out of place in Rowling's original work.
