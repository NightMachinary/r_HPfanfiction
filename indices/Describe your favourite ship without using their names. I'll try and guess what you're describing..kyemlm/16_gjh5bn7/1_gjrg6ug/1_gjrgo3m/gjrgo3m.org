There are many different kinds of Tomarry fics. I recommend going through ao3. The older fics are really good. Filter to look through the older ones. There are many completed ones. Though I gotta warn you, "Tom Riddle/Harry Potter", "Voldemort/Harry Potter", and "Tom Riddle | Voldemort/ Harry Potter" are pretty different tags. There are also ones with two "\" marks and those are threesomes. There are many good authors. And many different fics. The diversity is honestly really astounding.
