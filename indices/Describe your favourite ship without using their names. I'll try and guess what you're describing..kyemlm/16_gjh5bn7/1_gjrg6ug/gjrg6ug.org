I gotta say, the only Tomarry I really like (LOVE) is Lily/Lenin from linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) and Harry/younger Tom from linkffn(When Harry Met Tom by The Carnivorous Muffin). They're both by him (Muffin) and they're both great beyond imagination! Its just written SO WELL and I REALLY recommend both!
