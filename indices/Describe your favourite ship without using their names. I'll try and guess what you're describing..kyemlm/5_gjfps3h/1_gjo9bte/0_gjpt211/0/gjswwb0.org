My personal preference for Draco (if Draco is in a hetro ship), is Draco/Astoria, but honestly I've read so much Drarry that it's really hard for me to see Draco with anyone but Harry anymore. I ship plenty of hetro couples as well, I just prefer to read slash/femslash since it's more relateable to me as a lesbian myself.
