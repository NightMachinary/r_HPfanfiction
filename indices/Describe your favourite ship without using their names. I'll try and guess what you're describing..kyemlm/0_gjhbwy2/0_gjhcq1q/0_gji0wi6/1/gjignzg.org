Even more so if it is an AU where Hufflepuff was the actual super rich house (still with the same reputation though) while Slytherin was a muggleborn/from a very young family that ended up poor after he left/was killed/died naturally/whatever and never got to the heights of prestige Salazar envisioned.

Can you imagine Tom's conflict at having to choose between claiming to be Slytherin's heir and getting only a smidgen of respect from his house-mates or admitting that he is Hufflepuff's heir and get the riches but also be forced to deal with a ridiculous name plus being ridiculed though his whole life since his Hufflepuff side of the family made excellent business decisions and worked hard for their money but never actually bothered showing it off or using it to accumulate power.
