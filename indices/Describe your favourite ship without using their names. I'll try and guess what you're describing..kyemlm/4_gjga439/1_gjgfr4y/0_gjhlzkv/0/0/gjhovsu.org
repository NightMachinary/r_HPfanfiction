Harry/Hannah is common enough to have tropes?

Also, anything with Malfoy would need to diverge early enough that he would be practically recognisable. And Lupin's number 1 canon trait is disappearing, so he's no relationship material.

James/Lily is a special case where I would say that the plot is limiting it rather than the tropes. Few authors are willing to say "screw canon, they win and survive the war".
