One is a mystery whose destiny is constantly changing yet never the same, one is a well known constant that had the power to change everything. One is always based in reality the other is from outside the scope of fate, one is set on a straight linear path the other constantly is taking wrong turns and zigzags that should never have been accessible. What pairing am I thinking of?
