I remember one story (which I dont remember sorry), where platypus's were magical animals, and muggles just did their damndest to clasify it despite it not really fitting the mold for nonmagical animals, and since muggles just accepted it was an average if strange animal the obliviators just accepted it was easier to let them think that than try to cover them up.
