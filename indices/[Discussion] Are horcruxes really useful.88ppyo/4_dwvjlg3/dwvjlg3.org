My own personal headcanon is that horcruxes (and other, similar devices not shown in the books) simply don't work as advertised, or the magical world at least would be hip deep in immortal dark lords, or at least permanently under the sway of a small number of successful ones who keep the pretenders down to at most a dull roar.
