Quirrell wasn't a follower. Voldemort swayed him to his side when he found him in Albania. We really don't know the extent of his powers in that ghostly form, so we don't know what he could have done to Quirrell to bring him to his side.

Horcruxes are pretty much a last resort. Voldemort was only in his ghostly form for 13 years. That's a drop in the bucket if he's immortal.
