But this is it. The possession of Qurrell didn't work. The whole plot about him was getting the Philosopher's stone, that was a gamble. Riddle didn't have any other variants.

He couldn't use the same ritual as with Wormtail, because he didn't have any body. And for getting a body he needed a follower.

Therefore horcruxes work only if there're trusted followers who can perform required rituals, and even Riddle got two of them because of luck.
