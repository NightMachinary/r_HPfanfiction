I can be wrong, but as I remember Quirrell started dying as soon as Riddle had possessed him and the possession was consensual.

But I see some logic in it: find a host, create a cult about himself, make other members of the cult to create a homunculus and then perform the ritual.

Still for 10 years Riddle failed doing it.
