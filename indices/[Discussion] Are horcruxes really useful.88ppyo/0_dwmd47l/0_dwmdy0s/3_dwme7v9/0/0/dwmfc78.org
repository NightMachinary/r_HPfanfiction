Riddle was still very weak for that first decade. Too weak to possess a person, even consensually. "Lesser than the meanest ghost" I believe the phrase was. He had to survive on animal life before he met Quirrel. And again, Horcruxes make him immortal. He could wait as long as it takes. /Eventually/ he would get his body back.

And he really only needs one person to do the ritual. No need for a cult.
