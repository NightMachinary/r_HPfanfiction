Magicals live for a very long time, so even a hundred years would not be sufficient for people to forget. In addition, Voldemort was an extremely powerful and brutal dark lord, and his particular cause of pureblood supremacy would resonate for many generations. It would not be difficult to rally more to his cause. It's like Hitler. No doubt, his name will be remembered for more than the next hundred years. His cause of Aryan supremacy is still popular with some people today. If he were to come back, people would still rally to him.
