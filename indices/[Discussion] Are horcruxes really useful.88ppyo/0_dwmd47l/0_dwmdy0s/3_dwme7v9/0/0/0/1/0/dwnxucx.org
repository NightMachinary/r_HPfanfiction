  Magicals live for a very long time

It's a very debatable statement. In the books we see just one (or two?) truly old people -- Dumbledore (and some witch from the Ministry during OWLs?).

If it was true there would be a lot of grand- and grand-grand-parents. We see none. Even among the Dark families, which suffered less in the War), there aren't any.

  It's like Hitler.

Why is Voldemort often compared to Hitler? Hitler started the war where millions died. Compared to him Riddle led just a band of Ku Klux Klan cell. Yes, he is cruel and racist, but on the scale he isn't even near Hitler.

As I remember (I may be wrong) in the books it's stated that true analogue of Hitler is Grindelwald.

I agree that ghost like Riddle can try to seduce a weak minded person.

But last time it took it 10 years to do it, and at that time Quirrell was looking for him.
