The Philosopher's Stone was the most optimal choice for a full resurrection. It was likely the easiest and quickest to use. He could easily have directed Quirrel to make a homunculus for him and used the Blood of my Foe ritual, but that would have taken longer and probably be sub-standard to a Philosopher's Stone resurrection.
