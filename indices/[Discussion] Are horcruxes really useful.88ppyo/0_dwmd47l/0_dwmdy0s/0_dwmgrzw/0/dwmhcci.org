That's exactly what I'm talking about.

Riddle's existence as an almost ghost was useless without willing followers. Remove them from the equation and he is a threat no more that Peeves.

As time goes it will be harder and harder to find new followers, because Voldemort's name will fade away.

Riddle managed to find just one in 10 years and no one after Quirrell's ultimate demise.
