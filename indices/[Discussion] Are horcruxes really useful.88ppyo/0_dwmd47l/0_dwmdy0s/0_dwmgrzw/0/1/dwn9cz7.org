With sufficient cunning, a wizard that exists mostly as a disembodied spirit can still manage to get resurected, even without being well-known. Just finding someone young and power-hungry and not too bright to slowly entice with promises of power and along the way trick them into resurrecting the wizard wouldn't be the hardest thing. Voldemort probably just didn't want to go this path because it would take a while, as opposed to going for the Stone or using the ritual.
