Voldemort didn't possess Quirrell until the school year started. Note for example, Harry shook Quirrell's hand in the Leaky Cauldron with no burning effect. Quirrell was a willing servant whom Voldemort just happened to possess later. He could have done the same thing as Pettigrew did later, it's just that Voldemort wanted the Philosopher's Stone.
