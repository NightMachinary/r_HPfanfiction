Voldemort mentions that he was able to posses animals and people, and that he was able to break the memory charms on Bertha Jorkins take her memories.

Voldemort also didn't try to find Quirrel, he is to proud for that. Quirrel was looking for Voldemort.

If you are a non arrogant dark wizards in wraith form you could easily spend your time possessing animal and look for suitable wizards who would help you in exchange for knowledge. with Legilimency its even easier to find out what they want. Just seeing someone clearly able to avoid death would convince a lot of people to help in exchange for knowledge, reputation isn't necessary.
