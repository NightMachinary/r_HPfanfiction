There are most likely lesser forms of recreation of a body than those we have seen in the books.

Its just that Voldemort was extremely arrogant and and didn't want to be the one to seek out his followers and waited for them to find him. When Quirrel showed up looking for Voldemort' secrets , Voldemort easily corrupted him.

Now was the problem that Voldemort didnt just want his original body back, he wanted the best possible body, so he tried to steal for the Philosophers Stone so he can create it.

  â€œThere was no hope of stealing the Philosopher's stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength

When that failed he grudgingly accepted to recreate his old body but even then he wanted to make it better by infusing the protective magic of Harry's blood.

A normal dark wizard using a horcrux most likely would just appear in front of someone loyal to them and get them to recreate their old body without anything fancy to make themselves more powerful.
