The diary was pretty successful.

I wonder if there were diminishing returns with each successive horcrux. The locket was also able to easily affect those with exposure.

I'm guessing he screwed himself by creating so many. It kept him more tied to Earth, but with other problems. I believe a properly used horcrux would be able to 1. take over someone exposed and 2. once the horcrux has fully posessed an individual the main spirit should re-fuse with the soul that was once inside of the horcrux. 3. The newly formed dark wizard should then create another horcrux in order to keep immortality rolling along. 4. Rinse and Repeat.

I truly think splitting himself up meant he had a lot of problems with rebirth. No followers needed. Although you should practice possession before embarking.
