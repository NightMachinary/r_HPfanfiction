I don't think the locket needed to seduce. I don't think the diary needed to seduce. I personally think a horcrux should be able to possess through exposure. No henchman needed for resurrection.

The diary does that by getting the writer to engage, the locket through wearing, etc.. I think some of the objects he chose were poor because they provided little interaction with possible posessees and they were all weakened because he had split himself up so much. The diary had the largest chunk of himself, including whatever he was walking around with in his own actual pre-disembodied self.

Unfortunately, all we have are theories. Mine is no less or more valid than others.
