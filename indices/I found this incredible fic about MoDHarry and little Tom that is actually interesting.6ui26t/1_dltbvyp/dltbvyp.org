It's not that great tbh. It has some mildly interesting spell discussions about the fidelius but that's about it. I was intrigued by the premise of Harry travelling with Voldemort's Horcrux to another world and raising him as his son, but it never actually gets beyond the infant stage - or even very far into that either. Tom Riddle as a baby can be replaced by literally any other baby in this fic and it wouldn't make a difference as people don't generally start showing interesting personalities at less than a year old, so the premise falls flat. And it's abandoned, and has basically no steam. I personally wouldn't recommend this - it reads like the author became a parent and wrote this to vent because that's literally all this is.
