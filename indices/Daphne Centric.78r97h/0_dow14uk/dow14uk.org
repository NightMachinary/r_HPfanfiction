Daphne Greengrass got quite a fanon reputation in 'Ice Queen of Slytherin'. I personally don't really like this characterization, but there are still some good fics out there:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), is the one fic I ship Harry/Daphne the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), is quite a fun read with a scumbag Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), has Daphne as part of a harem consisting of her, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. All 4 girls are fairly well written.
