During the Christmas ministry ball it is revealed that he has been manipulating events (and people) for a long time, in order to be essentially declared the heir apparent to the Director of MLE position. It is further implied he is the one originally responsible for the current Director's illness (and definitely responsible for it worsening during the ball).

Although the dating Daphne thing took a life of its own (and became its own reward), the original purpose of the dates was to showcase to the various old-school purebloods that he's not diametrically opposed to them, that he won't mess up their interests just because he can, that they can and will profit from their association with him - the clear example being how Daphne's family business prospers after she utilises Harry's contacts.

I dont know if R-dude intended it, but after reading this fic a few times, I started to see more than a few parallels between this Harry's moves and Voldemort's early rise to power. Old V too was supposed to be charming and seductive in his early days - and there are clear elements of fervent, fanatical loyalty in Harry's group of friends. Granted, Harry has proved his mettle again and again, but it's not so clear just /why/ he is so interested in increasing his power. There's a nice bit of ambiguity in the story, a sort of airy implication that of course Harry is always working towards the goal of "making things better for everyone", but my intuition cannot help but point out that his motives may be a little more sinister than that.
