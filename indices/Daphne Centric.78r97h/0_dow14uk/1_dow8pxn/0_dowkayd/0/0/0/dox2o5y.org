I mean even in canon, you don't become the youngest Head Auror without being ambitious, hardworking, manipulative, and successful.

As the Vanquisher of Voldemort, he would be a target regardless what he was doing, so he might as well create a loyal private army and use it to protect his interests and push his agenda. The only thing better than a Dark Lord was a Dark Lord with a badge.
