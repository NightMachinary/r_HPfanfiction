How so?

I never understood why people thought this way about him in this fic. He makes her go on like 3 dates with him. Oh no, the horror.

From what I remember of Daphne in this fic, she would /gladly/ abuse a betrothal contract to get what she wanted - and if this particular situation wasn't stacked against her, she would probably consider Harry a weak moron for not using it to his advantage.
