A Fine Spot of Trouble, linkffn(6257522), is a good one. It's post war with a Harry/Daphne pairing, but the story isn't focused on that relationship. If you are looking for something overly romantic Marry You, linkffn(12357903), was the first one that came to mind but unfortunately it's still a work in progress.
