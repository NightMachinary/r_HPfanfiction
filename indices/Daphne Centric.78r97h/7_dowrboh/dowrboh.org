The Legacy. AU starting 6th year. Novel length, unfinished but certainly an excellent read, and not abandoned as far as I can tell. A nice realistic slow burn that takes its own direction while still keeping true to various canon facts that occurred previous to the fic start, like Harry being a horcrux. Also darker than most but certainly suits the tone of the last three movies.

Has a fresh take on Hermione and Ron's personalities as flawed individuals with real depth rather than super genius and super slob.

Really centred on Daphne and Harry's perspectives. Pretty much my favourite Haphne story.

Fair warning, this story ruined lower quality stories for me. I just cant find enjoyment out of the lower class fics now. Much like Game of Thrones ruins most other shows due to the difference in quality.
