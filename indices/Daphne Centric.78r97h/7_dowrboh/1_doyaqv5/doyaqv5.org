I like it when the plot is moving or progressing, even if it's doing so slowly.

The part of this story I could not deal with was how often and in depth the magical theory and explanation was.

Also, the story telling dropped off for me when they became trapped in the same environment for many, many, many chapters.

That being said the characters are immaculately written, as well as daphne and harry's relationship imo.
