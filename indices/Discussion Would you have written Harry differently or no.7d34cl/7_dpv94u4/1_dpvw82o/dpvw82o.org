  I find it ludicrous that Harry would sacrifice himself to pay for the sins of a society full of scumbags.

I don't. We saw from the get-go that Harry was a rather protective person who cared more about others' well-being than himself (eg. the troll and the Chamber). Harry by the end had five close friends, a godson and numerous other decent classmates to protect. Sacrificing himself was the morally right option from his perspective, and I don't think you can change that without changing like 80% of the story.
