I don't mind Harry generally. If there's one thing that I would change, it would be Harry's decision to go to his death.

The fact that JK shoehorned her christian narrative into the story leaves a very bad taste in my mouth - I find it ludicrous that Harry would sacrifice himself to pay for the sins of a society full of scumbags.

I'd probably change the ending to something like - Harry kills Voldemort - being the last horcrux, Voldemort's shade tries to possess him - after a titanic mental battle of wills, Harry emerges victorious, but not unscarred.
