The biggest change I would make is that Harry,s feats of powerful magic would not peak at the end of Third year. After the Patronus that drives off over a hundred dementors at the end of third years harry's never does any magic that even comes close to surpassing it.

Edit: also no Prophecy or at least change the wording harry was in no way Voldemort equal which is what leads a lot of fans to become angry at harry for not living up to the Hype.
