If JKR hadn't set Harry Potter in our world I'd like Harry way more. But to be as well adjusted as he is (yes temper. Yes moody. Yes a few other things.) doesn't sit with me given we draw so much from our expectations of how our own world works.

I'd have way more internal dialogue at least through the first few books rationalizing his decisions, so we get a little better growth from him.
