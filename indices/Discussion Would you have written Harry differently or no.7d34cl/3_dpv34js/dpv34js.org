The first thing I would change is to remake Voldemort. I don't care for that typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain that has been done ad nauseam these days. I would make him a complex person with some great personal virtues, but unfortunately found himself on the wrong side of history.

The next thing I would change is Dumbledore. He should no longer be that dumbed down plot device who only showed up in last chapter to sort out things. He would be that machiavellian puppet master who fought on the right side of history, and he would do lots of heavy lifting and maneuvering himself.

I would also get rid of the entire Roald-Dahlesque Dursley scheme. It made no sense to dump the hope of your nation into an abusive home, and the chance of getting your next deranged dark lord was just too high. Buying reader sympathy by letting heroes growing up in abusive household is way overused IMO.
