The one problem with this whole plot is that it removes Harry from the story. While it'd be a great story between two chessmasters on the battlefield of politics and war, Harry would literally be a tool used as Dumbledore's final weapon. The only way to make it a story about Harry is if you bumped up his age so that he has the knowledge and skill to compete with these two giants.
