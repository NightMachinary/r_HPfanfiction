I have problems with the epilogue as well but for different reasons. The Albus Severus namesake is more along the lines of why would Harry or Ginny want to name their kid after a man that hated their father. Sure he died at the hands of the dark lord while being undercover and helped Harry many times but I don't believe that could have endeared them to his memory that much after all the open hostility the man showed Harry.

And the Ginny/Harry relationship isn't clicking. I'm not saying they could never marry but the epilogue felt like too much of a quick tying up ends on kids and marriage. I would've liked to know how we got there.
