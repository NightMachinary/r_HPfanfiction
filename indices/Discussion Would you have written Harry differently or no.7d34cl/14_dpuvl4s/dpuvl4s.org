I think that the very presence of fan fiction is testament to readers displeasure with aspects of the books. However, as much as I would love to have characters and plot points that are different, I am deeply grateful for the books as they are. I grew up with the Harry Potter books, and they were exactly what I needed as I aged. For that, I love them completely as they are. As an adult, I would have written the books to have more moral grey areas. Life is not black and white, and that is something I explore in every fan fiction I write. I personally like Harry just the way he is. He doesn't follow a standard. He isn't the smartest, the most dedicated, the strongest, or the most emotionally stable character, but that makes him human. He acts as a teenager would- angsty, lost, distrustful, reluctant, and dramatic. There a good many points in the books where I wanted to scream at him and say, "what are you doing?!" but then I remember that my mother wanted to scream that same sentence at me many times during my childhood, and I didn't have an insane Dark Lord after my head. My biggest issue, is the epilogue. (Don't get me started on Cursed Child- I refuse to accept is as a "Harry Potter book".) No offense to any children who may have been named Albus Severus after the release of Deathly Hallows, but the name is cringe-worthy. I understand James and Lily- honoring dead parents. But there is no need for Albus Severus- it's a baby name that is a pleasant thought, but one you move on from to more normal names. Also, I was never a fan of Harry's relationship with Ginny because: first, the jealously stunt she pulled in their sixth year, and second, it is way too Freudian. Ginny already has an obsession with him from her childhood, and that never sat right with me, but I can live with it after he saved her from the Chamber. However, Harry is told that Ginny looks like a mini-Lily, and he doesn't find it the least bit odd that he's attracted to the person everyone says looks like his mother. Overall, I love Harry and the books just the way they are. If I were to change Harry to this ideal character in my mind, he would cease to be Harry Potter and all of the magnificence that holds.
