Well... Fudge became Minister of Magic and he's not what I would call clever, bad-ass, or even competent. Hell, just look at the current US president for confirmation that you don't have to be a great person or even seen as competent to nail a position in politics.

Also Tenacity can easily flip to Stubbornness, which she often is and her reputation as a know-it-all is well deserved (look at how she acts several times in class). She seems like she could be a good friend to those who can put up with these traits, but the books only show us snapshots of her. Being around her every day would drive me crazy, as she is the type of person who I would not like to be around too much.

Also I completely understand Harry enjoying Ron's friendship more, they're more alike than he is with Hermione. Both play the same sport, appear to play the same game, neither of them are overachievers like Hermione, and their personalities are pretty similar. Ron has his faults just like Harry and Hermione, but it's not really a stretch to see that out of the three Ron and Harry are the best friends.
