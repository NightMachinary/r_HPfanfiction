I believe S.P.E.W. was Goblet of Fire (book 4), not Order of the Phoenix (book 5). Also, for Post 7, she became the Minister of Magic. What impresses me most about Hermione is her drive to learn. She's a Muggle-Born and she knows she has something to prove in this new world of hers, but she never seems to waver in the trove of understanding she could gain which pushes her above her peers at Hogwarts. She's tenacious, a bad-ass, and a completely loyal friend to Harry (who didn't seem to enjoy her friendship as much as he did with Ron).
