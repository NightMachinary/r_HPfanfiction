I agree she's not on Dumbledore, Grindelwald or Voldemort's level. She was a good witch but she wasn't amazing. It's only Remus Lupin that said she was smart, and while he was a cool wizard he wasn't a titan like Dumbledore lol.

She only had knowledge (and not a lot if you count the Dark arts), whereas the three here I've listed had knowledge and power. Like for real a 15 year old Tom Riddle would wipe the floor with a fully grown Hermione.

Owl wise you even get people like Barty Crouch Jr so she isn't exactly top tier. Fuck even Bill and Percy managed to get 12 Owls. Hermione ditched 2 (in her third year) so she could lighten her work load, so why did these 3 wizards manage to do just fine? (At a higher level also considering 3rd year work is easier than 5th year work) I'll tell you why, because Hermione is hard working, not a genius (I don't care what JK Rowling says).

People even in real life do pass courses with near 100% without studying, they just turn up at the class, listen, do the required homework and don't even think about the class outside of class time. I can't imagine someone like Tom Riddle worrying about a test lol. (Dumbledore also said Tom was the most gifted student Hogwarts ever had)

Hermione has average to above average intelligence (Not genius) and merely studies harder than everyone else in her year. Percy is probably the same. Bill I don't know much about, he could just be gifted. Percy strikes me as the Hermione type though (Studies a lot to make sure she passes with a high mark, as opposed to inherent talent)
