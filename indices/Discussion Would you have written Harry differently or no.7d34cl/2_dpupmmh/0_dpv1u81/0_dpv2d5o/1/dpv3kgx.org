Call me utilitarian, but a friendship should also be about helping each other and making themselves useful to each other. Especially when you are in life and death situations, you can trust that one at your side.

Friendship is /far more/ than about just having a good time with each other. Your best drinking buddy or party friend might /betray/ you the first chance he/she gets to save his/her own ass.

Hermione was definitely not Harry's party friend, but he /trusted/ her to be with him when the going gets tough. That is for me TRUE FRIENDSHIP.
