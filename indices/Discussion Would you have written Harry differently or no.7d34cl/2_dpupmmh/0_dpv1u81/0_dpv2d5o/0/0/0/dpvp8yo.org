  Do you however, think that without Hermione, Harry may have developed better social skills?
#+end_quote

Eh, maybe. However the Boy-Who-Lived thing would always be there, fucking up things. Hermione read about him in a couple of books, but most of the other kids at Hogwarts grew up hearing stories about him.

  I'm a big believer that Harry should have been closer to the Quidditch team than we were ever show as he spent multiple hours with them multiple times a week
#+end_quote

Yeah, definitely. Harry should have been mentored in a lot of things by the team. That was one of my pet peeves in the original books.

  Does Hermione's overwhelming presence push out others?
#+end_quote

Without a doubt. Especially after the house-elf noise. It's equally probable, however, that Harry didn't /want/ to make any more friends. His childhood being what it is, I can see him being paranoid about being exposed to more people.
