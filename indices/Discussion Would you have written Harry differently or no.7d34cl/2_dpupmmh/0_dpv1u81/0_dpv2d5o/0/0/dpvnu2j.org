I don't disagree with your statement. Do you however, think that without Hermione, Harry may have developed better social skills? Consider Hermione's reputation as an insufferable know-it-all and several other less than flattering things. Did Harry, by being friends with Hermione force a clique around him? People couldn't be friends with Harry because they'd have to be around Hermione. I'm a big believer that Harry should have been closer to the Quidditch team than we were ever show as he spent multiple hours with them multiple times a week. They may not have chatted but the sense of being a team should have carried over. Does Hermione's overwhelming presence push out others?
