Indeed, Harry was just too nice a lot of times when abused children are often anything but when they finally have something that is truly theirs!

I wouldn't tell Hermione to "shove off", but I would sit her down ("Shut up for a second and listen...No, Hermione, you will listen for a change! This is for your own good after all!") and really tell her why people don't like her (because it really isn't her smarts like she probably asumes, no it's her acerbic personality and lack of social skills!) and what I am not willing to accept:

- No bossing me around ("You aren't my mother, Hermione!)
- No snitching to teachers ("For my own good? It's a good thing that I now question our friendship just because you couldn't talk to me?")
- No obeying worthless rules just because (she can do so, but enforcing them on me? Nope, no not even with a prefect's badge!)
- No learning stuff I might never need
- etc. etc.

Then again, some stuff might not apply to me in the first place, I liked learning (unlike Harry!) whenever it was interesting and I don't think learning magic (except for History of Magic and maybe potions and herbology!) can be boring and all of it is usefull!
