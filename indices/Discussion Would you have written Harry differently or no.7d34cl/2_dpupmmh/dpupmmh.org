I think people most often take issue with Harry's apparent lack of dedication once it is clear Voldemort is around and very much wants Harry dead. Exactly what they want I doubt they know but they just want to see more.

On a more personal note, my personality and canon Harry's are rather different. Things that I couldn't and to an extent still can't wrap my head around are for example Harry's tendency to share. This is very apparent in the first book when he makes friends with Ron, Harry having been deprived of so many things during his childhood instantly chooses to share. It wins him a friend yes, it might have been awkward to have the snacks while Ron picked at his corned beef but to me it would have made more sense for Harry to keep it to himself given the knowledge Dudley used to take anything nice he had. Out of habit alone he might have held some back. Other things include my dislike for Hermione. I find her irritating, she's not a bad person but I don't like her and her behavior she would have irritated me too much to stay friends with her, as such if I were to rewrite it Hermione would be relegated to a minor character simply because I wouldn't have Harry care enough one way or the other. No bashing no basking. Another thing that I would have done differently is Harry's actions following watching Snape's memories, namely there is no way I would have named a child after him, nor would I have done anything to clear his name. The man was an arse of the highest order who bullied children out of bitterness and spite. Not a legacy I would wish to preserve in any child.
