I would have make him less naive and more dedicated to study. Specially after Voldemort's first attempt to kill him. After living a live of abuse by the Dursley, there is absolutely no way that he could be such a gentle person, (like Tom) and also I wouldn't have make him befriend Hermione. I mean, look how he describe her at first. He uses the term (not exactly those, I translated from my first language) "annoying" "bossing tone" "pompous". You don't suddenly befriend someone just because you saved him. And I would make him leave the Dursley after the first year. I mean, he asked Dumbledore if he could leave who answered no and he obeyed him. Why? Dumbledore has no authority on what Harry does during his vacation. He could rent a chamber at the Leaky Cauldron during the whole summer, he does have the gold for it.
