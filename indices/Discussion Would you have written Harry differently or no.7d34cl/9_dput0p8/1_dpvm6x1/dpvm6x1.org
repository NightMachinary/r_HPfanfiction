I think more accurately, Harry should have started out by pitying Hermione following the Troll in the Bathroom scene. He'd invite her to join him and Ron because he feels bad for her. And then the way the friendship develops could go in one of either three ways. Perhaps somewhere along the way, they find something that makes the friendship click. Or another way is that they ease into a friendship, especially as she tries to tone her bossiness down over time. Or a third way could be that Ron and Harry find out about Flamel, and while they're discussing it, Hermione overhears. Then she might want to repay them or prove herself or something, and this gets her dragged into their adventures, which makes her end up as a friend.
