He does have the gold for it but Dumbledore enchanted his childhood home with the Dursley's (his only remaining blood-related family) with an ancient magic that protected him from outer evils, like Voldemort. There is no such thing at the Leaky Cauldron and he would have been vulnerable to attacks, even if Voldemort wasn't yet at full power.

I definitely agree about studying harder after realizing how pertinent the threat is. For that matter, I've always felt that if I were given the opportunity to study at a wizarding school, I would be busting my ass to learn and grow. Similar to Hermione's character but less pompous about it. I also wish she would have gone into more detail with some of the spells and how they work. I would have found it interesting to learn more about the magical subjects they were studying and what exactly they were learning rather than generally addressing the names of classes and talking about the extreme amounts of homework they had to accomplish.
