Yeah, from Harry's point of view, Dumbledore is The Knowledge. He's the highest authority in the wizarding world that Harry knows of. Of course he would ask someone who knows so much. There's also the fact that Harry does not think he himself has any authority. A lot of kids are taught this. We have to ask for a hall pass to go to the bathroom, we don't have the authority to give ourselves permission. Ask to do this, ask to do that. That's part of the transition into adulthood, is realizing you have authority over yourself and learning how to wield it. Maybe some kids learned this early, but I certainly wasn't one. Harry with his oppression at the Durselys wasn't one either.
