I would have tried my luck outside. Still better than getting abused by the Dursley. Besides, at the time, Harry didn't know that the house was magically protected, he just obeyed stupidly Dumbledore, and this bother me. If my Headmaster (or rather old Headmaster, because I'm not in school anymore) asked me to live somewhere, I would have told him to back off and not to meddle with my private life.
