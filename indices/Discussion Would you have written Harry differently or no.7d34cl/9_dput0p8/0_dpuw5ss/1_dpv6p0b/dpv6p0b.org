I agree about the class stuff, but I think mainstream readers wouldn't be too interested in how magic actually works in-universe, but that's totally my jam. I would be happy to read a rehash of the normal storyline with just a really in-depth magic explaination and more creative use of spellwork. My favorite part about fanfics are when there is an in depth explaination about magical theory, spellcraft, etc. and seeing how the characters use them in creative ways.

Sidenote: if anyone knows any fics that do a good job with magical theory, spellcraft, or even just explaining how characters are casting and utilizing spells in an interesting/creative/rational way please pass them on ðŸ˜¬.
