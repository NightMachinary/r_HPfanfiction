Yes, Harry would probably be a mix of Tom Riddle (New Harry 2.0 wants power in order to protect himself and others and to hurt those that hurt him), Hermione (Harry 2.0 loves to learn, especially magic because that does literally increase his power!) and probably myself (So new Harry 2.0 is curious as hell, asks tons of questions and has a sense of wounder! He also ignores rules he thinks are stupid (curfew for example!))

I really hate that canon Harry is so lazy...how can you be this way when you have somebody trying to kill you and when the adults have shown they CAN'T HANDLE THAT GUY? (The adults in HP buggered up the last war, especially Dumbledore with his preaching about forgiving the DEs and taking them alive and they didn't even lock all of them up after baby-Harry ended that war for them!)
