Honestly, given that Harry Potter is largely a series that also serves as Rowling's political mouthpiece, who I /heavily/ disagree with (as can uh... kinda be evidenced by my flair) I'd probably make Harry as a person a /lot/ more distrusting of authority towards the end, and he certainly wouldn't become an Auror.
