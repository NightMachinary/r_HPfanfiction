I have many many thoughts on how Harry should have acted differenent through many parts of the whole series. The problem is that I Love cannon Harry Potter series because Rowling wrote it in such a way as to be entertaining, engrossing, and reread able. To make any changes to how Harry would act in cannon would probably harm the whole series.
