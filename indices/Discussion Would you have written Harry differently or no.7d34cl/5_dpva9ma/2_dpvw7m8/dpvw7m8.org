I agree, especially because JK makes Harry super curious about whatever mystery is happening in any given year (that her current success is based on mystery novels is not actually that surprising.) But Harry doesn't ask a single damn question about his own family, which is utterly ridiculous. I'm actually a fan of the Pottermore Potter family history, but what we know is like 1000 words that could have easily been worked into the series.

Harry's curiosity of the given mystery of the moment is extremely incongruous with his lack of ANY curiosity about his family.
