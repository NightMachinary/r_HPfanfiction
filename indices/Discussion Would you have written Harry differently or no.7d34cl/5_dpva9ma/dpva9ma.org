I would not write a male protagonist, personally; it's overdone. I would write a protagonist who takes at least a vague interest in their own life. I would make the protagonist's emotions, motivations, and reactions less opaque.

For example, from /HP and the Philosopher's Stone/:

#+begin_quote
  â€œSent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos ... knew yeh didn' have any ... d'yeh like it?

  Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
#+end_quote

And then the scene changes. No indication of what emotion Harry is feeling, or how he reacts. Is it /the only family I have ever known is abusive and you're reminding me of other people who would likely have abused me and now I'm angry/? Is it /I am so happy that I have a connection to my parents now/? Or /I can't believe that you would go through that much trouble for me, even though this specific gift is not appropriate to me/?

We can tell next year that he hasn't looked at the album much at all because he doesn't recognize Remus Lupin or Peter Pettigrew or Sirius Black. And he never asks about these nebulous family friends. And he never asks Remus about his parents. He doesn't take an interest. That's a problem that I would fix.
