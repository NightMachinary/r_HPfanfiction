I think that Harry doesn't recognise the other Marauders because time has changed them very much. Sirius Black would probably be cut out from all the photos. Remus Lupin, as a werewolf, may look much more scarred and worn out. He's also depressed, so compared with his happy school days he could look radically different. Peter Pettigrew would perhaps in some ways look thinner as he's spent a year in high stress as he fears Sirius will kill him. He probably will look gaunt, and maybe his face is going to look sallow.
