He nearly lets the Mirror of Erised consume him in the same book because it shows his family... If it wasn't for Dumbledore who knows how many nights he would have spent just looking at it?

Who also knows if the pictures had names or not? Sirius had spent over a decade in a nightmarish prison and was described as malnourished and crazed looking. Starvation and torment changes how people look drastically, just look at Holocaust survivors compared to how they normally look. It's an extreme situation, but it showcases the effects it has when comparing them to healthy versions of themselves. Similarly Remus is over 10 years older and undergoes his own version of torture every month. Not to mention Remus also appears to be poor, which would impact his health as well. As for Pettigrew... even if there was a name on the photos how can he tell this rat is actually one of his dad's best friends in disguise. Even when he transformed he was once again someone a decade older than he would have a picture of and terribly unhealthy at the time of his reveal.
