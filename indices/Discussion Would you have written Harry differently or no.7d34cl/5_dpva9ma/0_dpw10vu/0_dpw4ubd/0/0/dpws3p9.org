  Who also knows if the pictures had names or not?

Hagrid, the person who gave him the album, has names. He has the names of enough friends of James and Lily to fill a photo album with their donations.

Harry only cares about his parents when it's important to the story. When it would merely color in the story better, provide more background, or it wouldn't matter at all, he hasn't done anything to learn about them. It's an extreme example of plot-driven writing. A less extreme version would merely ensure that the characterization doesn't detract from the plot.
