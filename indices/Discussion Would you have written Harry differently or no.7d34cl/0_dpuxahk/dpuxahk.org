Harry in Canon is rather dull. He has his moments. He is prone to teenage angst, crushes and stubbornness. He is a bit of a slacker, and was a bit clueless as a leader; he was forced into leading DA(which he did pretty good), but never restarted it. He didn't have a plan to defeat voldemort when the horcruxes were done; he never even prepared for the confrontation.

But that's the whole point of Harry. Harry always wanted himself to be just another kid on the block, and he was written as such. He was no magical prodigy(he was quite good, but lacked motivation to actually master his magical arsenal). He was hardworking when required, but not always. And all these characteristics can be associated with a normal teenager.

Harry is not Neo from Matrix or Anakin Skywalker. Harry is Frodo or even Luke Skywalker to an extent. He's a normal teenager who was marked by chance and completed his task by a combination of luck and perseverance. Neville would have been more of a leader than Harry, if Neville was the chosen one. Because Harry did not care about being the leader, more often than not. All he wanted was to finish off the voldemort menance and live a peaceful life.

Some fanfictions have often made Harry this impeccably perfect character, sometimes people forget that JK Rowling intended Harry to perceive himself as normal, and that's how she wrote it. And I'm completely fine with it.
