Exactly! Harry should have been like he was when preparing for the tournament, but ALL THE TIME! He should have been learning, experimenting and training a lot (maybe not 24/7 because he also has classes and you got to have some time off, too!)...but no, he rather played quidditch and some chess (he was always losing at!) with Ron :(
