Took words from my mouth. This is what I felt too. He wasn't suicidal, but he definitely didn't value his life much.

Harry had nothing to live for. Yes, he had his friends, but he eventually believed that his life is a small exchange for taking out voldemort for the wizarding world. He gladly walked to Voldemort because of the same.

I believe he wasn't suicidal because even after being given an option to move on, he chose to come back. Yes, it's more so that he could finish off voldemort for good, but he returned to live, nevertheless.
