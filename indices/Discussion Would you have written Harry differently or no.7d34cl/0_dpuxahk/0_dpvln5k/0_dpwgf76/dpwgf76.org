In my headcannon, because of Dursleys, he -in a subconscious level- believes himself to be a worthless freak and a piece of shit. He doesn't values himself. He is actually quite suicidal or at least doesn't really cares about himself. He's there for all others but he is not in peace with himself. He fights Voldemort not because he wants a better future for himself but for his friends. He blames himself to be the guilty one whether he is truly guilty or not because he is programmed like this. People who doesn't like themselves tend to act like this so I believe Harry was such a person. So in the end, I believe Harry didn't care about his death. He didn't actively tried to kill himself but he didn't shy away from situations which would end his life because he saw himself as a worthless person.
