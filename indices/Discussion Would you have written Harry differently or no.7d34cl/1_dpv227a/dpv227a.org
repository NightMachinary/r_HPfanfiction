No. I strongly believe the books are excellently written, and Harry as the hero fits very well. Sure, especially when rereading i get annoyed with him at times. However I remember my first time reading the books, and I could never put them down til i finished. A smarter harry, more hardworking harry, overly even focused on voldemort's Destruction harry might not have sucked me in as well. I love redo fix it fics and so on, and jkr isn't free from criticism, but her characters are nothing short of brilliant. Movies sometimes didn't portray them how i'd expect but so what... the books are genius. I think fan fiction does the job of rewriting harry well enough
