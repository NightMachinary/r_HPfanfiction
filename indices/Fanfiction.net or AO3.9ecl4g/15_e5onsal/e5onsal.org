Another thing I like on Ao3 is the bookmark search - you can see people's comments and tags on stories they bookmark, which is sometimes more useful than the author's summary and tags. Ffn just gives you the numbers, or lists someone's favorites with no commentary. For example, I found [[https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=1&commit=Sort+and+Filter&pseud_id=Beatitudinem&user_id=Beatitudinem][this person]] who sometimes does a load of commentary (but not always)

Edit: better link
