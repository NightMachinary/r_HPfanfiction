I just had a play with it today. When a story has more then one chapter and you press "next chapter" it goes to the nexh chapter and skips the header information (on mobile) which I didn't realize before as I had only looked at it on PC.

The other thing I like about FF.net is that you can download stories and read them offline (well on the unofficial app). Is this possible on ao3?
