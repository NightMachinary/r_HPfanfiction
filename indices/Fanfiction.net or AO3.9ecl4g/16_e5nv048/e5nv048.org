For me, AO3 is great for searching new fics comparatively to FFN but you find better things asking recs in a preexisting community like a subreddit (ex: [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] ).

.

Otherwise, it really depends how you like to read fics and for that you have a few options:

-FFN web, which is very simple and minimalist, both on computer and mobile

-FFN app, which I use and find pretty good, if a bit buggy in parts

-AO3 web, FFN in more complex

-another website like Sufficient Velocity, SpaceBattles, SIYE or DLP

-a third party app, try not to use them as a lot don't transmit to the website the author uses the number of readers, of favs, etc...
