FF is more convenient for me on the writing side (because they have a better upload doc system) and also as a reader (you can customize the text a lot better - unless there's way to get white text on black background in AO3 I've missed somehow.)

Their no-mature-fics tantrum was annoying, but FF is still way better for me at least.
