I find it so difficult to wade through the vast number of terrible fics on ff.net. I feel as though the Kudos system on AO3 leads me to fics that, while not always terribly original, tend to be of higher quality in terms of writing. I would love some recommendations of well written/grammatically decent ff.net fics!
