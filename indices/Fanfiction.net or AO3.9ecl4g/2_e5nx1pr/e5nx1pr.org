I started a long time ago on ffn, but stopped reading when they had a tantrum and removed all the mature fics a fair few years ago. Started reading again on a03, I appreciate that I can download things straight onto my kindle to read at work. Having said that, ffn is older and there are some fantastic fics on there... generally ao3 is a bit more smutty, but there's plenty of gems hidden away. So ultimately, mostly ao3, with ffn usually being recs, or for when I'm searching on pc.
