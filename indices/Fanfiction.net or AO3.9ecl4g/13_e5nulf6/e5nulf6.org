For HP, in my experience the best stories can be found on ff.net, or sometimes crossposted to ao3.

They have more serious, and long stories. There's some that have been kicked of for different reasons and have been moved to ao3, tthat have more "adult content". But at least both sites are better than livejournal.

Although for Fantastic Beasts, ao3 is better.
