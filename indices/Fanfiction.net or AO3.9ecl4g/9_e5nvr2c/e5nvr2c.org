The HP fandom predates Ao3, so it's much better established on FFn. And once established, it's hard for a fandom to move to a new site. So there are definite gems on both sites, and a lot of cross-posting, but FFn has a much larger library of fics.

And there are still some more specialized archives around, though many of the smaller ones are being imported to Ao3 through the Open Doors project. Check out fanficauthors.net (which is multi-fandom, but has plenty of HP stories.)
