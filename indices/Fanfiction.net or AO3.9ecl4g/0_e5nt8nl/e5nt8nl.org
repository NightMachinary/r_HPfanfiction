Honestly, both are good to me- though I tend to treat AO3 as a site for smut, Fanfiction.net for everything else.

You are missing out I'd say on a good many stories that are exclusive to Fanfiction.net I'd say, but it isn't as easy to find stories I admit- the tagging system of AO3 is superior mostly.
