Easier to just ignore most of that- google a topic you want to read about along with the fandom, the site fanficiton.net along with the word community- that should give you a list or many lists of stories on whatever topic you chose, then where you see "rating" click it and change it to M to see all of them including higher rating ones- though even many of those don't have outright smut on em- just more graphic violence and references.
