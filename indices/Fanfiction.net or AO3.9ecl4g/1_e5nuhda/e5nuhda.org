In my limited experience (I crossposted 3 of my stories there this week), Archive yields more kudos and reviews/100 views, but FFN has simply a far larger reader base. If you write rare pairings/characters, it is easy to get swept under the rug by the flood of other stories, but it's also easier to get thousands of views there. I began writing a year ago and just my two most popular stories (both still ongoing) have gotten 200k views.

  I avoid fanfiction.net because it's just not fun to navigate on mobile imo

The FFN app is vastly superior to the Ao3 app (which really sucks) and even beats FFN in browser view since, for example, characters get sorted by their popularity.
