AO3 doesn't have an app as far as I know. Maybe an [[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/3390][unofficial one?]] I've always found the web interface of AO3 to work fine on mobile.

I like both sites myself. I do like how AO3 is a nonprofit and doesn't do ads. Gives me more of a feeling of ownership of the space.
