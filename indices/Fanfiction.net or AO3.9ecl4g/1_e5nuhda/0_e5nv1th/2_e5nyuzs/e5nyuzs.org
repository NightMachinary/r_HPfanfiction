I used to use this same method before I actually started posting on AO3. Then I discovered that if the same person views the first, say, four chapters of my work on the days that they are posted, that means I get four views. But they can only leave kudos once. Thus the more chapters a story had, the lower the kudos/views ratio became, especially when I had several hundred people subscribed to a story.
