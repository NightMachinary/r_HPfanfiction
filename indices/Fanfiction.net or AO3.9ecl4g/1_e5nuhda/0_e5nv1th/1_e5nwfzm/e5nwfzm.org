  My general for AO3 is that 1 kudos every 10 views

  the ratio between views and the chosen form if likes when deciding to read a fic
#+end_quote

You don't see views on FFN, so you can forget using that metric.

  I've yet to read anything below 1000 kudos in HP

There are many great stories far below 1000 favs or follows on FFN, so don't discount them. If anything, nearly all of the very popular stories on FFN are shite or, at the very least, start out promising but then take a turn for the worse, like Delenda Est with the return to the future, or Rune Stone Path with the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass.
