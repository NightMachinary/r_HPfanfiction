I always do account for the ratio between views and the chosen form if likes when deciding to read a fic so it's good to know that I'll have to bear the difference in mind when coming up wig a standard for the two sites. (My general for AO3 is that 1 kudos every 10 views is decent for the first couple of chapter, although I've yet to read anything below 1000 kudos in HP as if yet so I don't know if it will apply)

I didn't consider the app, I tend to go in browser for AO3 after all given that their app isn't that great. I'll have to check out the ff.net app tho.
