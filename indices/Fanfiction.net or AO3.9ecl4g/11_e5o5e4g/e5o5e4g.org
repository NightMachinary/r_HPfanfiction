Ao3 is what I prefer in terms of viewing and uploading, the layout is better and their mobile browsing has everything on there without having to request the desktop site. Better updated, and actually updated. Submitting a fic is way easier, and I can use html/css to fix it. Reviewing, and replying to reviews is easier. I just like the level of control I have over my own content.

The search is better, I like the warnings, and tagging. The staff at Ao3 is very responsive, and they warn you for downtime, you can report stories easier, and they actually get back to you.
