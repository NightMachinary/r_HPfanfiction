AO3 has the better website and features: the tags, the categories, the download function. But is newer, therefore older titles can have fewer stories.

FFN has the larger library. But moderators are yanking stories for no reason. However, I just recently discovered the mobile app has drastically improved.

I read on both platforms and will likely continue to do so.
