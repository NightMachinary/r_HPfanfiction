I prefer FF.net because it's the first that I knew. And in general has more complex and mature stories than Ao3. FF.net has many defects like you can't really search a story as freely as in AO3 but at least it doesn't have people blogging their opinions like it was Tumblr on the 4 million tags that a common fic has there.
