I'll copy some examples from the sit: "alt title: How Zelda learned to stop worrying and love herself" or "Link's a monster fucker" or "the champions and zelda are in this but they're minor so im not tagging them" and" Theres a bunch of dicks in the beginning but it slows down"

Unless I really like the pairing or the summary is Really good. Tags like these make me avoid the fic entirely
