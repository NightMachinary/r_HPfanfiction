From the perspective of posting fics, I much prefer FF.Net. It's just a lot more convenient to upload a doc than to have to copy/paste text into an editor and then fiddle around with it because the formatting has gone weird. It's also a lot easier to make changes to previous chapters on FF.Net, as you can just upload the new doc and switch the old one out for the new one. On AO3 you have to go into the text editor and manually edit in your changes.

Also you get a lot more reviews on FF.Net. AO3 readers tend to leave kudos and leave it at that, only rarely adding comments.
