  It's just a lot more convenient to upload a doc than to have to copy/paste text into an editor and then fiddle around with it because the formatting has gone weird.

You can literally copy-paste from the FFN doc editor (or G-Drive) to the Ao3 "post new story/chapter" tab if you set it to "Rich text" instead of HTML. I crossposted 3 of my stories this week and spent more time wondering how to tag it than actually copying the content.
