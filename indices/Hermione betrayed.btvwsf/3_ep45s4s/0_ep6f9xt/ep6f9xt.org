The bashing in those fics is disgusting, but definitely fits the request. I can't really see Harry or Ron ever turning on Hermione like that or vice-versa. I mean Ron might leave temporarily out of anger, but that's it.

Frankly, aside from Ron, no one really had a problem with Hermione dating Krum.
