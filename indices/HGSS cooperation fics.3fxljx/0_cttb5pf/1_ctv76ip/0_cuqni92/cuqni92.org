well... I love that fic but they DO get together....lol They also get together in Pet Project, but in a lot of ways it's also an excellent example, and much more about Hermione liking Snape than Snape liking Hermione, if that makes sense. And Pet Project has only one smut section, and the author wrote an alternate chapter without it in there so you have to deal with less SSHG if it's not your cup of tea. (even though I drink that tea 24/7)

Edit: (wineunicorn) to answer your specific question, haven't found any fics that don't still pair them in the end. Sorry!
