I recall there was one in the TVTropes fic rec, although you'll have to dig it out. It has been made AU, since it was written before the series ended and the author clarifying stuffs. So it is about as canon compliant as DAYD, which ignores the epilogue and word of god.

I'm not sure if it was 1-4, or just 5 in her PoV though
