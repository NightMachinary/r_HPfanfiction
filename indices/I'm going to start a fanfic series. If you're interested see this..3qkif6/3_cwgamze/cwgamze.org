Hey, you have an intriguing start, but I really recommend finding a beta to help you format and structure your writing to a higher quality. It would be nice to see your skills develop through fanfiction, but I think you'll need some guidance. In the mean time, read, read, read! The more you read, the better your writing will get :)
