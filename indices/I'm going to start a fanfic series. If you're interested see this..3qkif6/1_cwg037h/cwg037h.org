My inner grammar nazi compels me to tell you to look out for run-on sentences (unless they are consciously used for stylistic purposes) and to make sure to use punctuation before closing a direct quote.

Moreover, I would suggest against too small chapters. 5k is usually the norm, and anything below 2k is too little.

Won't chance a guess at who the kid and the man are, since there are no hints really, so any estimation would be a random one. Anyway, have fun with the writing of your story. That is the most important thing, after all.
