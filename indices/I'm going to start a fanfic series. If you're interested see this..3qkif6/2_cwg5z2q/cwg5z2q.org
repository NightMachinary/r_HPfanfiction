Formatting issues. Grammar issues. Run-on Sentences. Lack of punctuation. Weak opening. Choppy sentence structures. Have I mentioned the Grammar issues? Sudden narration time skip is bad. Show, don't tell. Learn to use names

And if you have that many problems from a snip 150? 200? words long, then I strongly suggest practicing a lot more before publishing anything. As it is, I don't consider this beta-worthy as it would require an entire rewrite from the beta to get this anywhere near readable.
