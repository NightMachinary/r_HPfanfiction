I'm not saying it isn't savable. I'm saying it isn't beta-worthy.

Something savable is when the very story itself, either the plot, the character development (something integral to the story) is bad. We can't really say any of that here since it's too short.

I'm saying it isn't beta-worthy, because to get this anywhere near readable, the beta would have to rewrite the entire thing. This level of writing needs so much work the beta should be given co-authorship because they'd need to put in just as much, if not more, effort into the story.

Also, I never liked that story. I don't see what you mean by his excellent storytelling either, but that's just my opinion.
