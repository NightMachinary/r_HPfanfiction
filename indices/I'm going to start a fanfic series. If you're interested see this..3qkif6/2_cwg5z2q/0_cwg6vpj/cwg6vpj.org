The problem with writing is that you need the imagination, ability to tell a story and have good grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. The sad thing is, if someone amazing at the first two doesn't have the latter, they've had it without a beta. It needs work, certainly, but it's saveable. Look at linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) . The author is excellent at both storytelling and coming up with a plot, but obviously can't do shit involving English, which is apparent from the start. Then, later in the story, it becomes a frankly excellent story (although the last couple chapters are mind-fucky), either due to the fact the author improved throughout, or got a Beta. Seriously, it's impossible to put a number on how many amazing fics would be dog shit without betas.
