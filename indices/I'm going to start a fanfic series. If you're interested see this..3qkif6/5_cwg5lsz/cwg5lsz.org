I have 9 fics being written right now, and I have writer's block on 8 of them. None have been posted yet, even though 2 are near completion (one of those is the first of a next-gen series, like yours). Take a look at the the full picture, see if you have a plot set out, see if the story is going somewhere, see what plot points you have to make later on, and adapt the story accordingly. If you want, I'll beta your first chapter. Also, find something which has a spelling/grammar checker. Seriously.
