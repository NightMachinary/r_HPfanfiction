[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] by Clell65619 is another possibility. Harry is cast into a genderswapped AU where he meets him/herself. The fic isn't crackish, seems to take itself serious in the right ways. The one character who isn't genderswapped should be easy to gues. Its been abandonded, but its def worth the read all the same.
