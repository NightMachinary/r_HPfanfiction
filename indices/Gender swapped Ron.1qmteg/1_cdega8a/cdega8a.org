[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo might be what you're after. Here's the author's summary:

"We all know the stories that ask "What if Harry Potter was a girl," right? But what if Ron Weasley was a girl? Imagine that the first person Harry befriends on the Hogwarts Express is not Ronald Weasley, but Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first born daughter of the Weasley clan for generations... what might happen then?"
