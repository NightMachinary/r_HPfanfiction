Fleur. She put a dragon to sleep on her own. The same dragons were shown to require a dozen handlers to subdue earlier. If the dragon handlers didn't use this method, it's gotta be way out of the reach of ordinary people. If it was some veela technique, the reserves would have hired and brought veela to subdue the dragons. Fleur pulls out magic above the professional's standard. If the reserve had an expert capable of it, they might have wanted to send it to the event where they allow hundreds of children to surround an incredibly dangerous animal. Compare that to Krum, whose entire strategy was "poke it REALLY HARD". Or Diggory, who demonstrated animate transfiguration. Impressive, but both are typical school concepts.
