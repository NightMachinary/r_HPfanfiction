I agree Fleur was /really/ downplayed in canon and was actually badass, but I wouldn't put the technique being abnormal for Veela. They sound like they were based off of sirens which were known for magical singing. My thought was Veela prefer to not be dragon handlers or merely that particular reserve didn't have any available.

I've read where a lot of people give her a lot of flack for the grindylowa, but Veela are flying people who fling fireballs. Air/fire elements. I could easily see a water element being troublesome if the French school didn't encorporate them in the curriculum.
