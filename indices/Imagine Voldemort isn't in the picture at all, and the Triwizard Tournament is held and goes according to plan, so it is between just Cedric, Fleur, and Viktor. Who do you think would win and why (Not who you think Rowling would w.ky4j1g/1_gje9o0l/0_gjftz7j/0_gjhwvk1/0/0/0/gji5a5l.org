It probably was in a fanfic then. Oh well. I agree though that Krum has an advantage the others don't have because while Krum seems more morally upright in a general sense, more so than Fleur, Karkarof absolutely is not and would have used any and everything. Cedric would have been held back by his Hufflepuff qualities of fairness, and Madam Maxime seemed kinda...not a great leader...so Fleur would have had that disadvantage.
