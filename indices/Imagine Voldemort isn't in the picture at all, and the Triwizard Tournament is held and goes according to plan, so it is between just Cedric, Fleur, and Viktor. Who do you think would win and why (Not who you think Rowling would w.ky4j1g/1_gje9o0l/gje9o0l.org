The problem with the Triwizard Tournament (well, one of the problems) is that the first two tasks really didn't matter. Maybe Cedric would have been killed or seriously injured without a warning about the dragons, but if we trust that there really were safety measures in place like they said, he probably would have come out fine. And other than that, the first two tasks only determine the order the contestants enter the maze, which is certainly an advantage, but not a huge one. Making one wrong turn could easily set someone back enough to erase whatever advantage they had from going first.

So who would do best in the maze? My gut says Krum. Most of the obstacles in the maze seem like they were meant to be defeated by force (the boggart, acromantula, and skrewt, plus Barty said that he "cursed many obstacles out of of [Harry's] way," which weren't necessarily guaranteed to be more creatures, but it seems likely), and Krum, coming from the school known for teaching dark magic, would probably have the easiest time with them.

But it would really all come down to luck in the maze.
