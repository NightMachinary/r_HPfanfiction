I honestly think Fleur is an excellent contender. She did not perform well in the second task canon, and was attacked in the third, but in the first task she displayed an excellent grasp of magic and had by far the most elegant solution in charming her dragon into an enchamted sleep. Krum is likely the best combatant, but the tasks seem to rely more on finesse than fighting, do I would say Fleur is a good pick. Far from guaranteed, but she has a good shot.
