Without Voldemort's indirect presence, I wonder if the /tasks/ would even be the same. If I remember it right, all the tasks were made to play to Harry's strengths and effectively give him - and him alone - an "out" to ensure he's the one who gets whisked away at the end.

Without Crouch Junior there to influence things, they might not even use dragons for the first task (because /holy crap/ the safety concerns), and they'd probably sweep the Black Lake more thoroughly before sending anyone in there, if they did that at all.

And then, even if they did use the same tasks, the outcome would be different.

Let's assume Cedric doesn't get told about the dragons because Harry doesn't get told either. He's the only Champion to go in under-prepared, so he's going to get the lowest score there - and that's assuming he even /lives/ (let's say they have people on standby to subdue the dragon, so he does survive - but he gets a Did Not Finish). Everything else goes roughly as-per-canon - Fleur puts the dragon to sleep, Krum blinds it and causes it to crush its own eggs. Of the three, Fleur would come in first.

Then, second task. I find it somewhat unlikely that BCJ engineered the Grindylow attack on Fleur, but it's also unlikely that it'd happen under uncompromised-safety-precautions circumstances - so it's more of a toss-up. I'd like to think she'd still come in last here on account of her seeming inexperience with water-borne creatures (Grindylow are third-year creatures at Hogwarts), making the points totals somewhat close at the end - Krum with two second-places, Cedric with a Did Not Finish and a first-place, and Fleur with a first and a third-place.

Then, the maze. Canonically, Cedric goes in first - but here, he doesn't. A DNF is the heaviest hit on points, so he goes in last of the three - Fleur and Krum going in within a few minutes of each other.

As for who wins in the end, that is therefore a toss-up between Fleur and Krum - I think it might /actually/ come down to who goes in first, which is difficult to predict based on precise scores.
