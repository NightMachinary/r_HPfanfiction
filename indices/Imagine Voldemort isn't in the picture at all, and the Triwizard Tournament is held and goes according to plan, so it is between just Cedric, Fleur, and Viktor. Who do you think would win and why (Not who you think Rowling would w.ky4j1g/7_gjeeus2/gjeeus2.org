I think Krum. Despite imperius he was doing the best in the maze, so it's likely he'd have won it.

In case of altercation between him and Cedric, he should have more skill in DADA/Dark arts and better reflexes (being the better Seeker), so he should prevail in combat.

Though it is possible that Cedric gets lucky in the maze and simply outpaces Krum without ever meeting him.

Fleur hasn't got shit on either of them in terms of ability for 1v1, and she struggled with the second task putting her ability in question - i don't think she'd do better than either of them in the maze.

60/30/10 odds for Krum/Cedric/Fleur, i think.
