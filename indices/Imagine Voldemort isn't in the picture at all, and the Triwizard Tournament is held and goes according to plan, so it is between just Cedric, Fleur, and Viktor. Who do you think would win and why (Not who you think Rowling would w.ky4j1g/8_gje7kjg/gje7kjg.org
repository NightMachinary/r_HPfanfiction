I'm gonna make a case for each one.

*/Cedric./*

Yea, he was a Hufflepuff, but that probably wouldn't stop him. We know that he was incredibly magically adept; it's mentioned that he was brilliant at defense, and that's mainly what the Tournament would focus on.

Without Harry, he might not have had any warning about the dragons, but I doubt that would stop him, exactly. He was pretty good at magic(didn't he use transfiguration for the dragons?)

I don't remember if what happened with Fleur during Task #2 had anything to do with Voldemort, but Cedric would definitely help the little sister; being a good person is always a great help in one way or another.

He was also a skilled Seeker as I remember, that definitely would give him some agility and muscles, which would be a great help during Task #3. Call back to my opening, he was brilliant at Defense which he basically what Task #3 was testing them on.

And he would've has Cho's help, who was a Ravenclaw, yes? And quite good at magic, too.

â€‹

side note: why the hell is her name Cho? That's not a first name, not at all. It's a surname.

*/Viktor./*

He's strong, magically adept, famous, and literally takes a class on the Dark Arts, it makes sense that he'd be a good candidate for winning. Karkaroff would've helped him, and he'd also have his experience from being a Death Eater to help. I can see Viktor taking many risks, which would both help and hinder him.

You know what? Read the other two comments advocating Viktor as the winner; I wouldn't say much different.

*/Fleur./*

Maxime was /friendly/ with Hagrid, Fleur would've known about the dragons. Fleur was most probably underestimated by her teammates. Wasn't she half Veela? That would help. Although, personally, I don't think the things that held her back had much to do with Voldemort.

Honestly, I lost my momentum about halfway through, but you can see what I meant.

edit: yea, I remember that the Triwizard Tournament pays just as much attention to finesse as to sheer magical power and knowledge. Again why I think Cedric might've won. Look at it this way

Cedric

Cedric has, after Krum, the most magically adeptness, I think. Sure, Moody told him how to open the egg, but I don't doubt that he would've found a way quickly enough. Being a Seeker and a great flier, he has the capacity for the elegance I was referring to earlier.

Viktor

Viktor had an impressive amount of magical ability and knowledge(and muscle), likely coming from the school he went to. It's just that, well, he doesn't seem like the type to be partially elegant, does he? I might just be being a bit prejudiced, but he seems more the type for bruteforce.

Fleur

Fleur literally sung the dragon to sleep which gives her the elegance and finesse I was talking about in abounty. Unfortunately, she didn't quite make the other ones.

In conclusion, I think Cedric would win. He has high points in both finesse and magical ability. While on their own both Fleur and Viktor have quite high points in both magical ability and finesse, Cedric is the only one of the three whom which has both in aplenty(or at least enough so that he's a bit ahead of them).
