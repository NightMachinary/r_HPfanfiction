Sure, which balances out the timings on entering the maze in the 3rd Task. In terms of winning, the third task was all that really mattered. So, since I'd say navigating a maze on land would be easier than trying to navigate in dark, cold, murky water, I think she'd do better in the 3rd than the 2nd.

Would probably depend on what exactly Moody-Crouch moved in the maze, since without Voldemort's plan, they'd all be still around the route Harry took in the maze. If he'd diverted them into Fleur's path, for example, and they were thus no longer there blocking her since he never did anything in your hypothetical, she'd have an easier time of things.
