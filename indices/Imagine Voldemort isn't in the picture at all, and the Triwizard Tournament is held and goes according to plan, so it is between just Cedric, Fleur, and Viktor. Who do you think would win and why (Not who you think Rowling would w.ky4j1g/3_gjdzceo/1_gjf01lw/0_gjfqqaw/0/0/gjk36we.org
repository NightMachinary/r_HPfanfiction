I meant balance out in the sense of them all entering the maze at very similar times. Literally, that's the only difference the first two tasks made - so long as they didn't die and did vaguely okay, they'd still have a chance of winning because they just have to get to the centre of the maze.

Literally, that's the only thing that matters when discussing who would win - who would get to the centre of the maze first. As I recall, there didn't seem to be any indication that points total influenced who won, just who got the cup first.

You have a point that it would come down to Cedric's intelligence though. I'm pretty sure it'd be a competition between him and Fleur in the Maze, since I'm not sure Krum would be creative and smart enough to make it through without just blasting everything in sight. Hitting a dragon with a blinding curse and then not thinking of the fact that it'd stumble about and crush all the eggs indicates some level of 'not thinking ahead'.
