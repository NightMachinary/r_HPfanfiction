It doesn't balance out the timings though. Because while the dragon did trample some of it's eggs with Krum he still succeeded in getting the egg, and he succeeded with getting his charge as well, whereas Fleur succeeded with the dragon without eggs pulling her down but failed the second task entirely.

It would all come down to whether Cedric would be intelligent/smart and quick thinking enough to overcome the dragon without knowing about it, although he did get help from false Moody to figure out the egg as well, so that would require he was fast enough to figure out that task too as well as knowing the bubblehead spell before the task.

Imo fleur wouldn't have won.
