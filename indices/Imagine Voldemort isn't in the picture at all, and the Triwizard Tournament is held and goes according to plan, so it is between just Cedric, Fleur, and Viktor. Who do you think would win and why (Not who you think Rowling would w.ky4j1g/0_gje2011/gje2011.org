It's a tough one... I think Cedric would be held back by his 'fair play', and without Harry in the picture, might not have had any warning about the dragons... Karkaroff, without the worry over his Dark Mark coming back, might have been more focussed on the tasks and helping Viktor more. Viktor is a Quidditch player and is quite daring so without Crouch Jr interfering might have done better in the maze... Fleur had Maxime's backing and did well with the dragon, but failed the lake task (but that wasn't anything to do with Voldy's plan) but, again, might have done well at the maze if Crouch Jr hadn't got her out of the way... but overall my gut feeling is Krum, partly due to his general daring attitude and his magical skill, but moreover , Karkaroff would not have played by the rules and would have done everything in his power to promote his chances. I think he was only held back in canon by worry over his Mark, and Crouch-Moody scaring him!
