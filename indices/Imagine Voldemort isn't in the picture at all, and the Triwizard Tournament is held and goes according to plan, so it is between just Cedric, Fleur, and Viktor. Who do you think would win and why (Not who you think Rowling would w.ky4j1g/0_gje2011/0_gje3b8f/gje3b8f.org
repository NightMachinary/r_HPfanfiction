Also, even though Harry came back last in the second task, he was awarded more points for bringing Gabrielle back as well. This pushed Viktor to 3rd place when he would have been first if you factor in that Cedric wouldn't know about the dragons. This would mean that Viktor would enter the maze first too. I can't see any other scenario than Viktor winning to be honest.
