I wonder weather Harry might learn about it anyway, Hagrid being eager to show off dangerous beasties to his friend/favourite student. That said, it was a really specific situation that led Harry to deduce that he, Fleur and Krum were informed and Cedric was the only one ignorant, so there's no guarantee he'd share the info.
