Except that it did not seem that the Hogwarts teaches or headmaster was going to cheat, that fell on false moody who wanted Harry to succeed so he gave Cedric the info about the egg because he knew Cedric owed Harry, and Hagrid who had an emotional connection to Harry and wanted to help him, specially considering he basicly was already helping Fleur through Maxime because he wanted to impress her. As far as we know, Hagrid had no big enough reason to help Cedric

In which case only Maxime and Igor knew about the dragon and could help their students prepare.

In which case it would IMO come down to how cleaver Cedric really was, how fast would he think on the feet if he didn't know he would face a dragon before the time of the task.
