Altered Destinies [linkffn(3155057)] is awesome imo. It's a story of how Harry goes back in time to kill a young Tom Riddle and then live out an anonymous life but gets sucked into parenthood and the Grindelwald war. The writing is awesome, the characters are written out nicely and there is a lot of development. It's Harry/OC for whoever cares.
