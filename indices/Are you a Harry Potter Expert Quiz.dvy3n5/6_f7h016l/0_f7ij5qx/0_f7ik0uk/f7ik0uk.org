My logic was that I think Harry and Dumbledore land on the Astronomy tower when they get back from the horcrux hunt, and later when Harry is thinking about Snape's "betrayal" he calls it something like "murder at the top of the tallest tower". I can't remember the exact line, but I thought he called it the tallest.
