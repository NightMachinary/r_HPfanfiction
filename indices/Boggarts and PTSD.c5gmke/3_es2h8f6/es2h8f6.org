this is something that's always annoyed me about POA, and i find it irksome how few fanfics deal with this.

The Anti-Heroine has this; it's a somewhat dark Tom/Harry/Hermione fic, and not for everybody. Hermione's boggart is the corpse of a younger girl she mentored when she was homeless. linkao3 (The Anti-Heroine)

The Green Girl has this, in what i find to be a much more realistic portrayal. Slytherin!Hermione's boggart is Draco calling her a Mudblood. linkff (The Green Girl)
