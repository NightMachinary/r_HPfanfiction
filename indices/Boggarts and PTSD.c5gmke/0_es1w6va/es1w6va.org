I feel like I read a fic of POA from lupins POV and lucius was dracos boggart.

You know honestly you bring up a really good point. It must be really awkward for certain kids Boggarts. But likely it's pretty rare that the kids would actually have a practical lesson like that.

We know querrel and Lockhart definitely didnt do an actual boggart as lesson and definitely not umbridge. I cant see snape trying to find a boggart and with moody it would be a giveaway it someone saw it. And the carrow siblings were more focused on teaching actual dark arts.

Its possibly only lupin and a couple other teachers would have ever bothered with it. Maybe some teachers would have let kids sit out the lesson due to these issues?
