Hey, you can't get better as a writer if you don't challenge yourself. If you think you'd enjoy writing something, go for it! You don't even need to publish it anywhere if you don't want to.

Also, I have ptsd as well which is mainly why I thought of this. I know what my boggart would be and I can't imagine how shit it would be to face it in front of someone.
