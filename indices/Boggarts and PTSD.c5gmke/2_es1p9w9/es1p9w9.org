Huh. I have PTSD myself and love Harry Potter. This idea never occurred to me, most of my fic ideas take place after the war. It'd be interesting to see a more emotional, vulnerable side to Draco. I'm not sure I have the confidence to write it, though - I've only returned to writing a few months ago after an 11 year break.
