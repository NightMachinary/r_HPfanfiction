[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12042771][Let it choke]] linkao3(12042771) - Susan Bones's boggart is the Dark Mark, Susan and Lupin friendship (the same author also wrote [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]], which is a really interesting exploration of a boggart's abilities, in addition to being a great Lupin character study)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15230892][Dementors Within Us]] linkao3(15230892) - Harry's boggart is Vernon, Harry & Lupin friendship

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17842037][rotten on the inside]] linkao3(17842037) - Harry's boggart is about the Dursleys' abuse, Harry & Hermione friendship

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1986708][To Laugh At Our Fears]] linkao3(1986708) - Draco's boggart is Lucius, Draco & Harry friendship

(I must admit that I never really understood why so many people see Draco as an obvious candidate for being a child abuse victim - in the books, the one redeeming quality of the Malfoy family is that they love each other. But apparently I'm in the minority on that one.)

And, well, I've written two fics where a student facing a boggart goes a bit sideways, though both are for /Fantastic Beasts/:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16650817][left yourself in your warpath]] linkao3(16650817) - main characters are Leta and Dumbledore, gen, warnings for past child death
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11445738][Worst Fears]] linkao3(11445738) - Ilvermorny AU, main characters are Newt and Credence, gen, warnings for past sexual abuse
