The Prince of Slytherin has a few chapters/plot points regarding magical PTSD and it involving the person's magic attacking itself. There are a few chapters with this being caused by boggarts and a few chapters with it being caused by other triggers. Not the focus point of the story but I find the whole fic fascinating
