Honestly, the fanon creatures are way too tame. Gimme some real monsters which dig up graves to feast on the dead and wipe out entire villages and are consequently hunted. Gimme proper monsters and not some shitty urban fantasy. Hell in canon werewolves are a walking biological weapon, fanon makes them a shitty civil rights case which is condescending af since they need the MC to get things done.
