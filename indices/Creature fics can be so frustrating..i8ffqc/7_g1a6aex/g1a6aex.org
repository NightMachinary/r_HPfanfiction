It can be used well as a tool to show how a character who isn't happy about the transformation conceptualises the changes. Disassociating the creature instincts from who they are bc they don't view themselves as being that creature, they view themselves as human with these frustrating additions. Then as the fic progresses and they come to accept the change, they'd start acknowledging and referring to the instincts as their own
