Honestly I have pondered upon it often, considering I do like well written creature fics.

Additionally also Soulmate fanfics, they are prettying diverse (also not one-sided mostly unlike the fics we are discussing where only one character is a creature) but I am getting sidetracked.

Creature fics. Most of the writers want that ‘desperate love' ‘meant to be' stuff, like that one and only true mate, etc. I admit even I am guilty of reading a few of those (but only the well executed ones, well at least comparably). Also the instant attraction...

I often think writers justify creepy, weird acts by making them seem like an instinctual behaviour of the creature. (Edward the vampire anyone? I mean honestly if it was a normal older man sneaking every night in a girl's bedroom to watch her sleep, I doubt she would do anything but scream; and no, not the good kind.) Fantasy genre gives us a lot of leeway and it's not like I haven't read my fair share of those, so can't point fingers.

Also the varied concepts behind the creature fics, while some are tolerable, others are just; no, nope.

The one you are talking about is a wildly read trope. So it's there to stay, all one can do is filter according to the preference. Lol
