I'd really like vampires who slowly /dies/ as they try to resist drinking fresh blood, who can't drink blood from blood pack of a hospital, because it lacks magical life force or something ; I'd love werewolves who looks almost dead every time, not because they are miserable but because resisting their instincts is actually harder than just thinking "no, eating people is cringe" ; Veelas who can hardly resist their carnal urges, and whose anger threshold is so low even 5th year Harry would tell them to chill the fuck out.

I'd love sphinxes as mysterious guards created to rip apart a human easily if they cannot answer their riddles, whose sole concern isn't to live but to guard things ; chimaeras with only one throught process, to rip and tear and kill and bathe in the blood of the fallen enemies.

I'd kill for acromentulas as these intelligent, giant spiders with no concern for human life, where Aragog didn't listen to Hagrid because he hatched her but because she couldn't defeat his giant heritage as a child, and so was stuck into this lifelong servitude contract ; mermaids who cannot accept humans going underwater to explore their cities for no reasons ; centaurs as this mystical, forest-dwelling specie who tolerates humans because of ancient history, and only that.

In short, I would totally dig a story where creatures have a *story*, an *history*, and are not just victims of wizarding society.
