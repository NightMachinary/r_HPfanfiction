Here's my rec list

Vox corporis. Linkffn(vox corporis repost)

Probably the best Harmony fic there is, but it's been deleted from ffn and ao3, there are reposts and downloads by people on ffn and ao3

Linkffn(Severus snape and the art of war) an amazing Snily fic that is honestly under rated

Linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power) an amazing Harry/OC fic that makes the fight against Voldemort much more important.

Linkffn(courage and cunning)

”Harry” is actually Salazar Slytherin, amazingly well done fic and I loved reading it.

Linkffn(hermione granger and the serpent's renaissance)

Great Hermione centric fic! Loved reading it.

Linkao3(harry potter and the lack of lamb sauce)

Amazing crack fic that was masterfully executed, Gordon Ramsay is the potions professor

Linkffn(meaning of one by sovran)

Honestly I haven't read much of this fic, but everyone recommends it as a good fic so I'll do the same

Linkffn(the mind arts)

An amazing fic with Harry being a master at the mind arts, the fic is very well made in my opinion

Linkffn(to shape and change) To snape and change***

Amazing fic where Harry goes to live with Snape due to Dumbledore and the others realising how horrible the Dursleys are, surprisingly Snape is a good guardian

Linkffn(harry potter and the saviour of magic) and linkffn(harry potter lightning lord)

These two are basically the same fic except the other one went a bit further in the plot, I read both but can't remember which it was.

Linkffn(harry potter and the lightning scar)

Harry gets sent to the US to train by Renus and Sirius, becomes an animagus.

Linkffn(harry potter, squatter)

Harry potter x Percy Jackson cross over, Harry is a demi god and lives on olympus somehow, I think it's still updating like every other week

Linkffn(harry potter and the problem of potions)

Great fic, I'll let the small info bit do it's work.

Linkffn(up yours dumbles)

Haphne fic which is pretty cliched but still good and funny

Linkffn(escapologist harry)

A great crack fic where Harry tries to run away from the Dursleys and Dumbledore is a manipulative asshole.

Linkffn(Harry potter and the serpent chronicles)

A great Haphne fic that is possibly being updated idk.

Linkffn(the accidental animagus) and linkffn(animagus at war)

Great fics, Harry is Hermione's adopted brother after running out of the Dursley place as a cat

Linkffn(core threads)

Holy shat this is a huge power wank. Harry has like a bazillion magical cores and oh oops they're souls so he's now basically immortal... great fic though.

Linkffn(the peace not promised)

This is similar to severus snape and the art of war but a bit worse in my opinion, some say this is better but I don't think so.

Linkffn(the lion tamer)

This is a long series of fics that are continuations of each other, Haphne pairing

Linkffn(broken wings)

Harry becomes animagus i think, I'll let the info bit do the work

Linkffn(harry potter and the psychic serpent)

Great fic, I'll let the info bit do it's work

And finally

Linkffn(a marauder's plan)

Amazing fic, Info bit do work yes

I have a few more fics ( about a hundred tbh but some are horrible)

Ask for more if these have been read or you just want more. Idk how I managed to link all these (they are great though)

I'm sad I couldn't find any Harry Potter/Stargate crossover fics, they're great usually

Not in any sort of ranked system thing

The bot is doing stuff so go on google with the fics that the bot messed up
