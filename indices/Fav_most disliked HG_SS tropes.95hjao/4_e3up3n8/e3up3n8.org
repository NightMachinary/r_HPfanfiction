*Enjoy:* Unlike Dramione fics, where she tends to be a generally useless bookish ingenue, Hermione in Snamione fics is often portrayed as brilliant and powerful.

*Hate:* [[https://www.deviantart.com/zorm/art/Canon-Vs-Fanon-Snape-34384180][This phenomenon.]] Also, inconsistency in characters' stated and displayed competence when it serves drama and plot.
