They're my OTP as well and tbh I love most of the tropes, total guilty pleasure! Marriage law, time travel, Hermione fixing Snape after being tortured, reluctantly collaborating on something for the war and getting to know each other, dark!Hermione, snarky banter, etc., I love it all!

One small thing I do dislike though just because I find it too cheesy and usually irrelevant to the storyline is in marriage laws (with any pairing, but seen it in SSHG a few times) where they each have to pick a ring for the other and they miraculously pick two paired rings. I wouldn't mind if there was some more significance to the rings but if it's just to show how they are "totally meant for each other" I find it quite cringy. I'd much rather have something different to show some sort of connection between them.

In terms of bigger storyline stuff... I guess I get kind of annoyed when stories start out during the war, but then the author ignores the war completely in favour of the romance and there's an eventual small paragraph about "Harry did something and Voldemort is dead". Nothing wrong with a romance-only story, I'd just like to know what it is to begin with.
