Over the top, cartoonish, moustache twirlingly evil Dumbledore is what I remember.

I think I stopped in mid 50s too, and the only reason I read that far was pure morbid curiosity on just how evil Dumbledore was gonna end up.

I mean, he had actually forced Fawkes to do whatever he said with a binding ritual, he and Snape both had horcruxes that they repeatedly used to resurrect themselves. Because Dumbledore just loves horcruxes so much.

I did find it kind of funny that Dumbledore thought the Colonel, as in KFC, was a legit dark lord though.
