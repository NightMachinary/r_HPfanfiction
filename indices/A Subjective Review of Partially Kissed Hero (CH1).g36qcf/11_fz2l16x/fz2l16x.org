I read about 50 chapters of the story years ago, back when I had never heard of PL.

My initial response was to like the concept of "Harry with a backbone", as I was just getting into that phase of fanfiction in general terms. Some of the humour was well-done too. I also despise Dumbledore and the Weasleys as characters even today, so the bashing of them appealed to me as well. The reason I stopped at around the 50 mark was that the story just bored the shit out of me. PL even said that he enjoys raw data dumps and that he would delay any "action" because reviewers kept pestering him to liven up the story. That type of pettiness was an alarm bell.

Things got worse, as many of us know. I initially put the likes of the shady salesman talking about "natives" down to PL wanting to explore the deeply-ingrained racism of Wizarding society that exists even in canon, but then realised that it could very well be self-insertion, as his later comments on Islam indicate. Furthermore, his treatment of women makes me deeply uncomfortable. I have absolutely no problem with despicable characters in fiction; racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry in characters are interesting topics to explore... until I have the feeling that these are the author's real views, at which point I "nope" straight out of there.

Some of George R.R. Martin's characters are the biggest assholes that I've ever heard tell of, but Martin himself is a lovely man and his writing is impeccable. The distinction has to be made that these scumbags are his characters, not him. In comparison, Perfect Lionheart is no George R.R. Martin.

Oh, and he literally starts World War III in this story.
