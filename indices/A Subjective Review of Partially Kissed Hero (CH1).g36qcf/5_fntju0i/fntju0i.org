My favorite part of this review is you comparing this writers fics to the Rings of Power - I exhaled quite strongly through my nose.

Spot on review though, if I recall correctly the Weasley/Dumbledore bashing gets worse real quick. Also, it annoys the hell out of me when fanfic writers just hand wave in shit to make Harry's life more convenient without explaining why /everyone on the planet/ isn't also doing that thing.
