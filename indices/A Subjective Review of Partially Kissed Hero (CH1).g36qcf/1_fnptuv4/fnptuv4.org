I somehow have never actually heard of Perfect Lionhart, but I'm thankful I never have? Biggest fucking yikes on the "natives" bit. Big, big fucking yikes.

Reminds me of when I once read this horrid LOTR fic clearly written by a bigoted white writer trying to write a POC character. It was a nightmare. I reported the story because it was so horrible and racist.
