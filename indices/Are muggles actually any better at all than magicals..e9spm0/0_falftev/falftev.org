I think the whole point is that they aren't better/worse, just different. Like, Magical world definitely has the best transportation tech (hello teleportation) but the muggle world has far better information technology. I'm not saying wikipedia is better than a massive dusty library, I'm just... oh wait, that's exactly what I'm saying. Trying to find something in a library when you're not sure what you're looking for is horrible compared to the convenience of a computer.

So like, magic wins in transport, medical, storage, etc etc, but muggle wins in information, communications, power generation (yeah thermonuclear power plants) and also pens. Quill pens need to die. Keyboards win every time.

Socially they're also about equal in that they both suck at not being racist, use slave labor (sweatshops vs houselves) but again that just supports my point. Both have things they're good at and bad at, but counted up they're just... societies made of people that use different methods towards the same ends.

So yeah. Different but equal. I think that the ideal society in the hp world would be one where everyone used both magic and science. I have this great idea for an app that helps build spells by doing the arithmetic calculations for you. Like, why choose when you can have both???
