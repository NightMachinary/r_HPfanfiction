I would like to say that the HP world is set in the early 90s (pre 1994) so the Web didn't exist then. There were video games, but they were not the things that we would call them. Also note that the room of requirement is a thing, literal holodeck over 1000 years old. The series also never goes into magic for information retrieval, which definitely will exist, but a first year student may not be able to use it. The information fetch quests after the first book were limited to things that would be restricted information in the muggle world. It could be that we just are not exposed to the calculation math because arithmancy is not ecposited on in the series.
