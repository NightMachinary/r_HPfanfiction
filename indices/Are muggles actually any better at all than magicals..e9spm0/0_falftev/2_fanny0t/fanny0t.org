It was the early 90s...the things you are mentioning muggles are better at didn't exist.

Why do you need a block of a cell phone when you can literally talk face to face with fire Skype or just pop over to their house for a few?

Why do you need electricity when you have magic powering your lights, water, heat, etc?

Id give you the internet now, but in the early 90s.... Everyone did their research by books.
