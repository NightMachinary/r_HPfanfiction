[REDACTED] Actually, the dome got flooded when the scientist that convinced them to sink it made a rocket to go to space, but his son accidentally got into it, flew out, broke the dome, and killed all except his mother and father, of which his mother constantly started to make murder suicide threats to her husband, and when the he came back with 5 of his comrades plus Miss Pauling and another, his mother escaped to space, taking the last of the Australium, and breaking the dome a second time. The lost city of New Zealand was weird.
