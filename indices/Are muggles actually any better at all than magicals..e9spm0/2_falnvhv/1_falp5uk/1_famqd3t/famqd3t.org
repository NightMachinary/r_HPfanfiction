Uhhhh, no, the moon landing gave us many many things, the tech developed, and the ideas for future tech, did not leave the earth. We have computers, better communication, better travel, know much more on how to make necessary food stuffs grow in hostile environments, developed medical equipment, have a much better understanding of Earth, and our impact on it, and much much MUCH more from the tech developed starting with the space program.

I would argue we need another space race now to get the next bit bump in tech and understanding.
