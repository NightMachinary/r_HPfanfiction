Muggles have reached the moon, whilst Magicians haven't. Wizards have mastered the art of enchanting things to completely change their entire purpose whilst muggles haven't. Australia has found a material to not only boost their technology and intelligence by at least x1000 times, but has increased their strength hundred-fold, making them an economic powerhouse and world power whilst the rest of the world, muggle or magical, hasn't. So to settle the argument, Australia wins.
