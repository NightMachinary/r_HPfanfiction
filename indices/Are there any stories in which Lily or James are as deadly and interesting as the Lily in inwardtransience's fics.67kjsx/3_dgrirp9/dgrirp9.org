Haha I'll share mine,

Trelawney is cursed because divination is a serious branch of magic, but lying binds your powers and makes you magically and mentally diminished. Divination allows the discovery of truth, being able to see through enchantments and find hidden things

Voldemort is snatching up all the known seers, trying to raise the hidden and sunken city of Atlantis, where some magical artifacts and knowledge are hidden which he needs to gather more mainstream allies to govern his empire. He has already installed a shadow governor in Ireland, where magic is much more wild and the wizards there constantly war with the Fae.

The magical population is bigger then in canon, and most people lack magical power enough for formal school, only the nobility and the gifted attend Hogwarts, and having a title means real responsibility
