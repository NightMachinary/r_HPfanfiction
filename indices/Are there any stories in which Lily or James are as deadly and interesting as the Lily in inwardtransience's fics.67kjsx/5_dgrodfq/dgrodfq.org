Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) Lily is incredibly magically and chaotically powerful, which fem!harry inherited. She works at the ministry at an unspecified position (possible unspeakable) and is well known for her abilities in magical Britain. In Harry's third year she debates Lord Riddle about muggleborn rights graciously and passionately at a ministry gala, rather annoying him with her good showing. Lily does have issues with controlling her magic and wears a suppressor to make it more manageable, so she's not taking the world by storm like in The Long Game, but Harry feels closer to her than to James.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3126551]]) Lily survives, but James doesn't. After waking up, she walks into Azkaban and frees an unjustly imprisoned Sirius, and then takes steps to protect her family. Incomplete.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8379676]]) oneshot. Lily kills Voldemort with a pistol after he murders James, and deals with the adulation while mourning.
