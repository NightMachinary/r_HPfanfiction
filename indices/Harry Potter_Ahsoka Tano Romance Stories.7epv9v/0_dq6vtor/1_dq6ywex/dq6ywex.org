There's no romance in it. In fact, there's not really anything. It's just Harry going around, collecting all the interesting females to his "crew". Like as soon as one gets acclimated, the next one shows up. First, it's Ahsoka Tano, then Aayla Secura, then Shaak-Ti, the Asaaj Ventress, then Fay (and I didn't even know who that was until I looked on the wiki). If there's any actual romance, it's such a slow burn that it's going in reverse and it's impossible to invest in it, since it'll inevitably turn into a harem anyways. There is a very slight hint that something may happen, but it's really hard to decipher it from all the lechery that Harry displays constantly. And, the only wanking that is done is power wanking.
