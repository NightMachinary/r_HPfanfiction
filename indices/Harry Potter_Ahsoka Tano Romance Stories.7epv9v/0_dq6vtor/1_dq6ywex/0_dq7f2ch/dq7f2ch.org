God, the first part of that story seemed so promising, then we got to Kashyyyk and everything promising about it died. If it just stayed with archeologist!Harry and Ahsoka going on adventures it would've been amazing.

Edit: Apparently I was kinda combining /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ & /Equilibrium/.
