It's been so long since I read either of those that I somehow combined them into one story in my memory.

I suspect that I can blame the slow update schedule, I probably forgot the first part of /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ and remembered /Equilibrium/ as the Coruscant part instead.

Definitely would explain why I remember thinking the quality dropped an absurd amount, as /Equilibrium/ had way higher quality than /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/.
