linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal) is Harry transported to Westeros from Game of Thrones. I really liked the ending.

Do dimension hopping fics count? if so, there is World in Pieces. Canon!Harry, just after the Battle of Hogwarts gets summoned to an Alternate Universe by an Order that's on their 4th Harry Potter.

There is also, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero]]) which has a similar premise (Harry gets summoned by an AU). Nobody recognizes him as Harry Potter because there was no Boy who lived in their universe.
