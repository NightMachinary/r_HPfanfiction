One that I've got my eye on is linkffn(Rise of the Dragon Child), an in-progress crossover with Skyrim. It does strain credulity a bit -- while Harry is explicitly 13 and is treated with appropriate levels of care and concern by the other characters in that regard, his actions and inner monologue do not mesh with his age at all. Regardless, I've found it an enjoyable enough read so far, and the author has been quite open with their bullet-point plans for future plot beats which gives me hope that they'll actually see it through to the end.
