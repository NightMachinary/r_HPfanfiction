Story: A Third Path to the Future [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327]]

A MoD!Harry gets rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic 4, and later teams up with the X-Men before taking the Marvel world by Storm. Occasional lemony bits between adults that can be skipped without detracting from the story. Nearly 2 million words.
