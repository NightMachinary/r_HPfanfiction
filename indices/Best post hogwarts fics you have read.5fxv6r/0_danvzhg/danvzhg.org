Northumbrian, the author of Strangers has lots of stories that will fill that time period if you didn't already know. How dedicated to cannon and the epilogue are you? If you're not a great fan of the epilogue check out linkffn(11816264/1) or linkffn(10728064) a sort of halfway house between cannon and not is linkffn(11111990) which is becoming quite popular. If you didn't know, and honestly I'm not sure how good it is you can filter fanfiction.net to search only post-Hogwarts using the worlds drop down selection.
