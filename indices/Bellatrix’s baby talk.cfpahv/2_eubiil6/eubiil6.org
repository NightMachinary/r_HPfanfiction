Agreed. I think it should be only used, IF it is to be used at all, is for the psychological impact. For example, the battle in the Ministry. When she killed Sirus and then taunted Harry like they were children on a playground, I suspect it was so that he would be angry that not only he could no longer fight effectively but also opened his mind enough for Voldemort could possess him.
