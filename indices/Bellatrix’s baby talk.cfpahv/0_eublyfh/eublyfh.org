Exactly! People treat this like it's just a thing that she does in her day to day life, when she's clearly just doing it to fuck with Harry. The instant he uses the Cruciatus on her, she drops the act and starts taking him seriously. (more liek siriusly amirite!) Honestly, this is one of many infuriating things about the fandom that I 300% blame on the movies: HBC's performance is so un-nuanced and in-your-face crazy that people just sort of assume that that's how she's meant to be, but, like, it isn't . . . At all . . . Even a little bit . . .

(Seriously, I know it's not the point of this thread, but /fuck/ the villains' portrayals in the movies. Fuck them with something hard and sand papery.)
