I always took the "baby talk" as taunting (sure maybe it's how she likes to taunt enemies that are younger than her but it stops there).

1) she taunts the group of children infront of the othet Death Eaters (from a writer's perspective to show that the Death Eaters feel they have already won b/c how could children dream to compete with them).

2) she taunts Harry after the group of Death Eaters realizes that these children might actually manage to get away and the task of getting the prophecy is ruined. She kills Sirius and taunts Harry to get him to leave the group and chase her (i think she was happy to have killed her cousin but i think the act was done in that moment to hurt Harry and that the taunts was deliberately to get Harry away from the others).
