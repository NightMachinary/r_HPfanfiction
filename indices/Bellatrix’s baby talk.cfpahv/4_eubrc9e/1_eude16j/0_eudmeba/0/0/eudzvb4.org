Yes. Molly Weasley, formidable witch. The same Molly Weasley who could do a Summoning Charm without even knowing what she was Summoning. The same Molly Weasley who was accomplised with healing and protection charms, and who in the Battle of Hogwarts had no problem with nonverbal magic. Just because she normally used her magic for household chores instead of killing people, doesn't mean her magic wasn't powerful.

And really, it was the same thing that made her unable to deal with the Boggart that made her so capable of getting to Bellatrix. Molly's biggest fear is her children dying. The Boggart was preying on those fears and showing her children that HAD already died and there was nothing she could do. Bellatrix, however, is a THREAT to those same children, and a threat that Molly CAN do something about.

You're making the same mistake as Bellatrix: Just because someone isn't the most obvious warrior, doesn't mean they can't be dangerous if you threaten their loved ones.
