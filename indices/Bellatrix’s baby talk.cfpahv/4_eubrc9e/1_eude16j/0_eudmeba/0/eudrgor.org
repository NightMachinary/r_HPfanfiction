"Molly Weasley, a formidable witch" Did we read the same book?

From what I remember, Molly Weasley character, until that point, is the one of a housewife. I don't think she had either used something else than Households charm before that point, and she also failed to banish a Boggart herself (Ok, she had some pretty legitime fears, but it's a Boggart, the thing student learn to deal with in 3rd year).

I won't say Bellatrix death wasn't interesting (she got cocky and been killed, the same way she killed Sirius), but that scene was totally random.
