Why's that so bad? Molly's clearly been established as a pretty formidable witch, and she's fighting to save her daughter, while Bellatrix isn't taking the fight seriously. Perfectly reasonable that she'd take her down... plus, karma. Remember, Bellatrix killed Sirius because Sirius wasn't taking their fight seriously. This time she was the one on the receiving end.
