For me, the idea of reading one sentence over seventeen alternating lines makes it feel like a six year old being chosen to read a passage aloud in class, where they only parse and vocalise words one or two at a time with no regard for punctuation, sentence structure, or comprehension of the full string of words they just made.

When I read "twinspeak" it breaks the flow of the dialogue and makes the tone difficult to set in my head.
