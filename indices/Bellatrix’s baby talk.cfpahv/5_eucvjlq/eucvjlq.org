No way! Go the total other direction with this! Here's what I'm thinkin: Bellatrix ONLY baby talks in a fic! WHY? Because she's actually severely developmentally stunted, and has the mental age of like, an eight year old or something. Boom. Do it serious, do it live, and you got yourself a really horribly sad case of a disabled woman being groomed and taken advantage of by terrorists because she doesn't actually GET that any of the spells she's using are bad. She doesn't GET that hurting people and death is a real, permanent thing. She just thinks it's all some big, fun game.

(And from this you can also get your redeemed Bellatrix story too, so there you go!)
