I'm not saying the memories remain. They are erased, yes. But the changes in your attitudes / views towards things can change.

Like let's say when you're five someone tells you that we're actually just a very small rock in space. They convince you. Ten years later, you have no recollection of that event, yet your belief remains.

Similarly to that, even if your memory of the trauma gets removed, you might remain paranoid, emotionally unstable or irrationally scared of something.

The only thing obliviation would solve would be the nightmares (which arise from the memory not being able to be processed during sleep and remaining "fresh", replaying daily) as there would be no memory of the event. But this would leave you with a lot of emotion that no longer have a source.

In the end, I'm not sure if obliviation really is the best approach to PTSD
