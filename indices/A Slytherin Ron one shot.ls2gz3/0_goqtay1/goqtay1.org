Thanks for the recommendation! I really wanted the ending to read as Ron sees the green light of the killing curse because Draco has just killed Bellatrix to save his friend. That Ron's friendship with Draco is enough to turn Draco against Voldemort and they work together to assist the Order. Ahh, wishful thinking...
