Old Magic by ulyferal [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6373388/1/Old-Magic-WIP]] has Harry Potter being raised by the old ones with Hagard's Mother as his primary caregiver in his early years. It has 68 chapters & almost 270,000 words, it's was started in 2010 and is not finished yet, but it was updated in January 2020.

Do you like crossovers, I have not seen one were Harry is raised by or is fae but have you looked into Harry Potter/Merry Gentry crossovers.
