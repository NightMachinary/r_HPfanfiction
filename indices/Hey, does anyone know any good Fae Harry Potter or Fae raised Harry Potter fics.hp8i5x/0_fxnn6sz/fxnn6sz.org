To the Waters and the Wild is the only one I know that I currently remember. It's HP/LV slash and it's one of those 'Harry is naive and enthusiastic and nice to everyone' fics. It's not bad, but it's a bit... odd. If I remember any more that are better, I'll post 'em here.

EDIT - I suppose Have Chrome, Will Travel counts as well, but I don't really count them as Fae so much as I haven't read the thing that inspired the fic.
