Yeah true. I recalled upon reading your comment that that was how it worked when I'd been in an argument on the StarWars subreddit. They shadow deleted my OP. But still, what about explaining the general workings of Feudalism on the higher level would end up with a mod feeling like my comment was in need of being deleted/removed? And even so there should be a [Comment Deleted] message, shouldn't there?
