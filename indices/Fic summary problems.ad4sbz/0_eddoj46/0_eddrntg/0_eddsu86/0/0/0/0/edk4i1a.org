  Multiple people have messaged me saying that they almost didn't continue reading because they thought they were heading into a fun first person fic, and found a third person angsty slow-burn instead.

Okay, perfect, you can act on this. Change the perspective and the tone, and throw in some detail on the MC's motivations. I'll give it another shot real quick just to jog some ideas for you.

  Though Charlotte sat beside him, holding to their deal, James Potter had eyes only for her twin, Lily. He was yet another in her life to whom Charlotte was a mere shadow of an afterthought. As she watched his wistful stare, she felt it was time, at last, to shed her lifelong cloak of obscurity and step into the open.

I dunno if that's properly angsty or ridiculous melodrama, but you get the idea. Given the bot description I assumed the plot revolves around your MC trying to win James' affections. Hope this helps mitigate that drop-off!
