You know what, I can really be blind to my own writing sometimes. I didn't even SEE those grammatical errors. This is why I need a beta.

Thanks so much for your help thus far ! Better already!

Multiple people have messaged me saying that they almost didn't continue reading because they thought they were heading into a fun first person fic, and found a third person angsty slow-burn instead. Do I trust them? No, I don't know them. I do believe them, however, and agree what what they are saying.

The stats on the first chapter compared to the fifth has an enormous gap of readers, and it looks like quite a lot of people drop out after the first chapter. If readers are saying they /almost/ stopped reading because of it, it's highly some have already.
