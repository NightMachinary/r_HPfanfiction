Okay, I'm no summary expert but I'll give you my two cents here. Right away I notice your I's aren't capitalized and a few 'I'm's are without apostrophes. Grammar details like this are a big deal for . . . not /most,/ but a good portion of readers, I'd say. If there are errors in your summary, people will tend to assume your fic is filled with them, and they'll avoid it.

The summary itself seems alright to me, maybe could use more detail on the plot. This is what I'd change it to:

#+begin_quote
  I'm Charlotte Evans. Never heard of me? I'm not surprised---I bet you know my twin Lily, though. I'm stuck sitting with James Potter because of a stupid deal. Lucky me? You're sorely mistaken.
#+end_quote

I cut out unnecessary information. I think you should use the extra characters to expound on the story, whatever aspect of it you think will interest readers most. Although, if multiple people whose word you trust have told you the summary is 'different' from the story, you may want to make further changes to bring it more in line.
