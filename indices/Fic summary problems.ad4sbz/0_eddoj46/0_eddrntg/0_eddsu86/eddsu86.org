They make a new post every Friday for it, so you'll have to wait till then. I think they can give you helpful advice without needing to read your fic; they'll give you tips what to change, add or remove that would interest them enough to check out the story. The goal of your summary is to draw readers in, not necessarily to encapsulate your fic entirely.

The general advice is to give an idea of your plot and the tone of the story (humorous, bleak, mystery, etc.) with some sort of hook that leads to questions the reader wants answers to.

Edit: As wordhammer said, you could always post it here, too.
