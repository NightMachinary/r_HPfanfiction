Thanks for your reply ! I've had terrible luck with Beta's and have yet to find one that sticks through half a chapter with me. I ditched looking for another quite a while ago unfortunately.

I took a look around for this â€˜Fix your summary Friday' but I have no idea what it is, or where to find it. If you could provide more information, that would be lovely.

How successful do you think I would be posting my summary and asking for assistance ? Do you think they'd need to read some of the fic to be able to give valuable advice ? It's a bit of a long read :/
