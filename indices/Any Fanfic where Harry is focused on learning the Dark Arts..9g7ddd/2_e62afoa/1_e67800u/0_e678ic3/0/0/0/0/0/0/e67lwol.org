The magic lead Harry towards the path of inhumanity that he didn't even realise he was going down. Slowly becoming an animal unawares. Not quite voluntary

Also we talk about dark magic being addictive and what not. Some authors say that it is, some not. Some say that it is addictive to some people while others can handle it fine. In all cases it is still defined as dark magic.

Either way, we are talking about a branch of magic that the fanfic author invented (I believe) which the author decided was dark magic. For all purposes, in the fic, the magic is dark as the author said so. Even if this disagrees with some cannon reasoning - it's fanfic. Authors rules.
