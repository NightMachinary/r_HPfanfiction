Yeah, it ain't cannibalism and extreme bdsm is all. Also the whole transfiguration of other people is more like just a normal curse since it is more to do with forcing a change of state on the person that the target should theoretically be able to resist if they themselves are powerful enough. Real dark arts curses in canon seem to include a lot more pain and gore and have more to do with creating an intentionally flawed state i.e. broken bones, poisoned blood, magical disease, etcetera.
