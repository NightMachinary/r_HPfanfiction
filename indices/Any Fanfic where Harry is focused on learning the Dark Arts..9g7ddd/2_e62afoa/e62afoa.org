The Art of Self Fashioning

In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

------ it's about the darker side to transfiguration and honestly Harry is just a very unsettling individual in this. I didn't like him until a good ways in but couldn't stop myself from reading on.
