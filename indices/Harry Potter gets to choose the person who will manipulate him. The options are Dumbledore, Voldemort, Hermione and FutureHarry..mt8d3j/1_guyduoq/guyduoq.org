I'm going to say that Harry should stick to the Devil he knows. Dumbledore would get him killed maybe, but it would only be after he exhausted all options to keep him alive. Dumbledore hasn't followed a Greater Good mentality for at least 50 years, so at the very least, he can be assured that he wouldn't be used for evil. Assuming we are talking about canon Harry, he would be more concerned about doing the right thing than keeping himself alive.

The rest of the options are much riskier because they are much more likely to go further than Dumbledore would and are also likely to be much more cavalier about Harry's life and well-being.
