The Greater Good mentality is just essentially â€˜the ends justify the means'. Him allowing Harry to die in order to render Voldemort mortal is subscribing to the ideology to the Greater Good. The difference is that Dumbledore's interpretation of what the Greater Good was is not the same as Grindelwald's. I'm not saying that Dumbledore's a bad person or made the wrong decision, but just that he did follow the Greater Good ideology to some extent.
