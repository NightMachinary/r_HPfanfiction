Future!Harry is quite good at manipulating Harry, after all who knows you better than yourself?

That said, Harry can't ever imagine himself being a manipulative person. That's why he is more or less unrecognizable to Present!Harry, to the point of him seeming like a different person. Future!Harry also looks down upon the present Harry, hating him for being naive and idealistic.
