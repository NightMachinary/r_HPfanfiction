Future!harry by far.

While Future!harry might know there is a duty to do and a prophecy to fulfill, and would make sure it happened, Future!harry would at least be more honest with Harry and give him more information, given Future!Harry knows how much he hates not knowing stuff.

Plus he has Harry's best interest in mind, given he is Harry as well. He would likely aim to do things like saving Sirius and various others.

Only worry is that Harry has never been... subtle, so it is much less a manipulator-role he will take, and more a 'I will teach you and get you ready, and try to prevent the worst things from happening' and be really blunt about it.
