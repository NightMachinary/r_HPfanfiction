What do you mean? Harry is a pretty good manipulator as shown in the scene when he gets the memory from Slughorn (I know he is under the influence of Felix Felicis but as stated later, Felix Felicis just creates the optimum conditions for you to do what you could also do under normal circumstances). Also Future!Harry would still have to refrain from telling Harry that he has to willingly walk to his death in order for him not to die and also manipulate the situation so that everything happens accordingly. Otherwise Future!Harry would cease to exist as well.
