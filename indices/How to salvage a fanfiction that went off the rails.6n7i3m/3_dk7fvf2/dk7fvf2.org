The others are right to talk about good planning but I'll add in knowing when to stop. Say this is enough. Moderation is a powerful tool, just because you can doesn't mean you should. Going off the rails often occurs when you try to do too much even if you planed it, a good story doesn't need a thousand plot twists and intense moments every few paragraphs. If everything is intense then it becomes the new normal. You need flat bits so we understand the low bits and the high bits.
