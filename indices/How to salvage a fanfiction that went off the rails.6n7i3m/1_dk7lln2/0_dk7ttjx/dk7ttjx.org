  Be not afraid to throw away already written parts of your story. JKR allegedly wrote 12 completely different versions of the first chapters, that - according to her - taken together would give away most of the plot.

Bingo.

Just because you've written it doesn't make it a good part of the story. All they are at this point are words until you form them into a coherent part of an overall story. Sometimes you can write for days and realize that everything you wrote was just a warmup for the real writing you're about to do.

I am constantly doing this in my own writing (both in fiction, and in the real world). Sometimes the most satisfying - and agonizing - feeling is going back and completely scrapping days worth of writing because you realize it just isn't good, or simply doesn't fit with everything else you've written. /But that is completely okay/. All that means is that you have discovered a method of approaching a problem (in this case telling a story) that doesn't work. Which means you can avoid that path in the future.

Added onto all of this, the best way to prevent a story from going off the rails is having an alpha or beta reader that is willing to kill a bad idea in the crib for you. My alpha reader is ruthless about doing this for me (they know my signs of when I'm about to spin off the rails), and my beta reader is very good at catching wonkiness that has made it through the first pass.
