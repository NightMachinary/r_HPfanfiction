Something none of the others mentioned so far:

Be not afraid to throw away already written parts of your story. JKR allegedly wrote +12+fifteen completely different versions of the first chapter that - according to her - taken together would give away most of the plot.

Be not afraid to experiment, and be even less afraid to acknowledge that an experiment failed. And if you notice that something you wrote three chapters ago is hindering you, be not afraid to throw it away.

And with all this keep in mind that often rewriting isn't the best strategy, instead a 'refactoring' of some parts might be the best thing for your project.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Discarded first chapters of book one: I reckon I must've got through fifteen different alternative chapters of book one. The reason for which I discarded each of them were: They all gave too much away. And in fact if you put all those discarded first chapters together, almost the whole plot is explained

She wrote fifteen different chapters of book one, and the problem with all of them wasn't even the writing - it was an /outline/-problem.

Sometimes your outline is wrong. I've had it multiple times that when I finally write the scene from my outline, the characters don't behave the way I want. One example: I'm currently working on a story where Harry and Newt will meet post-CoS, and I think there could be a lot of interesting interactions and I have a solid plot idea where Harry gets to travel the world a bit with Newt in the summer (only to Germany, but still hopefully interesting)

My first idea was that Newt basically takes Harry to the MoM and this worked great in the outline and what I had in my head, but the characters just wouldn't behave: Harry wouldn't be comfortable interacting with an official person in the official environment of the Ministry, especially after what Fudge pulled with Hagrid last year. He'd never be able to trust Newt at all. Maybe Newt could work around this, but he'd then have to overshare some stuff and that just isn't Newt.

I only noticed that after writing the first draft, and seeing my characters not behaving well. Only then could I diagnose the problem and find a way to work around this.
