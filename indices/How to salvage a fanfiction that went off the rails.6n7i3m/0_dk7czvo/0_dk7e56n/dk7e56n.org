Thank for the link.

I have a plan with each arc planned out and how I want each of the main Characters to develop. I guess My Plan was not detailed enough if it went of the rails so quickly.

One problem that i am having is that the main reasons I Even started with this story is so that it would be something new.Its supposed to be a hurt/comfort story but I really just want to get threw the Hurt part to get to the other parts of the story.
