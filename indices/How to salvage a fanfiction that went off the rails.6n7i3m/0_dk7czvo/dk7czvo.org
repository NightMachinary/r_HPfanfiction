Question: Do you write with an outline?

If you don't, you might consider one with firmly delineated acts. For reference, I've commented on this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/6k5tq7/creating_a_cohesive_story/djl95xs/][elsewhere]] for a question someone had on a related topic about cohesive story telling.

If you /do/ write with an outline, you might want to consider that the story that you *want* to write and the story that you *feel* like writing are two different things. If that's the case, you should set aside the old version as the idea for something else (even if you don't plan on picking it up again) and then start working on the new version. I've done that before as a way to trick myself into writing something that's fighting me.
