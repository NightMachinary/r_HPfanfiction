As [[/u/mistermisstep]] already said, you need an outline. It also sounds like you could use one where you actually write down the outline for each chapter. Whats happening in the chapter, whats the point of it, how does its end make my reader want to read the next chapter?

Its tedious, but the moment you want to regulate yourself, you go away from freeform brainstorm writing to the more structured process of trying to deliver a product.
