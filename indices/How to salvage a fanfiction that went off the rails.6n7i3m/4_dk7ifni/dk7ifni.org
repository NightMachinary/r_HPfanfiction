People have discussed outlining, which is important and definitely helps a lot with pacing. This is a technical skill that is very concrete and easy to execute on (Easy may not be the right term, but there is at least a clear goal).

Another thing I think will help with your specific problem is characterization. The content you've included in your description of the story arcs is all character and personality based. I'm guessing yours is a character driven story?

This type of thing tends to lead to a very fluid, indistinct line between plot and characterization, which is not recommended. The correct method is that the plot moves the story forward and your characters' personalities inform the plot.

It's hard to maintain realistic characters when you are trying to use their mindset and revelations to drive the story forward. Instead, as you outline your story, use plot to accomplish your story arcs, and refer to characterizations (and how they change) as you build the plot.

You really need to get into the minds of your characters to determine how they behave at a given point in the story. Their actions are what drive the plot forward. The external consequences of their actions are what cause changes in their personalities. In this way you can achieve harmony between plot and characters by creating a feedback loop between the two, allowing the characters to drive the plot, and the plot to change your characters.

This separation and feedback between characters and plot will help your pacing issues. The characters change and progress as the plot unfolds around them, and these changes and progressions in personality will influence the plot. This is opposed to the contrived, unrealistic alternative of both happening simultaneously.
