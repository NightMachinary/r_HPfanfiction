It's pretty simple. Let's look at the purposes of the spells.

1. Imperius - No purpose except to dominate the will of another.

2. Cruciatus - No purpose except to cause pain, terrible terrible pain, that can cause insanity. And none of that "it was made to cause the nerves to get excited to help bring people back from heart failure" crap either. Torture, plain and simple.

3. Killing Curse - Kills. That's it. No purpose other than death. Instant, (virtually) magically unblockable death.

These curses have no use for good when used on another sentient being, and the cruciatus has no good use period.

Obliviate? There is the oft mentioned "Ministry needs it because Statute of Secrecy," so I'm going to ignore that for another potentially useful area.

Therapy.

Obliviate could be used to remove memories people can't cope with. We don't know whether obliviation is permanent or not. We know that Lockhart can't get his memory back, but that was through a misfired wand. There are probably forms that are reversible, as seen with Hermione's parents. So obliviate or related charms can be used as a therapy tool to get people past traumatic memories.
