Yeah, exactly. If you kill with incendio, burning a person alive is way worse than the instant painless killing curse. However you can argue in court you didn't mean to kill. If you cast Avada Kedavra there is no defense, you meant to kill them or you couldn't have cast the spell. Thus, unforgivable.
