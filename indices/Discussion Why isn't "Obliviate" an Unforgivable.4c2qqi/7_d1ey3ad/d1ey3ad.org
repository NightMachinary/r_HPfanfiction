When I write, I imagine dark magic as having a harmful psychological effect on the user, and the Unforgivables worst of all. Casting one successfully gets you life in Azkaban not because you must be evil to cast it but because casting it makes you evil.

Memory charms? They don't have a psychological effect on the caster, so they're not Unforgivable.

Moreover, I suspect that it's using memory charms /on Muggles/ that's effectively unregulated, and had Lockhart's actions come to light in another way, he might have faced Azkaban.
