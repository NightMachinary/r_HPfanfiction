heh, to expand on that - their modern world (Statute of Secrecy, and resulting Ministry of Magic) is based entirely on the concept of secrecy. This means departments largely if no solely formed to obliviate any muggles and reverse the signs. I have the least problem with that use however. Ex.

- Ministry Wizards wiped the camp officials memory many many times (taking away memory, without further harm- gets paid/not taken advantage of)

However other uses I've had trouble accepting, which the good guys see no issue with (or very little with general mind magics.)

- Even Hermione who doesn't want Ron to confund the driving instructor zapped her parents. (Taking away free will)

- Even Dumbledore whose wisdom says choices matter, they are what makes you etc. confunds and gives alcohol to Mrs. Cole. (taking away sound judgement)

- Love potions sold by good guy shops like Weasleys iirc (.... do you want Voldemort, because this is how we got Voldemort)

- Possibly maybe my own theory.... the Ministry does experiments on the mind akin to what would be considered a mad scientist without much compunction. (I took the brains to be wizards)

So I still have trouble understanding or accepting it, but Taure must be right. In contrast to my last point the experimenting on the soul is considered the worst of crimes or the worst punishment for crimes. So wizards simply don't think the mind is sacred and value it a good deal less. For me I just try not to think about it because otherwise I have trouble seeing the good guys in a good light.
