I don't think Hermione is a great example here. She altered her parents' minds for their safety, and I'm sure it took an intense emotional and mental toll on her to do it, and destroy her relationship with them. I don't think you can write off this incident as her not having an issue with it/very little issue. Knowing how cruel Voldemort and his followers are, what else was she supposed to do to protect them for an unknown amount of time from an unknown distance? She's a very logical person, and I'm sure she thought out every option and the consequences of each.
