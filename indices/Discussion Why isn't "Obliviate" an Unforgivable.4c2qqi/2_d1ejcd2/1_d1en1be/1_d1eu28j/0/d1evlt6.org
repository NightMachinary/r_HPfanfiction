That's fair, it doesn't fall under 'very little' issue. However no matter how much she struggled with it the ends do not justify the means.

I'm reminded of the Gandalf quote about "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."

Voldemort and Death Eaters are absolute scum who have absolutely no redeeming features. They deserve to die. But Harry wouldn't be Harry if he killed them or if he killed Voldemort, nor would Dumbledore be the wise mentor. And Dumbledore makes it clear that it is our choices that define us.

Yet we see the removal of free will, of identity, of life experiences, of removing pieces disallowing informed thought. These are truly heinous ideas if they were abused in our society. To me if Voldemort manipulated Pettigrew through solely fear and despair to be his spy then that is morally superior to altering his desire through other means: Imperius, Obliviate, Emotion inducing potions etc.

Hermione does choose to use obliviate and whether through spell or potion induces them to leave their home, country, friends, and family. It is not put in a bad light the way other evils are. It might have been tough, but SHE CHOSE. She chose to enforce her will for her parents over their will for themselves (every option must include talking with and failing to convince them to leave). Did it save their life?- quite possibly. Whatever the result, whatever her reasons that doesn't hold water against playing god over able minded persons. Reading it again Hermione doesn't have an issue with confunding itself, only using it to pass a drivers test (which is both cheating and potentially dangerous). This isn't to hate on Hermione but to show that wizards, including her, do things which are legal for them and yet would to us be a heinous crime either literally or morally.
