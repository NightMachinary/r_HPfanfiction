Easy answer: because it's a charm not a curse.

Even easier answer: because the Unforgiveables are an arbitrary set of unconnected illegal curses and not necessary the worst dark magic possible. See: horcruxes.

More complex speculative answer: wizards know the soul exists. We don't know much about what souls are in the context of HP, but traditionally they constitute your essential identity/self. That means that unlike most Muggles, wizards will not consider their minds to constitute their sense of self. They have a spirit which contains their essential nature/character/self and that spirit has primacy over body and mind.

This may go some way to explaining the cavalier approach wizards have to mind altering magic of all kinds, not just obliviation. It also explains why horcruxes are considered so horrific, even though to a Muggle it would seem that making one is no worse than killing someone in any other manner.

It also explains why wizards do not consider the Dementor's kiss to be death, contra LessWrong et al. The Dementor's kiss takes your soul, but not your body /or mind/.
