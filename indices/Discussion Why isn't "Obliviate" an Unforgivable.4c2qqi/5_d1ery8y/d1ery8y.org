I always thought it was because the proof of the casting is in of itself proof of the motive, and in a perfect retributive justice system you don't discriminate against attempted crime and successful crime.

To cast imperio, a person has to want to totally dominate the victim with no regrets. To cast crucio, a person must want to totally want to torture the victim and enjoy it, not for any retributive reason but simply because they want to. AK, of course you have to want them to die with every fibre of your being.

I've always assumed obliviate is reversible, but even without this it can be cast with totally good intentions. Imperio doesn't really fit too well with this but perhaps the wizarding world in general doesn't see any reason to use Imperio except in war conditions, so its "unforgivable until made ok by Ministry xox"

Consider two attempted killings. Both shot at a man they wanted to murder and had perfect aim, but only were able to shoot once before being apprehended. One killed the man, the other failed because a bird flew in the way of the bullet. Would one get life the other 10 years? But that doesn't seem just, as they are both equally as guilty as the eachother.

That's why, in my opinion, the instant life sentences are justified. They are their own proof and require severe, intense motive.
