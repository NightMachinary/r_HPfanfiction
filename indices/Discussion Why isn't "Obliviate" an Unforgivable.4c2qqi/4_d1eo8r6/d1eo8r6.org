It depends on whom you ask, to be honest. An easy explanation is that it's because the government needs it to deal with some muggles, and also because it's a charm rather than a curse.

That being said, *my personal headcanon* is that the most powerful curses actually require one to---in addition to being powerful enough a wizard to control magic well enough to cast them---have intent or desires of a given kind when casting them and when there is no strong enough intent of that sort the curse becomes nothing more than a highly inefficient (not like it matters, since there aren't any “magical cores”) discharge of magical energy that can at most throw the target into a wall but won't do what the caster wanted them to; on that note, this is also why those curses can go through shields as rather than being bolts of magic they are bolt-sized torrents of it and a single shield is nowhere near enough to stop them, and why they explode non-human stuff they hit as that magic has to do /something/. And with the three unforgivables the intent required would be the intent to murder, torture, or enslave, respectively for Avada Kedavra, Cruciatus, and Imperius. If you go with that, then it's easy to see why a potentially bad spell that does not require any such feelings to be present would not be thought as vile as those.
