#+begin_quote
  Are there any good fics that explore the (sick) consequences of cleverly abusing the potential of mind magic (obliviation, legilimency, imperio...)

On the consequences of Obliviation, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][/Memorium/]].

There's also [[http://hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], also available [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][on fanfiction.net]], which doesn't really /try/ to focus on mind magic and its abuses but keeps bringing them up simply because minds are so important and many characters are smart enough to come up with clever uses of mind magic.
