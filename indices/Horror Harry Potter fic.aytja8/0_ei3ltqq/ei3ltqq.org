I remember reading a cthulu mythos crossover. Can't seem to remember the story name though.

The main character was the only one who could remember people that disappeared into the shadows. When they were taken, it was like they never existed.

Dumbledore legitimized one of the things and was driven insane over a short time. Tore his own eyes out.
