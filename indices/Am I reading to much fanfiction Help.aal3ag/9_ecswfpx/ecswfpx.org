I was addicted to fanfiction a couple of years ago in another fandom. What did I do about it? I tried to switch out of the fandom, shut off notification emails from Fanfiction for updated chapters that tempt me to go back in and also found something else to occupy my time with. It's been two years and I completely quit that fandom (but I still love it) and I write for HP now. I find writing fanfiction actively keeps me away from reading fanfiction, which is sort of weird. But writing too takes some time and so I wouldn't recommend that to you.

Your best bet would be to find something else to occupy your time with, even if it's simply a hobby. Also, watching television with my family discourages me from reading. It's not much but it does help.
