Keep reading, or Don't. Fanfiction is half of all I do in MY spare time. Though, also, feel free to put fanfic on the back burner and get your life in order. Just because I don't get any sleep doesn't mean you shouldn't too.

They say your life is ruled by three things. Work. Sleep. Play. I work, but a good bit of my sleep and play times are fanfiction or youtube. I'm not particularly happy about that, but what can you do? Oh well.
