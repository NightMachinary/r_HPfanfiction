I've done similar things in the past, and made similar bad life choices because of it. Its not about the fanfiction or how much you've read anymore - it's about sheer strength of will and making yourself know when to stop. AO3 and FFN will be there when you've looked through your Christmas presents and when you've spent some quality time with loved ones.
