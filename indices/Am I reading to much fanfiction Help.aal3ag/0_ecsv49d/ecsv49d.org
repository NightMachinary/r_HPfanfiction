If reading fanfiction is interfering with the rest of your life - affecting your sleep pattern, interfering with your studies and other responsibilities - then I'd say you do need to step away, at least for a while. You can read whatever makes you happy, but if reading is all you do then that's not good for you.

There are apps you can download which will blacklist certain sites (or even block you off the internet entirely) for a period of time that you set. When I have something I need to get done, I use one called Stay Focusd - I can make it so that even if I want to, I can't go to the sites where I procrastinate (hi reddit) until the job is done. You could use something like this to quarantine fanfiction sites?

You could also try setting an alarm. I do this too, because otherwise I struggle to go to bed early enough to get the sleep I need. Set yourself a rule that says “I am not allowed to be up and about after /this time/”. Set an alarm a few minutes before, so you know when you hear it you HAVE to start preparing to stop for the night. Screen off, stop what you're doing, start going through your nightly routine. The alarm is your reminder.
