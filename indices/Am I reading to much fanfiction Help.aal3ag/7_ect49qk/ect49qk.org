Having read all but one of those series, that I added to my massive to read list, I can say I have been where you are. I have read 1.2M words in the last 4 days... and Fanfiction is no longer my Only Addiction/Timesink anymore. /(that included going to work)/

A lot of the advice given is very good, but sometimes that isn't enough.

1. Alarms / "bed time" can be migrated to yourself, /I can't go to bed in the middle of a chapter. (then suddenly its 5 chapters later)/
2. Using the App to blacklist fanfiction sites does work if you adhere to the "Set it up and turn it on, then off when you're allowed to read, then on etc." I fail'd at that.
3. Someone pointed out that after a while you run out of the good fics, and this is true with /some/ fandoms; Harry Potter is not one of them if you're new as its been going on for over 10 years! There is probably 500Trillion words in HP fanfiction across all the sites...if not more and climbing. In addition, if HP isn't your only Fandom....
4. Using a reward system could be very useful for the short term, get X done and then set a timer for Y minutes reading. Rinse repeat.\\
5. Writing Fanfiction does curb the reading a bit but timesink itself.
6. Reading as a coping thing is very true. Finding the reason though might not lead to a slowdown, but would be good if that is the case.\\

My suggestions:

- Pull yourself away from Fanfiction for a little bit BY Reading a good paperback. I know Kindle/nook/etc is easier but they also can be used to read fanfiction. By using a physical book, you pull yourself away from the screen and the fandom.
- What did you get for Christmas that you've not tried out? Actively doing so might be enough.
- When *I* needed to pull away from fanfiction, I put more focus into gaming and watching youtube. /often at the same time, by listening./ There are a lot of free games out there (some which spark other fandoms :D ) I started playing MMOs primarily, to get some social because when binge reading I ignored people.

In the end, I dont write as much as I did to fandoms, and I go days without reading any but then suddenly a story I've read pop into my head and I'll go read it. /As I prefer 100k+ these days -- and actively read 700k+ if they're complete--/rereading fics take forever. sometimes I'll just go looking for fics with no intention of being drawn into one. My bookmarks have multiple folders under *Fanfiction* /favorites/*/,/* couples, fandoms, etc and I'll just drop a good sounding fic into it using faves only for the ones I know I'll read again. Then when in the mood to read, scroll down and find a new or old one to read.
