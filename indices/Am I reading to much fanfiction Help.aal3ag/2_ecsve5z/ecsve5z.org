i used to have this problem myself so i tried using fanfiction as a sort of reward. for every half hour of studying i'd take a 10 minute break to read fanfics. it was hard to stop binging at first but i soon noticed that by doing so i managed to do all my work while still feeling like i've read enough fanfiction for the day. hope this helps uwu
