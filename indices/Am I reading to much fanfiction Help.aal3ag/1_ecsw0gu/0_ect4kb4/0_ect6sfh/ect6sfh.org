100% agreed on both points. On the topic of finding stories, I'm also thankful that HP fanfiction primed me to try out other serial/online fiction like Worm or Mother of Learning. If I hadn't been into fanfics, I also may not have gotten into LitRPGs like Worth the Candle, several subreddits largely dedicated to serial fiction, and even into entire franchises like Fate.
