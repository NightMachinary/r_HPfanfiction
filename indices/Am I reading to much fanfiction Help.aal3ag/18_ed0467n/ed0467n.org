Please don't let fanfiction take over your life! At the end of the day it's just a hobby, you shouldn't let it affect other parts of your life so detrimentally.

All of those wonderful stories will always be there for you, and the more time you give yourself between each one the more of them will be there for you when you come back, but you don't want to end up doing something harmful from this kind of neglect.
