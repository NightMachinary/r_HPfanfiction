I had this problem starting out. I tried a number of the things in this thread, and none of them really worked long-term. I got over it partly because I'd gone through all the good stories, but I have one piece of advice that really did work for me.

If a story is taking too much of your time, copy and paste the URL into a Word document or something similar (I use Sticky Notes) so you don't lose your place. I also make a note of word count and number of chapters so you know how far along you are. It doesn't sound like it would make much difference, but it really does. It's a matter of "out of sight, out of mind", and it gives you a ready-made list to catch up on holidays or weekends.
