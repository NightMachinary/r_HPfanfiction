In addition to all the great suggestions here: Read offline. I know it sounds counterproductive to download a whole fic and read it like that (because then you don't even have 'natural' breaks of the chapters), but the biggest issue I had was finishing a story and then /starting another one/. If it is offline I can't just load the next in the series, or look at the authors other works, or fall down the rabbit hole of a new tag. Also, when reading on FFN it is hard to tell where in the fic you are, but at least offline you have a complete page count, so you can say- "ohh, I'm only 1/5th the way through, may as well stop now, cos if I try and finish I wont get any sleep." and also "I've read 100 pages and it is still boring, why bother reading the remaining 300?"
