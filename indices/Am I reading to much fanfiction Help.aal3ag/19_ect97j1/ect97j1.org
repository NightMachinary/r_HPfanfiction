This combined with videogames made be fail a few semesters at uni. I tried some of the suggestions above with moderate to little success. The thing that really helped me was location. As in I would only read fanfiction at home or on my phone if I was in line or waiting for something. I did all my class work in the library or an abandoned classroom. Often I worked with classmates which would keep me on task. It's still something I struggle with though. One thing that has helped me a lot is listening/reading Jordan Peterson. He has a lot of good advice about how to motivate yourself.
