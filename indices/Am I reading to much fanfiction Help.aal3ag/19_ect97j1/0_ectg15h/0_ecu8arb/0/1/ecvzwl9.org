Hmm, I think you have only looked at the surface of what he is saying and not any of the nuance. His points are much longer from what I can see. His point about order and chaos was that in mythology order is a masculine trait and chaos is a feminine trait. That is why we call it 'mother nature' and why the tyrant in lion King is Simba's Uncle not his Aunt. However it is not strictly men and women, only masculine and feminine. Such as the villain Mrs. Trunchbull in Matilda, who is super about order. She portays many classically 'masculine' traits. The opposite would be Little Finger from Game of thrones. His methods of winning the game of thrones generate a ton of chaos and he uses methods classically 'feminine' very similar to Cersi. The reason for this as Jordan points out is that humans are inherently social creatures so we anthropomorphise everything and our default categories are male and female. Certain traits tend toward certain genders creating Masculine and Feminine. But just because Order is Masculine and chaos is Feminine doesn't make either good or bad. Order can be terrible such as Big Brother in 1984. Chaos can be great such as Katniss in Hunger games.

As for the point about enforced monogamy, that has to be taken in the context of anthropology. 'Enforced Monogamy' is a anthropology term meaning there is cultural pressure to stay monogamous. Which I think is pretty self evident in human culture. Polygamy is super frowned upon and most people usually say cheating on your S.O. is considered bad. That is enforced monogamy. I can see how what he said there can be misconstrued and was said pretty poorly. But he has elaborated on that point after that interview. The fact of the matter is that most of Jordan's advice for 'Incels' is to grow the hell up into men so women will be attracted to you.

As for the whole transgender issue, Jordan was never anti transgender. He was just against the bill that was supposedly pro transgender because it was a poorly written law and he thought the government was reaching too far toward tyranny. That bill if it was in the US would be in direct violation of the first amendment. He had also said now that he would call a transgender student by their preferred pronoun given they were being genuine. His whole stance was that the government was overstepping their bounds.

As for the whole lobster thing, I think you missed the point. Jordan could have compared us to whales or chimps or lions or whatever. His point was that the problem of hierarchy and inequality is a way deeper problem than a sociological problem. It isn't something that humans came up with. It is something practiced by the majority of animals and our biology had adapted to hierarchy on a neurological level. You can't tackle a problem that deep from a sociological level. Or at least not without acknowledging the fact that it is deeply rooted in biology.

I couldn't find a video where he said men shouldn't debate women because they were too emotional. I'd be really interested in seeing that if you could send me the link.

As for the last tweet... That was from 1.5 years ago. From what I can tell he was asking why that occurred, and part of the conclusion he drew was that YouTube's audience is 70-80% male. After his book came out he said his audience became about 60%M 40%F

As for the patriarchy/gender roles point, that would take like 5 posts to unpack.

You know thanks for replying to my original post. I watched a lot of Peterson last night looking in to what you said and I learned a lot. I never understood all the weird hype around fake news until now.
