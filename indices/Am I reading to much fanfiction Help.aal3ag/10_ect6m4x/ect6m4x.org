I remember during exams my first year of college, I was reading an amazing fanfic and I made a rule that I could only read it during bathroom breaks. It meant I would linger in the bathroom way longer than necessary lol but it worked pretty well. Just don't stay in there too long or your dorm mates will wonder what's up
