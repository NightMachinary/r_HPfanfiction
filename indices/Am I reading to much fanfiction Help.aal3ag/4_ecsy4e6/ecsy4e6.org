It's very common to binge fanfiction when just starting out in a new fandom. I read a couple million words in the first weeks of shipping my OTP as well. The good news is that there is a good chance your reading will slow down naturally once you've read enough to figure out your preferences in more detail and start focusing more on fics that match them. However, if you feel fanfiction is interfering with your life in the meantime, I agree with the advice to set some limits on your reading.
