Ok.. I have probably read at around the same amount or more as you, but it's not affecting school or sleep. Try to prioritize school, and sleep by at least 10. I normally sit on my couch on the weekends and read on my tablet. If this is a continuous problem, I'd suggest you step away for a month. I had the same problem with YouTube, but after my headphones got stolen, and my other pair broke, I took a long break. Now, I watch maybe 3 hours a week?
