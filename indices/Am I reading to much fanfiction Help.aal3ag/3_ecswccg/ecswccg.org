After reading the comments, I feel bad that I nearly responded with sarcasm. I had no idea this was an actual problem people could have. I used to be the same way with videogames, so I get it, I think.

Acknowledging the problem and accepting the need to fix it are two big steps you've taken already. I think you'll be fine, just take the excellent advice you've received here and learn to moderate. All I can add is what helped me to end an addiction, without fail, and that's to quit 'cold turkey'.

Good luck with it.
