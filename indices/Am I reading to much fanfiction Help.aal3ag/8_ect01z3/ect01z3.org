Basically anything that becomes compulsive to the point of negatively impacting your life can be an addiction.

You should probably take some time and reflect on if you have been using bing reading as a coping mechanism. Is it away to avoid negative feelings depression, anxiety, low self esteem. You can be functionality depressed with out recognizing it. I went into a depression after loosing my grandmother and it wasn't until years later that I could recognize how withdrawn I had been. One of my coping mechanism was bing reading.

On a practical level I have a 7inch kindle fire and it has a voice to text feature so you can download a fic and listen to it. This has allowed me to be much more productive while still enjoying fics. I listen to them while I am cleaning my home, commuting to work, folding laundry, with headphones when I am doing the grocery shopping extra.

I would try writing up a plan with when, for how long, and after completing what activities will you read. Then post it around as a visual reminder.
