From Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:

  “Why didn't you tell me you're a Squib, Mrs. Figg?” asked Harry, panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round your house - why didn't you say anything?”

  “*Dumbledore's orders.* I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. *I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it.* It wasn't easy, you know... but oh my word,”

Also from Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. *You had suffered. I knew you would* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. *I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.*”
