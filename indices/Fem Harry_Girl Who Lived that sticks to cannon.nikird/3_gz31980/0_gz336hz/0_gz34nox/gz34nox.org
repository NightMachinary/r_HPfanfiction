It seems like we've got similar tastes! I've found that there's a lack of good Gryffindor Fem!Harry - a lot of authors put her in Slytherin and I'm really not a fan of anything that puts her in a relationship with Snape, regardless of her age when it happens. I'm outlining out my own Fem!Harry that's more to my taste, but it'll be a while until it's ready for reading.

My favorite is one that already got linked - “Looking Beyond” with Hope Potter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3178778/chapters/6905645]]

She's in Slytherin in this one, but if you're interested in world building with holiday rituals, they're really well done in Mary Potter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/340966]]

The characterization of her in this one isn't to my tastes so I stopped reading fairly quickly, but she's in Gryffindor and it's fairly canon like in this ongoing series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26307580/chapters/64056670]]

I'll keep digging and see if I can remember any other good ones!
