Yes basically what you said. I went through a couple of highly recommended fem!Harry fics from other threads, but they all involved stuff like time travel, Slytherin!Hary, or Harry/Snape pairings etc. which I personally just don't vibe with. Fem!Harry is of course inherently AU, so I can't be too picky about stuf like that. But please feel free to recommend whatever you think would be interesting!
