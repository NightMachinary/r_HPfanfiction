Right. One of my posts got deleted, so here we go again.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] is my favorite of the lot.

#+begin_quote
  Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter.

Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb): Best Slytherin Ginny Fanfic around.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5639528/1/][Save Me]]: Another fun Slytherin Ginny story, abandoned early. Great character voice for Ginny.

  My foot started tapping to the beat of my humming, impatiently waiting for the hat to get on with it. "You will make your mark in---SLYTHERIN!" I've never heard the Great Hall that silent. I'm talking crickets.

Linkffn(A Call to Arms by My dear professor McGonagall) is very good.

Linkffn(The enigmatic headmistress) has the same premise, with an excess of smut.

Linkffn(The albatross did follow by Chromeknickers) is an excellent story, with a Groundhog Day style Infinite Time Loop. It is Ginny/Draco, which I generally don't read, but this one's really good.

Linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire) features Ginny as the Hogwarts Champion for the TWT held in Beauxbatons. Takes place during her final year at Hogwarts.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/825377/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets][Ginny Weasley and the Chamber of Secrets]] is CoS from Ginny POV.

  Horrible brothers, unrequited love, and leaving home for the first timewhat else could possibly go wrong? Ginny Weasley is about to find out. FINISHED

Linkffn(The Rebirth by Irina) and Linkffn(Galatea by Irina) are both interesting, if not particularly high quality stories. Rebirth has a shaky start, but gets better later on.

Try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2016209/1/][Lady Darkness]] by Angstpuppies for a well written Dark!Ginny, though she isn't really the protagonist. Also a side of H/Hr.

  Being possessed by Tom Riddle wrought changes in Ginny Weasley no one could have imagined. Six years after first finding the diary, she's reached her goal. Now, Harry and Order face their most difficult challenge: fighting a friend.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1181280?view_adult=true][Compromise: A Love Story]] is an excellent oneshot, a brilliant portrayal of the post War Harry/Ginny relationship. One of my favorites and my headcanon too.

Hmm. Did I miss any?

Edit: Ignore the first one. Stupid Bot hates me.
