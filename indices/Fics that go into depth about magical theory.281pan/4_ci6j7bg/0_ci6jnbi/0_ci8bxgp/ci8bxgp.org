Have you ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3322666/1/Echoes-of-Power-Part-I-Anger][Echoes of Power]]? Unfortunately it's not finished, but it's still quite long, and there are huge portions of it that deal almost extensively with magical theory. And there's a lot of 'darker' elements in there, too.
