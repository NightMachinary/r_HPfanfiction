I'm afraid not.

I only started reading fics a couple months back (maybe less!) and began writing number one for a few days until I had to focus on exams.

I'm a very imaginative person, and think of new things /all the time!/. Sometimes I just see something new (i.e. the word "Mnemonist"), then I'll research it for a few minutes, then apply it to a fan fiction. Within a few minutes I have a rough story layout and beginning/middle point.

Right now I'm job searching so can't quite just focus on fics :(
