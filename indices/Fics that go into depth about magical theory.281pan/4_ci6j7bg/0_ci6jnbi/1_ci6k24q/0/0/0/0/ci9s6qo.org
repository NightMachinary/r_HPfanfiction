I'm more interested in the origins and function of magic. For example, how does being a Squib work? How do muggle-born kids get magic powers? Why is "love", which is nothing more than a chemical reaction in theory, such a powerful magical force? How do wands work? How can you "invent" a spell? How does time-travel work?

I have zero content planned for all these questions, but I'd really like to write a fanfic that attempts to answer them. It's just a matter of finding the motivation to write. :)

And I agree, you simply can't improvise these things! You have to have a general plan at least, especially if your story is full of technical things like spell categories and stuff.
