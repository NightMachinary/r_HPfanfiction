Have you met [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][Taure]]?

He wrote a story that was literally called "Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling". I think he changed it to a google doc linked on his author page now.

All of his stories have extensive magical theory explorations. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic I]] is a rich new world - Harry Potter set in a world of very different magical rules which had only been hinted at before he abandoned the story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] made some amazing changes to the canonical story while sticking a bit more closely to canonical magic - DarkLordPotter forums have a breakdown by the author of the magic system changes he implemented from canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] is a bit shorter, but sticks the closest to canonical magic - though it doesn't explicitly give as much of an explanation of magic as the others do. It's also probably the best of his works. Harry gets Dumbledore's memories after his death.
