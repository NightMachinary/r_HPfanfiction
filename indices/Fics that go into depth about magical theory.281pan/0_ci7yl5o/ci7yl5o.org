I adored that one you mentioned ("On the Ground Running," maybe???), so I think you'd enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night]["Out of the Night"]], as it goes into some depth about Dark magic and what makes it different from Light magic. A lot of fics do that, but I think this one takes a unique approach, and I might even use this theory myself in the future. Sadly it's been abandoned, but what is there is amazing. The history the author puts forward makes a lot more sense than many fics I've read with the same concepts.
