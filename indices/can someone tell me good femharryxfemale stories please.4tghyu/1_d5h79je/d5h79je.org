linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize), and its sequels is Jasmine/Hermione

linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by slygoddess) is Harriet/Ginny

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by the MadMadReviewer) - Jamie/Tonks

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) and sequels are Jen/Luna, though it takes a while to come about [[/spoiler][and doesn't look too likely to last much longer]]

Also, and I thank [[/u/oops_i_made_a_typi]] for mentioning it, my stories are primarily Holly/witches, though with prominent exceptions [[/spoiler][Harry in Holly Polter; Neville and several non-consensual encounters in Holly Evans]]
