Dumbledore also "gave evidence" that Sirius was the Potters' Secret Keeper but Sirius never had a trial. It's very likely that Snape never had a trial either and Dumbledore politicked his crimes away.

Though I /would/ like to know how such a trial would go if it did occur. What evidence would Snape (and Dumbledore) provide that he'd turned against Voldemort to a /just/ court?

  “There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story, except your word --- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper.”

  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”
