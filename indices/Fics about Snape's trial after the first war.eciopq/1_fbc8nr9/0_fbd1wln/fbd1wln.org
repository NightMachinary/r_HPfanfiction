Karkaroff (I'm sure I spelled it wrong) mentioned him during his own trial and Dumbledore said he already testified that Snape switched sides, so there was some sort of discussion about that. Dumbledore says clearly 'Sverus Snape was indeed a death eater' so it's not a secret. I'm curious if they knew what he did as a death eater. Of course the policy 'I've got a dark mark, prison is waiting for you' is the best, but they apparently didn't know this existed, and yet Dumbledore had to testify so there was a reason for that.
