Well, the adoption of Teddy is completely canonical, isn't it?

Also, “Dudley's Memories” by Paganaidd linkao3(601542) and its sequel.

Harry also semi-adopts Holly (a magical Dudley's daughter) in the “Holly at Hogwarts” series (starting with linkao3(1048010)). Not really, because although the relationship is sometime tense, her parents are generally doing The Right Thing™ (sometime with disastrous results, true).

I think Violet Malfoy is adopted in “Hogwarts Houses Divided” by Inverarity linkffn(3979062), but I don't remember the story that well.
