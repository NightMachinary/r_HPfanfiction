  Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.

  Return to the start. Do not pass Go. Do not collect 200 dollars. Harry and pals' ultimate spell goes awry, and Voldemort is reverted to a baby, brain and all. Everyone deserves a second chance, and this time, Harry's making sure Voldemort gets it.

  Voldemort remembered his killing curse backfiring and shooting the Potter boy one last utterly betrayed look before he... awoke. In a small dark space.And if Voldemort was right and this was indeed pregnancy... he didn't know how he'd suffer another 9 months of this.(AKA, Voldemort finds out what exactly it's like to have a person love him, and finds himself perhaps returning the sentiment.)
