I read a funny fic some time ago, and there the Marauders pick each day one of Dumbledores first names. This one then stuck for the day, even in front of Dumbledore. But to your question, I think to Dumbledore it depends on the familiarity between them but in most fics it's either Albus or Professor. In front of Harry (without Dumbledore present) I think (because Sirius is immature) he would call him Albus or one of the other first names.

If you post your story, can you link it here, so we can appreciate it too?
