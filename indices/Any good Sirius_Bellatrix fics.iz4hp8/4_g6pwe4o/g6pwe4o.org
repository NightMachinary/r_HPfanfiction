Ok, the Sirius/Bellatrix is an undercurrent that is slow to reveal, and not the focus of this long Sirius raises Harry series, but 'Brilliant Difficulty' has one of the most fascinating Black family dynamics, including nods at past S/B that's just deliciously painful (but this is really more apparent in the last few chapters).

It's really good.

Some of the writer(basketofnovas)'s shorter fics focus more on this pairing, like "Deception of the Thrush," and "All Time is unredeemable."
