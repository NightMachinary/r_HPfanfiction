Has there ever been a vote on this sub? I recognize both sides of the debate, but I myself am actually not too sure which side has more supporter. As for your last sentence, I want to answer to that, but this would restart the old argument and thereby go horribly off-topic. (Note that I specifically mentionned that I was talking about "the people this sub", not "fanfic readers at large").
