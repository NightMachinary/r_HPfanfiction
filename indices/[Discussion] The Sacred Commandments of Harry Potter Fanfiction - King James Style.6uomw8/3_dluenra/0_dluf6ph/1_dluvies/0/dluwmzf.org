  So you're cool with the Death Eaters going and killing innocents because Harry's too selfish to get his hands dirty? Because Harry has certainly never shown any sorrow towards dead Death Eaters, so the only reason he doesn't kill himself is because he feels uncomfortable with it.

I darehoped we wouldn't rekindle that old debate here... but here are my two cents.

First, one could argue (and this is certainly Christian J.K. Rowling's opinion, though not necessarily mine) that it's simply /wrong/ to kill someone under any circumstance --- not only because of sorrow felt for the individual in question but because killing is by itself an act of utter evil. "Thou Shalt Not Kill" and all that. That's not really my belief (as I'm an atheist), but going by Rowling's unspoken assumption that her characters are Christians, this may be Harry's, giving him a reason for his "no killing" rule beyond "he's weak" even though he doesn't really empathize with the Death Eaters.

Secondly, barring the first argument, I'd say there's something /wrong/ with Harry if he does /not/ show sympathy for the Death Eaters at his mercy. Unlike Voldemort, who you could argue may actually be a born psychopath (who, additionally, willingly altered himself with Dark Magic to turn himself even more insane), most of the Death Eaters are normal humans, not some sorts of irredeemable demons, as Regulus, Snape and Draco's eventual redemptions proved. To kill them is to deny them the second chance they, as human beings, deserve. I am fundamentlly against the death penalty IRL and this basically the same thing.

And drawing on the above point, unlike (to an extent) in a real-life war, the almost limitless possibilities of magic /do/ provide a competent wizards with ways to lastingly incarcerate an opponent without killing them. Of the many options, at least two off the top of my head even remove the cost and time of feeding and watching them: you can Petrify them/feed them Draught of Living Death, stuff them in a Fidelius-ed closet, and forget about them till the war is over.

So I realize that in full-blown battle it's not always possible to stand by that rule. If Bellatrix is about to AK you and she has raised Anti-Apparition Jinxes, then of course, I won't blame you for sending a Blasting Curse her way. But if you spot Dolohov in the street minding his own business, it's /not/ acceptable to just assassinate him on the spot. If you feel you can, take him in custody. (No need to be "nice" about it, either, mind. You can break both his arms with a well-aimed curse, for instance. He'll have a tough time fighting back that way, and you can regrow the bones later when he's locked up and wandless.) If not, just go away. It's not worth taking a life needlessly.
