  How is murdering someone that gets in Harry's way pointless?

Now /this/ is one of the things on the list I agree with (keep in mine everybody, I'm listing common complaints; I don't agree with everything --- for instance, I prefer fanon Arithmancy). The debate often pops up (I'd say it's one of the few classic fanon wars that never really ended but just slipped into passive-agressive mode), and the question is, should Harry keep his canon "no killing" rule, and if not, to what extent? There's those who think he sinks to the Death Eaters' level if he ever tries to kill his opponents at all, those (me among them) who consider he should try not to kill random Death Eaters in battle unless it's the only way out for himself, and those who think trying to win the war without attempting to decimate the Death Eaters is just being weak and soft-hearted.
