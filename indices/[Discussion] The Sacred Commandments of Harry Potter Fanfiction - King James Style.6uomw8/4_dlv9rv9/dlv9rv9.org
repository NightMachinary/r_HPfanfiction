  Thou shalt not make unto thee any magical core, or any likeness of any thing that acteth like a magical battery, nor arbitrary power differentials between characters.

Hmmm... canon does not support this commandment, I am afraid.

HBP, Chapter 26:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it."\\
  "But then-?"\\
  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

Clearly there are great power differentials between characters, and clearly that difference is somehow measurable.
