Fair enough.

And about the magic = muscles comment? If magic can be "trained", it's safe to say that different magicals may have differents levels of power available to them, since they would have different training regimes. A fully trained 50 year old is more powerful/resourceful/skilled than a magical the same age without training.

Following that idea, someone, somewhere has tried creating "power-enhancing" potions/spells/rituals. At the very least, one person is bound to be successful.
