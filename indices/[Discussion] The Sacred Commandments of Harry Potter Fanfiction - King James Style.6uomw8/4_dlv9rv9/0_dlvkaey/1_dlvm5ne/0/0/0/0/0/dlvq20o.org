I agree with the "muscle" comparison. The fact that power-enhancing potions may have been attempted at some point is a plausible thought, though I don't know if they were successful. Looks to me like "you can't artifically enhance magical power" may very well be one of the Fundamental Laws of Magic of which we only know one ("meddling with the soul is dangerous"). For instance, maybe a human body can't handle a sudden, artificial increase in magical power and would burn down like an overcharged wand.
