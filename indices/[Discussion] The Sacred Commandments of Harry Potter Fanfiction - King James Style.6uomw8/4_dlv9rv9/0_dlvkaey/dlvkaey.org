Because he's sixteen-year-old. You're not the first to point this out (and other similar scenes in the books), but the key point is that every time this happens, it's about an underage wizard versus an adult. This does not /entirely negate/ the idea of cores, of course (but again, this thread lists things that the sub seems to dislike, whether or not that dislike is entirely rational), but most people who dislike magical cores argue that in canon, one's magical power grows naturally with age, moreso as the magic is exercised, but --- and this is the main point of contention --- that nothing differentiates two wizards /at birth/. Harry or anyone else can't have an "unusually large magical core" just because; he'll only get Dumbledore-levels if he trains properly, and anyone, even someone like Neville or Goyle, could technically get to this level if they trained as well.
