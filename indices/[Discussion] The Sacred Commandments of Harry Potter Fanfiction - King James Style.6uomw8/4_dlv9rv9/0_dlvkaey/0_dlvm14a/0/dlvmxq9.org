Because while "magical core" /can/ be used for a more abstract measure of power, it originally came from bad Indy!Harry fics where the core was a /visual/ ball of glowing light or something like that within the person, which Lucifer!Dumbledore usually put "binding enchantments" on. All this being obviously ridiculous by our modern standards. So using the word brings back the memories of these hated additional concepts. By contrast, the only difference between "wards" as they are usually depicted with the "protective enchantments" of canon are the fact that "wards" are often based in runes, and most of the fandom seems to /like/ the idea of chargeable, magical runes even if it's not canon.
