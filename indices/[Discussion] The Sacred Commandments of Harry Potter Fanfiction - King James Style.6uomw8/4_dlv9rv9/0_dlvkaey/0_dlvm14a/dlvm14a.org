That doesn't negate the fact that there is /something there/, some measure of power. Why shouldn't "core" be as good a word for it as any? I will never understand why this sub abhors the word "core", yet embraces the word "ward" for the magical protections that can be put around people and places. Neither are used in canon, yet the concepts are there for both. I wouldn't advise using the words for either, simply because they're not in canon, but why does the sub hate one and love the other?
