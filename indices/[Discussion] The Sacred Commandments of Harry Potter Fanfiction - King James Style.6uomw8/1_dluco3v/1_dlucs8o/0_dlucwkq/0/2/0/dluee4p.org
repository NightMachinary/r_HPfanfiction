I certainly wouldn't call myself fanon-intolerant. (I just dislike smut, which rules Harems out, and am annoyed at Manipulative Dumbledore because of how much I like his friendly canon self.) This thread is supposed to be a collaborative, comedic summing-up of what the tropes most of this sub seems to dislike, not a representation of my personal tastes. In fact, it will say something about my supposed "fanon intolerance" that one of my favorite fanfics is /Core Threads/.
