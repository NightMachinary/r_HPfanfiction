The moment that hits me the hardest of any fic is the climax of linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca) in the Louvre.

Everything in the story leads up to that moment and it's so powerful and full of emotion. Perfect.

Honorable mention to the shed scene in Linkffn(Backward with Purpose by Deadwoodpecker)
