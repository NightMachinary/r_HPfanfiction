It isn't a HP fanfiction, but this story is genius. It's a Naruto fic where he and Sasuke become friends early on, but Naruto is mentally unstable. Eventually, he starts to drag Sasuke down with him. It's addicting, dark, and perfectly written.

I was in the process of writing a Slytherin Harry fic, and reading this story made me want to quit. ;-; I know the feel.
