Mirror by theresnomeaning on Fictionhunt.

I have read many cliffhangers at the end of unfinished stories. I thought I'd grown a thick enough skin not to be affected by just another unfinished story.

I was wrong. So very wrong. This is a great story, but it's not worth the absolutely crushing cliffhanger that finishes this incomplete story.
