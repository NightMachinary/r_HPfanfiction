I get this feeling in a specific circumstance. English isn't my first language, but I like to think I have a good grasp on it. However /writing/ is a different kind of mastery of language. I think I've managed to turn a clever phrase once in a while, but then I'll read one of the authors who imo write well. I want to stress /write/. I love POTDK, but it's not particularly well-written and it's not why I enjoy it. Take joe6991 or Newcomb, or Swimdraconian. These guys actually write well. I reread their works periodically and sometimes they make me just want to.give up and not bother writing myself anymore. Haven't crushed my spirit completely though.
