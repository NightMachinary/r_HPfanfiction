For me, writing fan fiction is very low-risk. There's a lot of reasons my fics might not be popular, completely separate from quality. So when I read fan fics that I consider to be amazingly well written (Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux as an example) I don't feel inadequate or disheartened, but instead try to analyze the writing and see what exactly I like about it.

Idk. Fan fiction is funny because writing it is so purely for the enjoyment of writing.
