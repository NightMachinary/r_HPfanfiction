Long Journey Home did it several times. Changeling did it twice. Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation confounded me- I kept thinking 'but you can't change the time and setting within a paragraph', and yet the story flowed so well.

In each of these cases, it seems like the authors break the rules in how they use narrative style, but I can't figure out how they know when to shift without losing the reader, and yet they know.
