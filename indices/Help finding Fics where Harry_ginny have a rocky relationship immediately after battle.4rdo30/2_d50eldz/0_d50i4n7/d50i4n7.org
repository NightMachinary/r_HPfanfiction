I thought it was mentioned specifically somewhere but can't find. However, James is born 2004, meaning Ginny is pregnant in 2003 or 2004 at the latest. Rowling has mentioned, or it was mentioned in the wiki, that Ginny left quidditch to start a family.

Ginny graduated in 1999 and presumably started playing with the Harpies soon after. I assume the seasons might run concurrently to the school year since the World Cup took place in the summer, likely when the league was off season. So Ginny starts up in 1999, with the first season ending in 2000. Three seasons of play takes her up to 2002. So she either retired in 2002 or 2003. It is possible she played 4 seasons.

So nothing specifically mentions how long she played so it is certainly not off canon if a writer has Ginny spend a year abroad before trying out for the Harpies or has her quit after a year. But from what we know about Ginny and her love of quidditch, it's safe to assume she joined up soon after graduating. But you're right; it isn't explicitly mentioned.
