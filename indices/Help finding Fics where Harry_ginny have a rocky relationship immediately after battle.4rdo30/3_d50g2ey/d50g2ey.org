Hate to self advertise, but I feel like this fic I'm working on now kinda fits your idea. Ginny and Harry do get back together, but they have issues.

Still kind of rose tinted but they're also still in the honeymoon phase, once she goes off to Hogwarts and him to Auror training it won't be as perfect.
