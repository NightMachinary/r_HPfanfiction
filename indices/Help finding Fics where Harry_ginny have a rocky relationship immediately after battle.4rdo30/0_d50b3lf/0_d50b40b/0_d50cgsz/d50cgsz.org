Yes, this one I read a while ago and really enjoyed it. They hit the nail on the head for what I look for in these types of fics. Realistic in how they broke up, a murder/mystery b plotline to keep it from getting repetitive, and the ultimate reconciliation. Bit explicit which I'm fine with if it doesn't control the whole story.
