Pretty late to this topic unfortunately, but imo this one is the best.

Basically 5 versions of Harry in alternate dimensions with different backstories can communicate telepathically, and since they are all dealing with the same similar to canon HP plot events, they help each other out as they discover new information. It sounds like it would be a huge mess, but the author does an amazing job making all 5 characters distinct and easy to follow, and it just works really well.

I'll also second What's Her Name In Hufflepuff which someone else mentioned. That fic was also great.
