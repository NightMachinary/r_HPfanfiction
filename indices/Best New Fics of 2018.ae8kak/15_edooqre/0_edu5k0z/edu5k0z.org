What's bothering me a lot is that in the Russian version the disclaimer is plagiarised from HPMoR without giving credit, which makes me wonder just how original the whole thing is.

Also, I am fazed and confused and in stitches about the number of translations this remark involves: this is a fic in English translated from a fic in Russian which contains an unattributed quote from a fic in Russian translated from English so yeah....
