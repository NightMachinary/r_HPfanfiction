linkffn(Cleansing the Sins of the Past)

I'm biased of course but it has the usual strongly developed characters of [[/u/TE7]] 's writing, and a genuine sense of a real magical world.

Of course the highlight is the amazing beta work.

EDIT: I was going to add Hollow Ash by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] but it misses out by two days, having been published on Dec 29 2017.
