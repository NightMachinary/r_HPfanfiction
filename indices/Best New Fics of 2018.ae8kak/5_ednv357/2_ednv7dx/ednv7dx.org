  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

  Time has passed and the Golden Trio is safe and happy. Their family--- or most of them--- is safe and happy with them. There is love, there is joy, there is expansion... The Potters, the Weasleys, and the Black-Lupins are well.If only we could all be so lucky.Percy is a Weasley in a farce called the Ministry. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan are on the run. A Muggle detective named Rosier Bishop has a new partner who sees things and a series of murders that they just can't explain. Draco and his new wife Luna are stepping through a minefield of friendly Death Eaters who visit for tea after murdering children. Neville's working with crazy people to try and integrate the Magical world with the Muggle, and oh, yeah, Dumbledore's dead along with most of the rest of the Order.
