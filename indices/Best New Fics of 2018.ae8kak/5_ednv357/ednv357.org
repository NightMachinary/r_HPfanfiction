I'll reiterate my recommendation for linkao3(Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) and it's sequel linkao3(The Mercy Seat by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) It is, hopefully, one of the new generation of fics. I've been in this game(as a reader) since the early 00's and while I love most of the tropes of fandom, and find them comforting, it is so refreshing to see a story that is so /real/ and.. full bodied.

And I really belive in the authors characterization of people desperately trying to survive a dystopia.

Also, I love Luna in this. Well, love might not be the right word, but it begins with a Luna we all know and love and lets us see what she might become when confronted with the incredible ongoing moral quandary and mortal peril that comes with marrying into Death Eater family. The pairing is Draco/Luna. And Voldemort attends their fucking wedding and she handles It like a fucking MVP.

  Everything is going very well, until it isn't. The ballroom of Malfoy Manor goes dark and cold when only moments ago there was summer sunshine, the tall, stained glass windows flying open with the force of a dark wind. Smoke billows into the ballroom, forming itself into a thin black funnel before dissipating, revealing...

  Luna goes very, very cold. A pale face, red eyes, thin, lipless mouth. She never thought about what the Dark Lord might look like, but now she doesn't have to, because he's standing in front of her.

  Wait.

  She keeps her expression flat, focusing on the man as he turns slowly to take in the ballroom. There's... an afterimage. Nothing visible to most wizards, but then, no one has the same natural talent with glamours that Lovegoods have. Granted, it's a good one--- she can't discern any actual features of the man that lies beneath--- but to know it's a glamour is something of a comfort, paltry as it is.

  His eyes find her and Draco.

  The noise he makes is one of satisfaction.

  “And here's the happy couple,” he says. His voice is soft and so utterly alien--- another glamour, Luna suspects. “The young Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.”

  Draco bows low, an exaggerated greeting better suited to a house elf than an heir. Luna curtsies, careful not to wrinkle the folds of her wedding robes.

  “We were not expecting you, my Lord,” Lucius says, stepping forward with a bow almost as deep as Draco's. “We apologize, but we are ill-prepared---”

  She sees a spark of fury in the Dark Lord's red eyes. She moves almost thoughtlessly, laying a gentle hand on Lucius' elbow. Regardless of how cold the man may be with her, he's her father-in-law now, and Narcissa seems quite fond of him. Better to save him from becoming a gibbering mess in the middle of the floor. Not on her damn wedding day.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” she says, not sparing Lucius a glance. “For joining us on this joyful day. I was uncertain as to whether or not you would attend, but I made certain to leave a place for you at the family table. I was told you are close with the Lestranges.”

  Luna can feel the prickle of fear emanating from her husband, but she doesn't turn her head, doesn't look away for a moment when the Dark Lord turns his focus on her.

  “Not at the High Table?” he asks, tone deceptively smooth.

  She smiles.

  “No, my Lord,” she says. “I felt that--- should you have been unable to attend--- it would have thrown off the careful symmetry of the room. For all that a wedding is a bond between two people, the bride is always the centerpiece, and I felt it best that I be displayed properly. I am a stranger to many of our guests, you understand.”

  The Dark Lord's lip twitches up into an odd, humorless smirk.

  “A very practical young woman,” he remarks. “But there is a flaw in your reasoning.”

  “Is there, my Lord?”

  “Indeed.” He steps closer. Lucius instinctively backs away, but Luna stands firm. “I have, in fact, arrived.”

  “You have,” she agrees. “But as I said before, my Lord, I am the centerpiece. It is my day. And as bright as I may be---” she gestures at her sunshine yellow dress. “--- I felt, sir, that should you arrive, you would draw the eyes of every guest in attendance. Pardon my forwardness, but I'd like to remain the center of attention today.” She smiles at him, her face a perfect impression of a dreamy, somewhat silly girl.

  None of this is true, of course. She set a place for the Dark Lord as far from herself as possible without endangering herself by offending him. She wouldn't have even allowed Narcissa to send out an invitation if it weren't for the fact that Lucius was Inner Circle.

  (She wouldn't have any of these people here, actually, but at least they're not the Dark Lord himself.)

  His smile grows wider, and a moment later, he lets out an odd, hissing laugh. Yes, she thinks, his voice has definitely been altered.

  “You are a bold girl,” he says. “Tell me: are you afraid?”

  “I am,” she says, honestly. “But you are a reasonable man, I think, and a reasonable man has no reason to harm me now that I've explained myself properly.”

  He continues to stare. She stares back, resisting the urge to react to the prodding of his Legilimency when he meets her eyes. Instead, she allows her Occlumency shields to become smooth and slippery, like oiled glass.

  Finally, the Dark Lord nods.

  “An odd choice for a bride, Draco,” he says, turning to the Malfoy heir. “But an intriguing one.”

  Draco swallows, moving to stand beside her.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” he says, inclining his head.

  “Would you like me to show you where you are seated?” Luna asks, an earnest smile fixing itself to her face. “I am sure a moment of relaxation can only be beneficial. I imagine you must be very busy, most days.”

  The Dark Lord seems taken aback by the offer.

  “... My, my, you're quite proper, for a Lovegood,” he remarks. “Narcissa has taught you well.”

  Actually, it was her father, but Luna feels like correcting him is pushing it.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” she says, curtsying again. “Please, your table is right this way.”

  She doesn't expect it when he offers her an arm. Regardless of social customs, there's something incredibly jarring about the man wearing a snake-faced glamour who is slowly killing off nearly two-thirds of the population holding out his elbow for her to take--- which she does, against her better instincts.

  The walk to his table is an eerily silent one, all eyes following their progress across the ballroom. It isn't until he's seated, robes gathered properly around him, that the world seems to jerk itself out of its shock. The music starts up again, the quiet hum of chatter begins.

  “Yellow does not suit you,” the Dark Lord says before she can excuse herself back to her husband to hyperventilate. “Were you a Hufflepuff?”

  Luna shakes her head.

  “A Ravenclaw,” she says. “But my father believes yellow is good luck to wear at weddings. You might have noticed, but Draco is wearing a yellow under robe as well.”

  “A silly belief,” he says simply.   “Perhaps,” she agrees. “But every little bit helps. Draco signed on as a Snatcher nearly a year ago, now, as I imagine you're aware. The Mudbloods---” Oh, Merlin, the word makes her feel like she forgot to brush her teeth this morning. “--- have been known to get rowdy, I've heard. As skilled as I know Draco to be, it makes me nervous to think of it.”.

  The Dark Lord smiles.

  “He is taking the time to prove his talent,” he says approvingly. “I am sure you have little to worry about.”
