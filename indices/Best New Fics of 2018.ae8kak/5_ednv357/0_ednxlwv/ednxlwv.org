Here is my old recommendation:

#+begin_quote
  What about one where he runs of to America, refusing to become a child soldier? linkao3(Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) and he and his friends find a better life, but in doing that they leave the British Wizarding world behind to burn. The story takes a lot of minor characters and flesh them out and introduces a lot of OCs and it /works/ the author is so skilled. Stylistically(if that is even the right word) once the trio leave British shores the story steps away from most fandom conventions and tropes and does not hold back any punches. I love it, so refreshing.

  The second part really focuses on Britain turning on muggleborns and gets dark and gritty and /realistic/. A totalitarian regime rises and genocide begins and characters behave and feel like real flawed people slowly whittling their souls away in an attempt to survive. Collaborating. Death of the boiling frog. Killing children.

  Maybe I'm over hyping it but I love seeing this new generation of fandom writers that goes at the possibilities from a new angle.
