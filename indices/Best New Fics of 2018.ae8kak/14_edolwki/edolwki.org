One that I've really been enjoying is linkffn(13098062). It's a killer AU based around a really talented witch and her fight against a stupidly scary witch that's lived in captivity for thousands of years. All the main characters are OC's but they actually feel like real characters with their own flaws etc. One of the best bits about the fic are the different types of magic the author introduces throughout and how everything is given a somewhat realistic consequence for its use, especially the more dangerous/powerful types of magic. Definitely recommend giving it a go if you're looking for something new to read.
