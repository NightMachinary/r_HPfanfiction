#+begin_quote
  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.
