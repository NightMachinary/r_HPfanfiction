I really liked anticlockwise by casscade. It's a time travel fic but all through the eyes of a non-traveller. It's very big on mystery and had me at the edge of my seat. I stayed up all night reading it, which I rarely do. Still a WIP, though.

For stories that have been completed, Bad Oracle by we_built_the_shadows_here is a much better take on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
