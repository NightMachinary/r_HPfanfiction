Linkffn(13108396) is the only non smut link HP link I've saved this year. Its appeal to me is firstly that it's completed, so no worries your fic will suddenly stop receiving updates just after a cliffhanger. It is short, clocking in at a lean 35k words and 5 chapters short, perfect for one afternoon and free of extraneous details.

Quality wise, it is a Dark!Harry and Hermione fic where the Canon divergence is the Year 6 Poisoned Mead scene. Here, Harry goes to extreme means because of this divergence but he still remains fundamentally good. Canon characterizations are kept intact. This fic is more than happy to rely on the original books where Canon stays the same, which was a strong factor in its short length. Overall a fic I would recommend for its brevity that is still a solid and riveting fic to read
