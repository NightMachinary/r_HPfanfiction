Just reread it, think the last time I did so it only had a few chapters, and it's top notch. It's part post-war fix fic, part coming of age story, and part slowburn-romance. If you enjoy politics/Wizengamot-heavy fics, you'll love Novocaine; if you don't, it's worth slogging through those parts.

And as much as it seems fluffy and light-hearted at times, it's not afraid to take off the gloves and throw some deep stuff at the reader. I LOVE this quote from Harry's thought process during one of the chapters:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had been too afraid of power after everything, and Voldemort had sought nothing but power. A pureblood whose father had murdered Muggles, a half-blood whose father had been a Muggle. A wizard who had accidentally murdered his sister, a wizard who had killed over and over, including his own family. Two people deathly afraid of the other, both of them betting their survival on a boy. The two most powerful wizards in their history, and the two men who had shaped Harry into the person that he was.

It can be a little over-dramatic at times and I think some characters (Ginny and Ron, mainly) get the short end of the stick, but overall this is really a great fic.
