Ugh no. That story is utterly awful. The characters are all indistinguishable and act like robots and there's absolutely no magic in it. I slogged my way through it because someone recced it and insisted it got good in the latest few chapters. Spoiler: it doesn't.

To be fair, the actual writing is decent but the story is awful.
