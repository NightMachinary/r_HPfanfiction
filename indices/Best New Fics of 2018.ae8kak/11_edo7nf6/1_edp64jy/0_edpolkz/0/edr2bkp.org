I was just going to let this lie but I have to ask... What is good about this story? It's nothing but Harry spending money, setting up a foundation, hiring people and - I raise a sceptical eyebrow at your claim of lack of angst - gradually breaking up with Ginny and getting together with Daphne.

There's no real story here. It's just Harry doing Good Things. Read a biography of Bill Gates Post Microsoft and you've got this.
