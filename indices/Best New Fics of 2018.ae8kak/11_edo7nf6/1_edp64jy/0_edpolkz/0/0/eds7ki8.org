I'll list off some of the things that I liked about the fic, even though I'm not OP:

- It's a better take on redeeming Malfoy than the Draco-In-Leather-Pants trope. He still feels out of character compared to canon Malfoy, but I can believe that it's his personality and we've just never seen it from his perspective before.
- I'm a fan of the canon relationships, but if you're going to break them up, how the author handles Harry/Ginny in this is the way to do so. It's how actual adult relationships can end in the real world. I think Ron's shortchanged as a character here, but that's true for a lot of fics, so I don't hold it against this one specifically.
- I like being a party to Harry's decisions about who he'll be post-Voldemort. His entire life in canon revolves around Voldemort; it's a good question what he'll do and who he'll become once Voldemort is gone and I haven't read a lot of post-canon fics that I think do this well.
- It has the right amount of Old Magic info-dump, at least so far. Unless it's linkffn (Prince of the Dark Kingdom), a fic should not spend chapters detailing the intricacies of the Old Ways and how amazing and misunderstood they are.
- The story also serves as a cautionary tale about how easy it would be to take over the Wizarding World post-War if Harry was less inclined to make the world a better place. It makes me wish linkffn(Made of Common Clay) was less cracky.
