I rarely see Daphne in a f/f pairing at all. Daphne/Tracey is the only one that I've seen with any regularity (in the broadest sense of the word). Hermione/Daphne is one of those pairings where it surprises me how few fics are out there about them. Same can be said about femHarry/Daphne, have not encountered it.
