I suppose everyone that reads fanfiction is familiar with Jeconais. He's the reason I read fanfiction. He supports his own website [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]] All of the authors he has invited are good writers. Most have stopped producing lately, but some of the older stuff is wonderful.
