I second this fic recommendation. The relationship is written very well, especially on Hermione's end. Especially liked the plot points revolving around the horcruxes. Also has a very good portrayal (albeit minor towards the latter stages of the fic) of Ron and Ginny which is a plus, considering how some authors write them.
