I know I'm self promoting here but I do think you'd like my Harry Black Series. It's about a Harry raised by Sirius who starts as a playboy and begins to actually fall for Daphne in a manner similar to James and Lily all while struggling with his one track mind for revenge and solving the riddle of Voldemort.

Whereas Daphne is struggling with her own roadblocks that prevent her from opening up. Over the course of the will be tetralogy the two fall deeper and deeper in love, though they are officially a couple by the end of book 1.

Check them out here if you'd like:
