This is a great point. It definitely could be a very good ship. While these characters are blank canvases there are a lot of interesting and compelling ways they could be written and their characters explored through romance and the like. I'm not against any of those pairings on principle I've just yet to seen one I liked and found some common similarities on the ones I really dislike I thought I'd discuss on here and see what others thought.

Any reccs?
