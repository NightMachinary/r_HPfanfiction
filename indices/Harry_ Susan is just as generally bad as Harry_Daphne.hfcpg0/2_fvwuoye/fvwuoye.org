There are some excellent Haphne fics, even though I hate the Ice Queen persona with a passion.

There are some great Harry/Susan Bones fics too, although I agree with you that her aunt is being overused.

I have yet to see a Harry/Susan fic that has them getting together AFTER Amelia Bones was murdered.
