I can't remember it now, but it was one where she took Harry there(they lived near the Weasleys) and showed the whole farm to him and explained how their family had that land for thousands of years, Harry also ended up helping there for day before someone came to pick him up.

I also remember it was one of the few where she didn't look like a supermodel but was still pretty.
