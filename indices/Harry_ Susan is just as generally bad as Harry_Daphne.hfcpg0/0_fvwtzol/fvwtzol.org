I think you're reading some pretty bad stories, but I see from where you're coming.

I don't have read too many Hary/Susan, but the two I have enjoyed had her being a regular teenager with a preference for combat because of her aunt(think of it like a good cop daughter), but that helped Harry because she had experience in leaving the "work" outside the door, thus giving a sense of normalcy he couldn't find elsewhere at the moment. Others had her personality vary, but always with more dimensions than those you've described.

As for Haphne, well, as with any pairing or even premise, your mileage may vary, yes, there are the absurd Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell ones, but I've seen many good ones that went against that notion, in one the Greengrass were farmers, and instead of a politician she was basically a farmer girl who used magic, another had her being a lawyer and another a very closed off girl that was just as introverted as Harry, so it depends on the writer.

As for Fleur, well, again, you're painting all of them with the same brush, you can find some pretty good interpretations, some of them have her being the one who teaches Harry stuff, another as his ticket out of England and to a larger world, and one of my favorites has both of them complementing each other and has Fleur's relationship with Harry making both characters develop quite a bit.

Just to be clear, I don't think it's fair to place the blame on the pairing, the blame is with the writer, you can write good stories with almost any pairing, Harry/Fleur offers quite a few opportunities for worldbuilding even, same to a lesser degree with Daphne and Susan, who can both be characterized as the writer needs it, and even keeping with the fandom perception can be interesting.

The same way as any pairing can be pretty bad too, I tire to see the Harry/Hermione ones where he's devolved to the trophy boyfriend for MarySue!Hermione who needs no one and solves everything by herself, or vice versa for Hermione being reduced to a bullied/lonely girl to be rescued by Knight!Harry, same thing for the often bland and boring Harry/Ginny.

So, yeah, stop blaming the pairing, because of their popularity(because they are different from canon) there are tons of stories made, and as the fanfiction rules state 90% of it is trash.
