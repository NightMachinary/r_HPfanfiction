I have a few rules when reading fics to try and avoid the bad ones.

-If Harry gets more than two last names, I am out(and that's just because I can tolerate Potter-Black due to acquired immunity)

-If the goblin powerup gets going for too long(/billions and billions/ of galleons that are never going to be used, more rings than the ones made by Sauron and Celembrimbor, more titles than Queen Victoria), I am out.

-TARDIS trunk? Out.

-Scarcrux removal with a commercially available ritual? Out.

-Super!Wand with three kinds of wood and seven cores? Out.

-Girls start blushing and falling head over heels at a mere glance from Harry? Out very fast.

This keeps me from getting the worse ones, because writers who use these do them right at the beginning to start their total makeover of Harry into their Edgelord SI.
