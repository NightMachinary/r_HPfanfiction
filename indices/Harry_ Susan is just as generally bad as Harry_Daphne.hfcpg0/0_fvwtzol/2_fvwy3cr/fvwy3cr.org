I agree with a lot of this. I don't blame the pairing, I blame the writers perhaps I should have been more clear. That said I can only discuss what I've seen and it seems rather common what I've criticized. I definitely think all of these pairings can be done well. Perhaps my title is more negative than my actual post? It matters not you get downvogted on here whenever you dare to discuss or criticize The Ice Queen of Slytherin, pUrEbLoOd Powerwank fics or Indy Harry or any of it's elements ðŸ˜‚
