There is nothing wrong with OC's, whether fully made up or using a underdeveloped name/face from the series.

Now doing so fails differently then fics that use established characters. When established characters are miswritten, they usually seem ooc or off. When OC's are miswritten, they feel misplaced in the greater lore.
