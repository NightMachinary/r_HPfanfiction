Perhaps but I think I've been respectful with my opinions. I used the discussion flair. I wrote this post to say my piece and see what others in the community think about what I've noticed. I'm open to hearing from people who disagree with my takeaway from such.

Also this is a subreddit for discussing fanfiction. There's nothing wrong with sharing your thoughts on HP Fanfiction whether they be positive or negative. That's part of this subs purpose. I don't think it's being picky. I like to dissect all the media I consume whether I enjoy it or not, and I know I'm not alone. It's absolutely fine to read fanfic for just entertainment and not break it down further. It's also totally fine to rant for pages about what you read as long as you aren't a jerk about it
