I mean, there's three basic parts to a story - the plot, the setting, and the characters. I would argue that writing characters is by far the most difficult of the three. So, anytime someone in fandom tries to create their own full-OC characters, or even their own interpretations/versions of any character, that's often going to turn out not as well because it's so difficult to do and so difficult for that to show in writing - there's two points of failure, the creation and the demonstration, and both are really, really hard to get right.

I've read some Daphnes and Susans that are really, really interesting characters, but equally I've read some that are dull, cardboard cutout armcandy, like you said. It's not that you can't do great things with them, it's just harder to do, so more people are going to fall short of the relatively high standards that seem prevalent in this fandom these days.
