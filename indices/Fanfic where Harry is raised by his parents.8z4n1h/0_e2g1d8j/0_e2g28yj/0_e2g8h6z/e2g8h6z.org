Harry's parents ran to Germany before Voldemort got to them and lived there for ten years before they died. Because the spell never rebounded Voldemort won the war, and isn't horrifically disfigured to boot.

Voldy has more character development than just "evil" and and kinda takes Harry under his wing. The story is about Harry's schoolyears as what is essentially the prince of Voldemorts Kingdom.
