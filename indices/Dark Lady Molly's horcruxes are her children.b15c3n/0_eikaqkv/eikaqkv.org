The Burrow was devoid of its usual bustle. No sounds echoed along its winding staircase, and no movement disturbed the vacant rooms. The ghoul in the attic had fallen silent; only the clock on the kitchen wall -- that hand-made antique, passed down through generations -- rocked in an agitated way.

There was a single hand on its face. The rest lay on the floor, twisted by magic; broken away. ‘Mortal Peril', the clock read.

And right beneath it, sprawled on the floor in a languid manner, as if he was just taking a rest, was Arthur Weasley's decapitated corpse. His widow lounged in a chair.

Just as the house around her, she was deathly still. Only the slightest incline of her chest betrayed any life within her figure. It was quiet, so quiet that time itself seemed to have paused...or maybe it was unwilling to come here, visit this house of horrors. But movement -- and life -- eventually appeared.\\
The silence was disturbed by the sound of voices, a chuckle from outside, a creak on the porch-steps, the swivel of a door. And then abruptly, silence again.

“Your father has fallen ill,” Molly Weasley uttered into the void.

Ginny and Ron cocked their heads.

There was no shock on their faces. No horror or surprise. In fact, as the laughter from their shared joke peeled away to drop like a poorly-fit mask, it became replaced by stillness. Unnatural, unseemly; a facsimile of life. Only their eyes moved.

“You will take care of him.”

“Yes, mother,” the siblings answered without pause.

“And Harry,” the Weasley matriarch continued, “is he coming tonight?”

“Fred and George are bringing him,” Ron answered.

“Then you know what to do.”

“Yes, mother.” This time, only Ginny replied. She was quickly divesting her cloak, a famished look in her eyes. Apparently captivated by the sight of her father's decapitated body, she took several careful steps forward, sliding out her tongue several times, as if tasting the air.

"This is good," she finally muttered.

"Yeah," Ron roughly grunted from her side. "Harry's thin. He can use the meat."

Lounging in her chair, Molly Weasley watched her children set to work. And then slowly, she smiled.
