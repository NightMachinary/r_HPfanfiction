Thanks for linking your story. I will admit I've seen it a few times in my searches. I personally am not a fan of Snape, and rarely read stories from his POV. I read the first chapter, and I suppose it's not quite what I expected Snape's thoughts to be. It also seems to... jump around quite fast. He's meeting Dumbledore, then he's telling Voldemort not to go to the Potters, then he's grieving Lily's death, then he's threatening Petunia, then he's reliving his childhood and his mother's death, then he's with Voldie receiving the Dark Mark... Emotionally I can trace the thread, but chronologically and geographically it's a muddle of moments and feelings.

It's also such a short chapter for how much you've tried to do with it (which is explain to the reader part of Snape's emotional journey up to the point of Harry's orphaning). Many fanfic authors can be accused of using far too many words but in your case IMHO the fic is too dense, and could benefit from more words, or maybe less exposition.

Also, most of the best fics use a hook of some sort to get a reader's attention. A novel addition to fanon, a foreshadowing of some dramatic event, etc. Your first chapter being a rehash of Snape's journey as most Harry Potter readers know it, with a few additions thrown in, is not really much of a hook.

Another thing is the blurb. I distinctly remember reading this blurb and moving on during one of my fic searches. I'm not sure what to say except that some real gems I've found by my eye being caught by an excellent blurb. One of my all time favourite fics, The Dogfather by Hollymichele, has a simple blurb of dialogue taken from the middle of the fic that pulled me in immediately. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/]])

I hope I haven't been too harsh or unfair on your fic. I can see that at ~35k words this is something you've put some effort in. On the whole I'd say it's a decent enough fanfic, but as it doesn't claim to develop towards a popular pairing, it doesn't have a fascinating hook of some sort in the first chapter, and it doesn't have a very compelling "blurb", I'm not surprised that it hasn't attracted more readers. Promoting your work would help greatly, to help prospective readers find it. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to reading what you think up next.

Edit: Trust me when I say I know that critique is much easier than creation. You've written a fic that's at least 30k words longer than any of the abandoned stubs I've tried to write.
