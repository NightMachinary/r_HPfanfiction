AO3 is the right place for all fanworks. What its not so good at is discovery, unless you're writing a popular pairing or story tag. Their version of FFN C2s, called "Collections" leaves a lot to be desired.

I'd suggest promoting your story in places that contain potential readers. Here, DLP and maybe alternatehistory or spacebattles. Would you mind linking me your story?
