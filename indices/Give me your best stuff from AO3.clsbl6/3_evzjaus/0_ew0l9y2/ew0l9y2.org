Ooh! I thought my story was just shit but turns out I've been publishing in the wrong place? Where would you say is a good platform for a story that really doesn't have a lot of sex in it (or any, to be honest), but is meant for grown-ups? I also published on FFN and it's not doing super well either, so I'm starting to think it might just be bad but then I read it and I really really don't think so.
