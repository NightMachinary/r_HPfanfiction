The HP fandom on AO3 is kind of slash central, so specifying that you don't want slash removes a huge chunk of fics from the pool. Drarry is the most popular pairing amongst AO3 HP fics by a large margin, for example. Of course your preferences are your own prerogative, and there's thousands of het and gen fics for you on the site, but I just thought you ought to know.

The fics I am linking explores the character of Harry as a child, and does quite a good job of it. Please note that Dumbledore is canonically gay, and there is some age appropriate discussion of that in this fic. I don't think that would cross the line into anyone's definition of slash, but here we are. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]])
