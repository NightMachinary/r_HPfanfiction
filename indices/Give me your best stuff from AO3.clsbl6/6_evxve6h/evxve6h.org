**EDITED to link properly Saved the post to check out the recs myself. Please check out mine! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18874543/chapters/44800099]] Snape centered, canon compliant but with a lot of extra stuff, gets dark. 3 chapters away from completion I think. Feedback welcome.

Also recommend the series "memories and dreams" by paganaidd in its enitrety - best fic ever imo. Enjoy! I'm linking to the first story in the series.
