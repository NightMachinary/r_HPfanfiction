This is definitely one of my favorites. Insanely well written. Romance is definitely a side plot.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
