  On his seventeenth birthday, Albus runs away. Years of arguing with his dad and struggling at school have worn him down, and he just wants to be free. With Delphi's mantra 'the future is mine to make' echoing in his head, he sets out to change his life, leaving everything and everyone behind.Years later, an accidental meeting with Scorpius forces him to question the new life he's built for himself. Is his life complete without his family? Was he wrong to leave Scorpius behind? Is he really any happier now than he would have been if he'd stayed? And does he truly know Delphi, the person who convinced him to walk away?
