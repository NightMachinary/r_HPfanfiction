I will definitely check out your recommendation and I really appreciate your comment! I asked for feedback, so... I can handle it not being you fawning all over my work. I thank you for making such an effort to explain.

I agree with you that chapter 1 is too dense. This being my first fic and first piece of creative writing in a long time, I also agree with you about the blurb.

It's really challenging to write something that makes sense as a standalone story but also does not bore the people who know story already. I don't know if I can start at Snape's meeting with Figg in a way that makes sense.

Thank you again!! I think I will finish the story and than rewrite and restructure it.
