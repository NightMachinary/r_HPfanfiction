I've been reading the linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) series. There are some issues with it, but I've been enjoying it overall.

A lot of stories get cross-posted so I'm not sure which of these are ao3 specific, but here are some others I like:

Linkao3(The Changeling) Linkao3(Perfectly Normal) Linkao3(World in Pieces) Linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts) Linkao3(C'est La Vie) Linkao3(The Prince of Slytherin) Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) Linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven)

Some of these are recc'ed regularly so you're probably familiar, I just went through my bookmarks and grabbed any that seemed relevant. One way to find others you like would be to click on the tag from a previous fic and sort by kudos or comments. Ex. [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Pureblood%20Politics%20(Harry%20Potter][Pureblood Politics]]/works) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marauders%20Era%20(Harry%20Potter][Marauder's Era]]/works) - you will likely have to adjust the filters to eliminate slash though, since it's quite popular.
