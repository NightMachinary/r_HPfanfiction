  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Abused!Harry fics usually cast uncle Vernon in the role of the main villain. But couldn't it have been Petunia just as well?

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Luffy disappeared a day after Sabo died. Four years later he came back with a slave brand, burned into his flesh. Whatever happened to him, made Luffy view the world differently. Follow him on his journey to become the Pirate King, the freest person in the world, as snippets of his past slowly reveal itself to his crew.(AU, stronger/more mature/darker/jaded Luffy, no romance)
