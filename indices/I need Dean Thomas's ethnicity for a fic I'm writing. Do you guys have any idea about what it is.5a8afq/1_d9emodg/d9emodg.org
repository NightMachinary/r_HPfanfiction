I am also curious as to why you need to know his specific ancestry? From the perspective of a black American, I can say that 'black' and 'Indian' are nowhere near the same thing, but maybe it's different in England? That's almost like comparing a Korean and Samoan, really. Completely and utterly different.

I can say that many ( I am not making this assumption for anyone other than the people I know personally) black people don't really know/care about what specific countries their ancestors came from. The nature of the slave trade made this pretty much impossible. So you won't get a lot of people saying "Yeah, I'm a quarter Kenyan and a quarter Ethiopian and the other half is from Botswana." We just don't do that (in America, again maybe England is different?) Maybe someone's grandmother was Jamaican and they will hold on to the connection to that culture, but that's it, really.

I personally wouldn't sweat it unless there's a major plot element tied to it. Dean Thomas is black and British, and unless your story revolves around him in a way that it's important that his family comes from X country, that should be enough. I'd say that if you're going for that angle you should really do some research into the culture you're thinking of.
