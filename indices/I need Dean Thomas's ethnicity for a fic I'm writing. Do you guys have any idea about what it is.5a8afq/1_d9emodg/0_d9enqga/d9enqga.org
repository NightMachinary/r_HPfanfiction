I /think/ OP didn't know whether Dean Thomas was black or whether he was Indian or whether he was white and just portrayed by a black actor.

That said, most black British people emigrated within the last 100 years or so (there was a huge influx post-WW2). And people who have emigrated more recently tend to identify more strongly with that culture/country, and can more easily trace their history back to a specific culture. And yes, there are definitely people who don't care or don't know, but there would be others that would be at least mildly offended for the same reason that a Vietnamese person might prefer to identify as such and enjoy a distinct culture rather than be simply consider themselves Asian.
