I can understand why OP might not have remembered if he was black in the books. If I'm remembering right, it was really only mentioned once in the first book? That was actually a great way to go about it. I hate when authors feel they have to constantly remind you that yes, this person is *insert race*.

Please, for the love of all that is good avoid this kind of descriptor:

"Hello!" the black boy greeted.

"Harry, did you finish that charms essay?" Dean asked, furrowing his chocolate-colored brow.

"I can't believe that move you made in the last Quidditch game!" Dean Thomas said, hoping that no one has recently incurred a head injury that caused them to forget that he is the token black character in this fanfiction.

End mini rant.
