Dean is dead in my story. I'm writing a scene where his long lost grandfather sees his body for the first time after realising that he has a grandson. I realise that a lot of people get really uncomfortable at the first mention of race, but the scene is from the grandfathers' perspective. Hence a short description is unavoidable.

Well, that and I am introducing his mother as a character and didn't want to get her ethnicity wrong.
