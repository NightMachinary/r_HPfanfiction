I'm afraid that my reasons aren't nearly as deep as you thought.

My story has a really long plotline about how Dean's wizard father hadn't actually died like in canon, but instead in the fight to protect his family, had been turned into a werewolf and had chosen not to return to his family out of shame. Back when I started the plotline I wrote the father as Caucasian. It was a throwaway detail back then, since race wasn't all that relevant to the story back then. Didn't think about it again.

But last night, I was writing his mother's description as Indian, I went to look up some stuff about the Thomas family, and realised that he was actually black.

For some reason, for the entire 6 years I have known this book series, I had /always/ pictured Dean as having Indian origins. Maybe its because /I'm/ Indian and Thomas is a really common surname where I live? Dunno really.

Hence my confusion and why I posted this question.

Anyways, thanks for clearing it up.
