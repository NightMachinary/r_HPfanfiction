Well, you kinda can. I don't mean arguing that the OC/spell "is" canon. But there is nothing wrong with stating "a second-year Hufflepuff called Tom Smith /could/ exist in canon for all we know", and therefore saying "Tom Smith canonically doesn't exist" wouldn't be a true statement. Same thing. I think there's a difference between things that aren't mentioned in canon but could exist between the lines (i.e. Tom Smith, the Notice-Me-Not Charms) and things that canon makes clear /do not/ exist (i.e. Wards, depleteable Magical Cores, a twin brother of Harry Potter).
