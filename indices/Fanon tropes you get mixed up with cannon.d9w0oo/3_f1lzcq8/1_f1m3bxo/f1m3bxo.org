I absolutely hate certain Dumbledore portrayals.

I've read some where he's so insane and eccentric it's cringy. Yes he's rather eccentric but alot of people forget - He's the only person able to duel Voldermort equally, he defeated Grindelwald and won a war, he is a leader.

I don't really like Harry as a character that much imo, I much prefer characters like - Tom riddle, Dumbledore and Snape. It'd be much more realistic for Harry to become a shy, introverted, bitter kid, or a sociopath but, hey what do I know. (When I mention Tom riddle, the key is TOM RIDDLE, not Voldermort)
