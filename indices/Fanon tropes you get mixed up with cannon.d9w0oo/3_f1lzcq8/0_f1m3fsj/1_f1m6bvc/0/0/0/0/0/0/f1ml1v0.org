Obviously Voldemort didn't predict that someone like Draco Malfoy would be able to find a way to get an entire group of Death Eaters into Hogwarts.

One Death Eater against Dumbledore is pretty much always an instant loss, even if they can surprise him, a group of powerful Death Eaters has a much more realistic chance to kill him.
