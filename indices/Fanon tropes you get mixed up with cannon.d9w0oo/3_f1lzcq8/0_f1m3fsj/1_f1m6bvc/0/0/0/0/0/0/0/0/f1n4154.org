Draco didn't commandeer anything, he just gave them a way to enter the castle, it was made pretty clear that he wasn't in control, he didn't even know who was going to come, the only instruction they received was that Draco was the one who was to kill Dumbledore. If anything Snape seemed to be the one who held command.
