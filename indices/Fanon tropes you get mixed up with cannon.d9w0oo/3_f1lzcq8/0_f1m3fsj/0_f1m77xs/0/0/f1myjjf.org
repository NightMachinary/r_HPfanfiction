  Gone to Dumbledore for help. Dumbledore was the one wizard Voldemort feared.

His parents die.

  Fled the country. Tracking down Karkaroff in some remote cottage is probably easier than trying to find Malfoy (with dyed hair) in NYC or Houston.

His parents die.

#+begin_quote
  Attempted to off Dumbledore directly instead of committing a bunch of war crimes. How difficult would it have been to stab him with a cursed dagger in some corridor, maybe even using the first idea as a pretence.
#+end_quote

He is immediately arrested by the Order and taken prisoner. His parents don't die. But why the fuck would he bother when he could keep working on a more intelligent solution.
