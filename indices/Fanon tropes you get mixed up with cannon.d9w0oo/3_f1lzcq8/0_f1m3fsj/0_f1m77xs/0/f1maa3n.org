Draco could have, at any time:

- Gone to Dumbledore for help. Dumbledore was the one wizard Voldemort feared.

- Fled the country. Tracking down Karkaroff in some remote cottage is probably easier than trying to find Malfoy (with dyed hair) in NYC or Houston.

- Attempted to off Dumbledore directly instead of committing a bunch of war crimes. How difficult would it have been to stab him with a cursed dagger in some corridor, maybe even using the first idea as a pretence.
