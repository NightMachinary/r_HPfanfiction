  He's all forgiving of a person he believes is a child in an impossible position.

And this "child's" life is more valuable than the lives and well being of all other students in the school for some reason? Malfoy nearly killed Katie and Ron and Dumbledore knew this and did /nothing/!

He should've confronted Malfoy, exposed him and if he wants to be "forgiving", placed him under a Fidelius. If his parents die in the bargain then /so be it/, they're in a war and they had willingly chosen Voldemort. It's better than playing with the lives of the students.
