Someone pointed out the other day that the Cruciatus Curse wasn't red and I flipped through the books and they were right. It doesn't have a color.

Certain characterizations:

*All forgiving, non-violent Dumbledore. He encourages Harry to use any spell if they're attacked in HBP and keeps Snape on a tight leash.

*Snape being kind to all his Slytherins. PS suggests he's critical of them all save for Draco.

*oblivious, pushover, "Just Harry" Harry. He takes a turn for the worst in OOTP (ugh Theodore Nott), but he notices so much between 1-4 that he can even tell Ron how to hold his arms while under polyjuice. He does what he wants, save for where Dumbledore is concerned, and "Just Harry" wasn't even about being the BWL
