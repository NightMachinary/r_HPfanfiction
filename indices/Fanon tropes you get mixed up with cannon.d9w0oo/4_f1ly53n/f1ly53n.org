A few years ago, after reading hundreds of HP stories, I myself was unsure of wether or not certain branchs of magic were canon (like blood magic, soul magic, death magic). So I looked up every spell that exists in canon, because I didn't want to use something that I didn't know where it came from. There were quite a few, like point me or hominus revelio, that I was surprised to learn were on the list.
