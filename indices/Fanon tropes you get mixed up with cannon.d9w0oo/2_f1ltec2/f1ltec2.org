*Fanon:* Wizards are either pagan or atheist, and are generally clueless about Christianity. due to the Christian church's historical involvement in prosecuting and burning witches.

*Canon:* Wizards are, at the very least, culturally Christian. They celebrate Christian holidays (Christmas, Easter), namedrop God, and have some familiarity with the Bible.

It looks like fics just use paganism for worldbuilding, and atheism to look cool, but it's not supported by canon, even if you take away canon's themes on resurrection, love, sacrifice, and forgiveness.

  ‘How do you feel, Georgie?' whispered Mrs Weasley.

  George's fingers groped for the side of his head. 'Saint-like,' he murmured.

  She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, and her daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation:

  *Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.*

  James Potter, born 27 March 1960, died 31 October 1981

  Lily Potter, born 30 January 1960, died 31 October 1981

  *The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.*

  Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. ‘“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death”...' A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. ‘Isn't that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?'

From Corinthians 15:26. Looks like our Harry skipped Sunday school.
