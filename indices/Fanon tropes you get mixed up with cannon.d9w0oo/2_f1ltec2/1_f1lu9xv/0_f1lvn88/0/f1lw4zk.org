This errors on me since I was mixing fiction with reality, but when I posted that I was considering what if they'd simply performed accidental magic and had no information about magic hence they got burned. Though that'd be rare I'd assume considering all the magic schools around the world, nevertheless sometime to consider.(Also I never checked Pottermore so whatever)

Regarding what I said about Satanists, is their anything on how magic works in Harry Potter? Part of the reason I take to fanon so much is their theories on magic, addmitedly it's rare to find good fics that explain magic but they're there regardless
