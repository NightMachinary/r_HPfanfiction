  A Satanist performs a ritual and it genuinely works, oops?
#+end_quote

Only if the Satanist is a wizard. Magic isn't about the spells, incantations, or wand-waving. It comes from inside the wizard. A muggle who grabbed a genuine wand and tried to perform a spell would fail.

  " As invariably happens when a No-Maj waves a wand, it rebelled. James was sent flying backwards across the clearing, hit a tree and was knocked out cold."

  Whether or not the witchburnings had genuine witches are up to debate
#+end_quote

They did.

#+begin_quote
  "On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises."
