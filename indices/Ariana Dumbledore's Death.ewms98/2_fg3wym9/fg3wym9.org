Of the three in canon, Gellert doesn't care, Albus blames himself, and Aberforth blames Albus and Gellert both.

Narrative wise I think confirmation that Gellert cast the spell could play out where knowing the truth from the start could possibly have pulled Albus out of his self blame. Which could have resulted in him taking a more proactive stance with Grindelwald during the war instead of waiting so long to confront him. I'd imagine those character traits would continue through his life, making him more proactive in politics as well as his headmaster duties.

Confirmation that Albus killed his sister is the least interesting to me. In Albus's mind he was responsible regardless, and knowing the truth wouldn't change much. I would imagine that without the fear of finding out the truth, since he would already know, that he would once again face Gellert sooner during the war, but that overall the result would be a more timid and passive Dumbledore.

Aberforth is the most interesting. He blames Albus for associating with Gellert, he blames Gellert for corrupting his brothers head with nonsense, and he blames them both for his sisters death. I'd imagine that confronting the truth that his spell was the fatal one would be a difficult thing for him, he'd probably blame the other two at first still for creating the situation, and have to deal with the truth later. He might either continue into obscurity at the Hogs Head or make something more of his life in trying to change. It's also possible that in the moment, with Gellert at his side, the burden of his sister gone, and Aberforth to blame, that Dumbledore would have left with Gellert after all, dramatically changing everything.
