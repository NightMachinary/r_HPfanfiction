Well firstly, thank you for inspiring me. I'm now planning out a three-thread parallel-universes story exploring this (alongside the literal [And yes, I totally counted] hundred other ideas I've got on the back-burner, so it'll be awhile 'til I start it properly) and it's looking to be a fun write.
