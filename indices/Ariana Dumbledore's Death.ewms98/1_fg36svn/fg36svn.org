I don't know about best but the worst would be Gellert. He is wholly unaffected by it, and the person who is affected the most, Albus wouldn't have to feel any guilt anymore. Rather than a complicated relationship, the story would turn into a simple good guy vs bad guy.

Albus already has heavy guilt not knowing who killed her, I think knowing for sure it was him would destroy him and bring him to his lowest point. If he doesn't die there then the only way left for him to go is up.

Aberforth may be the most complicated. First of all, he is the least likely candidate to be throwing around anything lethal. He seems to have fully blamed Albus so maybe if it was him then.... I don't know what would happen.

I think the best and my personal favorite is Arianna didn't die from any stray spell. She died because the stress caused by the fight made her Obscurus explode out violently. That way, all of them have a shared responsibility but them being human, would put blame on one of themselves.
