I think [[/u/SurbhitSrivastava][u/SurbhitSrivastava]] covered your first question pretty well, but for your second, I've personally always thought he made the names up (or chose some that had meaning to him) to add fuel to his senile, powerful wizard image.

I remember reading a fic where Harry was so feared for his power that the Ministry started imposing restrictions on him. Dumbledore has always been the same for me. The people feared that he'd turn his power on them, and so he portrays a 'grandfather' personality. A mad wizard, firmly rooted in his beliefs. All to make people think he's no danger.

Actually, now that I'm writing it down, it doesn't seem as well thought out as I thought it was. I may have to rethink this one.
