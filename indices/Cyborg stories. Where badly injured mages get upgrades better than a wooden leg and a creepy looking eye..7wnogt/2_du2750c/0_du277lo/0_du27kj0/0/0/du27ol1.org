Lol what? Electric blue is an eye color, and even if it wasn't people wear weirder contacts every day

And even at that...who cares about going out in Muggle London? That sure as hell isn't going to stop me from getting some sick-ass cybernetic implants when the day comes. If they look just like regular flesh then what even is the point?
