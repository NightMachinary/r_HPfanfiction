Canon. Black lures Snape to the Shrieking Shack, and James has to risk his life to save Snape. Snape owes a life debt and increases his hate of the Marauders even more. Lupin's illness is now less of a secret. The prank is potentially the catalyst that pushes Snape toward the Death Eaters. Potentially drives a wedge between the Marauders and makes them suspect each other during the Secret Keeper/Potter murder mess. Snape's hatred for the Marauders and Gryffindors carries over, at least in part, in him becoming a bully in turn to the students. The Snape/Marauders grudge colors the events of POA through OOTP and leads to some bad outcomes in general.
