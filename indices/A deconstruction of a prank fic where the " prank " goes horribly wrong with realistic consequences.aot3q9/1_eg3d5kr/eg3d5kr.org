  *To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.* 'Should we say something?' said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr and Mrs Montague marching inside. 'About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?' 'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently. 'Anyway,'

They did lasting mental damage to Montague, that his PARENTS showed up for him over it A WEEK LATER, and nobody gives a shit!!! Not our "heroes", not Fred or George. It's just some passing thing that they did purely because they wanted to cause chaos for Umbridge!
