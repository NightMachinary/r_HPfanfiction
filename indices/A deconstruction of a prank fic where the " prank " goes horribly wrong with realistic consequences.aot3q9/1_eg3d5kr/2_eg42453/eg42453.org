Montague willingly joined the Inquisitional Squad, voluntarily working for a woman who was working for an obviously corrupt regime and tortured students (unless Harry wore gloves and Lee Jordan for some reason also did, everyone would have seen the scars).

And given that Voldemort's return was unquestionable (Malfoy wouldn't shut up about it, the sudden smear campaigns and the Ministry trying to silence the truth), it was also clear that working for Umbridge directly helped Voldemort.

Now, Fred and George probably didn't think that far, but with the benefit of hindsight, their actions were not unreasonable for a collaborator. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEvyEM0JdSc][The Allies were quick to execute them in France for similar transgressions after all]]
