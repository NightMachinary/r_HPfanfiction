:END:

Not just the ending, but the whole latter half:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas]]) went from "kill Voldemort in decent Battle of Hogwarts" to "massive pyrrhic war involving religiously fanatical muggles and Harry/Ginny sex magic"

Oh yeah, and at the end they just say, "[[/spoiler][screw this burning, atomic wasteland of a world, we're leaving for a whole new universe]]"... with the help of the ice-cream man. The literal last line is, [[/spoiler]["With Ginny's hand in his, he stepped forwards, leaving a fractured, burning planet behind."]].
