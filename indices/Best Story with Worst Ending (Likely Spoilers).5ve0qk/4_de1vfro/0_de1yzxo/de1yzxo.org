Hahaha. I get how obnoxious the second half of that story can come across, I really do.

It was, however, quite fresh. For all that you hear about muggles vs wizards, few authors attempt to write such a conflict. I enjoyed reading about it, even though the muggle/wizard war was presented as a bit less important than the Harry/Ginny banging XD. And the last chapter was really contrived.

But, yeah, most of that stuff (one dimensional ultimate evil villains, massive amounts of H/G sex) comes with every story by Brennus. The trick is not to take it too seriously and just enjoy the trainwreck-like ride.
