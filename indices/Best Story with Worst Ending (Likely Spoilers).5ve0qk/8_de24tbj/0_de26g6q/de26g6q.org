I feel really conflicted about that story. The worldbuilding is excellent, but there's a few weak moments and the writing isn't entirely consistent in its quality.

That ending though was really dumb. I guess the author really wanted a semi-bleak conclusion and just shoe-horned it in. It just left me confused, like "Why though?". As if all the development between Book 1 and Book 3 of his trilogy didn't happen.
