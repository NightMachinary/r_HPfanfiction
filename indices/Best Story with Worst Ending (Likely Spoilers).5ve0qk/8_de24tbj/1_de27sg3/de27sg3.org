I wish i could like that story but i gave up after book 1. It had so much potential, the worldbuilding was amazing and i was really into the oppressive matriarchal society setup but i just couldn't stand the way the story dealt with prophecy, seers and fate. It felt like everything was already set up and nothing the characters did actually mattered because it was fated to be that way.

I'm not inherently against fate and prophecy; it can work if it's done well, i loved Wheel of Time for example which is pretty much the ultimate 'fuck you' to the idea of free will but it still worked; in Firebird it just never felt right to me, i'm not sure how to explain it better than that.
