linkffn(Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews) isn't that great to begin with, but its ending is simply awful.

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) is fantastic. linkffn(The Handbook of Elf Psychology) starts to wear the concept thin. But the sequel's ending is just ...odd. After a book and a half of making it clear that Harry doesn't care about wizards and tends to leave a bit of a mess behind him, everything is resolved /too/ neatly and quickly.
