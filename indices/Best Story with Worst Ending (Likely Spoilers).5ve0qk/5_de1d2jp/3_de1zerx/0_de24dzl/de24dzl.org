YMMV: it's undeniably well-written and has several great moments. I think it's almost a different premise, though: Harry's no longer a /complete/ outsider, he's just another wacky kid a Hogwarts.

Also, if you haven't done so already, I recommend checking out linkffn(Magical Relations by evansentranced) by the same author. In particular, the first few chapters and parts of fifth year feel very Rowling-esque.
