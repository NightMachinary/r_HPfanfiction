That's a good point. We're talking about a world in which a 13 year old girl is the only one who can figure out symptoms of a Basilisk and who can brew a NEWT-level potion while having one of the worst potion teachers imaginable.

A lot of things in the world make a lot more sense if you assume Wizards have some kind of brain damage (probably due to incest).
