Not sure if this counts, because they certainly aren't my favorite fics, but I enjoyed them well enough. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4753440/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Founders]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402371/1/The-Forever-Mage]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6859254/1/The-Lord-of-Light]]). The Ending to "The Lord of Light" was extremely disappointing. I think the author just has a problem with endings, seems to be a theme for all stories that I've read by them.
