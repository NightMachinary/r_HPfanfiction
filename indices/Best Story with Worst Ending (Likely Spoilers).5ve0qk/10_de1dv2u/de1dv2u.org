I don't know about best story, but there were a lot of things I liked about Harry Potter and the Final Straw. But the ending flat-out sucked. It was like the author lost interest completely but felt obligated to finish it. As quickly as possible.

And I'm not even talking about the casualties in the Battle of Hogwarts, though at least one was very upsetting, considering the plotline up to that point.
