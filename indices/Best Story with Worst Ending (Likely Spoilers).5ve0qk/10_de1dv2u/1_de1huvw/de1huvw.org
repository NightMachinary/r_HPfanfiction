  4th Year: Once again Harry is front and center for the Wizarding World's controversy. Bolstered by close friends and a surprising alliance & impugned by greasy bats and students, he reaches a breaking point. The timid, respectful knockaround is going to fight back using lessons ingrained in him by his upbringing with his "loving relatives". Dumbles/Ron bashing, Slight OOC Harry.
