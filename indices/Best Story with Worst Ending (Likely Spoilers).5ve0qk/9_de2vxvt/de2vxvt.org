Not precisely what you're asking for, but one of the stories that I enjoyed most of, then it fell short of my hopes:

linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) is one that did it for me. While the story isn't perfect, by any means, I really liked the concept and it filled one of the genre's that I enjoy (rebuilding society with members of canon). Unfortunately the stories (because this is really 3-4 short stories tied together by a loose narrative) each hit their stride of world building and then the author appears to have no idea what to do going forward so has that society collapse/get destroyed/etc. and a new one starts.
