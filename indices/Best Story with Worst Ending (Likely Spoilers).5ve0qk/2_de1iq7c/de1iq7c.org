linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) is generally beautifully done, but the ending is a bit meh. It's not awful awful, but leaves the reader unsatisfied.

In linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah) the author basically gave up on the story and was kind enough to post an epilogue which is basically an extended synopsis of how it was originally planned to develop the story. I guess we should be thankful for that instead of just plain abandonment, but darn it, I want to read a full story based on that synopsis!
