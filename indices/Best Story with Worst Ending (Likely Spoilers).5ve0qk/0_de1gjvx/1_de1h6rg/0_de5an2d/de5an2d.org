Not the person to whom you replied, but after about a third of the way in, there's a marked decrease in the quality of that fic. Like, I vividly remember following that fic from chapter one, and it was the most anticipated thing on my alerts list, but after the first year ended and we got into summer, all the characterization just started falling flat and everything was terrible.
