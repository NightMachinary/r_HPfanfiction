How far along is that in the story? 2/3 maybe? I remember it took me a few days to continue reading from that point. It made me so mad that the author built up all this cool stuff centered around the past and then abandoned it.

And it's not like it was worth it at all. The parts after the second time jump are just way too neat and tidy.
