The Second Wizarding War took a darker turn, and Harry is captured and tortured. An interaction with Bellatrix sends him back in time. Many people like this because it handles the initial aspects of time travel. Bellatrix and Harry are interesting characters to read about. Harry is competent and the plot, up to a certain point is really really good. He teams up with Bellatrix and others to bring down the Dark Lord. Basically the premise is efar would happen if Bellatrix followed Harry instead of Voldemort.
