Yup. The Potter kids were especially annoying, the whole lot of them. As was the treatment of the prophecy. I didn't like it at all that Voldemort was unable to gain any significant power after getting rid of three most powerful figures in Wizarding Politics off the bat. I mean, Old Man Malfoy was pretty damn awesome. If he could be subject to a full-blown attack, I fail to see how a lack of funding could have prevented such an attack on other high-ranking politicians who would oppose Old Voldy.
