Which is a shame because that forward in time could have been the biggest boon for the story. Right when things were starting to go a little too well for Harry, he gets flung forward and now Voldemort has years without Harry's intervention to enact his plans. But that is ok, because Harry has safe houses set up, emergency lockboxes filled with spare wands and neat portkeys, and the gold from two powerful estates.

Part 2 of that story should have been Harry and Bellatrix reviving the Order of the Phoenix and fighting a guerrilla warfare style rebellion against a Voldemort who has won, because there was no boy who lived to disembody him. Instead we get a Harry whose family is fully intact, larger than ever, and the day gets saved without breaking a sweat.
