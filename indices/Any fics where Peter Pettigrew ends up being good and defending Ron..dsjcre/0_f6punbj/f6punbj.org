But also at the same tkme, really confusing and difficult. Firstly, I don't think Harry is going to look the other way when he finds the person who basically just killed his parents. Furthermore, if we're going by it following a canon storyline somehway, then he'd want to be free of the Dursleys. So, he'd probably do his best to take Pettigrew out, so Black can be released, with him taking custody afterwards.
