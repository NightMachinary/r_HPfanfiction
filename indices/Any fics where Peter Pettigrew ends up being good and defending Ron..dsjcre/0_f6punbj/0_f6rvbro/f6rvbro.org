Idk, I can see it. A Peter who genuinely seeks redemption. Assuming he betrayed the Potters to save his own life and not because he actually supported Voldemort, I can theoretically see him having some immense growth of character with the result of him willingly turning himself in during the confrontation with Sirius and Remus in third year. Or perhaps even later when he is caring for a powerless Voldemort. Basically, what if Peter grew a spine during his time as a pet. It would be very interesting how Remus and Sirius would deal with a remorseful Peter. Would they argue for him to be kissed/executed or for leniency and life in Askaban?
