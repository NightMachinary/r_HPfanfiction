Sorry, totally my bad. I read both fandom's and was reading a worm one when I got the notification email about Stormbringer being a bad fit, so I just immediately went there.

​

For HP, that comment was likely right. Mr I'll give more second chances than I have names would NEVER allow Harry to keep such a horrific blade (worse than dementors), so either you kill Dumbledore right off the bat or it's over.

​

Potentially you could say that it eating Harry's horcrux or the diary would allow it to eat them all and get rid of the original plot right off the back. That leaves you free to go wherever you want without the stupid hunt.

I could easily see Dumbledore tossing Harry into Azkaban. Might be an interesting plot point to make the Dementors another way the various brothers of Stormbringer can manifest. Or maybe Stormblade teleports itself to Harry and he kills all the dementors with it.

​

To keep Harry from tossing it away, it is of course going to not only restore him to the health he should have, but also greatly enhanced. And maybe the basilisk still bit him, but Fawkes wouldn't heal him because the phoenix could feel the evil of the blade. Then you have a sword that would let Harry live even with the poison, but he can never let it go or he dies.

​

Just some random ramblings.

​

In any event Stormbringer has much more history and background, than something created for a movie or a MMRPG.
