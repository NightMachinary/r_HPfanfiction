At some point some removed a comment about the op's being more story friendly. That may be true because of the inherent deadliness.

However Stormbringer fits the worm story well.

Taylor is left longer in the locker and her cuts become infected or she is phased into the toxins. As she is dying Stormbringer finds her and because of her physical frailty but mental strength is reminded of Elric. Stormbringer offers to allow her to be a wielder.

Stormbringer was created to kill Chaos Gods. Zion causes conflict (chaos) to find a way to prevent heat death (again this is Chaos fighting Order) Taylor agonizes over choosing who to kill to keep her healthy but gradually builds to the level she can kill the endbringers. This would be the bulk of the story. Her moral dilemmas and hunting kill orders. If you want a lung scene then she only manages to nick him and flees before Armsmaster so she isn't charged with murder. Her guilt over that kill would haunt her, but it would also build months of health. Finally after she kills Zion we don't even need Contessa to double tap her since Stormbringer will kill her just like Elric.

Overall that probably follows to closely to Worm, like Goodkind/Tolkien. I just tossed it out there to show how similar the stories could be.
