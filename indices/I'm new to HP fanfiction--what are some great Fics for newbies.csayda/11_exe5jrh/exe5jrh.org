I'm fairly new myself, but I can suggest a couple long ones I got into.

linkffn(To Know You is to Love You by CoyoteLaughingSoftly) 500K+ words of nothing but Ron/Hermione. Takes a deep dive into the canon ship, and explores it thoroughly.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5) An AU fic where Hermione Granger is expelled for a crime she didn't commit, and she swears to get her revenge. Features a (very) slow burn Harry/Hermione, overpowered Harry Ron and Hermione, and a lot of crazy action.

linkao3(Pluto by bikelock28) A large collection of oneshots revolving around Lupin/Tonks. Jumps around the timeline a lot, but paints a full picture of their relationship. Updates still ongoing.
