One of my favorite places to check is tvtropes' fanfic recs page for Harry Potter. They split it up by type, list pairings, and give a synopsis. Just take it all with a grain of salt and remember that it's only occasionally updated.

If you don't mind trying something a bit longer, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] Is it 50 chapters long? Yes. Is it also hilarious and well worth going through all 50 chapters? Also yes. It's a bit cracky, but great fun all the same, as Harry makes a mockery of the books as we know them.
