Try The Cupboard Series by Stargon1. An incredible AU of the whole series, portrayed in a realistic way while still capturing the magic vibe of Rowling's world. It starts with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Series-1-The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][Book 1]] and then goes onwards, with a total of 6 (1/2) books. Try it, it's one the best stories I've ever read
