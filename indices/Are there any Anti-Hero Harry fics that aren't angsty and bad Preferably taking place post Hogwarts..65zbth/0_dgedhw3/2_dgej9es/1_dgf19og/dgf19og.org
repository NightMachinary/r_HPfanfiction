I agree that it may not be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to speed, but I feel that /a lot/ of fics (example, james spookie's works) rush themselves into a corner pretty fast and you are left with the sensation of "what now". This is the exact opposite here. While some things take quite a while to resolve, when they /do/ is even more amazing because of that wait.
