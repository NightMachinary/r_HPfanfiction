Imprisoned Realm starts post Hogwarts, but it has a very open-ended feeling to it due to that and it gets sort of angsty depending on who's reading it.

Forging The Sword is a popular one that gives us an Anti-Hero that is willing to sacrifice someone if needed, and suffers from a sort of identity crisis.

A while ago I would have recommended Magicks of Arcane or even Gods Amongst Men, but those fics present a style of action that I personally dislike.
