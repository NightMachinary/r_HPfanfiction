I think it is, as you say, a matter of preference. I personally like stories that stick close to canon while diverging in interesting ways, so I gravitate toward later year stories than earlier ones.

In any case, are there any stories that fulfill OP's guidelines that start earlier than my suggestion? I'm curious.
