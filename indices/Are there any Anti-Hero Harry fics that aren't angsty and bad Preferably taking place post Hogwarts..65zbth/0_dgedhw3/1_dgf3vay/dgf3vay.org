I have a problem with how inconsistent it is, really; Harry taking his role seriously before the Prophecy (4th Year) would make much more sense, especially in the context of THIS Harry, who seems to be more up for jumping in and having a go at it. I also have this odd problem with OOTP and HBP divergence stories, where I feel as if the story is purposely giving itself only 2-3 more books time frame to end the story, whereas a fresh new story or maybe an earlier divergence, creates a more open-ended feeling to it. Once, again, it's my personal preference, but I wouldn't recommend it to OP.
