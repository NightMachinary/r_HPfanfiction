I really enjoyed quite a lot of the plot of The Legacy, Dudleys subplot is freaking fantastic imo, but it is painfully wordy at times and for readers who can't deal with that it's a non starter. Normally I can hang but there were a couple times where I had to stop and take a break for a few weeks/months and I'm actually not finished at this point, I had to take another break somewhere in the low 70 chapter count.

I'm actually having a hard time remembering what it was exactly that made me bug off, but something did and the feeling is still strong. It's been more than six months since I've tried to pick it up but I get this angry/disappointed feeling whenever I see it recommended. I told myself if they started updating it again I'd give it another chance but it's nearing a year since the last update and I don't have much hope. Maybe I should reskim those chapters to see and to make my argument more tangible but it really sucks when you've invested so much time into a a fic and then something annoys you enough to make you lose interest.
