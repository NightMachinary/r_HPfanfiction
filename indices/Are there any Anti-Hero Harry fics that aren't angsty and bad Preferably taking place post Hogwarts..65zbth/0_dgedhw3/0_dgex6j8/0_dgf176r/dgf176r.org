The style is not the usual... "speed" of other fics, but perhaps that's why I liked it so much. It was refreshing to see a story that actually took its time to set the world, and the characters in place. It made the resolution of certain subplots /amazing/ due to that wait, and I feel the wait was totally worth it. It does get quite better the more you read, so if you haven't got past the first chapter, I'd definitely reccomend you give it a try!
