linkffn(The Legacy) is pretty good at handling Anti-Hero tendencies from Harry. He does what has to be done. Sometimes he threads the line of anti-villain, as well. Pairing is Harry/Daphne, superbly done. Nothing is rushed and the characters stay quite in character. Harry has a (somewhat) different personality than in canon, but /there's an actual reason for that/.
