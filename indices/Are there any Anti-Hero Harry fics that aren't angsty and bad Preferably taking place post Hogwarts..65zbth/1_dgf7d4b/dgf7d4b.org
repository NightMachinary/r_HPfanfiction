[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry was generally benevolent, but also did TONS of very nasty things, and was capable to do more. Most of the story took place after 2008.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Harry and Ginny were awful people in an awful world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): This is a time travel, and they were all highly disturbed people and killers. Lots of dark humors, especially their conversations among themselves.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): This one is a top favorite of mine, and this Harry definitely qualifies as an anti-hero by end of the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of the King Massacre]], linkffn(5998729): Only a one-shot, but he did very nefarious things later.
