This is a (very) minor plot in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels. Lucius Malfoy initially believes that Harry might be the next dark lord, although he is quickly disabused of this notion. It has some interesting consequences, namely that [[/spoiler][Lucius encourages Draco to ingratiate himself with Harry, which ends up with Draco being sorted into Gryffindor.]]
