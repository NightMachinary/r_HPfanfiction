Fanatics are inherently illogical in their beliefs, so arguing with a simple cause and effect in mind is probably not sufficient. Plus, we know very little of Bellatrix Lestrange other than her sadism, bigotry and fanaticism. Any half capable writer could insert reasons into her character, explaining why she would care for the baby that has bested her master. You can't make her act OOC, if the details you alter aren't part of her canon C. It would be OOC if she suddenly started having a neutral stand to muggleborns and would do her best to squelch her sadism.

  I mean sure yeah if you put in some retarded shit like magical cores and wandless magic and all that kind of bullshit sure and make everybody act ooc then you have a shitty story.

What has that to do with anything? When were magical cores and wandless magic ever part of this discussion?

Grey! is a known fanon concept. Using it in a request tells a somewhat experienced fanfiction reader what he'd like Harry to act like in the story. You may not be able to put people in boxes, but you can definitely put /characters/ in those. Characters are not people.
