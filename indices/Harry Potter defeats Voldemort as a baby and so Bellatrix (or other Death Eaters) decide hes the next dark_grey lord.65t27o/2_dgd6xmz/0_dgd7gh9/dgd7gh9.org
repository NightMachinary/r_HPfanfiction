Well someones got a stick up their butt. Perhaps... just perhaps... instead of acting like an idiot.. maybe explain why you think it stupid instead of just saying so.

Also, how is it stupid to think that a group of fanatics, following a leader in an almost cult-like way, many obsessed with power, might think that someone who defeated their dark lord, and is the only known survivor of a killing curse could be the next person to follow. Even if not all of them, all it would take is 1. Bellatrix for example.

In addition, yes there is such a thing as a grey lord. Grey!Harry is quite common actually. In fact, it kinda astounds me you are not aware of it and furthers the idea that you came into this without a clue.
