Hey,

Not sure if this is what your looking for, but in a fic im writing Dumbledore died in his duel against Grindewald. Tom Riddle is headmaster (He never became a Dark Lord because he saw all of the destruction Grindewald caused).

Heres the link if your interested: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11083975/5/Evelyn-Potter-and-Fates-Hand]]

Be warned though its a WIP so if your the kind of person who (like me) hates incomplete fics don't read it :p
