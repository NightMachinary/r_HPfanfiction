Afraid I don't know that one. I've read fics where Hermione ended up being not a good person, a few where she's just plain book smart but very naive about people, and some where she got called out on her overachieving nature(particularly in regards to /not/ following instructions), but I don't believe I've read one where Hermione wasn't a top student.
