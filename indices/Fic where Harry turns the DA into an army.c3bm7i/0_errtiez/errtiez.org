Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis]]) Possibly this one, I think it has a squad like theme to it but I'm not sure on that part it's been a while since I've read it. It definitely has the army part though.

Either way it's a more unique concept for a story so I would recommend at least giving it a try.
