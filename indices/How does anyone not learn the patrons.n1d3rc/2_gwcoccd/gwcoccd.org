Hogwarts is right next to a lac, why don't you learn the BubbleHead charm? You could drown!\\
Everyone is eating right next to each other in the Great Hall, why don't you always keep some antidote with you all the time? You could be poisoned!\\
Have you seen these stairs? You should totally learn the "/Arresto Momentum/" spell, unless you want to break your neck after a fall?\\
Did I either mention that one class of the core curriculum asks the students to stay next to some kind of semi sentient plants that totally want to kill them? While an option ask them to do the same thing with magical beast? And that's without even mentioning all the possible accidents that could happen in classes like Transfiguration and Potion.\\
There are a lot of arguments at Hogwarts. What if a student decided to curse you in the back?You should learn Defense!\\
Have you heard about the Unforgiveable? Do you think conjuring a slab of rock in front of the spell could stop it? Maybe I should learn it, just in case.

There are /a lot/ of possible way to die in the Magical World. And I would not even rank the Dementor Kiss in the top 10 or the most probable (or even 50). People can't protect themselves against everything and most of them are already working very hard to not fall behind with the normal classes, they can't take side projet like learning the Patronus.
