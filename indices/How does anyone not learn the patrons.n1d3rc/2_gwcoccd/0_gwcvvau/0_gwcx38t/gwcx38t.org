The only student that was "traumatised" by the dementors is Harry, who was a lot more affected by their presence due to his story. I guess some unmentionned student may also have been hit pretty hard, but the point is that they are not the norm.

For most of the student, the nearby presence of a dementor means being cold, and feeling as if you would never be happy again. Not a good sensation to have, but most of them probably felt the same thing after one potion class with Snape so it's not like there is something to worry about.
