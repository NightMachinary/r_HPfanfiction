And that's a terrible reason. Characters should do what is realistic for them to want to do, not obey the hands of an invisible puppet master who just moves them around like props on a stage. If a reader can't put themselves into the head of a character and think, "Given everything that's going on, is this something reasonable for me to do (or not do)?" and answer "Yes", then the character is badly written.

I mean, yes, you're right, the reason that nobody learned or even seemed to want to learn the Patronus charm even with Dementors around the school who had ATTACKED STUDENTS twice is clearly that JKR didn't want to write it that way. But that's the same thing as saying that she's a bad writer since that decision makes no sense whatsoever in-character. Good writers get into the head of their characters, and frequently say that the character does things that they hadn't actually intended. Bad writers treat characters the same as they do props. JKR is a bad writer.
