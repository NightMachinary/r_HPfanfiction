Wizards are generally pretty indolent people. Most of them had lived through two wars and barely bothered to learn a shield charm, which isn't described as being as difficult as the Patronus is. If they won't learn a comparatively basic shield charm, they're properly not going to bother putting in the effort to learn something described as incredibly difficult.
