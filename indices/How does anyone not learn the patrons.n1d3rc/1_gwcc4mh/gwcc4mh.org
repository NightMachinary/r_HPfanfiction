Well most of the young students (especially muggle borns and muggle raised ones) had no idea what dementors were at first or that even such a charm existed, since it's only taught much later.

I get your point that you would want to learn it, because we readers are really curious about the wizarding world but for the students it's not the same. We are reading about this amazing word with magic and spells etc, meanwhile for them it's their normal life. It's like if you were in middle school, and knew there was some nice formula in maths that would help you solve a problem, most students wouldn't bother learning it in middle school because they know they'll eventually learn it in highschool. Those for example of your grade who are in the maths club could maybe learn it since they do things more advanced in their club ( that would be Harry's case in the Harry potter books ) but the rest of your year won't really bother with it.
