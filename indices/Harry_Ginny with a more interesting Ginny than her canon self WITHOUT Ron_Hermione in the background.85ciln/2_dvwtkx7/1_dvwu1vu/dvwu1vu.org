Because she has very little "screentime" in the books and I have read far too many stories where she is just a "red haired Quidditch girl with a yearlong crush on Harry". And the few stories where she is developed all are Ron/Hermione, the single biggest reason for me to ditch stories. My suspension of disbelief can handle magic, but not that pairing after reading books 1 to 4.
