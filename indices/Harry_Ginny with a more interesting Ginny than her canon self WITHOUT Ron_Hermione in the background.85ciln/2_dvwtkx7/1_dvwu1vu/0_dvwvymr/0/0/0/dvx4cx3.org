That, and Hermione is pretty callous in book 3, she's offending people left and right. If my roommate overheard that my pet died and was just like 'ya that sucks, but at least it proves that your favorite subject is useless' I would be pretty sympathetic to another friend when Hermione turns around and is like 'my cat didn't eat your rat, but he's a prey animal so if the cat did, it's a dirty old rat anyways.'
