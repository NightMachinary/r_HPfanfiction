I just can't see them together after how Ron behaves in PoA and GoF. By the time Ron had gotten his head out of his arse, there's too much water under the bridge IMO. Stuff like Ron's actions around the Yule Ball and how he rallied public opinion against Hermione about the supposed murder of Scrabbers.
