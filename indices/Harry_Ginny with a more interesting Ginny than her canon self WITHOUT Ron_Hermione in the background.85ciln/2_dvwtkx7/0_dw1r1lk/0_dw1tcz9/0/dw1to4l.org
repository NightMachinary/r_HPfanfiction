I think I'd probably agree about the depth and character progression.

The issue for me was simply that I already knew the plot, so I wasn't pulled along by an interest in the plot. And the characters weren't engaging enough for me to read through just for them (that was also probably affected by knowing where their characters are headed as well).

Just one of those things I guess. I've found I generally tend to prefer Movie or Book dependent on which I see first.
