Well, aside from friendly adults who /do/ befriend and help my heroes (Dumbledore, Sirius, Flitwick to an extent), here's my explanation: /the situations these kids get into are goddamn crazy/, and unless they witness them firsthand, any rational adult /would/ write it off as fibs.

Here's a concrete example. Fifth-Year. Put yourself in the shoes of an average witch or wizard, one who doesn't know Dumbledore personally nor has any ideas Horcruxes are a thing. Over a decade ago a terrible tyrant died. You know for a fact that no magic can bring back the dead. And there comes this kid, raised by unsavory nonmagic sorts, this poor disturbed kid whose parents were murdered by the tyrant. And when one of his friends dies in traumatic circumstances, he claims, with /no evidence/, that the tyrant has somehow /come back to life and killed his friend/? Come now, it's all very sad, but let's be realistic, the boy has /issues/ and that's all there is to it. Give him a Mind Healer and stop yelling. What's this, you say? Some old war hero supports his claims? "Dumbledore"? What, is that decadent ruin still alive? Well, it doesn't surprise me he'd buy into it. A broken old soul, and getting on in years... war does strange things to people, have you heard of how low Mad-Eye Moody has sunk?... And he was the boy's murdered father's friend, on top of that? Oh, the situation is quite clear, my poor man, these two are mad as coots, bless their souls.

If all of this still doesn't sound reasonable, transpose this to the real world and imagine they're talking about Hitler. A pauper kid whose parents were killed in the Holocaust when he was a baby starts raving about how Hitler's resurrected and is trying to kill him and is inside his head? A centenarian veteran alone supports his claims? /What/ are you going to believe in this situation?

If you start looking for this type of explanation you can find it everywhere.
