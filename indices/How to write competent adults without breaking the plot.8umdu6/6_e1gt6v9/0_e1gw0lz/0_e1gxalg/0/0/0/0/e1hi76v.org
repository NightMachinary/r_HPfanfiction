Maybe I'm not making the distinction clear enough. I understand that the lack of a body would be public knowledge. But would the average person know that? Take, for example, climate change - the theories associated with it are public knowledge, but does the average person know those theories? That's what I'm asking - not whether something was public knowledge but whether it was something the average person would know.
