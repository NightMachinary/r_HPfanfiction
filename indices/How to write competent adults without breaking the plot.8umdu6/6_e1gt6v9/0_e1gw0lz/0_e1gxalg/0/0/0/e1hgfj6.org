What I'm saying is people clearly know what happened that night. No one but 4 people actually saw Harry but they know. Dumbledore says in Chamber of Secrets that his sources - meaning people besides him - knew for a fact that Voldemort was hiding in Albania. If there had been a body every wizard would think he was dead, but Crouch Sr. makes it clear the Ministry /knew/ Voldemort survived:

  The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of /your exiled master/, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

If there was a corpse, no one would describe Voldemort as being in exile or having present whereabouts so the lack of a body being public knowledge is almost certainly a fact. Those court cases were public (or at least covered by the press, like Skeeter).
