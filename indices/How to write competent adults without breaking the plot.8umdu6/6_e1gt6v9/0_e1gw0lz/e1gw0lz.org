So wizards are still in the running?

On a more serious note, it wouldn't quite be the Hitler situation because we are sure what went down there. The Soviets were about to storm the FÃ¼hrerbunker when he took cyanide and shot himself. There's no coming back. But Voldemort? They never found a body and the kid who was in the same room got off with a scratch. He is gone, but there is little evidence to suggest that he was dead. The Potters were there, Lily's body "survived" but Voldemort's was gone without a trace? You don't need to be a conspiracy nutjob to see the holes in there. Especially when the country's number 1 authority on Dark Lords says that he is not actually dead.
