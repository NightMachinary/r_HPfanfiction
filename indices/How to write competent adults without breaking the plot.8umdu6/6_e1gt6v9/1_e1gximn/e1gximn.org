Right, take McGonagall at the end of the first year as another example. Here you have some kids that are decent enough, but have gotten into serious trouble before - the troll, curfew. Now they come to you with more evidence that they are disobeying the rules, poking their noses into something that's not even their business, and they expect you to do everything based on a far fetched theory? What else would you expect her to do other than say "Leave it alone and go away before I decide to punish you for the rule breaking you just admitted to"
