I am pretty sure McGonagall believed them, but they didn't tell her anything she didn't already know. I mean, the only thing they told her was that someone is going to try to steal the stone(It was obvious that someone would try eventually, otherwise they would hav no reason for the protections). They didn't even say when it was supposed to happen or who they think the culprit was.
