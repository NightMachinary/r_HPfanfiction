If it got out that the ministry representative had been torturing the chosen one, the ministry would be in deep shit. Umbridge is too well-known(hated) to disappear to askaban, so McGonnagal knows that she has no choice but to obey Scrimegour- he'd be screwed if he persecuted Harry, but people wouldn't care as much for a simple muggleborn. It's a risk, but otherwise the ministry he is in charge of would fall apart.
