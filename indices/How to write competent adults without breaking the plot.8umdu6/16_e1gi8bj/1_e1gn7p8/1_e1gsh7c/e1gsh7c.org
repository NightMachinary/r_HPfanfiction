appoligism is not what happens when someone tries to show reasons as to why canon happened from another perspective. Things can be wrong, canon can be wrong, but canon can also happen for a reason, or, Harry Potter can be an unreliable narrator. There's plenty to go with, and plenty of small things which could be different or could be different than as perceived by Harry Potter.
