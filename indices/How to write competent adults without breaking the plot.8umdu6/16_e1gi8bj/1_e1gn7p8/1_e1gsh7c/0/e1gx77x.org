Right. I remember arguing with someone that even if Snape didn't have issues with Black, he still would have followed the kids into the Shrieking Shack. Any competent teacher would go to protect their students from a supposed mass murderer, that scene doesn't disappear just because Snape and Sirius get along during school.
