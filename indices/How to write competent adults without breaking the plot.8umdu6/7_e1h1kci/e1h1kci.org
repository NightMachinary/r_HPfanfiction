Large organizations like that have multiple friend groups and cliques that can and do have beef with other groups. It's a lot harder to get things done when everyone is interfering with everyone else for their own goals. To top it off, this is bureaucracy. Stupid rules, forms in triplicate, and multiple other things connecting departments means that there are hundreds of little ways for groups to interfere with the others' operation. Trust me, people in government are just as competent as anyone else, but they have a ton of shit to keep track of and it grows every day. It's very easy to get blindsided by that one vital form that you got five days ago but got buried under paperwork.

So, make them perfectly competent, but bury them in misfortune and petty grudges. Office politics are just as cut throat as legislative politics.

To extend this outside of the Ministry, CIRCUMSTANCES. They make or break a good plot. You can either make someone hold the idiot ball, or you can devise circumstances that force people to act in certain ways in certain situations.
