Can I contest point number 6 partially? Preparation,timing,strategy and luck can enable you to win against dozens death eaters. Remember most of these death eaters are not fully sane after there extended stay in Azkaban. But I agree with you about Voldemort even though Horcruxes made him wonky he still need to be competent for a good villain.
