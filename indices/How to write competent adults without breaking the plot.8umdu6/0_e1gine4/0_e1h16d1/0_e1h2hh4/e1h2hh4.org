In the DoM battle, the Death Eaters were the ones who were prepared. But of course, JKR had to let his kids heroes escape against overwhelming odds, so she had to dumb down the bad guys. "Accio Prophecy Orb" after stunning Harry is more than enough.

That's my core issue with the Series. Harry and co had too much luck, too little skills, and NO STRATEGY. JKR basically wanted a pure hearted hero who would rush into any dangerous situation without thinking. God forbid if they show political acumen, strategic cunning, and tactical ruthlessness.
