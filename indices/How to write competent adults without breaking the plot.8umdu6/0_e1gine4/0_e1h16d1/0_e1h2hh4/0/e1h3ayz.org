I am not talking about book DoM trap. A good writer can make a competent Dumbledore who can make trap after learning that Harry getting visions from Voldemort and prepping Harry with prophecy Orb to attract attention. Knowing that Voldemort is way too much attached to prophecy. It might not be successful against Voldemort himself but it just might work against his minions. Dammit Rowling made Dumbledore fool at worst who rely on too much luck in book at worst or mediocre at best.
