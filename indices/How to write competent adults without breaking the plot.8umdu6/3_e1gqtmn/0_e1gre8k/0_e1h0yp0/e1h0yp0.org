It depends on how obvious some mistakes are. I think that mistakes that are only revealed as such after the fact work better than too obviously foreshadowed failures.

Although you can't please everyone anyway - there's the "unless they suffer and fail a dozen times trying to buy milk at the supermarket, it's a Mary Sue story!!!" crowd too.
