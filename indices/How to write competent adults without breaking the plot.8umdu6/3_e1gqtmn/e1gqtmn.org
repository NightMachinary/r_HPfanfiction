Make the authority figures shaky allies or people with loyalty uncertain. If the MC doesn't trust them, their actions may cause them to leave their protection and end in some unintended result. Such as a bitter Harry that resents a competent Dumbledore (don't just use the same old edgey reasons) may rebel and their actions will have consequences, such as leaving the blood wards then allowing Voldemort to attack him.

Location of battles/conflicts is also important. Hogwarts should never be a home to conflict year after year. Lord Voldemort will not somehow manage to be incognito for back to back years in a school. This would never happen. That being said make conflict take place outside of the sphere of influence of powerful figures. (think Knockturn Alley rather than Hogsmeade)

Flaws in plans and decisions is not the same thing as incompetence. People make mistakes, just be sure that those mistakes are plausible. Dumbledore would not leave Harry unattended for 10 years. That's implausible. However Dumbledore may not realize that the wards would allow someone to collect Harry /without meaning harm to him./ That's actually a premise of a story (Blood Crest) which I can see actually happening. This is the sort of loophole or flaw in a plan that you can exploit to still allow conflict without anyone being an idiot.
