Well, there's an example of competent adults not wrecking the plot: [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. It also features very competent teenagers (with the trio far above their peers) - but that's pretty much needed if you want competent adults and Harry and Co. as heroes.

What you can't have is competent adults and average teenagers still playing a major role.
