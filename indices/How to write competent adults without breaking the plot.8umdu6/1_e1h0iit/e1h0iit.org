Bureaucracy.

You can have 100% competent adult characters who keep not being able to act because they need to get a warrant, they need to fill out this or that form, they need to first have the Suchandsuch do the Thingamajig, they need to request permission to do the whatsit... etc.

Kids are ALREADY BREAKING THE RULES, and also are "just kids" so they are not bound by the necessary bureaucracy of life that always happens because at some point SOME ASSHOLE did a thing and then they had to make a rule about that and you know what they say about nice things.

In the same vein, there is such a thing as analysis paralysis. It might be the case that you have a bunch of characters, and the adult ones KNOW that, for example, "we could just raid Malfoy's house. We could just do that, we have magic and some ability to plan heists, distract people, etc." But... if you raid Malfoy's house, then he might come after you afterwards, or the ministry might start an investigation on you, or... etc etc.

It is /perfectly reasonable/ for an adult to be like "this plan is awful and we will have no part in it" /BECAUSE/ THEY ARE COMPETENT.

The smart thing to do (most consequences you want and the least consequences you don't) and the "right"/griffindor thing to do ("fuck the consequences to me next week, we need to stop this injustice /now/") are very often incompatible in real life, and the people who adhere to the latter go against those who adhere to the former all the time.

If you want an example, look at /any/ violent revolution, and you will find a bunch of people who aren't building guillotines or shooting up government buildings, but who are "sympathetic to the cause". Whether it be the French Revolution's "constitutional monarchies are nice, let's not go crazy" people, or MLKjr's "White Moderate" idea, there are bound to be people who want whatever the goal is (the thing doesn't have to actually be good, you could use this same model with everyday blood purists vs actual deatheaters) but do not want to do something outside of the established norms of discourse to get it.

Teenagers tend to not-be those people. Teenagers are easier to radicalize and often have a lot less investment in the status quo and a much stronger need to TAKE ACTION when they are mad about something.

Adults tend to have /more to lose/ if the thing goes wrong, and the caution that brings can create plenty of conflict without them being actually incompetent or even malicious.
