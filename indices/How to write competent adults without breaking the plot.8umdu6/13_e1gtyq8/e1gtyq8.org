For 3 you just need your villains to also be smart, and have HP have a reasonable plot-reason to be involved - things only he can do, or reasonable reasons preventing information from being shared.

Or have enough adults be smart, but have blind spots out of ideology, culture, etc. that allow the plot to happen.
