I never thought this would be an issue if thought through. Like just look at real life. Yes many people mess up due to incompetency, negligence, malice and so on. But even more than that it's just an honest mistake.

So generalize this in a ways which are reasonable. So instead of Dumbledore being a total dingus and hiding the fucking Philosopher's Stone in a children's school, have him move it somewhere else but make it so that someone at Hogwarts knows where it is besides Dumbledore. That gives Voldemort a reason to come to Hogwarts that doesn't implicate Dumbledore as a buffoon.

Adults can be competent and yet mistakes allow for critical plot points to get you to the same general conclusions. It just requires a bit more thought and planning to see if it's actually plausible.
