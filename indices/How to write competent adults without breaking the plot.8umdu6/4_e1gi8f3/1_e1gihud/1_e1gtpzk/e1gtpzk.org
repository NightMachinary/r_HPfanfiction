Year 7 fic. There's an open rebellion. Show it.

What is that rebellion trying to do? Smuggle muggleborns and halfbloods into hiding or out of the country, kill Death Eaters, destabilize Voldemort's Ministry.

What are the trio trying to do? Assemble the Seven Pieces of the Fifty Pence -- er, sorry, Voldemort's Soul -- so they can murder the guy.

They have related projects, but they're doing different things.

That's assuming Dumbledore left things to the trio alone. Let's say he left it to the trio plus several adults -- let's say Sirius survived, and he and Remus and Tonks are all in on it. Six people on the hunt. This means they can do more, but it doesn't leave them so flush with personnel that they can just leave the kids somewhere safe. Give them more work, make the tasks more complex, and they'll have to use the children.
