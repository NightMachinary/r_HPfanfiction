But where's the /fun/ in that? I realize that "preteens save the world" isn't too realistic, but I don't read /Harry Potter/ fanfiction for realistic.

For one thing, we /know/ the characters as teenagers. Adult!Trio feels unavoidably, overwhelmingly /alien/ to me, like I'm reading about a completely different universe/franchise.

Second, you lose the setting of Hogwarts and the framework of the canon setup. I don't mean Stations of Canon; but unless you make it about a completely different conflict that could realistically happen after the canon books, your story about an adult!Harry will still have had him go to Hogwarts, and so you need to somehow contrive events so that /none/ of the canon plotlines you'd want to exploit in your story were resolved during his schoolyears. And then you run into the other end of the realism stick, unless it's a heavy AU, which, again, I don't really like in a fanfic because it stops feeling like HP after a point.
