And FFN/Ao3 are both heavily into disturbing slash ships. Popularity does not equal quality, even here. Cadmean Victory got recommended 164 times and a godforsaken HP/LV one 149 times. That's like Anne Frank/Adolf Hitler.

Also, 40% isn't exactly a bad quota and it gets higher the larger your sample size is.
