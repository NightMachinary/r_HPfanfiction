  But where's the fun in that? I realize that "preteens save the world" isn't too realistic, but I don't read Harry Potter fanfiction for realistic.

I beg to differ. At least on this sub, preteens and Hogwarts era fics are not popular based on the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=00][top 100 most recommended fics from 2011 to November 2017]]. Among the top ten, only 4 are focused on teens and Hogwarts.

Honestly, I'm getting really tired of Hogwarts and fighting Voldemort again and again. What I want to read is to see my favorite characters having new adventures in new worlds or settings.
