I got a counterquestion: what (in your opinion) is a "competent adult"?\\
Because, most people hold people they believe should be "competent" to higher standards than themselves.

"Competent Adults", dont necessarily need to be strong or wise. But they need the ability to make decisions. Certainly not on the spot - but as it is supposed to be: based on deduction, induction and abduction!

In my opinion a competent adult will make a decision based on a mix of evidence, gut feeling and maybe slighty based on the influence of the people is surrounded by.\\
But being adult also means, based on what people expect of you, that you live a (healthy) and well adjusted lifestyle. It begins with your haistyle and ends with proper clothing. Waking up on time, arriving at work on time, doing said job properly. Dont live over your means. Being an competent adult also means that you accept the fact that there are people more wise and knowledgeable than you. You growth with your challenges. The rules dont say that you cant have help with that. And most importantly - what makes an adult a good adult: dont be afraid of rejection or negative comments. They will improve you.

But then again, all of this only really applies if you want to fit into a society that expects all of it from you.

The main issue in Harry Potter lies with the fact that all adults aside from 1 or 2 paradigms are displayed as weakminded sheep.\\
Magic not only seems to impair logical thinking but also the ability to stand up for oneself.

I'd say, throw in a couple of backbones and stop the adult characters from taking shit.

Any adult wizard can fight back. When in mortal peril any animal or human will fight for survival. They dont necessarily need to throw around Avadas. Cleaning spells into the eyes, polishing charms in the gonads, slicing spells to the arteries.

Life aint got a happy ending.\\
Dont forget that.
