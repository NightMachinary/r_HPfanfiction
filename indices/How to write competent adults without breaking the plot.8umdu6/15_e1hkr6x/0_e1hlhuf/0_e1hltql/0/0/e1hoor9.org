The bitter truth, though, is, that family doesnt mean anything. Family is a social construct, an expectation you have of those who are blood-related to you. As we know most pureblood families are working in a way that would not be out of place in the early 18. century. Muggleborn also grew up in a household in which it was common for father and mother to have a job. They either learned their social skills from a nanny or Kindergarten (or whatever the British equivalent is).

My point is - you cannot expect the Magical World to fit in with your standards/expectations of the world.

Rowling wanted the people to be sheeple so the Hero-cliche would work out well. She wanted the Hero to suffer. And she wanted a HappyEnd. Proper Adults dont fit in that plot.
