Fair enough. Though I would have to question the standard on which Hogwarts is operating if they are supposed to look after the children for most of the year - how many teachers are there- lets say its around 15. I remember the table for teachers in the movies was quite big. 15 people to look after and teach how many? 150-300 children? I think some people did the math based on JKR interviews. Dunno, does that work out? In my school we had classes of 30 children with 1 teacher. And the teacher was near-broken after a 6h of work.

Dunno.

Genovese syndrome at work, maybe? :)
