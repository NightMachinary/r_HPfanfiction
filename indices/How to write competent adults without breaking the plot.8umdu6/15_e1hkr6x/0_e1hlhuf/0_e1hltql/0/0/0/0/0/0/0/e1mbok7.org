The most can't write about people being people.

Creating multi-dimensional believable characters is hard. Almost none of fanfiction writers can do this and very few of the professionals do this right.

Therefore this talk becomes being about author's skills. Unfortunately Rowling's are in another area. On the other hand it's very possible that if the books were about social laws they wouldn't become popular and we wouldn't have the HP world to read and talk about.
