Ah, you are labouring under the misconception that teachers in the magical world are similar to teachers in the non-magical world.

Nonmagical Teachers are no teachers because they hold a master in biology. In my country you have to undergo a specialised field of study that teaches you not only the stuff you need to know about biology (eg) but also how to teach it to children. Additionally they learn basic pedagogy. Which is not available in the magical world as it seems.

Basically teacher in the magical world are more or less adults who have excelled in their fields and have made a name for themselves.
