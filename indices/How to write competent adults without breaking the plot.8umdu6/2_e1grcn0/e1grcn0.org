Make the adults competency reflect their reputations in universe, ex. wormtail is a passable wizard who is crippled by cowardice, Molly is an extremely competent mother who is somewhat blinded by overprotectiveness of children, Lucius is a fully trained death eater but is also a political powerhouse. Checks and balances is the name of the game, if your standard adults are competent at one thing, reduce their skill in another. If your good guy's are smart enough to see through the antagonists plan, give them a better plan. If need the adults to be limited in their actions, make a literal in universe obstacle to cause it, (ie. Fudge's ministry in OotP). The way around removing the tension from the story by making the adults competent, is to make everyone else competent too, and the way around having OP characters, is to make them have both specialties and shortcomings rather than just being good at everything. If Dumbledore is an extremely powerful and old knowledgeable wizard, then give him a fucking hernia or something else related to being old as dirt to make it possible for him to weakened so younger more energetic people have to take his place when his age catches up to him.

You ask you to make competent adults without ruining the plot?

Step 1. Checks and balances.

Step 2. Give your villains a better fucking plan than something that could be concocted by a two year old.

Step 3. Profit.
