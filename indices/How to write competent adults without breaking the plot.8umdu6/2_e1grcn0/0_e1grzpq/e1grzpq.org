Also it doesn't hurt to give harry trust issues around adults to limit their ability to either help or interfere. Why trust issues you ask? Simple, every adult he knew until the age of eleven either actively abused him or failed to realize that that a skin and bones kid wearing dirty old clothes the size of tent and who was constantly picked on by his obviously more nourished cousin, might need some assistance with his living situation. In other words, he has no reason to trust anyone except Hagrid, (rescue from number 4 privet hell) and every reason to be skeptical of everyone he meets.
