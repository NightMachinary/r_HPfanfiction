One I don't see mentioned here is 'overworked'.

Dumbledore is a head of government, running a school, part of an international arm, and trying to lead a counter-terrorist organization.

The Aurors are a small police force that is no-where near equipped to handle a terrorist organization bigger than it is.

There really is only one Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts, teaching 14 classes of 16 kids each. Even only teaching class once a week that would be almost three classes a day, have each class done 3 days a week you have them having to teach 9 classes a day + grade homework.

Fudge spends his days reviewing and authorizing building permits and other government minutia. The owner of the Daily Prophet has to spend all day every day casting duplication spells to get his paper out, so he can't do editorial control.

Exploit the HP Universe's complete lack of scale.

If you really wanted to go all out, the Wars have depleted the magical population to the point where they are stretching every working hour just to keep the lights on. The magical world is surviving on the prosperity of the past, barely surviving on enchanted items and previously produced goods. They can't dedicate workers to expanding quality of life because they need everyone they can just to keep the gears turning.
