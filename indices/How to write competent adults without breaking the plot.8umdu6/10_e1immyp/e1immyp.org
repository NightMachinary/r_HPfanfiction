You should start with making adults different.

As an example you can use this thread or any other about controversial topic. Usually there're more than two people with strong different opinions and they aren't scared to express it.

Most fanfic authors show only two points in their stories: the wrong one (villains) and the correct one (heroes). The real world is more complex than that. People on the same side still have different opinions about methods, expected results, timing, planning, etc. They argue with each other and it can affect their position.

If you take such heavy topic as "Chosen One" teenager, it's guaranteed that people on the Light side will argue about his role. Some (like Molly) will insist that a war is not for children, others (like Moody) will argue that every chance should be taken.

It can be the conflict where teenagers' action can play a major role.
