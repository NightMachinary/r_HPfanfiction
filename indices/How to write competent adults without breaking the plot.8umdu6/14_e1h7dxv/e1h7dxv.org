I find that the way that the Mary Potter series by LeighaGreene does things is particularly good. The teachers are competent (or at least Snape is, and all seem slightly more competent than canon) and attempt to solve problems but due to the children/teenagers' precociousness (among other things) they end up in the midst of things anyway, and survive for reasons other than pure luck.
