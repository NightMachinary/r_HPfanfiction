There's one very very old fic on that theme, in which Harry becomes another kind of wizard and is severely persecuted because of it. Can't remember the name, the author, or anything significant, but I do remember that it was very long, had him being sent to Azkaban, meeting another person there with the same ability, escaping, returning to Hogwarts and going for the lodestone/leylines that underpin the school's magic. I think he also goes blind for a bit, not sure. There's also a nice parallel plot thread in Hogwarts, where Hermione and other try to rally for him.

Really old, really long story. I remember it fondly, if very incompletely.

Ps. The story was written long before adding Daphne as badass Slytherin came into vogue.
