I think the different sites go through shifts.

I started reading on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] but ended up moving to Ao3 because it seemed to have fewer crap postings and a distinct lack of pre-teen contributors. There were also a few mass exoduses from [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] when content was removed without warning, pissing off a lot of authors.

But over time, I'm finding more interesting work on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] again with authors who are not also posting on Ao3 so I'm shifting back over to it.
