the Island of Fire series by Esama is fantastic. HP + most of Hogwarts gets in a portkey accident at the end of the 1st task in Goblet of Fire. They end up on an island in the middle of the ocean, and then have to figure out how to survive. It isn't really very long, but it is well worth reading. And this Esama has a lot of slash stuff in the rest of his/her works, but this one is not.

i've also come to the same conclusion as you though- if you aren't gonna read the slash, AO3 isn't worth trawling through.
