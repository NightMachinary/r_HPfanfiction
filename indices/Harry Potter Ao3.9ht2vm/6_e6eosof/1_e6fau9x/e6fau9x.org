I'm partial to fics with a more sane version of Tom Riddle/Voldemort. So far I've found a few exclusive to Ao3 that are non-slash.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] - (521k+ words, frequently updated, currently starting year 5) A Slytherin!Harry WBWL fic. Has some common tropes, but very well executed. In my opinion the writing style and quality is top notch.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] - (187k+ words, frequently updated) A "Harry travels back in time to raise Tom Riddle" fic.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/36855666][Antithesis]] - (353k+ words, frequently updated) A WBWL fic with a much darker tone than the usual. Lots of Stockholm syndrome.
