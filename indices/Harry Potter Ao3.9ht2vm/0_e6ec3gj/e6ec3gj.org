Fics like supernatural, Harry Potter and Sherlock are dominated by slash on AO3. There are far more than this but I'm blanking. AO3 is kinda like the home of slash fics nowadays, considering a vast chunk of their combined fics are slash. I don't know details, but I assume another poster will fill you in. AO3 is also different in that it allows explicit material, as it does not have ads in its site. This encourages people to write their fics in more sexual detail than they would in FF.net. Which means a lot of sex. Which then means harem sex. There's always a chance that those kind of fics will be purged on FF.net so they put it on AO3. That's my take on it anyways. You'll probably get a more informed response later on.
