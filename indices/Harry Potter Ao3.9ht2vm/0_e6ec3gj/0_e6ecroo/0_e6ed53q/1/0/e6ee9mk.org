Not even just advertisers! AO3 exists to be a place where fic writers can put whatever they want, basically. There used to be a huge problem with the TOS on sites (LiveJournal, FFN, etc.) getting changed with no warning that ended up with a bunch of fics and accounts getting deleted - usually because of slash.

On AO3, readers are expected to police what they read, instead of the site policing what anyone writes.
