Ao3 accepts content that ffn doesn't (mainly, explicit sex). That creates a different type of writer and attracts a different type of reader to the site. Even if sex is not what the reader wanted in the first place, the fact that there is more sex means that there is more shipping, and most shipping is M/M (the reason for this is a whole other story), which leads to an increase of non-explicit slash as well. The fandom, realising the differences between the content of both sites, will post/read stories in each site accordingly, so that divide gets bigger and bigger.

Is my theory, anyway.

Also you should know Ao3 can now filter /out/ tags, which is ridiculously convenient and might help you with your problem.
