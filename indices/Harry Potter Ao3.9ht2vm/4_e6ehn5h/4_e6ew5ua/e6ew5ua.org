Don't know specifically what you like but some of these are pretty popular in the fandom.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2854958/chapters/6399425][Our Choices Seal Our Fate]] by DolorousEdditor: This is my personal favorite fic of any fandom. It's just short of 582k words long and the premise has Rhaegar winning the Battle of the Trident. The fic mostly follows the Starks (primarily Jon) and has lots of things going on. Some of the things include pretty much all three factions of Rhaegar's children disliking the others (Aegon/Rhaenys vs Jon vs Joffrey/Myrcella/Tommen), Robert wanting revenge after his defeat, and the Others returning. Not going to say how the things unfold of course. The only problem is that it hasn't been updated in about 2 years.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4005610/chapters/8998063][Kingdoms at War]] by Deathwalker: This is my second favorite at 666k words long. It involves Ned managing to escape and has Robb wedding Margaery instead. We see how those two events change the War of the Five Kings making it pretty Stark-centric. Gets about one or two updates a year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9430127/chapters/21341330#workskin][A Song for Dragons]] by Doublehex: Another favorite of course (413k words). Has Jon not joining the Night's Watch but heading to Essos instead. He gets roped into joining Daenerys' entourage where they eventually become lovers along with any complications that would arise from their relationship. Has lots of worldbuilding; used to be updated every 1-2 months but now gets updated whenever the author is able to (6+ months usually).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8425864/chapters/19306879][Valar Botis (All Men Must Endure)]] by sanva: At 169k words, it pretty much features an immortal Jon. Every time he dies he retains his memories and gets sent back in time to the moment where he finds Ghost. We follow his current life. Don't know much about the update status but the writer is working on the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10838280/chapters/24058194][When the Snake Bites]] by Avery_Fontaine: This is a shorter fic at 52k words that features a world where Rhaegar defeated Robert at the Trident. Even though Rhaegar won there are still houses who despise House Targaryen. In order to avoid having them use Jon as a figurehead of rebellion, Rhaegar marries Jon off to Arianne hoping to isolate him in Dorne to prevent any rebellion. However, this Arianne is just as ambitious as her canon self. Still updates occasionally.

I had a couple of more I wanted to put but my descriptions are making this post long enough as it is. I'm recommending these because these are pretty popular so chances are you'll like at least one of them (hopefully).
