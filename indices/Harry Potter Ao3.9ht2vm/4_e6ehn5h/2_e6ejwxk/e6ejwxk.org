It depends on what you want, a certain character as the lead, something shippy, story based, crack, AU, etc... sadly there's no DLP for asoiaf.

I'd start by checking out the Ao3 which has like 20k more than GoT and asoiaf combined on ffn and look for yourself. I'm probably not the best person to ask cuz I discount a fair amount of fics because I just really dislike the idea of certain pairings like Jon/Sansa, Arya/Gendry, and Jaime/Brienne, well not so much this one I just don't care to read a whole fic about it.

I read a really interesting take on jon/dany a couple of weeks ago, that's 250k, still being updated, and the writing is pretty good. It is extremely slow burn tho the story starts with dany being born. I believe Jon is like 12-13 right now, but it is speeding up.
