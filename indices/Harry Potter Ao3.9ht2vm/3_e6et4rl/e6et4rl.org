AO3 was created specifically as a haven for people whose works were being deleted from the other popular sites at the time because they were "obscene" (sexually explicit, slash). It was the safe space for LGBT-centered stories, especially those involving sex. So you're basically going into a site that was created for slash fic and getting frustrated that there's so much slash fic.
