Different fandoms have different activity levels on AO3 vs FFN. Some fandoms are more active on one, some on the other. ASOIAF likely has a larger presence on AO3 because the nature of the canon means there's a high likelihood of explicit sexual content and graphic violence in the fic, which would be riskier to post on FFN due to its content restrictions. FFN also forbids fics by certain authors like Anne Rice known to dislike fanfic and while GRRM isn't on the list, he is on record as disliking fanfic, so some fan authors may consider it too risky to post on FFN in case their policy changes, which may be another reason for the difference.

Harry Potter, on the other hand, had a huge presence on FFN for years before AO3 even existed, so it has an enormous archive going back ~20 years with hundreds of thousands of fics to attract both new and longtime fans. Many of the HP fans who left FFN and moved to AO3 were people whose fics were deleted in the FFN purges of sexually explicit content, so that's part of the reason there's such a high percentage of explicit fics on AO3. The founder of AO3 was also an HP slash fan (mostly Harry/Draco), so many of the early users were her friends and followers, which naturally included a high percentage of HP slash fans (self included, though Remus/Sirius was my OTP), so that's another reason there's so much slash on AO3.
