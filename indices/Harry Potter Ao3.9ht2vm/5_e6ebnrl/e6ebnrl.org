Well, archive is rather infamous for the amounts of slash and outright sexual content. It's basically the adult version of FFN after they did a purge on that type of content a couple of years ago.

You have to keep in mind that most of these authors either have absurd ideas how gay relationships work (I mean, I am not gay, but I am pretty sure that gay people do not behave like in the average slashfic). They basically ship the actors or go by the logic that if one man is hot, two are even better (which is the appeal of lesbian porn to guys after all).
