Harry Potter Era to 1st War:

The Second String. This is the best time travel story. It has adventure, suspense, drama, heartbreak, humour, everything I adored it. Harry doesn't meet his parents, he fights in the war for his own reasons. It's a wonderfully unique story 10/10. linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Timely Errors. This is also a good time! There's a lot of tension between Harry and the Marauders that was new and fun to read. Bit different. A good story, especially since Harry has a suspicious amount of experience with Unforgivables that make him interesting. 8/10. linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe)
