Thank you, those are great questions! Some of these I've actually thought about, but definitely not as in depth. I hope these answers help. I will read the fic, thanks for the recommendation!

I was thinking along the lines of her not taking Harry because Harry Potter, but because she has a heart under those golden teeth. Maybe taking him along on her field trips under glamours/compelling spells, because people are quicker to trust her when she's nice to a kid, and they're not careful around Harry, because what would the kid do? Because of her weakness, and her ending up liking him, I imagine she'd try and not write about him unless she absolutely has too (in case of the Triwizarding Tournament) to not lose her credibility as a journalist. Even then, she'd only make up rumours that would not alienate him from his peers. As for Sirius, I think Rita would be an extraordinarily good help raising questions about his non-existing trial. Dumbledore, maybe because Rita bought Arabella Figg, does not realise Harry is in Rita's custody for a long while, and when he finally realises who is responsible for the columns in WitchWeekly and the annoyingly accurate articles she has written, he realises that a) the blood wards are already done for and b) Harry is happy at Rita's. I think Dumbledore would hope that Harry would temper her vitriol and Rita would make a good home, even though unconventional, for Harry.
