This gave a lot for me to think about, and I definitely need to think it over more. I really liked Skeeter as an intriguing character, which is why the idea popped in my head. Needing her to be out of character does seem unavoidable at this point, which is painful to admit. Was Rita Skeeter always this awful? Evidence does seem to point in this direction, she wrote /Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?/ quite early on. However, JK Rowling did make her an incredibly flat character, as she is basically the personification of the Daily Mail.

  Intrepid investigator, Rita Skeeter, on the hunt for a story: Harry with the Dursleys is a story. He's with MUGGLES. They're mistreating him. BOOM. I can see literally NO way that she wouldn't write that story. It's juicy, it incriminates Dumbledore, and she can morally justify it because by calling attention to it, it can be fixed. Headlines. Dumbledore doesn't remove him? Boom. More story. Dumbledore does move him to live with wizards? That's a story too. Dig up dirt on them.

Keep in mind, though, that at this point (post-bellum), she has little to gain from discrediting Dumbledore, and would risk losing her fan base by going against the grain so much. She'd arrive at the office with this story, her boss would probably get a heart attack, if he even believed her. /Now don't be ridiculous, Rita, my girl. First you try to print th--that awfullly RUBBISH article about Henrietta, now you are trying to spread these lies about Dumbledore! If he really was not capable of caring for children, he wouldn't be headmaster, now would he? I think I've been giving you too much liberties, but enough is enough. This was your second chance, but the next will be your last. If I hear you even whispering all this nonsense about the Potter boy in the next CENTURY you'll be writing garden articles until the end of time!/

You are right though, Skeeter would never take Harry in without a thought. She has proven that she's not above kidnapping him for a while though. What if she lured him by promising him an ice cream, hoping to obliviate his aunt and uncle, if they even missed him, afterwards, only to discover that the Dursleys decided to celebrate his running away by taking a spontaneous holiday?

Now she's stuck with the brat, because he doesn't want to leave her side, without a story, because her publisher doesn't believe her, and on her last warning.

She has no choice but to take him in, and his willingness to help out in the household and his interest in drama (both a product of Petunia's upbringing) endear him to her.
