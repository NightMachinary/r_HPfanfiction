I suspect that you're starting to have to take her very out of character to make this happen. Okay, so she has a heart? Great. But it's not on her sleeve. She doesn't care about upsetting Harry when he's 14, which is still a child. She doesn't care about unleashing horrific misogynistic/slut shaming attacks on Hermione. If she cares, it will be eventually, not immediately.

I appreciate that at this point, it's just incompatible head canons, but it strikes me that you're going out of your way to avoid putting conflict in your story, which will make it less interesting.

Intrepid investigator, Rita Skeeter, on the hunt for a story: Harry with the Dursleys is a story. He's with MUGGLES. They're mistreating him. BOOM. I can see literally NO way that she wouldn't write that story. It's juicy, it incriminates Dumbledore, and she can morally justify it because by calling attention to it, it can be fixed. Headlines. Dumbledore doesn't remove him? Boom. More story. Dumbledore does move him to live with wizards? That's a story too. Dig up dirt on them.

I don't see the point that it goes from "This is a terrible thing to do to a child, and consequently, a great story!" to "I must raise him myself, it is the only way!". I did not see anything in her that indicated that she would keep him rather than leveraging him with say, the Malfoys or Fudge.

I definitely could see the things you describe happening if it was just a kid, but not The Boy Who Lived. Harry is just too valuable a scoop for that. (Although I suppose the way around that is for Dumbledore to disguise him and his scar, and her to notice he's a magical child and nothing more. If you manage to keep his name hidden from her, and they both learn who he is when he starts Hogwarts, she'd have the requisite affection in place.)
