A similar thing is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obligate!]] which has Harry adopted by Lockhart.

I think he'd probably be Slytherin, largely because Rita Skeeter seems to very much shill for the pureblood/high ranking establishment types, and is very anti-Dumbledore. The hat wanted him there, and without Hagrid telling him it's a house for dark wizards, and Malfoy annoying him, he might have been there.

Here's my question:

How do you get around the fact that Harry has no value to Rita if he's not Harry Potter, that continued access lowers his value as an asset, and that Dumbledore, the Ministry, Sirius Black and pretty much everyone will want her not to have Harry?

So if she hides his identity, fine, they won't take him away, but she also can't write about him. If she writes about him, they know she has access to him. All they need to do then is get her and interrogate her until she returns Harry, because it's kidnapping. Also, if she doesn't let him out, he's not doing anything she can write about, she can't use him to get high level access.
