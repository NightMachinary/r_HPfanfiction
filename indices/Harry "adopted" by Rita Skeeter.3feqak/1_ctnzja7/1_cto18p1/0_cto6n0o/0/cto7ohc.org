I meant him feeling personally responsible for people, but yes, he is very impulsive too. As for Snape, I think it's also that he's an adult now, since he didn't seem very into saving people when he was young, at least not in the small tads we know about his teenage years. Very impulsive as well though, I feel like there's a pattern there...
