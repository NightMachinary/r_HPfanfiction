Given how unscrupulous Rita Skeeter could be when it comes to obtaining gossip, she strikes me as someone who's not too worried about morality or "looking good". That attitude would probably rub off on Harry, too.

The only reason Harry rejected Slytherin in canon was because he didn't like the whole "only dark wizards go to Slytherin" image that came with the house. But with Skeeter raising him, Harry would probably be just as unscrupulous as she is and not care that much about good vs bad, especially if Skeeter taught him to snoop and stuff for her.

So, my guess is Harry would've chosen Slytherin. Besides, a cunning journalist gets far more juicy gossip than a straight-laced, blundering Gryffindor.
