True that, thank you! I think I'm just so caught up in the whole Slytherin vs. Gryffindor thing sometimes that I just skip the other houses completely.

[[/u/BabyBringMeToast][u/BabyBringMeToast]] pointed out linkffn(When In Doubt, Obligate!) down the thread, which has Lockhart adopting Harry. I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, but it might be something to your taste as well. I'm definitely planning on writing it, but I'll try to figure out the general lines first so I have a solid foundation on which to build.

EDIT: oops, that didn't go quite as planned, here is the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][link]]
