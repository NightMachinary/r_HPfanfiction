Ravenclaws are driven by a desire for more knowledge. Hence Luna. I feel like your harry would most likely be a Ravenclaw. Unless, for example, his desire for more knowledge stems from something else, such as more power/prestige/fame/desire to help family.

In which case he wouldn't be a Ravenclaw at all, and would be a Slytherin.

However, ultimately everyone has some trait of all four houses. It just depends on which traits define you. Everyone is loyal to their friends. But do you believe in hard work, and does that work, passion, and determination define you? Then you are a Hufflepuff. Do you desire knowledge for knowledge's sake? Ravenclaw. Are you driven by ambition, and are you cunning and ruthless enough to do what it takes for your ambition? Slytherin. Courage is knowing your fears, and being able to overcome them. Bravery is being able to deal with ambiguity. Are either of these your strongest suit? Griffindor.

A reporter/investigator! Harry would have to exemplify all of these. Not being afraid to dig up facts. Having the work ethic to find necessary information, sometimes looking through dusty age-old records. Wanting to seek information for the sake of having that information. Having the ambition and resourcefulness to find that information in the first place. It is easy to justify every house; difficult to justify one single house.

I really love the idea though, let me know if you find one/feel like writing it.
