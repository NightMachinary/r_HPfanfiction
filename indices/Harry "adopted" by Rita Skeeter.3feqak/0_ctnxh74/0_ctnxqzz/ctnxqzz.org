Hmm I had never quite looked at Ravenclaws like that! I always feel that they're more like Hermione, very book smart, but not very bothered about the social going-ons. Ravenclaws are quite neutral though, which obviously would enable Harry's agenda. They can be friends with Gryffindors, solely because they're not Slytherins; they're friends with Slytherins, because they're the only House that's not filled with idiots from their POV; they'd be friends with Hufflepuffs, because Hufflepuffs would be friends with everyone but Slytherins.

On the one hand I can see Hufflepuffs being gossips, on the other hand they'd be so loyal that they wouldn't tell secrets. As for being in Hufflepuff because no one will suspect a thing, I don't think that is quite within the planning capabilities of an eleven year old. Might be Rita's idea, but I like to think she lets him do his things. I also have a bit more faith in the Hat's ability to see through such schemes and just put the kid directly into Slytherin.
