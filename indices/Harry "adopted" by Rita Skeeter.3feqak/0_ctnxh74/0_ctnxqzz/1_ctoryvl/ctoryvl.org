I also thought Ravenclaw right away, just because reporters do so much research and it's from the desire for knowledge. However, I feel Rita is extremely ambitious, and so might Harry be after being raised by her. I also feel that Rita might care enough about manipulating public opinion that she'd tell Harry to avoid Slytherin, leading to another Sorting Hat scene where Harry is going "not Slytherin, anywhere but Slytherin!" to the Hat.

But then. There's Harry speaking Parceltongue to deal with. If Rita has had him since he was seven, she will find this out. And it will be a huge dilemma for her. What a news story, Harry Potter is a Parcelmouth! But he's also her son and she doesn't want people to think of him as a dark wizard, and she ultimately decides not to write it and not to tell anyone. But she'll know that if Harry goes into Slytherin there might be things he could learn there as a Parcelmouth that no one else could learn. So should she advise him to try to get into Slytherin?

Maybe she advises him not to get into Slytherin, but later helps him sneak in to their dungeons. She could hear the password in her beetle form. Oh! Would she help him become an animagus? She'd have no moral problem with doing it early and keeping it from the Ministry, I think, and she knows how useful it is.

Okay, so Rita knows the importance of public opinion, so she advises Harry to avoid Slytherin (unless /she/ was a Slytherin and she has a fondness for her old house and wants Harry to be in it for that reason, hmmm... but anyway) But she also knows how influential Slytherins can be in later life, and knows of the Slytherin-Gryffindor feud. So maybe she counsels Harry to avoid Gryffindor also, so as not to piss off anyone important? Actually I'm betting she tells Harry all the people in his year (and outside his year!) to make friends with right away, like Draco Malfoy and Susan Bones, people with important parents.

That's why I see him in Ravenclaw, but he'd be much more outgoing and... networking, involved with people, than the average Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw can take the oddies, though. It's like Luna Lovegood, she's into knowledge, but not the same knowledge as her housemates, she is into all those imaginary creatures and conspiracy theories, so even though she belongs in RC for her thirst for knowledge, she suffers for it. Maybe Harry's housemates would also hide his things to torment him when he pissed them off by not acting like a proper Ravenclaw. For instance, maybe his grades aren't the best because he cares more about gossip, and he's bringing the house average or reputation down.
