Although Rita seems quite ambitious, I think that she seems to thrive on the uncovering of secrets rather than getting higher up. Now I've thought about it, it wouldn't surprise me if she has been a Ravenclaw.

I hadn't given much thought about Rita finding out him being a Parselmouth, but I would think she'd be 1) scared 2)excited because of the snoop 3)reluctant to release the information anyway and lastly, 4) interested in the possibilities of using snakes as sources. However, she'd probably find out that snakes are still snakes, and do not care for much for humans and their petty squabbles.

She'd definitely want him to be in a house where he could get information for her, but he's still an eleven year old kid, and his own person. Also, I believe the Hat is smart enough to see through that within a few seconds. So she might push for a certain house, but in the end Harry is going to be where he needs to be, which might very well be Ravenclaw indeed.
