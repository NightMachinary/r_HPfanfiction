Draco doesn't stand a chance. He's never shown doing anything particularly impressive. His use of the Imperious curse on Rosmerta in half blood prince without anyone noticing is probably the best we see, but that's not that impressive and not until he's had some tutoring from Bellatrix. He gets soundly thrashed in almost every conflict with the trio and ends up a coward having to be saved by them.
