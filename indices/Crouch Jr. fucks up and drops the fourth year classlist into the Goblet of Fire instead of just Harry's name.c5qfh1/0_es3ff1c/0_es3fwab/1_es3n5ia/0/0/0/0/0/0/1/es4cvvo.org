Yes, but you get that active sort of plot, rather than passively reacting. The patronus is kinda a boring spell, but he showed initiative. And the spell at that point was difficult for schoolchildren to learn, before it was retconned away.

I can't help myself, that's hilarious. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms][Especially with this trope.]]

He doesn't do much for spellcasting except in book 3, where he actually does better than Hermione in an obstacle course final exam for DADA. Granted Hermione failed at McGonagall telling her she failed (neurotic much), but still.

In all honesty compared to someone like Snape, who invented spells and altered potions in school, everyone in Harry's class is lacking.
