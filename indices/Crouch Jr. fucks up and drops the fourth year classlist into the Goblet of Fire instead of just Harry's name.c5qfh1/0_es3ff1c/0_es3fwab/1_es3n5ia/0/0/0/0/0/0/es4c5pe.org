Okay, book 1 Harry stuck his wand in a troll's nose and grabs a guy's neck with his love-napalm hands.

Book 2 Harry doesn't really get into much in the way of fights except sticking a sword into a snake and a snake tooth into a book.

Book 3 Harry, well he pranks while invisible and points his wand, and casts a spell that needs emotional maturity or something.
