  In all honesty compared to someone like Snape, who invented spells and altered potions in school, everyone in Harry's class is lacking.

That was something I noticed even after OotP but especially after HBP when you compare them with Snape's year. They've got 'OWLs were so easy I didn't need to study' James and Sirius who along with Peter became animagi, with Remus, they make a map of Hogwarts /that tracks students' identities and movements,/ PotionsGenius!Snape, and Lily who was supposed to be amazing at charms and that year's version of Hermione (or was that last part fanon?) Entering class of '91 just has Hermione as the academic talent.
