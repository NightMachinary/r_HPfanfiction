Book 1-3 Harry was great, but then Rowling decided to make him the average guy apparently.

He is the only uninjured party in the Order of the Phoenix and almost kills Draco in a bathroom. He doesn't really get a lot of showings does he?

Hermione in canon really doesn't do well without planning. It's actually one of my favorite character flaws. Harry meanwhile lucks into every situation.

For the best champion, Harry definitely fits the bill. He might even have fit the bill compared to the Cedric (not skill or anything, just the most entertainment I suppose. And Harry is more well-known).

I read a fic where it was the person who would provide the best show being chosen by the Goblet.
