I read a story with a plot very similar to this. I think it involved time travel or something. Anyway, Harry adds a bunch of names to the Goblet including Snape, Dumbledore and at least one of the Crouches and Tom Riddle. There is also a first year who shares the same name as a ministry official who ticked Harry off, so the goblet picks the first year. Deal is that not fullfilling the magical contract that you entered when your name was put into the goblet makes you loose your magic, so there is plenty of mayhem happening at the weighing of the wands.
