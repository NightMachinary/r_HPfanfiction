That depends entirely of the goals of the plan. Every thing about Voldemort down to his nom de guerre (which despite fanfics mocking it over the years means "Flight from Death" in the sense of "Flight /of/ Death" like William of Occam) shows that he feeds on fear. And pulling off a (seemingly) ludicrous kidnapping that everyone would believe to be impossible can instill that fear as an opening move of his return. Or to put it another way, this section from The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity

  Still, this is not nearly as farfetched as my gut seems to think it is. I've been using the one lesson Voldemort really taught me, even if doing so was wholly unintentionally on his part; Play Big.

   

  Most people don't try to play in the big leagues because they're scared by the level of competition, or perhaps the higher stakes. And the one thing I learned from Voldemort is that when playing at the top, there is in truth far less competition, and doing things that are impossible is surprisingly straightforward.

   

  All it takes is balls.

   

  When I was fourteen I was kidnapped during an International Event, the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I was taken from a super-high security area, right under the nose of thousands of spectators, the entire British Auror Office, and the protection of Albus Dumbledore.

   

  An individual who, despite my personal feelings toward the man, is nobody's fool.

   

  Not only that but we were under the wards of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an impenetrable fortress, whose wards cannot be bypassed by any save the Headmaster himself. Well, strictly speaking there are workarounds, such as a Founder's Ring which must be specifically blocked, but none of them were used in the kidnapping.

   

  To add further complexity, the kidnapping had to happen on a specific date; the 24th of June, three days after mid-summer. This was necessary for a Ritual as it was the optimal date for rebirth.

   

  So from a planning perspective most people would say it too much of a challenge, and come up with an easier plan. This is fine. Easier plans are best. He could have found an easier target. He could have used a Ritual with a broader date range, and then ordered one of his people wait for an opportunistic moment and throw a portkey at me or something.

   

  But doing it that way lacks, zazz.

   

  It doesn't have the same impact, or air of impossibility which strikes fear into your enemies and leaves the ignorant masses gaping in awe.

   

  So you stop and think; okay, if I was me, how would I go about a totally unfeasible kidnapping? How difficult would it actually be?

   

  It helps that his minion's father was Head of Cooperation, and directly involved in the Tournament. Bam, Imperius Curse. You now have someone in authority that can nudge the schedule and have the third task on your required Ritual date. You do this months in advance of when it happens, so nobody will even notice anything has been changed at all.

   

  Next step is to get your target into the competition, hard. And have your target win said competition, harder.

  [....]

  Getting the target into the competition was the only part Barty had to achieve which was really necessary to the plan. Cheating to help me was nice, but fuck it I'm Harry Potter, I was always going to win anyway, it is who I am. And anyone with the 'Power to Vanquish' our chessmaster was clearly going to win a competition against bloody school kids.

  The winner of the Tournament is portkeyed to the centre stage to be named Champion, therefore the Trophy-Portkey is exempt from the impenetrable fortresses wards. Modifying the destination is so laughably easy that all it would have taken had both Barty Jr. and Barty Sr. been killed, was sending Wormtail to do it the night before.

   

  So the impossibility of kidnapping someone in the middle of an International Event actually only rests on two things, Bartemius Crouch Sr. being under the Imperius, and getting the target's name to come out of the Goblet of Fire.

   

  Doing it that way has zazz. There is no doubting that. All it takes it the balls to try something that most would write off as ludicrously impossible.
