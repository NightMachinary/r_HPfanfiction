Oh my turn to play the French man.

So while "Voldemort" could potentially be translated by "Flight From Death" in Shitty French, "Vol" could also be translated by Rob/Steal, which seem to fit more his name considering the whole "I am Immortal" ego trip. Don't know why most people use "Flight From Death" though
