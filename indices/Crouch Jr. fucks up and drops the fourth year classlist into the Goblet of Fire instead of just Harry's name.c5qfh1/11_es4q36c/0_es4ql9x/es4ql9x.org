Well,this wouldn't be a serious fic and would be more crack. I personally envisioned it as Crouch's student list is on a small piece of parchment with the names being so close together it sorta confuses the Goblet into thinking it's one long name .And he also would put the class list in by accident (Moody's eye is messing with his vision so he accidentally writes the fake school name onto it as well)
