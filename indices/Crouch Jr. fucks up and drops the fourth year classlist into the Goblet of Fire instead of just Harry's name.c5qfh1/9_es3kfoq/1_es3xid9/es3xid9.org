No, it would not be easier. Crouch's method is simply adding to what is already there. Convincing the Goblet to choose Harry as Hogwarts' champion would mean interfering with the core enchantment and primary function of the Goblet.

Not only would that enchantment be extremely protected, it would be difficult to change and it would be catastrophic if it was done wrong.

The Goblet is a complicated piece of magic. Even Dumbledore didn't mess with the Goblet's enchantments, to enforce the age requirements, instead relying on the Age Line.

In order to change the Hogwarts champion, Moody would have to study the Goblet intensely, and figure out how the enchantment works, then override that enchantment to get his results. Depending on how the Goblet is enchanted or programmed, the Goblet could be running the same evaluation spell/process for each school, meaning if he changed the Hogwarts process, he could also be changing the other school's processes as well.

Instead of changing the process itself, Crouch changed the number of times the Goblet ran the process, which means the Goblet is using its own magic to select Harry as champion.

Crouch's method is actually far easier, quicker, and less intrusive than the alternative.
