There's a oneshot I can't seem to find anymore, where Harry figures out how to conjure food with correct flavor (which had previously been thought impossible), and a few girls who are present when he demonstrates this decide they're going to "share" him between them. It was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and the title was something like "what witches really want" (though don't rely too heavily on that exact wording if you try to find it).
