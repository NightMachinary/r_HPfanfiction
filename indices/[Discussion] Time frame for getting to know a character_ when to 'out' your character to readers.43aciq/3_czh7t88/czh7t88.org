One thing is be sure to consider is how the Wizarding community would react, and start from there. Does your story suggest that homophobia would be an issue? Or would it be minimal and perhaps non-existent, similar to how racism based on skin color is, as far as we know? I think that might be a good starting point. Sure, you may have the odd character that's wildly against homosexuality, but I think if you decide how the community as a whole should react, you'll have a better idea of where each character should go. Hope this helps!
