You're very right, [[/u/mossenmeisje]] pointed out that Dumbledore was gay, and I think that that'll have an impact on how this plays out. It's not something that the character (Malcolm) has ever had to think about, but in my story I've implied that while Britain has it's wizarding prejudices, and a little bit of sexism (it's old school, and I've always felt that there were less women, but that may just be the Weasleys!) America in the story has things like racism and (assumed) homophobia. I think this story is going to be less homophobic, if only to enhance that the sexuality of any of the characters isn't the point, their relationships with each other are a big point though. I'll have to balance that out.

Thanks a lot!
