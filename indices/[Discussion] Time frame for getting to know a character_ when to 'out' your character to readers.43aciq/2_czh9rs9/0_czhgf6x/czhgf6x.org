I'm LGBT too, I thought I'd chime in. Before I realised I was gay, I'd wondered about it for a while. But since I'd never been in love or interested in anybody, boy or girl, I just put it aside as one of the 'guess I'll find that out later' things you have in life.

Then I met this girl, and we became friends. After a while I realized that my feelings for her were more than just friendly. So my realization went like this: 'wow, so I guess this is what liking someone in /that/ way feels like. Oh wait, this isn't a boy... Well, I guess that answers my question about being gay as well.' (Just to be clear, by that time I found it very hard to imagine ever feeling that way about a guy, and I still do.)

It took a bit of time to get used to the idea, and coming out was very stressful even though I already knew no-one would make a problem out of it (yaay for an LGBT-friendly country and open-minded friends). I felt like I had to come out, because I was uncomfortable around people assuming I was straight. After that, it was pretty much a non-issue.

So, if he doesn't know what 'gay' is, you can just make him fall in love first, exactly like you'd do with a straight character. You can choose for a lot of internal struggle, but like [[/u/toni_toni]] said, that's going to be hard to write as a straight person. I'd have a hard time writing it, and I'm gay. So you can also choose for making it not that big of a deal. Now I haven't read your fic, so I'm going out on a limb here, but if they haven't had much contact with society, they might not know about homophobia. They're werewolves, they know what being different is like. Since there aren't any openly gay people in canon (I know J.K. Rowling outed Dumbledore, but since it isn't mentioned in canon we don't really know how the wizarding world reacts to homosexuality), you can choose whether or not homophobia is a thing.

The slash fics I've read can be roughly split in two groups: those with a lot of homophobia, internal struggle, etc (pure bloods being all about reproduction and heirs, thus homosexuality being frowned upon), and the stories where it's just normal. Of course there's a grey area, but for me both these options feel realistic. So it's something to think about, which route you want to take.

If you go for internal struggle and homophobia, I recommend reading blogs, watching videos, etc etc by people who are part of the LGBT-community. Visit [[/r/ainbow]] or another LGBT-sub to read a lot of different views in a short amount of time. And last but not least, a resource you might not come up with on your own: the nanowrimo-forums. There's a thread in the Young Adult-Genre lounge about LGBT-characters, and I think you can find a lot of different places where it's mentioned. Be careful not to go down the rabbit hole though, there are a lot of fun things there that could consume your day/week/life. But the Adoption Society and Appellation Station are great if you need a bit of inspiration, regardless of your genre/topic/whatever. Good luck! (oh, warning, I think the forums there are wiped once a year but I don't know when. September probably.)
