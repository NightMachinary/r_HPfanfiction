Oh My Gosh! I'm an LGBT person! Finally my time to shine!

So I've read through your post twice and the prognosis is... difficult.

Realising you're LGBT is hard, hard to wrap your mind around how you're different from everyone else and hard to come to terms with being what you are. To that end I have only two major pieces of advice to offer.

For the self discovery bit where Malcolm realises he's gay you've set yourself up perfectly for "Holy cow! You can actually do that!" moment, where just being around a person who is out and comfortable in their own skin makes you realise that you could do that (It's how I got my best friend out of the closet). You've inadvertently set yourself up in the best possible way, congratulation on that.

The second bit, coming to terms with it is harder, much much much harder and it's not helped along by the fact that you're (apparently) straight. You're going to have to decide how much homophobia your character has internalized and how difficult it is to get past it. This is the bit where many authors screw up and is the reason why I don't read fics that center around the topic of self discovery (or at least the ones that take place during hogwarts years). Malcolm is already an outcast or (if you've been liberal with cannon) feels like an 'other' because he's a werewolf and you're adding being gay on top of that. For societal discrimination, I highly recommend you do either tons of research (for example being gay in muggle scotland was illegal until 1980) or minimalise it to match today's standards of treatment for LGB individuals. Tread lightly here because this is the part where your being (apparently) straight will make things difficult.

If all the minority characters actually contribute something to the story and are more than just 'that <minority> guy' tokenism isn't something you're going to have to worry about.

I think that covers your questions, let me know if you have anymore or you need me to clarify anything.
