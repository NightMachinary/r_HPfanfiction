Thanks so much! You're right about him already feeling an outcast, he's kinda an obnoxious guy (ie- James P, Fred W, George W, type) but instead of just being that way it's been more of a coping mechanism, and a way to entertain oneself when your only company is your brother. I'll need to decide how the wizarding community feels about LGBT individuals. On one hand I want it to be a beautiful thing, and the significantly lower rate of sexism simply because magic isn't inherent to any gender (though there are still gender roles, to a point) connects to a less homophobic community. However, it is also set in the Marauder Era which was a LONG time ago. This is going to require some more in depth research.... Thanks for your help, I'm happy that I set it up right!
