That's a good point, and especially since so many of the main characters even just don't know what 'gay' is, the idea hasn't occurred to them. With that being standard, I'm sure there will be some misconceptions that can be hurtful, especially to someone who is gay and hasn't really figured themselves out yet. [[/u/mossenmeisje]] specifically mentioned that many fics take the perspective of pureblood families being against it, if only because of reproduction. I think that is a good point, and an easy way to have a society that supports, but a bad guy/popular crowd/government that doesn't. It'll also polarize the good and bad a little more, separating them on an additional personal level.
