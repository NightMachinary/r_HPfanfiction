Remember that homophobia doesn't always come in the aggressive physically harmful variety. The homophobia could be as simple as having to deal with other kids saying 'that's gay' when talking about things they don't like, or having to deal with people expecting you to live up to stereotypes (watch an episode of will and grace to see what I mean.). Something like this would allow you to create a wizarding world that's okay with LGBT people but also has some issues and misconceptions ingrained into the culture.
