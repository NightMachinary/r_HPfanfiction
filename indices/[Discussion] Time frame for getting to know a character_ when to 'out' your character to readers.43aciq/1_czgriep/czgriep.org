Honestly, if you're worrying about this I doubt you'll be a dick to the LGBT community and will try to do their characters and story justice. :)

I'd recommend reading through LGBT blogs / tumblrs about writing LGBT characters and becoming aware of stereotypes and whatnot so you know what would be offensive to the community. Read stories with LGBT characters to see how people handle them (both in good ways and bad).

I'm always very careful about my characters and make sure they have storylines outside of their sexuality, as well as a defined personality. They should be well-rounded characters where their sexuality is just one part of who they are. If their only defining trait is being gay, than that's a HUGE problem.

As for getting a sense of realism to a situation you can't relate to... that's part of writing... you're not going to relate to all the situations you put your characters in.
