I think you've got the right idea in asking us, though it may make more sense to ask the question in an LGBT subreddit- perhaps one on representation in media, if it exists.

Of any 'tokenism' concerns, I would encourage you to treat the characters as not gay or straight or any category, but instead focus on them as the sum of their experiences and the forces in their lives. These guys are people first. I would argue that they're werewolves second, wizards third and of all other matters, inexperienced. It then becomes a question of 'This is what this character feels in this circumstance- how would I expect them to handle that?' A strong-willed, expressive person might be showy about their feelings. Someone still bouncing through the traumas of becoming part-creature might want to sideline anything that further confuses their limited coping skills. If in the end this just distracts from the main plot or isn't very interesting to write about, either change it to be more difficult or dump the concept as unimportant.

tl;dr: they aren't 'gay'. They're people. Things happen and they react to it.
