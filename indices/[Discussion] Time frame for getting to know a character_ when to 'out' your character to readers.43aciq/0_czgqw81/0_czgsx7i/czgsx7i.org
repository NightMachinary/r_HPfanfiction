Thanks for your reply! It's because they just haven't been in a romantic spotlight that it hasn't come up yet, which is why I worry that readers may take it as 'tokenism'. I think I'm going to use some flashbacks for Mark, it would be a good way to show his relationship with Alpha when it was good so it would serve as a more... anecdotal announcement which is what I'd prefer since they aren't 'token' characters.
