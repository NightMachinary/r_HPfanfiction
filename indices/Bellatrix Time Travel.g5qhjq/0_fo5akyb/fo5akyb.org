That's a tough request. Out of all the time travel fics I've read I don't think a single one had Bellatrix being the one who traveled. In terms of harry time travel where he gets with a young Non-deatheater Bellatrix I was going to recommend linkffn(Delenda Est) by Lord Silvere.

Good luck I hope someone can find some fics to recommend to you.
