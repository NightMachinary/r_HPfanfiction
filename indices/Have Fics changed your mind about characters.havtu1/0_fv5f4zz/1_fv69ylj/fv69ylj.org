I kinda agree with this. I still like her character and I enjoy meta and art with her. But in fic? When I see her especially as mc i just kinda expect her to get all the useful qualities which makes alot of the other characters kinda useless or boring. And it kinda ruins the tension of the plot. I know there are Hermione fics that don't do it. But there are so many I've seen that do that I have started sorta avoiding fics with her as a central focus. Which is a shame cuz I used to love fics with Hermione.
