I always had a dislike of Snape in canon and fanon. Pretty much, he is either an incompetent bully or a soft-hearted father figure who shits rainbows. My dislike is probably from how flat the character is.

He is a complex character, but his motives are always simplified.

I changed after reading this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857][one]]. I realized that he actually can be written as a complex person.
