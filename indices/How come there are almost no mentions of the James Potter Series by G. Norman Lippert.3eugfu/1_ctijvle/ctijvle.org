When DH came out I was intrigued by the next gen and read a few fics by some of the big name authors I followed. But I decided it just wasn't for me. The next gen kids are just... Lacking in canon characterization that it made it difficult for me to read any fics with them. This is similar to why I don't read marauder fics. I also rarely read anything about or from the pov of an ancillary character. Or gen fic really either. We all have our preferences, and sadly I think next gen just isn't a popular genre to really be discussed here too often

As for the length, there are tons of long fic out there. Maybe not as long as the one you're talking about, since I have no idea how long it is. You could check on ao3, and use filters when searching. I like to search for a minimum of 40k word count and then I sort by kudos. Not sure if ffn has similar search features.
