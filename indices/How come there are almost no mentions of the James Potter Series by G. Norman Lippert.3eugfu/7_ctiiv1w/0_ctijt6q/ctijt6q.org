That is a fair point, although one I disagree with. A fan fiction does not have to focus on the main character or even a major character of the original content in order to be good or considered in the same world. Any story written in the same world as the OC should be considered a fan fiction of that original story.

Personally I prefer fan fiction that takes place post HPDH and focuses on either new characters or the original characters lives after the events the original series.

That said was down voting the topic itself really necessary? Even if the topic is not your cup of tea the down vote (when talking about threads) should really be saved for topics that do not pertain to this subreddit, not just ones you don't like. It reduces the visibility of the thread, meaning people like me who care about this topic have less of a chance to see it.

You didn't even make any suggestions as to fan fictions to try out. If you're not going to contribute to the threads topic and instead are just going to post negative remarks why even bother responding in the first place?
