I don't expect anyone to blindly agree with me, I wasn't aware of the apparent preferences and I like debating the point. I was being an ass trying to lecture Bobo and apologized for it. I see now he was just answering my questions, I misread feeling behind the words which sometimes happens when you can't hear and can only read.

I don't suppose you know of a subreddit or website specifically for next gen do you?
