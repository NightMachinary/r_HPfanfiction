Yes, slash usually means m/m relationship.

The only fully next gen one I can find is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4215748/1/The-Comprehension-Series][The Comprehension Series]]. 157k words. It's Albus Severus/Scorpius eventually. No real summary given though and I can't remember what it's about.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/608957][The Price We Pay for Wings]]. a short one, at 13k words, but really unique. It's kind of preslash Harry/Draco but the next gen kids play a big part of this story. One of my favorite fics, and it's worth the short read if only for the lore the author brings into it.

You can also search by tag on AO3. You just click a characters names, or a pairing, or a keyword and it'll create a search for you. I made a search for you based on [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&tag_id=Harry+Potter+Next+Generation][Harry Potter next generation]], and then sorted it by word count for you.
