Oh I could care less. Equal right to be miserable as anyone else. I don't judge.

I don't particularly want to read any sex scenes between two men but skipping a page or two is pretty easy and it wouldn't bother me unless it was excessive, and then only cause even excessive hetro sex scenes in the fic would annoy me.
