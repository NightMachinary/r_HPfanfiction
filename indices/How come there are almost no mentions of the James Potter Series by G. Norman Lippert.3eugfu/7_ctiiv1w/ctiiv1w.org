I've been reading HP ff for over 10 years and I've never even heard of the stories you mentioned. I'm a member of multiple forums and actively search for new things to to read and not seen it mentioned.

For the most part I only read Harry centric stories so that is possibly why I've not come across them. It's called "Harry Potter" and I'm not particularly interested in the story of his son who is only present in one scene making him as much a real character as Daphne or Tracy or Eloise Midgen. Any story about the next generation has left JKR's world and started making its own.
