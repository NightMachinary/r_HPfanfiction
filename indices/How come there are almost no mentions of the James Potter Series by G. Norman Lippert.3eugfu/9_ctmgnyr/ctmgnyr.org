These are some good fics of different tropes, try them, see which is more your speed, then request similar ones:

Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

Linkffn(Resonance)

Linkffn(A Year Like No Other)

Linkffn(Time Warp)

Linkffn(To Shape and Change)

Linkffn(Circular Thinking)

Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle)

Linkffn(Saving Connor)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Linkffn(Harry Crow)

Some of these are /not/ popular here at all, but all are generally widely read and definitely popular within their niches. You've got everything from a war scenario AU with a powerful Harry to mentor Snape. They all have a few things in common: Harry!centric and taking place during Harry's era because this is what the sun really leans toward.
