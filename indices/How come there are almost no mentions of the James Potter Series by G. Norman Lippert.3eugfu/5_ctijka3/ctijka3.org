I have read james potter and I think there are several strikes against it. One is that it's a next gen fic-- this IS the Harry potter fanfic subreddit. Next gen fics always seem to get a little bit short changed. I don't think this is anything against the fic, just the fact that it moves it's focus away from Harry lowers its appeal. Secondly, it's not finished - I know that the individual books are finished, but when people set out to read a million words, you know, they want to get to the end. And there are LOTS of fanfiction, even if you're only looking for completed, well written fics of more than 500k words (I chose that number because that's the word count of war and peace) you have lots and lots of options. Third (and this is a personal peeve of mine, so forgive me if it's a little petty) but I read fanfiction on my phone and the fact that there isn't a way to read james potter other than on a pdf drives me nuts.

As for your other request, this subreddit has new thread titled "I need good long complete Harty potter fanfiction" every two weeks. Keep an eye out for them. This was the most recent one. Should keep you busy for a while.
