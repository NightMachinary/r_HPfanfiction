Wasn't agreeing or disagreeing with any of them (except the third, obviously). Just proposing them. I do like the james potter series, although i wouldn't describe them as my favorite fic ever. I'm aware that the epub exists, but it still isn't nearly as convenient as reading them in my browser.

there ARE fics that chronicle the aftermath, but the only one that I've read (harry potter and the summer after the war) was tremendously not to my taste - more of a novel of manners than anything else.
