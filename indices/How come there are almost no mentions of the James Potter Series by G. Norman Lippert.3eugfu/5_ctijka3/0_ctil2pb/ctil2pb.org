All of his books are available directly from his website and now conveniently come in epub editions. Which can be easily read from your phone using multiple free apps. So that takes care of your third strike at least ;)

As to the second strike, personally I don't mind waiting for a book to come out, it's not any different then when I had to wait for Rowling to finish her books or any of the professional authors whose works I read. That does apply only for works in which at the very least the writing skill of the author is enough to be considered "professional" which if nothing else I think this series is that.

As to the first strike... I don't understand the fandoms love of rewriting the original canon. To me I would call that AU more then I would "fan fic" although there really is not be all end all definition of fan fiction. I guess partially because I love the original series so much that I prefer to keep it the way it is, my only problem with the original series (and Rowling herself) is that the story never really felt finished to me. There was/is so much more to be told, the immediate aftermath of the battle for Hogwarts, the complete dismantling and rebuilding of the Ministry of Magic, Harry and the gang becoming aurors (or not and pursuing different careers). Those are just a few off the top of my head.

Thank you for the link, I will be checking that out for sure.
