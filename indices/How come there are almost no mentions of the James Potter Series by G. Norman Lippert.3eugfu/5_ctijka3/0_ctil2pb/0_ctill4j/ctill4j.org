Your preferences aren't uncommon; large parts of the fandom prefer non-rewrites of original canon. But that's the thing -- everyone has different preferences and every community has their leanings as well. I read little of what's most popular here, but I'm glad to see this subreddit diversify as it's grown, and there are people to give recs for any kind of fic you'd like. On the rare occasions people want light minor character/next gen fic, I'm here. If you want to read more next gen fic, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/][HPFF]] is the most popular archive for it. Anything /non/-canon set is more popular there in general, actually. Nature of the community.
