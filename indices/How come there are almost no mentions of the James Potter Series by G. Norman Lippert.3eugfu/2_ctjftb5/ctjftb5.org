I've read the first book, and I often rec it on here when people occasionally ask for Next Gen. Haven't gotten around to reading the others. I liked the story, but I felt that the plot was very dry. In fact, I rolled my eyes at the arrival of Merlin. That was weird. Here are a few other good Next Gen fics to read:

#+begin_quote
  1) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity. It's about Teddy and his first year at Hogwarts. The author also writes this really good series about an American witch named Alexandra Quick. None of the Harry Potter characters ever show up, but there are little mentions from time to time (Weasley Wizard Wheezes, for instance, made it over to America).

  2) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] by Slide. I found this one to be very engaging, and the characters were interesting.

  3) [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever is a cult favorite. If you can get past the poor writing at the beginning, the author really improves and gets better over time. This story pretty much started the Rose/Scorpius hype. It's got a sequel that's worth checking out as well.

  4) Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is worth a look. He's got a gazillion stories all in the same universe. Whatever you want, he's probably got it.

  5) Similar to above, you should check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. She's got a ton of stories about life after Hogwarts, but they are a little more fluffy if you are into that sort of stuff.

All in all, you shouldn't restrict yourself to just Next Gen. There's a lot of great fanfiction out there, and the community is absolutely huge! HOWEVER, a lot of these guys seem to be dissing the stories that don't focus on Harry...and they clearly don't seem to understand the point of fanfiction. Fanfiction can be whatever you want. In fact, I rarely ever read stories with Harry as the main character. He's still my favorite character, but I read seven books about him so I want to know what people think about other characters. Sometimes it's Next Gen...sometimes it's random people like Percy or Luna. My favorite stories are about Harry's parents, and you don't see much of that on here either (lots of Snape defenders). Just because it isn't the most popular on THIS subreddit doesn't mean there aren't people who like it. Sometimes this subreddit annoys me because they think everyone should agree with them (as a Ron/Hermione shipper, I feel very vulnerable), but there great writing tips and discussions sometimes.

As for James Potter being the best? I don't know. Maybe I should read the other books before I can agree or disagree.
