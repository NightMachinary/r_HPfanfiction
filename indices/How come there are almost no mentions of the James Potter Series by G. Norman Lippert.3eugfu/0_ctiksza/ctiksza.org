On the whole, this forum doesn't seem to care much for next gen fics. Harry-centric stuff seems to be sought after most commonly. This is likely why there's nothing much about this series.

As for "by far the most read fanfic" -- doubtful. Do you realise how long the HP fanfic community has been active? How many fics have been written? How many BNFs were writing stories that were getting HUGE readerships back in the day when BNFs were a thing? (I mean, they might still be but I never see them talked about.) The JP series might be popular where you're hanging out, but that's hardly reflective of the entire fandom. As a whole, we must be one of the biggest fandoms to exist online; there are going to be a lot of people that have never heard of this series. I've been in the fandom for over 10 years now I've only seen it briefly because I never had any interest in reading it (next gen isn't really my thing) so I never got into the circles where it was talked about and hyped over. Media representation is also not that indicative of quality or fame because it really depends on WHAT media is covering it and what kind of audience that media reaches.

As for length, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ytpy0/whats_the_longest_completed_fanfic/][this thread here]] has multiple fics just as long and longer. When someone writes a fic longer than the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][Sacrifices Arc]], then I'll be impressed. (By the way, the Sacrifices Arc is over 3 million words and contains mature content, if you wanna go check it out. Also AU and slash, just in case they're not your thing, and multiple warnings for psychological child abuse, rape, torture, graphic gore and violence, and major character death.)
