I'm relatively new to the "fandom" I read each book as it came out and I've probably read the series itself a dozen times or so, but I was never really into the fan fiction stuff until very recently. I mostly read epic fantasy by authors like Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, so I prefer a more epic scale and lots of well fleshed out characters. Well written battle scenes are a must for me as well. Nothing makes me give up on a story quicker then poorly written action.

I enjoy what I guess would be called "next-gen" I like leaving the original books and canon the way they are and focusing on new characters, although preferably related (doesn't have to be by blood) to the original characters and with good cameo's from them.

I saw the Alexandra Quick stories but did not check them out yet, are they worth reading?

Never heard of DA and the Year of Darkness, what is that one about?

Thanks for the link, I'll take a look at that.
