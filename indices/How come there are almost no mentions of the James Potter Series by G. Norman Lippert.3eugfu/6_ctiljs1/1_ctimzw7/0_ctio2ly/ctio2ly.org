Highly recommend DA and the Year of Darkness! It's the 7th Harry Potter book told from Neville's point of view. Basically about him & the DA fighting against the evil Carrows (and boy, are they evil in that story). Follows cannon pretty closely and really develops some smaller, peripheral characters from the series!
