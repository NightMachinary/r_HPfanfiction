Have you tried the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] stories? There's four out now and the author is working on the fifth. What about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]]? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3esu2m/good_epic_adventure_fics/][This thread]] that's currently on the front page has a bunch of long stories recommended.

You're not getting very many recommendations because no one knows what you're interested in. Are there any pairings or tropes you like in particular? Is it only next gen that you're looking for?
