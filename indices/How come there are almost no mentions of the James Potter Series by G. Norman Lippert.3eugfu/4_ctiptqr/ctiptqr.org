The reason its not really showcased on this Subreddit is a multifaceted answer. This subreddit leans extremely toward Harry Potter gen fics. NOT next-gen. Also, G. Norman Lippert's work is harder to get a hold of than the works that are common here. We can type our title into a bot command and have it linked. that is much more difficult with his work. Also to be fair it is NOT the most read fanfiction on the internet for harry potter. That title goes to Methods of Rationality. Lippert's work is the most *downloaded* work. since you can only read it by downloading. Which oddly enough this particular subreddit is not a major fan of.
