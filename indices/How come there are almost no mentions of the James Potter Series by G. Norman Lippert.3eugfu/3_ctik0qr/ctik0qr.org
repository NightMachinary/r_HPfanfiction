  Why does it seem like no one ever talks about what is if nothing else the most widely read HP Fan Fiction ever written?

I don't really talk about it because I didn't find it all that interesting. Same for why I don't recommend it. It's also pretty well known so I don't bother as it's likely they've already heard of it. You don't see Methods of Rationality recommended much here for probably the same reasons.

My go to author recommendation is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]]. He's writing one big story that's broken up into several smaller ones.
