1. I agree-I don't think JKR said much about vampires so I'm wide open to his interpretation. I think the whole cloud of bats thing is a little bit cheesy, but it is nice and old school! It gives a retro vibe.

2. I haven't read that so I looked it up on wikipedia. It does look like it could be a nod to it but it could be a coincidence :) Carmilla was born in 1698 and Camelia says [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8458913/1/Killers][she was born in 1766]] so I guess they aren't meant to be the same.

You bring up a good point about the OCs and it's awesome how he writes them. They're more fleshed out than most of fanfiction's Harry, Ron, or Hermione.
