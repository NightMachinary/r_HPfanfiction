1. A bit cheesy, yea, but to some people all of HP would be cheesy. I do like the retro feel. The geographical isolation of the setting, the mythos of the moor and the more classical characters gives it a richness.
2. Carmilla/Camelia could be a coincidence. I don't think they would be meant as the same person, just that the author might have named their character as a reference to a vampire classic.

I think fanfiction is essentially an assisted-daydream. We don't require (or don't mind) that canon characters aren't fleshed out, because they already exist in our memories. Fanfiction is a literary skeleton, /what if:time travel...what if:Indy!Harry/, that is mainly held together not by the fanfic-author's writing skill but by the reader's imagination and memories. Most of the effort put into a fanfic is by the canon author. They created the characters we love, that fanfic writers just tweak, and are always relying on the reader's knowledge and love of cannon to fill in the gaps. I know that it takes a lot of time of skill to write a quality 100K+ word fanfiction, but it's always dependent on canon as it's foundation. That being said, a compelling OC character is a credit to the fanfic-author. It is their own talent that has drawn us into investing in the character. Especially if it is a muggle character, which is the case in /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/. With a muggle character, JKR has no claim over any of their attributes, and there are no flashy qualities to attract the reader i.e. having your OC be a mystical mage, or anything that's specific HP magic system. Northumbrian does flesh out his OC's amazingly. I know a lot of young families like the OCs, and I was drawn into the character's experience as it mirrors real life so closely.
