Ah, I missed that, sorry. I think you're right though, Northumbrian's updates are not too slow.

I enjoyed it. It feels a bit wrong to read a chapter of HP fanfiction that is 95% OC, but darn it, Northumbrian writes good characters.

Two questions on Camelia if you're up for it:

1. I don't think JKR did much of anything in canon with Vampires. Specifically I don't think their ability to turn into a bat/cloud of bats is ever mentioned. If it's not, I've got no problems with it. It is a very Bram Stoker style interpretation of vampires that I haven't seen in most fics. Your thoughts?

2. Do you think Northumbrian is referencing literary character [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla][Carmilla]] in Camellia? Young, female, classic style of vampire written just before Bram Stoker's version.
