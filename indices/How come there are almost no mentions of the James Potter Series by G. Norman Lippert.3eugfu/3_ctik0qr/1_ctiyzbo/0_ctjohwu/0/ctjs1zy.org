Thanks! I agree that the updates are a bit slow, but the product is good. It is not as bad as some other popular authors (will Emporer ever update?). /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/ did update today, however!

Another reason to like Northumbrian is their completion rate. They have A LOT of completed stories, even if they are short.
