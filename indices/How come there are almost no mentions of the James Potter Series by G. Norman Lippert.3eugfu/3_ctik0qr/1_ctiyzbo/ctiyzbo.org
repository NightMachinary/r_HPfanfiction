I second this, Strangers at Drakeshaugh is fantastic. It is post war, with a mature (as in sophisticated) writing style and characterizations. I feel like it's HP fanfiction all grown up. The plot is mellow, but also is tense and suspenseful at times. Comparable to a good quality BBC Drama/Mystery show. Northumbrian is very refreshing author. I know my description sounds a bit pretentious. but it is a good read (WIP and worth it).
