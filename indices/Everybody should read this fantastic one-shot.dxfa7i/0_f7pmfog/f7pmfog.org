While I like this fic and have recommended it before, there are several things I don't like too:

Ron is very OOC and is basically getting bashed into oblivion. I honestly don't understand where the trope of chauvinistic/misogynist Ron comes from. Throughout the series, he's one of the very few who does not get intimidated by Hermione's intelligence, but actually welcomes it.

Hermione is also damn OOC in this one. I highly doubt a radical one such as her would ever put up with the shit of that postwar Ministry. It's the same failed characterizations of hers in those marriage law fics.

This fic also goes all out into 'give every Death Eater a second chance' Dumbledore trope. We had many threads denouncing the very same thing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), has a very similar premise in that Harry fights a still malicious postwar Ministry, but I like it so much more because:

- Characterizations. Not only does the Trio stay true to their canon characterizations, Neville, George, Susan, and Dean all have their bright moments.
- This Harry doesn't wait X years until the bad guys killed off his family. He lashes out only three months after the Battle of Hogwarts, when the Ministry finally worn down his patience with its malicious policies.
- The overall, slightly melancholic, tone of this fic is very compelling. Trio interactions are a really bright spot.
- The plot, the depictions of magic, and attention to details.
