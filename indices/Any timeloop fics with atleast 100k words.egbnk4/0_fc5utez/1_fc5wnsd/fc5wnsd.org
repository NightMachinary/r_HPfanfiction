This was my first thought too. I 'finished' reading it when it was only about 400k words and can't bring myself to read it again, though the writing is excellent.

My boyfriend has since read it through and LOVES it. Definitely give it a try if you want a time loop read.

It's good enough to be published as its own book, and long enough that presumably it never will be. :)
