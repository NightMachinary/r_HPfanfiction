If you're not opposed to original fiction, I highly recommend Mother of Learning. It is about a young mage studying at mage university, who becomes stuck in a time loop. He uses it to become stronger and hopes to eventually escape. The fic clocks in at about 700k words if I remember correctly, and the final chapter is due for December/January.
