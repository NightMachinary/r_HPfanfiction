Harry loops back when he dies... I think I dropped it after either Voldemort also looping or Harry getting to a checkpoint.

Unsure which but both do tick the 'stuff don't work out'-category for me... which I don't enjoy. (was a good fic tho. and you might enjoy it more)

(note: don't remember if Voldy looped in this one, quite sure Harry reached a checkpoint)
