Probably not exactly what you mean, but did you consider the idea of an Empath? Like a specific gift for a wizard/witch allowing them to feel other peoples feelings, emotions, pain? It is what [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] series is based on, and I really like it.
