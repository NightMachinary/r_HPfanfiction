My story doesn't have enough of him to qualify but I love me some Slughorn. In my headcanon he is all about the stuff that probably won't work 100% of the time in magic but is worth exploring sometimes. So he knows all the fringe spells and curses, and stuff, which is why he knew about Horcruxes. So yay for the Slughorn love!
