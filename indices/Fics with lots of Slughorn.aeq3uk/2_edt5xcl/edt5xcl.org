Slughorn is a fascinating character and I wish there were more fics with him! There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4457149/1/Last-Chance][Last Chance]], which is a Dumbledore-mentors-Tom-Riddle fic, where Slughorn is Dumbledore's friend. He is not the main character, but plays an important role in the story.
