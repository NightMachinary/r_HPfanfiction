I have one planned for /Parselmouth/'s next story-arc, though it won't be as morally clear-cut as allowing the protagonists to just cheerfully slaughter.

There's also always the excellent /Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«/, but the Goblin Rebellion thing is actually, in my opinion, the least-well-executed element in the story. Still. Well worth a read.
