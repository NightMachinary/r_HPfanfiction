The "investing in a Muggleborn" part reminds of /Serena Miller/ and her /Miller's Magical Mirrors/... which can be found in *Harry Potter and the Lighting Lord*. In particular, the investment scene with the goblins can be found in chapter 28.

The author re-wrote / ripped off himself into *Saviour of Magic.* Unfortunately, I do not specifically recall if Mrs. Miller made the cut into the rewrite or not.
