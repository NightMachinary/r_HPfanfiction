It depends on whether squibs are simply magical-born muggles (with no more magic than a muggle) or whether they are half-way (some connection to magic but not enough to perform spells).

If they are magical-born muggles, then there might be only a single gene for magic and it wasn't passed on or its expression was suppressed by some other gene(s).

If they are half-way, then there may be multiple genes for magic (or one gene for magic and others that contribute to it) and squibs didn't get them all or something else suppresed them.
