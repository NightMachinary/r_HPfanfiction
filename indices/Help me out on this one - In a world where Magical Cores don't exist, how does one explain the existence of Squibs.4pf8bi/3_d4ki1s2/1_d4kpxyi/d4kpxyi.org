  If they are half-way, then there may be multiple genes for magic (or one gene for magic and others that contribute to it) and squibs didn't get them all or something else suppresed them.

Or alternatively, it could be that muggles get one variation of the gene, wizards get another, and squibs get a faulty gene that is neither of those and thus can't do that wizards can but technically aren't muggles either. It's a long shot, but considering that the mechanics of the existence of squibs seem to be similar to those of certain genetic mishaps that do work this way (existing due to faulty genes), it's a possibility.
