Like [[/u/Kazeto]] said, I am of the opinion that Hogwarts is a school for those above average in magical ability. In my mind, there is a sliding scale of magical power, from most to least: Sorcerers, Mages, Wizards, Hedgewitches, and, of course, Squibs. It's possible (thought certainly not canon) that Kwikspell was for hedgewitches and weak wizards who couldn't afford proper education.
