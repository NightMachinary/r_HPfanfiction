I don't think the Weasleys were that poor at all. They had seven kids so money would obviously be tight during the summer right before the school year. Also, Bill and Charlie were already out of school by 1991, so the point where they would have had the most fiscal trouble would be in the summer of 1992, since that's when they had 5 kids going to Hogwarts. 1993 would have been bad as well, but they won the lottery and managed to deal with it.

But Bill was a curse breaker for Gringotts and must've been making boatloads of cash to wear dragon hide boots all the time. Percy was really high up in the Ministry and still lived at home; he probably was supporting his family at the time. Arthur was still a head for a reasonably important but looked down upon department; he probably had a decent paycheck to support 9 people + Harry without complaints.

Hand-me-downs don't necessarily mean poor. Used is just cheaper than new. From Harry's, Malfoy's, and Hermione's POV, Ron looks broke AF because the former two are filthy rich and Hermione is reasonably well off (two dentists can make some good money). Ron still had enough money to buy Harry decent Christmas and birthday presents.
