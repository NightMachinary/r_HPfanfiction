Some people theorise that only the (supposed) elite go to Hogwarts and many witches and wizards learn from one another rather than go to schools, so Kwikspell could also be useful to those because if you learn from people who aren't technically teachers you might get someone who doesn't really know how to teach you well enough.

And before anyone tries to counter it with the Weasleys being too poor and stuff, they are one of the “Sacred Twenty-Eight” which could void that argument (or could not, but point is that we don't know).
