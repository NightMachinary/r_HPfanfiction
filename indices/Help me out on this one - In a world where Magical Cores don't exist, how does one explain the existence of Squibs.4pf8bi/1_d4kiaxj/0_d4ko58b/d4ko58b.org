This. Filch was still able to see Hogwarts, Dementors, and use owls as a postal service. If a Muggle ever tried to use an owl to send a letter to grandma, they'd probably be scratched all over from a very angry bird.

Makes you curious about the Kwikspell course though. Filch never succeeded at the course. But does that mean there's people with more magic than a squib but less than a wizard to the point Hogwarts doesn't accept them? Or would this course be for late bloomers (who probably fall into that category anyway)?
