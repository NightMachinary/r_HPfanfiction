I always assumed that the presence of magical ability was basically a gene mutation. It's the benign kind so it doesn't affect health but since it's a mutation, it can randomly occur (muggle-born wizards), it can be passed on in families (it appears from canon that the vast majority of children born to wizards and witches are magical and the vast majority of children born to muggles are non-magical, we know wizards can be born from mixed marriages but we don't know in what proportion mixed marriages produce muggles/squibs.) I don't know enough about genes to know if they can un-mutate/mutate back into the normal form or whether the actual mutated version is passed on or just a /tendency/ to mutate (so for squibs, something would prevent the gene from mutating or it would just not mutate for some reason despite this inherited tendency.)

Functionally I've always assumed that muggles and squibs are identical, it's just that most muggles don't know about the existence of magic so are blissfully ignorant and squibs are unfortunate enough to have that knowledge because they are born into that world. The reason squibs aren't called muggles would probably be because of anti-muggle feeling, because in the past (and the present with some wizarding families) who you were born to was almost more important than your own heritage - and perhaps because it's not always clear with little children whether they have magical ability or not - Neville mentioned that his family thought he was a squib for a long time, whereas Harry was doing accidental magic all through his primary schooling. (Though this could be argued this was because he was going through extremely stressful experiences, perhaps not all magical children have accidents). I think if a squib was brought up with muggles (e.g. if Tom Riddle had been a squib) they would be considered a muggle.

As far as ability goes, I have always seen magical ability as being similar to whether or not a person has good physical co-ordination or has a "math brain" or finds it easy to pick up languages or how creative they are, basically, a mixture of innate skill and training, whereas the ability to produce magic or not is more of a binary - you either can or you can't, and the "kwikspell" type courses are a cruel kind of scam.
