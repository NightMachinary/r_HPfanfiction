You make good points and I absolutely agree now that a radar like/area monitoring enchantment is most likely.

The ministry probably gets a ping and then cross check that ping with the muggleborn registry. If there is a muggleborn nearby, but no wizard homes then a letter would get sent out. If there was a wizard home nearby it's probably discarded.

My point now is that because the trace cannot differentiate between wizard and elf, most likely it cannot determine between adult and minor.

Therefore all magic is monitored and it's a gap in canon that the ministry doesn't monitor those logs for unforgivable curses and send an auror response team. Voldemort's taboo shows that some words can be tracked and used as transportation coordinates.
