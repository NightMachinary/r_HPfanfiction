Yes, the fact that the Trace can't distinguish underage wizards from adults is precisely what I was alluding to by using the CoS example, not arguing against it.

Okay, a recap.

1. Trace can't tell who casts a spell, only where (roughly) and when.

2. Trace is supposed to be geared towards underage magic only, yet it reacts to house-elf produced magic.

3. Trace is not on the wand.

4. Trace is most likely not on the person.

5. 3 & 4 would suggest that the Trace is some kind of radar spell.

6. No one gets a letter for casting magic aboard the Hogwarts Express, which is technically "outside of school".

There may be more to the Trace than we know. Perhaps it's capable of more than we see from Harry's POV, but not every case warrants an intervention by the Ministry.

I speculated that Voldemort's Taboo was actually based on the Trace, or was the Trace itself repurposed, because their functions and area of effect seem similar.

Nothing suggests that Unforgivables would be detected if cast by over-seventeens. Harry cast the Cruciatus /in the Ministry/ but as far as we know, he didn't get a letter for that.
