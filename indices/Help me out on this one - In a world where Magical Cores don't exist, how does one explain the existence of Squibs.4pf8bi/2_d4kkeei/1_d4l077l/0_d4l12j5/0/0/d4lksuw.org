Regarding the Trace: I actually don't think it's a charm on the person at all, rather more like a blanket enchantment over Britain, like a magical radar or something. /Homenum revelio/ is canon, so why not a mass-scale /Magica revelio/? Or something like that. The Taboo in DH wasn't cast over every witch and wizard to summon Snatchers to their location if they spoke Voldemort's name. It was a spell that detected it being spoken, not monitoring every wizarding mouth in Britain.
