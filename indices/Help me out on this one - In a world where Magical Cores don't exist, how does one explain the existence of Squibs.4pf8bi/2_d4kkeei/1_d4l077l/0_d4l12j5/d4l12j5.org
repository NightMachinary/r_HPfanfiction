Probably in a similar way that thestrals can only be seen by people who have seen death. You're a muggle? Can't see dementors. You've seen death? You can see thestrals. Btw, having seen death is the only stated requirement for being able to see thestrals, there's nothing that I know off (cbf to check Pottermore) that says being a wizard/squib is required as well.

In general, HP magic is best not analyzed too deeply. It's like the Abyss. If you stare into it, it'll stare back into you and infest your soul with silly notions like magical cores or the Trace being on the wand.
