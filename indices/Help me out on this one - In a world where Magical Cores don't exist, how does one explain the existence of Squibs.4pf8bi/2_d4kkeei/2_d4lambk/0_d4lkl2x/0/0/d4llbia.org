You don't need to keep telling me you're not trying to trigger me by replying to my posts or whatever. ;)

As for your interest in magical history, I personally am interested in the lore oscillating around the core of HP, so Harry himself and his adventures. I guess we won't agree on the question of "how much lore is enough". Worldbuilder's disease is a thing that happens. Not everyone wants to spend years fleshing out the setting like Tolkien for example.
