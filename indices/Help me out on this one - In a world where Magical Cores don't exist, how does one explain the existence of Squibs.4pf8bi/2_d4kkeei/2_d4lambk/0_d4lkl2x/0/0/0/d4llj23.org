Yea I am a bit of a "background" person. I think it has to do with me simply being overly curious. I WANT to know the lore and background to a story, or show, or movie. I love the history, the deep background, and the world the story is built into.

Dont get me wrong, I love people in FF altering anything and everything to create amazing new stories, but I would prefer it if there was a baseline so that there would be less fights about canon and fanon if you will. And a lore that allows me to explore it deeply without needing to overly create unless I feel the urge (or wish to read others wonderful new concepts and ideas).

I grew up on Tolkien and so perhaps there is some influence there ;)
