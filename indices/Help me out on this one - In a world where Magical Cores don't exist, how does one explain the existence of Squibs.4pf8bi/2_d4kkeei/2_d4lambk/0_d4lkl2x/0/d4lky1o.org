Fair enough, again I was not critiquing your answer but JK Rowlings "background" and "lore" for HP is extremely lacking. There is a reason so much of fanon is confused for canon.

As for questions I have, it would take a full paper to fully list them all and why, and that would only be covering maybe 10% of possibles. My main issue has and always will be the background of magic and magical history itself. Most of the lore is corrupted now by fanon, because JK gave VERY little background in the stories themselves (and even less outside them), focusing mainly on character development. But if your looking for a more specific interest outside the bounds of the major structure of the story, a question as simple as why certain types of magical study are taught and others not and all that entails would be another such question of great ponderance.
