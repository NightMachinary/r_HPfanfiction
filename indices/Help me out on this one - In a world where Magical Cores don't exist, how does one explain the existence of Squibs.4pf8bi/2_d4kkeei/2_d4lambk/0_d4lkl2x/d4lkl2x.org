Have to? Not at all. If you feel like you need an explanation for where magic comes from, go ahead and think of one. I don't and I don't feel at all impeded in exploring the lore of HP in my fanfics. To quote ERB, we don't need the backstory on every ducking tree branch.

What deeper questions interest you that you feel the lore is unable to provide answers for?
