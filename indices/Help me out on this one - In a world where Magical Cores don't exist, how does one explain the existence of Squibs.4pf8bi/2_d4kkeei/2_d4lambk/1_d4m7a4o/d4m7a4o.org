I like the idea of ambient magic, and that there is a metaphorical/metaphysical siphon within people. Powerful people such as Dumbledore, Voldemort and such have large siphons capable of drawing in large quantities of magic. Muggles and squibs have very small siphons that don't allow for much magic, but because the siphon exists it allows for it to become larger as generations go on.
