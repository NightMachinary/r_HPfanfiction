Magical cores are fanon, but at the end of the day a book world needs to have lore behind it. Sadly unlike Tolkien, and certain other authors, JK Rowling did not put a ton of thought into the lore. As such, people have invented their own.

So heres the question. Squibs have a much magic as muggles. Magicals have more obviously. But where does that magic come from? Is it intertwined with their souls, is it part of their mind, part of their being, in a seperate core, is it drawn from the world around them, and so on and so forth.

You could always go with the "its just magic" answer but that doesn't help explain deeper questions.

Edit: just to clarify, not critiquing your answer so much as pointing out that canon is seriously lacking in this area, and because there is no actual answer given, you have to create one to allow for deeper exploration of the lore. Unfortunately, creating one also affects what you see/discover later.
