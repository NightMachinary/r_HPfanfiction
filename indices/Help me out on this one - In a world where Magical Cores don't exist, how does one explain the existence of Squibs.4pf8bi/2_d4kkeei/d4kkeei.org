Squibs have as much magic as muggles. The reason why squibs like Filch can enter Hogwarts is because he's not /considered/ a muggle and magic hides Hogwarts from muggles, not squibs. Language is important here, because as we know, HP is based on concepts. For example, James and Lily weren't hidden from Voldemort because their house was hidden. What was hidden was the /information/ that Potters lived in that particular house. So, the information was hidden by the Fidelius, not the location.

Edit: magical cores are entirely fanon. While I'm not a proponent of slavish devotion to canon, the cores are, imo, one of those bad fanon ideas that should never have been invented.
