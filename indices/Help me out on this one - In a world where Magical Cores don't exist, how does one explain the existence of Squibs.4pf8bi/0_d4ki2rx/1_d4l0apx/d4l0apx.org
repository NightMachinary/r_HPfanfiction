That doesn't make any sense. If anything, magic is a dominant genetic trait, within squibs it has become recessive due to the most likely culprit of inbreeding. If we go by your logic of choice, then Petunia could have chosen to be a witch or squibs could make that choice too. Some things aren't choices, but our choices make us who we are as a person to the world, can you see that difference?
