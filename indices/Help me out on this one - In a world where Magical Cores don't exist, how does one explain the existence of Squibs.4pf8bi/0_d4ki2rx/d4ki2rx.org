Well you know: MAGIC

Magic in HP isnt meant to be some hidden science with perfect laws and rules. Yes there is some magical theory, but its not absolute, intent trumps mechanics.

Most of the time, magic does things because. Squibs dont need to be explained, they are a thing that just happens, no reason nor logic to it. Making it some breeding or genetic thing undermines HP's message that we are defined by choices not birth.
