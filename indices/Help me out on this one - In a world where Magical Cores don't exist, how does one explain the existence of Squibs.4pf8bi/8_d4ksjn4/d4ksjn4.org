There are several ways you can explain it, based on what the premise is you are looking for:

IF magic is genetic and squibs arise because of excessive inbreeding, it can be genetic/neural damage.

IF the above prepositions aren't established, it can be explained away by the nature of the magical connection in humans-magic arises in certain individuals who then go on to procreate. Being mystical in nature, magic is not necessarily tied to genetics so much as family connections-if you are born of two magical beings, it is their conviction and nurture that helps develop the newborn's magical potential rather than genetics. However, magic also happens to be fleeting-the longer it is present in a single family line, the more likely it is to, for want of a better word, regress in capability. And while nurture & conviction can help improve the odds, they never completely negate the possibility of someone being born with a connection to magic but without the means to exercise it.

Another idea would be simply that wizards have their magic flowing from point at to point b with the wizard or witch being the connector between the two points. Squibs, on the other hand, are caught in a feedback loop-magic flows in from point a, but a biological/mystical/metaphysical quirk in their body catches it in a feedback loop and discharges it back down to point a rather than allowing it to flow through to point b. They have all the benefits wizards have-longevity, the ability to perceive more than the accepted standards of reality, maybe even a way to actually perform magic if such a thing were to be discovered, but they would never be able to use a wand or express their magic the normal way.

They can also act as magical regulators, attracting and smoothing out any magical surges that may occur in magic-saturated environments, which neatly explains the reasons behind Filch's continued employment at a school with an army of house elves at its disposal. I cribbed that idea off a fanfic somewhere, but I cannot remember which one...

If you are looking for a theory on how magic works given that it does have metaphysically measurable phenomenae occurring in nature (magical beasts, leylines, ghosts and so on), you can explain it by saying that magic is conducted through the human nervous system. This helps explain how accidental magic occurs and allows for the differences in power one can see in the books/films/plays-the greater the brain's connection to the magic flowing through it, the more effective the wizard or witch is at learning/using/researching it. I say connection to magic rather than intelligence because some of the ideas the characters come up with is enough to me to label even the most powerful among them as dumber than bricks (especially enchanted ones, given magic's penchant to grant sapience to inactive objects).

Whatever the reason may be, I do not really believe squibs are an aberration. Rather, they are a mutation that randomly occurs within the magical population-some variables that determine how they interact with magic are changed by either chance or destiny and, while 99.99% of them end up disconnected from magic, it is my belief that that 0.01% that successfully changes the way the affected party interacts with magic in a positive manner is evidence of evolution in action. As that one one hundredth of a percent continue to reproduce and spread the new connection to magic, over a couple of millenia those pseudo-squibs could end up breaking off from the mainstream human race altogether. Indeed, the fact that goblins and dwarves exist indicates that this may well have happened in the past.

Is that helpful?
