My personal theory doesn't involve magical cores, but "veins" in the body that allow a person to channel magic through themselves - Muggles never evolved to have these "veins", whereas Squibs, from genetic unluckiness or from inbreeding, tend to have them but they're too closed in, leaving it virtually impossible for them to channel magic for more complex spells.

They can still sense latent magic and the like, having the smallest of capabilities, but they're simply unable to draw magic into themselves and cast with it.
