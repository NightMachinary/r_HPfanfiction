It is an interesting theory, but I think there is a large problem with it, namely Ravenclaw students. Ravenclaws, famed for their intelligence, do not seem to over represent those with the greatest magical power. In your theory, as they are 'smart' (for however you define that) they must also be emotionally unstable for this to be the case. And as Ravenclaws are roughly 1/4 the population that doesn't really work out.... Sure, we don't see a lot of Ravenclaw students, but if your theory is correct we should have, as they would be important to the plot with such magical power.
