Firstly, what makes you think that a typical Ravenclaw is that much smarter than a typical non-Ravenclaw? Would Salazar have let Rowena get away with that? The division is not over raw intelligence (however measured) but over what one does with it: one may have intellect used to acquire knowledge for knowledge's sake and satisfying general curiosity (Ravenclaw), intellect used to help oneself and one's own (even if it hurts others) (Slytherin), and intellect used to help others or fix the world's problems (whether the world wants it or not) (Gryffindor). In other words, while Ravenclaw might exclude people with low intelligence, it might not actually get the smartest people in a given year.

Secondly, perhaps I should have been more clear. Intelligence in and of itself seems to be a requirement for doing powerful or complex magic (because most of what is often called "magical training" is better described as "studying"), but it's not sufficient: one must actually take the time to learn and practice it and the confidence and the drive and the emotional disposition to cast it (which was the other factor I had described), and, for that matter, to get involved in conflicts rather than just keeping one's head down or fleeing. Having high intelligence seems to make it easier, but if one is a very laid-back person who spends one's time at Hogwarts doing the minimum necessary to pass classes while being fascinated with history of magical beverages or Muggle clocks or Astronomy, one might have fairly limited capacity to influence events when war breaks out --- and Ravenclaws would be particularly prone to do just that.
