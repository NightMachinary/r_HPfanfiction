Nature vs. Nurture debates aside, I generally agree.

My thinking is that it's easier for smarter people to learn new magic and perform magic better (just as it's easier for them to learn new mundane things and perform most mundane cognitive tasks better), and a certain amount of general intelligence might be necessary for understanding some of the more complex magic well enough to cast it. So, other things such as personality type, self-confidence, and time investment being equal, a person endowed with a higher IQ (for lack of a better metric) would be better at magic. It's causal in that respect.

The main point I was trying to make, though, is that how well one does at what magic appears to depend on traits that are not in, and of themselves, magical and, critically, if there were some continuously varying magical power level separate from those traits, that distinguished Muggles from Squibs from Wizards and made some Wizards more or less powerful than others (i.e., the Magical Core mechanic) we would have expected to see some wizards whose magical capabilities were decoupled from their intellect and personality. We don't, so Squibs don't add to evidence for such a power level: you either have magic (Wizard or Witch) or you don't (Muggle or Squib).
