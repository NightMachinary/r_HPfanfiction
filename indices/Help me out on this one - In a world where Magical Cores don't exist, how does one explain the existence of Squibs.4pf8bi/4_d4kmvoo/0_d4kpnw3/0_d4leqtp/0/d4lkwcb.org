  Intelligence in and of itself seems to be a requirement for doing powerful or complex magic (because most of what is often called "magical training" is better described as "studying"), but it's not sufficient: one must actually take the time to learn and practice it and the confidence and the drive and the emotional disposition to cast it (which was the other factor I had described)

To distill your argument down: /Everyone is born with equal magic, but magical training and mental fortitude are required to be powerful./

So, it is not /caused/ by intelligence (correlation is not causation), but just like intelligence there are many variables that affect it (which also affect intelligence itself). However, unlike intelligence, one factor is /not/ genetic predispositions, other factors such as learning environment (especially when very young), drive, opportunities etc. are more important to how 'magical' someone is. It is /not/ a fixed innate capacity, a genetic gift, or as it were in Harry Potter, due to blood or /core/.

This theory I think fits the theme of the books well. Is that what you were getting at?
