Specific expression "magical core" aside, I think that Squibs are actually evidence /against/ some sort of a magical power level, unrelated to general intelligence, knowledge, emotional disposition, and just plain practice.

Consider, that if there were something like that, then we'd expect to see a /spectrum/: we'd see squibs, we'd see your typical Hogwarts student, and we'd see everything in between, including near-squibs, who would be intellectually and emotionally normal, but would only be able to do magic a little bit. We don't see that.

Instead, we see a pretty good correlation between a wizard's magical capabilities and their general intelligence and studiousness (Goyle and Crabbe on one extreme, Hogwarts Professors, Dumbledore, and Riddle on the other) and a pretty good correlation between magical capabilities and emotional disposition, including drive, desire for control, and resilience (early-canon Neville on one extreme, late-canon Neville, Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Riddle on the other). We also see limitations and signature spells that reflect a wizard's personality, with the most clear examples of that being Lockart's shallowness and lust for fame driving his talent for magic that affects others' opinions of him and nothing else, but also Harry's indomitable stubbornness and emotional directness giving him a powerful Patronus and resistance to the Imperius, but making him incapable of taking advice, controlling himself before Umbridge and, arguably, crippling his Occlumency [1].

What we don't see is any good counterexamples (if my memory isn't deceiving me): characters with low intelligence and/or lacking confidence but having powerful magic, or wizards or witches with high or even average intelligence and average emotional disposition but whose magic is just plain weak.

Coming back to squibs, the evidence that they are distinct from Muggles as far as inborn magic is concerned is highly circumstantial. When I was reading the OotP trial scene for the first time, I remember getting a distinct impression that Dumbledore had just made up the "fact" that squibs could see on the spot so that Figg could testify in Harry's defense: who's going to contradict Dumbledore on a obscure factoid like that? Squibs who stay in magical society can probably be accommodated, perhaps similarly to parents of Muggleborns when they shop in Diagon Alley, and, given how magic seems to work, I can see a form of acclimatization as well: Filch has grown up with magic all around him, and he /knows/ Hogwarts is not ruins, so why shouldn't he be able to see it?

[1] Arguably. I don't want to get into that argument on this thread.
