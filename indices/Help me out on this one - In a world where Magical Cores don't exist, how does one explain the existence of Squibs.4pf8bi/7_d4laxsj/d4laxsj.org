There is no background on WHERE magic comes from in the lore. JK Rowling never gives us one. She gives us lots of little leads, but often they lead in different directions.

Ive always gone with the concept that Magic is likely similar to "the force". A genetic mutation that tends to run in families (but occasionally does not happen), that allows you to tap into an energy force ever present in the universe, and through manipulation of that force through words, intentions, and movements (with a wand helping to further focus such movements) to achieve your goals.

As such, a Squib is simply one without the mutation. A rarity, and basically the opposite of muggle borns, but even less likely to happen due to the gene having a MUCH higher chance of being passed on from people already with it.
