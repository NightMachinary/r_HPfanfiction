..... Magical veins? lol.

Consider the difference between having the magical ability, and being able to channel that magic outward (into a wand etc). Also, I guess it depends on if you're arguing that magic is something the wizards possess innately or whether it's something they draw in from the outside every time they cast.

As long as you have a solid explanation backing yourself up, readers will take anything you make up :) ... or if it sounds complicated enough that no one understands any of it, I guess they would accept that too. XD
