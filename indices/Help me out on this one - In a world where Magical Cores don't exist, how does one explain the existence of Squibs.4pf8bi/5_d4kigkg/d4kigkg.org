This is purely my head cannon but it might help you out. Magic is an energy/force that permeates the world. Every single person in the world has a connection to this magic. Think of it as a pipe/thread/bond or whatever makes sense for you. Somewhere in the middle of that pipe/thread/bond, with a human on one end and magic on the other, is a valve. The position of that valve affects how much magic flows through the pipe/thread/bond to that individual.

- Valve closed: the person is a non-magical.

- Valve partially open: the person is a squib, able to perceive magic but unable to use it.

- Valve is open: the person is a magical.
