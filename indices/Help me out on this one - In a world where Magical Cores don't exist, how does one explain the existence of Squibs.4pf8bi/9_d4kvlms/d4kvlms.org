In one of my fics that went nowhere, I delved into the matter of magic and how it comes to be. Magic, as a force in the HP universe, is symbol, need, desire becoming matter and energy. There are several origin stories for magic in the fandom, but my favorites are always those that don't try to explain magic, because it simply cannot be explained in a way our senses and brain can grasp.

It can be narrowed down - framed, if you will. People find boundaries, but we also see that these boundaries are not as strict as someone like Hermione wants us to believe. The Avada Kedavra is always deadly, cannot be blocked - Not always, though. Rules are established; wand-movements, incantations, recipes and timings, but those rules only tell us about the frame of magic, not whats within it.

Or, like Aurora says to Hermione in my fic: "Magic is all and everything, anything you want and nothing if you don't believe it. Logic has no place with magic. Magic doesn't do the science with you - it defies it, mocks it and changes just to spite the researcher who tries to shackle it down and define it."

So, the answer given to your question was quite accurate. "Lol dunno" is probably how the wizarding world has dealt with the matter for the entirety of its existence.

But to give you an inspiration, here is how one of the books in the mentioned fic describes it:

/Magic as a force establishes itself in a sentient being by giving it the potential ability to distort current realities. Its will shall be done by its will alone. Magic is nature, and above it and more beyond it. Those who wield it are beyond nature and at the same time, deeper within it; masters and servants, Kings and peasants at the same time./

/Those without magic are independent and suffer for it. Nature punishes those with the potential to free themselves from it. Disease, early death, lethal wounds, frail bodies are but a few things deadlier to those without magic, without nature within them. Instead of the singularity of nature which the magical beings are part of, those without magic live in duality with it./

/The ones in the middle, the wolfs and owls and monkeys, with the squibs representing our own, the human, live in limbo between the outside and inside. They are aware of their exile from the singularity of nature, almost teased by it - mocked as the odd one out by granting them just enough access to see their outsider life for what it is. Pity them for they see the Lethifold hunting them, but not the weapon that would be their saving grace./
