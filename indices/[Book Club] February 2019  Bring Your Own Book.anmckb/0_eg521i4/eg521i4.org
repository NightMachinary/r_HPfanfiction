I was just re-reading The Eyes. This story could easily be published in one of those Lovecraftian yearly almanacs. It's a great horror with very little gore. It's scary because things so familiar to us as Harry Potter fanfiction readers reveal the terror that was inside them all along. The poetic use of homonyms is another reason to love this story.
