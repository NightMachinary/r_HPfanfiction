"Nothing scares me anymore"

It is undoubtedly an odd story, an AU where Tonks is some kind of well-meaning "shadow monster" and Lavender Brown apparently a Muggle. It is not the usual fanfic but more akin to the kind of stories told in the Magical World (eg three brothers). At the same time, it still feels somewhat in character and for a short oneshot, I have seen way worse. It won't win any Nobel prices, but it is the good kind of different.
