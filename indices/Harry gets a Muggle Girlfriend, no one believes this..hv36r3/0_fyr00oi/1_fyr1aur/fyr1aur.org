I've actually been working on an idea like this with a Sailor Moon crossover. Harry starts dating Minako before she returns to Japan.

Writing the two of them being sickeningly sweet is tooth rotting fun.

Writing Hermione's observations of just how /happy/ she makes Harry while Ron just goes "Wow, she's pretty, lucky you mate!" Is hilarious fun.
