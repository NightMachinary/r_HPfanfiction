They're completely different systems, and I'm not really focusing on the Sailor Moon side of things. There's some references to where they are in the story, but Harry is largely staying out of the Senshi's fights just like they're staying out of his.

They're over 5,000 miles away from each other after all, aside from some short moments of Minako visiting Hogwarts, specifically for the Yule Ball, and Harry running to Japan for a while after 4th year, he's not going to really interact with their fights.

He will however be subject to the most terrifying grilling of his life from Minako's closest friends, two cats, and possibly infuriatingly annoying remarks by Chibi-Moon.
