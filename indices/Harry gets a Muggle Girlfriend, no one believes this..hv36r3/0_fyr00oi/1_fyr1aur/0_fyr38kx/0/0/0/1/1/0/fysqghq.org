Nope, this was my introduction to Ranma, and it did it well. It's a small section and leads into how Harry and Usagi meet, but there's nothing to make you hopelessly lost while reading it. He even explains the mechanics so you don't need to go on a wiki dive to learn about it.

Ranma shows up again later on, but his story isn't a big enough part of it to leave you lost.
