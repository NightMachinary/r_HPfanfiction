I'll second the recommendation for The Girl Who Loved and its sequel. Another HP/SM story I like is linkffn(Tuxedo Harry by Benneducci). It's unfinished, unfortunately.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Senshi of Love by fitzgerald) is the only other one I've read, and I didn't think it was as good. It's a one-shot, and seems too abrupt. Being longer could have really helped it, I think.
