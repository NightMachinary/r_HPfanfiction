The girlfriend is not a muggle but one of the name-only Ravenclaws, yet there is very little mention of magic and it is mostly summer fluff, teenagers acting as such and period-accurate pop-culture (as far as I can tell).

It is perhaps not the best fanfic ever written, but it is the perfect read after one too many IndyHarry fics where he becomes Lord Potter and gets a harem after Sirius died. One of my all-time favourites exactly for that reason.
