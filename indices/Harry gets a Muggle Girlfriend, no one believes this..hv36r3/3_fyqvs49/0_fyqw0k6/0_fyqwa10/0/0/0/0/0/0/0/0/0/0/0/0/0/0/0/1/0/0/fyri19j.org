Twist 21:

All this was in actuality the result of a legilimency feedback loop caused by voldemort's horcrux attempting to possess voldemort and voldemort attempting to possess Harry, resulting in him trying to possess himself and falling into a coma. Harry is a normal wizard who occasionally has visions of this world from the feedback-looped dreaming Horcrux nobody has ever detected and chooses to write them down for a quibbler column.
