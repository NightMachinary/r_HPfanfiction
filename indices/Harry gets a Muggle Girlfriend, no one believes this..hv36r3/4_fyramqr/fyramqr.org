Is it the coffee shop girl from the 6th movie? Because that would get my thumbs up.

But really, for a series where the good guys tout the idea of wizards and muggles getting together being an OK thing, you'd think they'd show that more. The first Fantastic Beasts movie was really the only time they really showed muggle/wizard friendships. Sequel too.
