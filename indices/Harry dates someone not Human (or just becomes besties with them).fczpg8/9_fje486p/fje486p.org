Linkao3(14340108) It's a Harry/Fred/George, it's slow burn so there's no relationship yet. It doesn't fill your requirements, but Harry works in a pub in Knockturn Alley, where there is a lot a creatures, he befriends some of them, he talks with them about a lot of things, it's pretty interesting. The same author has a fic where Harry gets a creature inheritance
