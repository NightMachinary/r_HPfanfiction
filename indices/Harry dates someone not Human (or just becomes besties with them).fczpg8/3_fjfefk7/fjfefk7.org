Not exactly dating or besties, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept) , Harry ends up adopting the dragon Hagrid hatched as a daughter, though he does treat her more as a peer than as a child.

It just so happens to be that the dragon is closer to /Dungeons & Dragons/ and /Shadowrun/ dragons than the dragons of the original lore, and while Harry certainly considers her a threat due to her raw ability, he never really treats her differently than how he really treats anybody else beyond being a little more empathetic and understanding.
