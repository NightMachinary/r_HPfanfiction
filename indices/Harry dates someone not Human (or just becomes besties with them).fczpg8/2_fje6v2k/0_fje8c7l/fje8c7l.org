I have no idea. I read it half an age ago and I've forgotten much of everything else to do with it. Literally all I remember is that he picked up a punk-looking girl somewhere and she turned out to be a werewolf and he was kind of like "Eh, we'll get you a cage for the full moon. Shit'll be aight." about the whole situation.

She kind of reminded me (at least what I remember of her does) of the Kitty OC from Behind Blue Eyes, if that helps at all?
