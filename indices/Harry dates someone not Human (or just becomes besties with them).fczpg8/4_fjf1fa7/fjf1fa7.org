Blood Crest by Cauchy where Harry befriends vampires, hags, wws and inferi-ghost

That slightly edgy fic where Harry is prophesized to be the Alpha(no omega alpha bullshit) Lord who takes more than equal rights for beasts and beings, just search for alpha lord in ao3 maybe? ~~+spoilers he annihilates all of wizarding population in the end/ the human part at least+~~
