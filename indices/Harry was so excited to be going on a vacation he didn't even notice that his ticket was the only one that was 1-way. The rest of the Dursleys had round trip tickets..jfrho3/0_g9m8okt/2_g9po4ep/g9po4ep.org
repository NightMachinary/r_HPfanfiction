Mostly a pretty amusing fic, though notably not one chapter involving a canon HP character other than Harry himself has been any good, it also kinda feels like the author doesn't actually like the series (stuff like wizards being actually just wrong about magic, bashing all the canon characters who show up, apart from Luna who's at her fanon worst).\\
Pity too because there's a lot of fun stuff too when the author is just making up fun crossover interaction and divine poker nights.
