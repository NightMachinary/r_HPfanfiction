/Queens, New York/

​

Harry felt fear. 

Vernon had dragged him to this abandoned alley; the only life coming from the rats scuttling here and there. It wasn't dark nor scary as it was still day and the alley he dragged him to wasn't quite narrow. Yet, somehow, Harry felt this squeezing feeling, this intense foreboding of something about to happen. 

He often was right with his inaccurate hunches.

“Stay here,” Vernon spat at the shaking boy. At that, Harry braced himself, wielding the tiny shred of courage he had left, to look directly at his eyes.

“What?” 

“Stay here”

Harry blinked, confused at the remark, “Why? Until when?”

Vernon said nothing and turned around. A horrible inkling treaded its way to Harry's mind and a voice whispered in its ear

/He's going to leave you alone/

“You're going to leave me aren't you?... But why?” Harry whispered. Despite their cruel nature and treatment to him, they still held his shelter and food. Without them, Harry wouldn't know what to do or where to go.

Vernon laughed. His eyes prickled with tears as if this was the funniest joke he has ever heard. For Harry, he felt slowly destroyed. They were going to abandon him, leave him here to rot. Just like Vernon, Harry's eyes started to prickle with tears but not for the same reason.

The more he laughed, the more Harry felt despair grow stronger within him. The alley no longer looked bland or normal, it's slowly going narrow. He couldn't breathe anymore. It was suddenly all so narrow, so tight. He wanted to run away, lash out, but that would mean death.

Despite being so young, he knew a lot already. He knew he would die with nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep. He knew he would be vulnerable, more so from here on because at least with the hurtful home he has with the Durselys, they gave him his cupboard which held warmth. His cupboard would never harm him. It was where he could be open and cry about the world.

From here on, there would be nothing and he was afraid. He had heard of those horror stories his classmates had told him, of evil men who stole children and kill them. 

Harry closed his eyes and let the tears flow down his cheek.

“You? Why would I want to keep a freak in my household! Listen here boy, the moment I saw you I hated you and wanted nothing to do with you, in fact, if you die right here I would be happy! Good riddance!” Vernon's voice boomed in the alley, making the hair on the whimpering boy rise.

And in one sudden turn, his mocking joy turned to absolute scorn. 

“You brought nothing but taint to my household”

Vernon raised his hand, about to hit the boy but as he was about to swing his palm, a woman's scream echoed through the alley. 

“/STOP! GETAWAY FROM HIM!/”

Harry's eyes flew up and there he saw her. A woman, whose face stricken in horror, running towards him, the bags she was carrying all sprawled across the floor. She immediately enveloped him in her hug and for once, despite being uncomfortable in an adult's arms, he felt hope.

A small hope that maybe she wouldn't hurt him. Right? 

Missus Abernathy, his preschool teacher, use to tell him of how superheroes, saviours, would never hurt anyone. She told him all these stories and fantasies that he so loved. He missed her dearly when she left. That was the second time Harry felt abandonment. 

This one, was a saviour /right/?

Footsteps were heard and Harry knew, with his inaccurate hunches, that Vernon has left.
