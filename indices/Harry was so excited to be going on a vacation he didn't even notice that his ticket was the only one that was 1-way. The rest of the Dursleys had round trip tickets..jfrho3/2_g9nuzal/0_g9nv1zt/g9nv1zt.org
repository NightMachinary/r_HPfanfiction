“Hey, got the key?” Harry grumbled. His day was awful, not only did he just receive a hefty load of homework to do but the new star wars lego set he was going to order got sold out.

“It's in the last pocket in my backpack,” Peter replied, turning around for Harry to get easier access to his bag.

Harry fished out the key and opened the door.

“Hey May,” both of them said in unison as they dropped their belongings in the table.

“How's school today?” 

“Okay,” Peter mumbled, stretching his back from the pain of his heavy backpack.

“And there's this crazy car outside---“ Harry continued but his words fell to nothing as both boys suddenly noticed a familiar stranger in their household. Right there, beside their aunt May, was Tony Stark, eating their Aunt May's date loaf on their couch.

The /Tony Stark./

"Mr Parker, Mr Potter,” The man smiled, his hand on the date loaf that's slightly burnt in the side.

Both boys stared at each other before trying to say something, which ended in Harry piping up something unintelligible “,Uhm..wha---what's are you... uhm”

“I-I, I'm Peter, and this is my brother Harry,” Peter continued, gesturing to himself and his still gobsmacked brother.

“Tony”

Harry, trying to salvage his busted dignity, lightly coughed and straightened his back to look composed, “What... err.. what are you doing here?”

Tony smiled, his eyes amused at the two flustered boys especially in their pitiful attempts at hiding it “, About time we met, you both got my emails right?”

“Yeah...?” Harry said unsurely, of which Peter hit him subtly with his elbow. He glared at his brother.

“Yeah, yeah, Harry meant yeah, regarding the---?”

“You both never told me about the grant,” Aunt May piped in. Her genuine smile easing the stutters in their words, and the nervousness in their hearts.

“About the grant”

“The September Foundation,” Tony supplied.

“Right”

“Remember when you both applied?”

Peter looked at Harry who spoke up for both of them, “Yeah?”

“I approved, so now we're in business”

Aunt May suddenly gasped, her eyes excited as she narrowed her eyes playfully at his two boys, her finger pointing at them mockingly “, But you never told me anything, what's up with that? Are my two mischievous boys now keeping secrets from me?”

“Well...Well we just knew how much you love surprises so Harry and I---uh...“

“So we thought we would let you know... the--- anyway what did we apply for?” Harry asked, his face looking unsure at

Mr Stark. 

“That's what we're here to hash out”

Tony closed the door behind them, “As for walnut date loaves go, that wasn't so bad” He surveyed the room, each glance looking inquisitively at everything. From the blue bunk beds littered with homework, to the messy rectangular study table with the various wires, and the dated computer sitting in the middle of it.

“Ah! What do we have here, retro-tech huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?” 

“Oh, ah the garbage---“

“You're both dumpster divers”

“Yeah, we are...,” Peter tried to continue but suddenly felt helpless, he looked towards Harry to continue the discussion.

“Uhm, we uh...we definitely did not apply for your grant---“

“Nah uh, me first,” Tony interrupted, “Quick questions of the rhetorical variety”

Tony fished out his phone, raised it, and; without even looking at the screen, pressed a button that immediately displayed a small hologram of an image---no, a paused video of Peter and Harry in their respective hand-tailored suits.

In another tap, the video played and zoomed into the scene of Peter swinging around the building.

“That's you isn't it?” Tony remarked, his eyes staring at the nervous boy, clearly enjoying his subtle attempts at denying it.

“No, no, what---er..what do, what do you mean?”

Tony smirked and looked again at the hologram. It was now zoomed in to Harry subtly waving his hand to move a detached car door that was being hurled at Peter's way.

“And, I suppose that's you”

Harry gulped, his eyes betraying his agitation, “Of course not, I can't, I can't do that, that's a err.. clearly a, just a look-a-like of me, which is--- is which yes, impressive because doppelgängers are rare, kinda rare? rare? yes”

The hologram zoomed out to see Peter grabbing Harry and lifting him up away to the building. Afterwards, Harry grabbed a random abandoned jacked in the ground and sent it hurling through their enemies, wrapping around their faces with only a mere wave of his hand.

The attempt at denial continued for a few minutes before Tony found a small secret hatch at the ceiling that exposed both of their poorly made suits. And at speeds Harry only saw when they were fighting crime together, Peter immediately lunged to their suits before hiding it behind his back. He crossed his arms in an attempt to look as if nothing happened at all.

Tony backed up his steps to get a good look at the both of them before looking straight at Peter, “So you're the spiderling,” and then to Harry, “And the wizardling or is it the magic boy?”

Harry and Peter stared at each other.

For some reason, Harry's inaccurate hunches were telling him that something was about to change. Meanwhile, Peter's spider senses mirrored the same feeling.
