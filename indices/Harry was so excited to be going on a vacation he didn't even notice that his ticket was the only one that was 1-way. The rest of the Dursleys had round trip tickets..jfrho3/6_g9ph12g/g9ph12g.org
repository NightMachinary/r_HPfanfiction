Personally I'd love a story where Harry is left somewhere in France and discovered by the Delacours... or the Veela coven. Fleur (and Gabrielle) - or her parents - may come upon him while out walking, or Harry finds their house.

Or what Vernon think is somewhere without anything for miles, is really the hidden-from-muggles estate of the Delacourts or the mountains(?) of Appoline's Veela Coven.
