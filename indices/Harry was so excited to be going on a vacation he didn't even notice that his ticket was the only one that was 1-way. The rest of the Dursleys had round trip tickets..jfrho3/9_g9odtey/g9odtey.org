I know I read one where the Dursleys leave Harry at a British campsite. With a little luck, some trial and error, plus magic kicking in, he learns to fend for himself and does a great job of it. But he decides he is a wood elf, related to house elves (after all, the Dursleys had made him work like one), which leads to interesting times when the Hogwarts crew catches up with him.
