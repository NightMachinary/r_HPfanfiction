A oneshot where the Dursleys abandon Harry in the Australian outback. It's a one shot and reading it is a rather nice experience.

Edit: Whoops just realized this is a prompt!

I'll give it a shot. I hope I pulled off a forest gumpy vibe.

Looking back, Harry Potter firmly believes he wouldn't change a thing in the world. Not having to cook and clean for those awful Dursleys, not having to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, not even having to deal with Harry huntings.

No, because in the end, Harry found something greater than all those things combined.

When his uncle had dragged him from the garden, ordered him to pack up everything he owned (which wasn't much), and gave him a ticket with the express order not to lose it... Well, Harry had been more than eager to comply. He couldn't read much back then, he was only 4 and a half. But he recognized the words on the slip of paper from an ad he saw on the TV while dusting the mantle off.

"MADELINE TOURS PROMISES AN AMAZING, SPECTACULAR VACATION FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA"

In hind sight, maybe that was the ad that finally ignited the fuse in Vernon Dursley. Because less than a week later he'd booked a tour with the Madeline company and off they went.

Harry had been ecstatic, what kid wouldn't? It'd be his first vacation! He'd get to see a big city! And the ad promised it would be an amazing and spectacular experience!

But the second they landed, Vernon dropped off his wife and son in a nice hotel and ordered Harry back into the rental car. Confused, he followed along. They drove for hours and hours. The afternoon turned to night. And then, on a dusty road in the middle of nowhere, Vernon made Harry get out the car. He shoved his bag into the boy's arms, told him to stay put. Then he got back into the drivers seat, slammed the door, and sped away.

And that's how Harry Potter found himself abandoned on the highway, halfway across the globe from the land of his birth, with only the clothes on his back and a plastic bag full of all his earthly belongings.

Alone and utterly lost, he did exactly what Vernon told him to do. He stayed put. At first, he thought his uncle would come back any minute now, and he feared the punishment he'd get if he moved. He'd hate it if he ruined this awesome, spectacular trip before it even began! But as the night turned to morning, he got hungry, and tired, and upset. And... It was starting to dawn on him that his uncle may not be coming back...

So, when an old Volkswagen van stopped on the highway, and a bunch of hippies came pouring out the back asking him if he was okay: he started bawling. They couldn't just leave a crying kid stranded on the high way, so they promised to take him to the nearest town.

Harry, didn't exactly believe them. After all, the Madeline company lied. This was certainly /not/ an amazing, spectacular vacation. But after a while his needs got the best of him and he climbed in with them.

They introduced him to vintage music, to dream catchers, to radical socio-politico-economic ideologies, to lava lamps, and other generic hippy things. Including some interesting vegtables in baggies that Harry had never cooked with before. Then again, the Dursley family wasn't big on eating healthy, so he wasn't too surprised.

They drove and drove until they found a small town. But for some reason no one was willing to go into the sheriffs office with him. Or even remotely near it. So instead they dropped him off a few blocks away and sped off.

Harry had shrugged, putting some of the stuff they gave him into his bag. It was only a dream catcher and a peace sign bookmark, but it was pretty cool.

Then he continued on until he got to the sheriffs office. Except, he didn't, because he got distracted by a big, fancy bus feuling up at the petrol pump. He'd never seen something like it before. It had bold letters painted against its shiny black body. It read:

"AC/DC"

And, what was even cooler, it had the lighting bolt between the letters! Just like the scar on his forehead! And, because Harry was a curious boy with nothing else to do and no where he particularly wanted to be, he went to get a closer look. And, because the door was opened, he climbed inside.

It was super cool! It looked more like a lounge to party in than a bus!

And the seats looked so comfortable too... And he was so tired... So Harry climbed onto a velvet lined seat, laid down, and dozed off.

Hours later 4 famous band members would find a 4 and a half year old boy at the back of their bus. They would freak out, he would freak out, but at the end of the day there wasn't much anyone could do. They were already halfway to Denver and turning around would cause them to miss their show. And, seeing as Harry Potter had no idea where the Dursleys were right then and had no interest in going back to them, everyone decided to just go with it.

They promised him it would be a fun trip as long as he didn't tell the cops.

So that's how Harry Potter ending up touring with AC/DC, as an unofficial mascot of sorts. At some point, lighting bolt scars became rather fashionable amongst the AC/DC fans, and Harry ended up signing many, many peoples foreheads where they had drawn on their own lightning bolt.

With them, he had seen Denver, then Kansas City, and then Minneapolis, along with so much more! But after that the band would be going to Winnipeg, and no one wanted to have to explain to border Patrol why there was a random little kid on their bus.

So, they parted ways in Minnesota and that was that. Harry added a few signed photos of him and the crew, and a lucky guitar pick to his little bag.

From there the boy hitchhiked his way across the states.

He met a 89 year old man on the run for tax fraud who promised him he'd teach him how to swindle like hell. And he did.

He chatted with a family of Amish as he rode with them in their horse drawn carriage, they promised him they'd teach him to drive a horse and raise a barn. And they did.

He met a king who promised him he had the scariest stories to tell. And he did. Harry was happy to suggest changes though. Who cares about a boring murderer when a cursed clown is so much better?

By the time he'd finished talking about clowns though, he found he wasn't so scared of them anymore. Which is good because his next adventure would be with a travelling circus. They promised to teach him every thing from acrobatics to knife throwing. And, unsurprisingly, they did.

As he touched each person's life, they'd give him a small token to take with him, and soon enough his bag was filled with things from his journeys. In a small rucksack was all his earthly possessions, but he thought it was better than anything else. Not even a castle could compare.

Harry aplologized to the Madeline company then. He said that they lied, that they didn't show him an amazing or spectacular time. But he'd clearly been proven wrong. They'd kept their promise, all right.

And as Harry Potter, now a full 5 years and a half, trots along the side of a highway at an easy pace, he knows he wouldn't change anything.

He didn't know it of course, and maybe never would. But in 5 and a half more years there would be thousands of letters and thousands of owls which would never make their way to him. After all, you can't put an address on a boy who's home is his own self and the single bag he carries.

But even if he did know, he probably wouldn't care much for Hogwarts and magic and prophecies. No, the road's all he needs.
