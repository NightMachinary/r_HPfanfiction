I think it depends on how magic works in your fanfic.

If magic flows on the inside of people's bodies whenever this is by a magical core, wizards somehow absorb it or it seeps from the soul of some such will drastically change on how it would go.

For example if your magic is from magical cores and it flows into the body, then you can do crazy shit with occlumency.

Just say, occlumency is the art on which you pour magic into your mind to create legimency shields. BUT now you have a brain with a fuckload of magic running though it, what happens when that occurs? Do they get smarter? Can they recall their memories better? How does the actual grey matter react to this?

Or if your magic is less powerfull and it's never on the wizards body and they are just manipulating the magic around them, then maybe occlumency is just a way of thinking and a trained method you can use to detect if anyone is digging in your mind and how to counter such by thinking in specific ways. Perhaps even muggles can learn occlumency then?
