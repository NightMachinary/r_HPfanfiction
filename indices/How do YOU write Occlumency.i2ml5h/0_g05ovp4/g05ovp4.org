Quoting my previous post on the topic:

  What do you think a good system of legilimency/occlumency is? I find the "mindscape" system to be the worst and making no sense whatsoever. Of course nothing is going to make perfect sense in a story about magic, but I find that "mindscapes are too much". People create a world in their mind that they have perfect control over and place traps. Legilimency users use legilimency to enter this world and fight these traps while the occlumency user defends. What? Why on earth would you bother creating more traps when you can literally change the world around the legilimency user to force them out? Why on earth would you even place memories out in the open as opposed to a vault? This is only the tip of the iceberg as well.

  For me, I think the best system of mind magic is similar to that in canon with a few changes. Legilimency views memories (and only episodic ones to boot) at the same rate as real time, so one can't simply view another's entire life in 2 minutes. It also provides a good explanation as to why people don't learn via legilimency. Why bother learning from someone else's tainted (via their emotions, separate way of thinking, etc) memories when you can learn yourself? Occulumency is about clearing your mind and mastering your emotions. Why? Legilimency works by having the caster (wandless, nonverbal legilimency works by casting the spell) use emotions to bring up memories. If Snape wanted to view memories of Harry's childhood, he'd likely bring up feelings of happiness, security, and of home in Harry only to fail because it would bring up nothing. A trained occlumency user would spend the time clearing their mind or focusing on different emotions/memories and if they get a good enough control over their emotions, they force the legilimency user out.
