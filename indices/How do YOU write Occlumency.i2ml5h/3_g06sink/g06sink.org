There was a thread on this about a week ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hxuv8v/whats_the_most_interesting_interpretation_of/]] .

*My headcanon* (copied from that thread):

More generally, I think that the best interpretations of Occlumency are the ones that treat it as a /dynamic/ process rather than a /static/ defence: not a suit of armour but a parrying dagger. The following is a repost with edits of something I had written up a while ago.

My model for Legilimency is basically an interrogation with an element of torture. However, it's conducted not with words and physical actions but with qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.). Occlumency is then training in resisting this type of interrogation and torture.

The Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a magical channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster. Through this channel, the Legilimens can inject qualia into the target's mind and read the reaction qualia. That's only the beginning, however, because the Legilimens then needs to correctly interpret what they are reading and follow-up with whatever is needed. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads, and interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability, requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention a lot of practice.

Occlumency is the skill of identifying, dissociating from, and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing. More advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder. (This can be dangerous, to the point of the Occlumens forgetting which of their thoughts are real and which are forgeries. To quote /A Scarlet Letter/, "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.")

A hostile Legilimens trying to break through---assuming that they don't care about being noticed and the target doesn't have a way of breaking the connection---will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by the imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens. (It's worth keeping in mind that the Legilimens has to, in some sense, experience everything they are sending, and so, say, sending the notion of extreme pain hurts both sides about equally.)

Now, that means that unlike the Levitation Charm or riding a bike, Occlumency is not discrete skill that one learns and moves on. Rather, it is something that one /becomes/. To successfully resist an all-out attack by a skilled Legilimens, one must /be/ the sort of person who can, say, experience seeing, touching, and smelling a mutilated corpse of one's own best friend, sibling, or child (or worse) and shrug.

That, in turn, means that Occlumency training is inherently a painful and dangerous process. The instructor must necessarily expose the student to painful, disgusting, and disturbing qualia, because any attack that the student hasn't already experienced and learned to shrug off is one that may surprise them in the future. In other words, if it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong, and it may well be the case that the best Occlumency instructor is a sadist or a psychopath who is on your side. Becoming an Occlumens is therefore inherently traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

One aspect of Legilimency that favours defence is that Legilimency requires a functioning mind to interrogate, and drugs, sleep deprivation, and other things that might reduce an Occlumens's ability to resist will also tend to reduce the usefulness and the accuracy of the reading. (For a simple example, physically torturing an Occlumens would make it harder for them to maintain the presence of mind needed for Occlumency, but if all the Legilimens can get in response is "Ow, it hurts!", it's not a very useful thing to do.)

Lastly, eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal". That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts. A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

The Memory Charm interacts with Occlumency in an interesting way. I imagine that it has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., "last 10 minutes") and specific memories. The first one is pretty easy, and it's what's used most of the time, though perhaps beyond half an hour or so, memories become increasingly integrated, and trying to target anything older than that risks hitting unrelated memories. The second targeting mode requires the target memory to be brought up using Legilimency. This makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without them noticing.

These mechanics have broader consequences, which I think are pretty consistent with HP canon. Since Legilimency is *hard*, there are usually much easier ways to extract information. Therefore, even people who could make use of it don't bother to learn it. This rarity of good Legilimences means that even people with secrets to keep are fine without Occlumency; and this, combined with the price of learning it means that few people learn Occlumency as well, even if they have the opportunity to.

*What Occlumency feels like to the Legilimens* (if the Occlumency is successful):

/Basic Occlumency:/ The Legilimens gets nothing. No matter what they probe, they just get placidity, neutrality, emptiness back. They might try to push some painful, scary, or disturbing qualia until they get some reaction, and then work from there. Still nothing.

/Mid-level Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, sending the stimuli to (they think) guide the Occlumens to the information they want, and getting back responses that they would expect, then once they have what they need, they terminate the spell and act on the information, discovering too late that they'd been terribly deceived about that last bit of information.

/Advanced Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, but hits a roadblock, and gets an idea to make the Occlumens think that they are no longer being interrogated so that they would let their guard down. They project a perception of them ending the spell in frustration and turning away. They then project the perception of the Occlumens slipping their bonds and somehow overcoming the Full Body Bind they are under. Then the perception of the Occlumens "ambushing" them, knocking them out and stealing their wand (in some order)...

When the Legilimens later wakes up (if they wake up) they will probably be able to reconstruct (if they hadn't been Obliviated) that the idea of making the target thinking that they had escaped had probably been injected by the Occlumens in the first place. Then as they were busy confabulating the perception they were sending to the Occlumens about the Occlumens escaping, the Occlumens had somehow disrupted the mental separation between the Legilimens's imagination and their actions, and they never realised that they were actually untying the Legilimens, ending the Full Body Bind, handing them their wand, and turning their back.
