People tend to bring up "logic" here. Mindscapes dont make sense as occlumency is supposed to "occlude" or hide information. Having a defensible mindscape makes it a battle of wills, where the legimencer has to get through the defenses and find the memories.

What would make sense is learning to show false memories, or think of something random and not being influenced by the legimencer. Thereby "hiding" the important memories.

(Would Voldemort ever alow Snape to keep up mindshield/defenses when he wants to read his mind?)

This however doesn't make mindmagic interesting in itself, -and as seen in canon from Snape it does not supress emotions.

But mindscapes can be interresting to explore, cool defenses, interresting memory sorting etc.

(You can ofc do both, false memories outside the "shield") But in the end it depends on what YOU want occlumency to do.

Should your Mc hide he knows occlumency and hide important memories? Or should he block all access to his mind?
