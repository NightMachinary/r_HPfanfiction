HAHA that's so funny---I'd love to read it when you post. I love the idea of canon AU staring in OotP.

Lolol I kind of do hate Snape's guts in canon, but I've read quite a few Snape-centric romances that I loved, so I'm psyched for yours.

Snape is going to play an increasingly important role in my fic, and I'm definitely tinkering with his canon representation because otherwise I'd probably want to punch him.
