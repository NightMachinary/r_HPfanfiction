Dude the fic I'm working on is going to have a lot of mind magic, so I've been thinking SO MUCH about it and developed a whole system for how I want Legilimency and Occlumency to work. I think that's probably a good idea---figuring out the system and distinctions beforehand so you have a framework to work in.

The way I imagine it (if you're interested---this is going to get long) there are two types of Occlumency, but first I distinguish between two types of thoughts. You have your top layer thoughts, which is your stream of consciousness, and then you have your memories.

In terms of Occlumency, the easier, basic option is that by clearing your mind of emotions you're essentially erecting like, a bubble or a clay wall around your brain? That includes around your stream of consciousness.

Of course, if the person is good at Legilimency, or if you're not very good at Occlumency, they'll be able to find cracks in the bubble (I.e., cracks in your emotional composure) and burrow into your brain from there. Memories especially are connected with strong emotion, so the more emotions the Legilimens can access, the easier it is for them to see memories. Also, if you're relaxed, the bubble is more flexible and has more give, and so it's harder to get in.

You could also erect this bubble over specific memories, or just your memories as a whole, leaving your stream of consciousness visible. This is all depending on who is reading your mind and whether or not you're submitting voluntarily.

The second level of Occlumency is the addition of fake/inane content on top of the bubble shield. This is useful in the Snape/Voldemort situation. I don't doubt Voldemort constantly wanted to read his followers' minds, and Snape would have to make it seem like he was voluntarily showing Voldemort His thoughts while hiding his true ones.

This basically involves either creating a fake thought/memory or bringing up an existing boring/unrelated memory, and pasting it on to the Occlumency shield in a way that makes it appear natural to the Legilimens. This of course takes practice, preferably with a person capable of reading your mind.

Once a person is in your brain rummaging through your memories, it's much harder to get them out than it was to keep them out in the first place. You literally have to set up this bubble wall thing right in front of the memories they're trying to get at, and slowly squeeze them out through emotional detachment. Like squeezing toothpaste.

I have a whole thing about how Legilimency works as well. I know some of this isn't canon, but this just works best for my fic.

Now, shameless self promotion here: i included a whole thing about my Legilimency theory in the Author's Note at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13648964/3/Lacuna][this chapter of]] my own fic. Obviously I'd love it if you could read the fic (again, shameless, sorry) but either way you might find my Legilimency schpeel interesting.
