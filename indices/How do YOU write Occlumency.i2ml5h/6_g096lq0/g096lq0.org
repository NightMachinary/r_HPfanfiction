So as a reader I'm actually a big fan of mind magic, I think it's awesome and I love the idea of mastering your own mind with occulomency. I always imagined it a little like pinball. The legimmens has only minimal control over what they see and are affected by the obstacles. The better a legimmens is, the more control they have. Think stream of consciousness, a legimmens suggests the thought of my sister and that has associations and off we go. Meanwhile, being an occulumens allows you to set up the "obstacles". The first step would be to clear the board of the natural associations you have so that a legimmens doesn't have those associations to follow, they kinda just get stuck. But true masters (like Snape would need to be to fool Voldemort) are able to set up fake associations to display false or misleading memories. Like associating Harry with hate and scorn and Dumbledore with foolishness and disgust. I think keeping those associations together would actually likely have some harm on the psyche. It would be an interesting topic to explore.

That's how I would write it if I did any writing, but as a reader I'll admit that I've always enjoy the mindscape depictions.
