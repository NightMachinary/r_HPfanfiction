Yeah. Happy to help:)

Look, I'll straight out say that rarely anyone I've seen hates Ronald more than me, but in this fic, Hermione starts out with Ronald but then breaks off very amicably and the trio remain friends. Ron is very helpful throughout. Harry and Hermione are very much in character and nice to read too.

Regarding the summary, I'll say this to not spoil it: Harry finds an unexpected ally in the form of his new dada teacher. Harmony together explore new, mysterious magic forgotten long ago originated from Egypt.

And yes, it's a happy ending.

Read it mate. It's the best DH replacement story I've ever read, to be honest.
