I have been reading this one lately and absolutely loving it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19865440?view_adult=true&view_full_work=true]]

I'm hooked. It's a HHR /really/ slow-burn but totally worth it. The plot is really good and the characterisation is fantastic. It's the fanfic I never even realised I needed to read because it deals with a lot of stuff that Rowling should have dealt with but didn't.
