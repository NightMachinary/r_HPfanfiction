Year 7 actions only showed up as flashback in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), but it turned out to be extremely traumatic for the Trio, so traumatic that they got together despite their families's strong opposition.

If you don't mind non-magical setting, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is the story you want to read. [[/spoiler][After Dumbledore's demise, the Trio and Order quickly figured out it was the old KGB "shoot your own guy, gain enemy's trust" trick. Before the start of the next school term, they managed to kill a significant number of Death Eaters and destroy several bases, forcing Riddle into a severe personnel and logistic bottleneck. The Trio could even afford to return to Hogwarts with Snape and Carrows in charge. The Trio turned up publicly at the Ministry, stole the Locket from Umbridge, and even managed to kill Avery and Yaxley. Riddle only made his next move after a few months of preparations...]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), involves a different Trio (Theo Nott instead of Ron) on their own guerrilla war. They killed very large number of their enemies and were in pretty bad shape at the end.

On the other hand, Harrymort had great fun dispatching Death Eaters in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), and fully exposing how stupid the idea of Taboo was:

  Dear Lord Voldemort,

  You may wonder why I, Harry Potter, have written you this letter. There are a few reasons for this.

  First, I would like to inform you that my associate has brewed a cauldron of polyjuice potion, while I have kidnapped several of your Death Eaters. Further, we just followed this owl to your base.

  By the time you've finished this letter, it will be too late.

  Love,

  Harry Potter

Meanwhile at Hogwarts:

  Ginevra spun in place, short hair twirling around her head like a dress. "Welcome to the Chamber of Secrets!"

  Hermione glanced around. "So you're really the Heiress? I'd just assumed you had caught Harry's sense of humor."

  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying.”
