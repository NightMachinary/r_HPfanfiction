I'm trying to conceive of a reason for a good guy to be a mass murdering psycopath and I think I've got it.

Your job is to kill everyone. To this end we guarantee a good afterlife for anyone you kill or your minions kill on your behalf. Forgiveness and rehabilitation for people who would have gone to hell, straight to heaven for everyone else. Anyone you don't kill is likely to be worse off for it. You have to keep this a secret or you lose the power.
