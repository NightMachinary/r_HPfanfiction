I like it. Though, I think it'll be more interesting if he was at Greengrass manor when he gets the vision. Then, it can be some sort of horror show (like Coraline) where he is playing a game with the family while trying to escape. They ask if he is hungry, Harry says he already ate. Harry asks for some floo powder to let Sirius know he is ok. They say they ran out. Etcetera, etcetera...

Pretty soon Harry climbs out the bathroom window and makes a break for the manor gates. The Greengrass house elves find out and form a human barricade at the gates while the Greengrass family chases behind him.
