I don't know why I'm arguing this point with someone who hasn't even read the story.

No story could tell the full story of anyone's life. (How many stories have you read that tell of all the times the character stubs her toe, brushes her teeth, defecates, goes down on her lover, etc.)

An origins story is a largely chronological tale describing the foundational elements that define who a character is in the present. LdS spends north of 100k words doing this. I think by anyone else's standards, it at least contains an origin story if not being one itself.
