  I've started writing at least a dozen fanfics and one or two original books, and never get past the first few thousand words. I think up an amazing plot and want to write it but I just get bored

Writing is work. It is not some whimsical easy-breezy thing that just happens because. Think of it more like exercising than anything else. Do most people want to go on a five mile run? There are times when you have to make yourself do it. Motivation and what not is bullshit.

You seem to have some issues with scale too. I don't mean to sound more dickish than I usually do. But a few thousand words is nothing. I can write a few thousand words in an hour. But that's not really relevant. I've often said that it takes me about 40-50 'work hours' to plan/write/edit a 7500-10k word chapter. Of that, probably half of it is the 'writing' portion.

Writing is a process. It takes a great deal of time and effort. Yes, there are parts that are easy and I breeze through, but there are also parts that are hard and the only reason they get completed is because I sit down and do the work.

As a whole I like the effort. I like the feeling of working through it and the accomplishment of completing it. But what most people don't ever realize is the true amount of effort that it takes.

Ideas are a dime a dozen. I have hundreds I'll never pen to paper because i find them less interesting than what I'm currently working on. ideas are utterly irrelevant without the effort.
