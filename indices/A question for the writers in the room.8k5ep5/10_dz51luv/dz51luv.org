If you quickly lose interest after the first few thousand words, I wonder if you have an endgame and if you do, how satisfied are you with it? I'll list some of Stephen King's advice on writing (he's one of my favorite authors):

- Write every single day
- Take your writing seriously
- Write primarily for yourself
- Take risks; don't play it safe
- When writing, disconnect from the rest of the world
