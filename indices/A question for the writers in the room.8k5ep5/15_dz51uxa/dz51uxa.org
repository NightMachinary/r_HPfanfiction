Personally I try to outline a bit, but that does't mean that is everything that'll happen or that I'll even end up using it. I use the [[http://www.iulianionescu.com/blog/master-outlining-and-tracking-tool-for-novels-v2-0/][MOTT]], which is a good tool to use I think. But for Harry Potter fanfiction I'd probably like to dedicate an arc for each season + 1 for the summer holidays and probably just make secondary notes for any potential Christmas holiday mini-arc. Some secondary changes to it could probably also be done though if you want.

When you've filled it out it should be easy enough to look at it as if you're checking off some boxes. A scene here, a chapter there. Etc.
