It sounds as if you want to be writing oneshots rather than multichapter stories.

But:

It's hard work. Fanfiction is easier than original fiction but it will still reflect the effort you put in. And the effort isn't in starting a story; that's the easy bit. It isn't always in finishing it. It's in getting through the middle. You have to be persistent.

I don't start posting a story until it's finished. My first story (which I now see isn't all that good and is being rewritten) took me about six months to write and it's about 45k words. My last one was about 85k words and took eight months. The one I'm on now has been dragging on for nearly two years though I didn't work on it for about a year and it's now being betaed but probably won't be posted for another three months. So you have to be patient as well.

It's seriously character building stuff.
