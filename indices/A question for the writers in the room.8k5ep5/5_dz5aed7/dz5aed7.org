If you're losing interest, then you're not writing about something that you're very interested in. Find something that really gets you excited and write about that. Race cars, capybaras, the mating habits of blue-footed boobies--find something that turns your crank. For me, that happens to be Harry Potter. It might not be for you and that's okay. There's a lot going on in the HP fic-a-verse and it's easy to be overwhelmed by thoughts of "Am I doing it right?" rather than focusing on telling the story you want to tell.

Before writing HP fic, I wrote a few in a couple of different anime fandoms and completely abandoned two multi-chapter stories. I didn't want the same thing to happen to HP, so I consciously limited myself to one-shots that I would finish. That might be something to consider. You can also start off small with maybe a 100-200 word drabble where you explore a single concept or a conversation between two characters.

Don't feel like you have to dive in with this enormous, LOTR-type epic. A well-done character study can be just as satisfying to read and write. Before you know it, you'll have all sorts of little building blocks that you can stick together and turn into a satisfying, cohesive story.
