Make sure you write all these ideas down! I'd recommend carrying a pocket notebook or using a note/writing app.

1. Now, if you've never written anything long before I would recommend starting out small. Yes, that big huge idea with lots of chapter/plot potential looks cool now, but it will quickly get overwhelming if you've never completed a project. So I would say try to stick to oneshots and get a few stories out. That feeling of finishing a piece is really satisfying and can be a great boost in your confidence and motivation!

2. Get in the habit of writing everyday. It doesn't have to be long, or relevant to any WIPs you have. But just having that discipline of consistent writing will help you in the long run. The only way to get good at writing is to do it- and do a lot of it. /Personally, I spend 15 minutes a day, on prompt(s)./ [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] currently has prompts for short stories everyday this month and is worth checking out! There's also plenty of prompts on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]]! If you don't want to do prompts then take one of those ideas churning in your head and just get something small written.

3. Planning: I know others have probably mentioned this but planning is optional with long stories. You need to have an outline of some kind. Some people do better detailing it down to the chapters, others do better with just having plot points. It is essential to have a beginning and end figured out. This way you have a clear view of where you are starting and where you need to end up. Next up, figure out a few key points you definitely must have, climax should also be planned. Now you can add more plot around these key points or begin going chapter by chapter in terms of planning. The more details you have before hand, the fewer plotholes you'll have and it'll be a great reference if you ever get stumped during the writing phase. This is also the best time to do any research. /If you can't power through getting an outline done, there's a good chance you won't be able to finish a long story./.

4. Know that masterpieces don't happen on the first draft. First draft is just writing so try not to stop or take few breaks. You will then need to edit...and edit... and edit again. A lot of your time will be spent rereading your chapters and revising. On one read through, I would recommend printing it out or reading it out loud to make sure the story and dialogue flow naturally. You can also get a beta if you want, who will read over each chapter and advise on grammar, formatting, etc. Depending on the beta, you may also be able to bounce ideas off them! They can also be a great source of motivation. Betas aren't for everyone though, so don't feel like it's a requirement!

5. Environment: I would also recommend having a quiet place you can go or be when you're writing. Make sure you're comfortable, and there aren't a lot of distractions- people, tv, etc. Some people even turn the internet off on their computers so they aren't tempted to web surf instead of write. Music is optional- most writers I know prefer background music, but it's always instrumental, and either nature noises or movie soundtracks. It's whatever works for you, without taking away from what you need to focus on.

6. The most important thing is to write what /you/ want. Not what others expect or demand. If you lose sight of what you want, the story will suffer and it will become more of a chore than a hobby. Writing can be a lot of fun- but good/complete writing takes time, a lot of effort, and as corny as it sounds- love.

7. If you do have a big WIP to work on, I'd recommend having another small project you can go to when you need a break from your main story. This gives you a chance to take a step back, relax, and clear your mind.
