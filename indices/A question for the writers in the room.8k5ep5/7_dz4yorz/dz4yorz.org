Planning, Plotting, Discipline

I never finished a story either, but I am determined to finish the original story I write now. These are the three main points that got me over the same issue you have.

I *planned* the story. I have character sheets, voice examples, moodboards, and so on and so forth. I have a whole repository of things to grab onto for my descriptions, my dialogues, my characters.

I *plotted* the story out to miniscule detail. Why does something happen? What are its consequences? What do the characters feel through that? How do the characters grow or devolve from that event?

And I *disciplined* myself to write every day. Sometimes its just useless drivel. Sometimes its great stuff. But I write at least 500 words every day that should be satisfactory.
