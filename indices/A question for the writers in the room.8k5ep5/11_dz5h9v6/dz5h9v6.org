Great question! I struggled with the same thing for more than 2 years until I finished a 10k one-shot, and I've finished a few 20k fics in the year after that. Although I definitely still struggle with motivation sometimes, I've also found what works for me:

- Education. I follow multiple writing blogs and YT channels to learn as much about writing as I possibly can. Part of my motivation issues had to do with nerves, because I was afraid I wasn't a good writer. Learning about the craft of writing helped me feel more confident, because I had at least an inkling of what I was doing.

- Plotting/ outlining before writing, because you can then focus on making the sentences flow well during the actual writing, rather than wondering what's going to happen next. Which makes the whole process a lot less stressful. It also helps me feeling more motivated when I know I'll get to write an exciting scene tomorrow.

- Deadlines. Giving yourself a deadline is awesome, but it's even better when someone else gives you one, because you /have/ to finish the work then. I always get stuck in the middle of a story and I haven't been able to get past that for the fics I didn't have a deadline for. All the ones that I finished were written for fests, so I had a very clear end date. I probably still wouldn't have finished anything if I hadn't. Signing up for a fest may be nerve-wracking, but it's so worth it!

- Finish something, no matter how short. This probably sounds strange, because finishing fics was your problem. However, let me tell you, there's nothing that gives you a bigger adrenaline rush than finishing a story. That alone is worth all the struggles beforehand. I'm never as excited about writing as when I've just finished a fic. I usually start on the next one immediately, because the feeling is just so awesome and I want to experience it again and again and again. Give it a try!

Hope this helps you!
