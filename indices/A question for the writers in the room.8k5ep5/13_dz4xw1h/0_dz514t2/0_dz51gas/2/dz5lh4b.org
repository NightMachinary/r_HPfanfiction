Eh. This is the Plotter vs Pantser, or Architect vs Gardner debate. The majority aren't plotters or architects but for fanfiction it is a bit easier to do it that way if your story is going to be rather canon compliant to at least plan your story alongside the canon events up until the point of divergence.
