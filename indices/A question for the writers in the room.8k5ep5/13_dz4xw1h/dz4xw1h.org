Plan your writing. Have notes, scene-by-scene, of how the story is going to go. You don't have to set it in stone, if you come up with a good idea mid-work, take a moment to revise your plan accordingly. (Backward as well as forward: sometimes the good idea you have now invalidates something you wrote fourteen chapters before.)

And don't depend on motivation. Motivation is a fickle and flighty thing, no more to be depended on than a cat's good opinion of you. Discipline gets you to the end of the book you're writing.
