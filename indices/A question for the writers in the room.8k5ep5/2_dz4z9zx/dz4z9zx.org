Outline. Fill in the gaps, even if it's a sentence. I'd start with the exciting parts and then fill in the rest later. For me, I am inspired by other fiction writing, TV, movies etc so even taking a break in writing and watching some TV can help go back and write more. It also helps (me at least) if you can get feedback from someone. Also remember that you don't have to write from start to finish, write from wherever interests you and then go back or forwards. Worst case scenario you can always put your work up for adoption.
