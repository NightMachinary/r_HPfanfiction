First and foremost don't feel obligated. /Write because you want to/. If you force yourself to write something you don't want to or aren't interest in it won't end well.

Don't feel like you have to write in a linear fashion. This may be a bit controversial, but you do not have to write chapter 5 after chapter 6. Hell I wrote 4th year before I wrote 2nd year. If you have an idea let yourself explore it. If you have a great ending write it! You can always fix inconsistencies while editing.

Find someone to talk to it about. Whether it be a beta or a fellow writer, or even a friend it helps a lot to talk about what you are writing, and state clearly what your vision is.

Outlining can help a lot I've found. I was in a similar place as you before I started mapping things out. After completing that first chapter sometimes you don't know where to go, if you have some sort of plan you are able to continue.

I will reiterate it again because I feel it is super important. Writing should be fun, not a chore. If you don't find it fun, don't write. Your writing will suffer and it will not be fulfilling. Best of luck to you!
