750words.com

Its a wonderful little site to try to get people to write 750 words a day. It tracks how long it takes you to reach the goal, how many distractions, words per minute as well as how many days can you go without stopping. There are wonderful little badges to reward you on goals. All your writing is private as well.

Try it.

I've learned that sometimes your best ideas come after you have written thousands of words of crap. Just by forcing myself to write everyday, I have come up with so many ideas for my current story. It took me almost two years to write 16k words in the past and then I abandoned it. Since I started writing daily in February of this year, I have written over 50k. It's incredible.

The second advice I have for you is open a Google doc to plan out your fic. How many chapters do you think it would take? What are some unanswered questions you still have? Then start plotting individual chapters.

Personally. I recommend publishing after your fic is finished as it allows you to jump from chapter to chapter if you get bored/have a great idea. This is what I am doing now. 50k into a 150k fic.

Good luck!
