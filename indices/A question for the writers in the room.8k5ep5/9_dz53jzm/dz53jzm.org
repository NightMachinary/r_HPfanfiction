Music definitely helps with me. It puts me in a creative mood and can help me express emotion through writing a lot better. I always try to write my goals down for what I want out of a chapter before writing it as well. Then, I fill in the details. Writing comes in ebbs and flows. Write two hundred words here or there whenever the creative inspiration hits you. Eventually, you have a chapter, then two, then three etc.
