  There are few things better than having a cup of tea and watching a great funeral. Until some purple nincompoop comes along and ruins his whole day.

  Nothing happened. The stupidly bewildered look on his face wasn't bad, as far as last sights go, but Tony still wished he could have been looking at Morgan as he died. Of course, that meant his daughter would have to watch him basically burn himself to a crisp with the power of Creation itself, so this was probably better in the long run. He raised his right hand, making sure Thanos could see the Stones his nano-suit was even now incorporating into itself.Ah, gormless despair. Even better.It's time.“I am---”That was as far as he got before everything changed.“Accio Infinity Stones.”Or, the one where Thanos accidentally made a very powerful enemy and didn't find out about it until the last possible second.
