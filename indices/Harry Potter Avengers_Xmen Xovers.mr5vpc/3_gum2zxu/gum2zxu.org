linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) is pretty much the gold standard as far as HP/MCU crossovers are concerned in my opinion.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the World That Waits by Dellacouer) is the best HP/X-men crossover I've ever read. It's a crime that it's abandoned, but it's so good, it deserves a read anyway.
