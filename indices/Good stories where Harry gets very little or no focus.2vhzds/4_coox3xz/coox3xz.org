[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][Harry Potter without Harry Potter]]:

*FFnet Summary:* Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

*My comments:* The summary doesn't mention that Voldemort was discorporated as well, so the situation in September 1991 is not dissimilar from canon, though it diverges quickly. It has a rather unique element of Hermione tricking her way into becoming a Durmstrang student.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]]:

*FFnet Summary:* In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;)

*My comments:* A fic loosely inspired by /HPMOR/ (but one less willing to sacrifice characterization for the didactic component, and the protagonist is far less obnoxious) and /Worm/ (though not a crossover). Harry is present, but they don't interact much, since Hermione is in Ravenclaw.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/][Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation]]:

*FFnet Summary:* Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*My comments:* Harry doesn't play a significant role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9045882/1/][A Pound of Flesh]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9672145/1/][Ill Met by Moonlight]]:

*FFnet Summary:* AU: In her sixth year, Hermione engineers a way to reawaken Tom Riddle's diary. But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

*My comments:* /Not/ Tomione or romance of any sort. Harry doesn't show up at all.
