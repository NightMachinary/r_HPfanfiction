Really? Clue in Canada? Huh. Google lied to me. :D

I've only read one actual murder mystery - that one where Narcissa finds Harry and returns him to the Wizarding world to play investigator (which has some special term in the WW that was also the name of the fic) because Draco had been accused of murdering someone (Cho Chang, I think?). It wasn't bad, actually. Can't remember the title, but it wasn't immediately laughably obvious who the culprit was, so... might be worth hunting down.

And three potential endings, huh? Well, AO3 technically allows Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories, so... could be workable.
