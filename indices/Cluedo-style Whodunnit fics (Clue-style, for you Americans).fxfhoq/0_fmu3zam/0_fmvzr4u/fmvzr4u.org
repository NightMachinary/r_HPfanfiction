  Magic leaves traces which wizards are capable of finding and tracking.

So, have them muddy it somehow - maybe casting a whole bunch of spells makes it difficult to separate them out, or something akin to planting random magical signals that overpowers the spell. Maybe there are spells to fog-up the clues somewhat and frame other people - or more prosaic tactics, like perhaps people with very similar wands can use them, but really badly (so a cutting curse might be more of an axe-hack than a sword-swipe).

Or just have the murder be committed with an actual weapon - can't trace magic that isn't cast. Someone sneaks in with an invisibility cloak, knifes the victim, then leaves.

Or maybe they're stuck somewhere with no wands or that suppresses spellcasting (which plot-wise could be what provides the killer a chance to strike).

And yes, assuming they don't have immediate access to Veritaserum. That potion is just ridiculously OP.
