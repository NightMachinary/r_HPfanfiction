I don't recall any such fics myself, and would question how to go about making an HP-style Cluedo fic...

I mean, magic tends to obviate a lot of the mystery with Whodunnits. Magic leaves traces which wizards are capable of finding and tracking.

Even if no magic was used, there are still liable to be spells which can point out who last used what as well as confirm what people were doing when.

It's less cerebreal, and more "we use magic to find the clues, and then use magic on the clues to find the culprit."

However, if there /is/ an HP fic done in the Cluedo-sytle of Whodunnit, I'd be very much interested in giving it a read too!
