The part that I was talking about is

linkffn(A Bond Of Family by Daily-Chan)

The first part of the series is either

linkffn(Home by daily-chan)

Or

linkffn(Midnight Conversations by Daily-Chan)

The series' order in the authors profile because they tend to post a little bit of everywhere in the timeline.

Warning, it's got minor sirius/remus vibes. Also slight op Sirius(which is pretty amazing imo) and lord stuff. It doesn't go overly into it though.

Oh and a bit of Dumbledore and Molly bashing. Just a bit.
