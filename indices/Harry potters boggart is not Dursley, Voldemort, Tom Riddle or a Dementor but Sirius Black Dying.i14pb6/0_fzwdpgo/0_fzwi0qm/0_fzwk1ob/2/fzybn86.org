If these are the fics I'm thinking of, then /slight/ is an incredible understatement. Didn't he disarm the entire great hall wandlessly or something and have Hogwarts (as in the castle) fawn over him? Also, weren't there massive conversations devoted to talking about how awesome Sirius is? I mean, he's my favourite character, but that was pretty off-putting.
