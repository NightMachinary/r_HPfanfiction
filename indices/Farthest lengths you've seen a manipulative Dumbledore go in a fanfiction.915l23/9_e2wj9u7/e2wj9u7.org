There was one where he put Compulsion charms on everyone making James and Lily get together, James and friends pick on Snape, some on lily to make her more loyal to her house and hate Snape, Snape to become more loyal to him, and to be a spy and do his bidding, some on harry to hate Snape etc. Was feeding Ginny Weasley love Potions since she was ten to like harry. Had all the portraits under a geis, had lupin under compulsions to be a coward. Put Harry with the Dursleys to make him into a weapon, meanwhile imprisoned a perfectly alive Lily in an underground house for 17 years, and eventually Lupin. He made Tom Riddle lose his mind causing his evil after using him in a ritual to bring back Grindelwald to the light side.
