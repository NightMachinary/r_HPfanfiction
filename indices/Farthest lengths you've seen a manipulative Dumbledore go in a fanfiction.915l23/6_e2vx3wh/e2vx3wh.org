The Dumbledore in one of Perfect Lionheart's fics was just whoa.

It's been a while, but here's what I remember:

He stole land (literally, using some magic trinket he also stole if memory serves) for his collection.

He had a horcrux.

He was storing Grindelwald's horcrux.

Snape was his minion as well as full on evil too. He had a horcrux too.

He was a dark lord in hiding.

He deliberately styled himself after Snideley Whiplash for some reason.

Basically, he was a straight up supervillain.

And it was played straight.

I still can't tell, even close to ten years later, whether or not the author was trolling or just had their bashing sequence run out of control and go so far off the rails it was technically flying by accident.
