Sadly enough, it's enough of something that I've seen it in multiple fics.

Though there was that one where Harry confronts Dumbledore in his office, and when told, "It's the only way" tells Dumbledore to go polyjuiced as Hermione, who then does and thoroughly enjoys it...

I don't really know where I was going with that, but yeah, there's some pretty weird stuff out there, and I didn't even mention any of it.
