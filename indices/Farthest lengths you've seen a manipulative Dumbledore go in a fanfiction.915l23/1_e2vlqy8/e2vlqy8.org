Dumbledore orphaned Harry, the NBWL.

Dumbledore mind-wiped James and Lily.

Dumbledore placed mind magics on Lily and James to make them never think about having another child, such that in the story when the magic is ended everyone realizes Lily is like 4 months pregnant.

Dumbledore literally doses half of Gryffindor house with potions to make them isolate or resent Harry.

Dumbledore tries to mind-wipe Harry's girlfriend at one point, which only gets prevented when /Harry/ threatens to set his twin brother, the BWL, on fire.

And all that is only scratching the surface of one fic.
