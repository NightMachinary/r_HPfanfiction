All from one story: linkffn(Sixteen Years)

Its cheesy as hell, but honestly I can't help but love the idea of all wizards being superpowered figures. Kingsley is hurling bolts of lightning, Sirius is calling forth darkness and shadows, the BWL is creating a hurricane to slaughter the inferi. And dang if Dumbledore and Voldemort aren't terrifying.
