linkffn(11123742) - The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time. Incomplete, time-travel, Harry/harem, Bond villain Dumbledore, Traitor-Parselmouth-Blood-Purist-potioning Ron&Molly, Lord Harry Potter-Peverell-Old-Uncle-Tom-Cobbleigh-And-All, Helpful Goblins, I could go on. Not by way of spoilers so much as saving you the effort of reading it.

It's the kind of story where nobody ever writes things, they /always/ 'pen' them.
