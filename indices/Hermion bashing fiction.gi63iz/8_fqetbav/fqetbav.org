Here's my recommendations:

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

This one is a classic: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]), along with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]). And these communities on FFN have some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Hermione-Bashing/123454/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888333/1/]]) has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to her about her long essays.

linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. Its more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) 6th year fic. Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) Hermione gets dressed down during a job interview.

(SELF PROMO): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]) More Hermione-critical than outright bashing. AU 6th year fic where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike.
