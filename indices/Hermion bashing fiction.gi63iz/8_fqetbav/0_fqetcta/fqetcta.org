  Why, in the Harry Potter books, did no one comment on the fact that Hermione doesn't actually know how to write a paper correctly. This story addresses that. Slight Hermione bashing, nothing too mean.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.

  Not all is as it seems in the life of Harry James Potter. Lily Potter was not the person everyone thought she was and her child pays the price. Some secrets are hidden under a thin layer of lies and sometimes we carry our prison with us.
