I can personally relate to your frustration. Hermione as a character is nice, but all ff writers make her act like an absolute goddess. I believe in all the very many ff's I read, I've only read about three to four with Hermione bashing...

I'd recommend reading *Golden Bullets* by /CescaLR/ on Ao3. It's the best-written book out there and the author has emphasised many of her flaws that others just choose to either ignore or downplay.
