a) Insulting the mods sounds like a dumb idea, particularly since posts asking for Hermione bashing fics have been posted in the past with no issue.

b) Your previous post was mis-flaired ('Recommendation' = you recommending a fic, 'Request' = you asking for a fic)

c) Your previous post was really bad - using 'Nigerian' as an insult is just pathetic, for one. If I were a mod here, I'd definitely have deleted that post.

Just take a look through [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=Hermione+bashing+flair%3ARequest+&restrict_sr=on][this search]] and you should find some previous recommendations towards bashing Hermione. I'd recommending doing a search in the future first, and to take a moment before submitting a thread to make sure that you've written appropriately.

As another aside, insulting a character too strongly (Hermione or otherwise) will be received worse. For instance, asking for fics bashing character X will be received fine if it's asked neutrally - but worse if it's super aggressive. "Any suggestions for bashing Hermione fics?" will be upvoted. "Any suggestions for bashing that buck-toothed, troll-faced, fuzzy-haired bitch?" will be downvoted. Your previous post was worded along the lines of the latter - what do you expect to happen?
