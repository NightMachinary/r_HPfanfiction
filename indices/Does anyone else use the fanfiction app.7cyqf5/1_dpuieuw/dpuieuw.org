Exact same thing happened to me; the name has also been changed to fanfiction chats or something like that. If you search the app store with "fanfiction," the second option or so should be fanfiction - 300,00+ books and it has the same logo. I've downloaded it and it seems exactly the same as the app used to be, but you'll lose access to all of your saved stories.
