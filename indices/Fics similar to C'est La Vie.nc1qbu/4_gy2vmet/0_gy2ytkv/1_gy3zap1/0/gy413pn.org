For me, definitely. Tho I did sneak a peek a few chapter ahead to raise my motivation at first

The first 2 chapter are pretty much introduction to both the Harry of that world (cause as u can see, it's def not the canon universe) and the bwl Neville world. And then ch 3 we definitely started getting more familiar with the character there and especially Orion backstory.

But at the end, it just kinda comes down to what you would like. It's def not action packed and it's also pretty close to canon, especially because the author was intending for the story to be until 7th year and start diverging from canon either at 7 or 6 year, so it's def not there yet. So the 4th year is pretty much canon retelling, with some different stuff added in and more character and relationship building. But I am a sucker for platonic relationships and this fic just ticks all of my boxes.
