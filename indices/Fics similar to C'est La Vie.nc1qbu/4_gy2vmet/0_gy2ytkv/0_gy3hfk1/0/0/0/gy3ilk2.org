Oh, totally

The amount of time which I've seen c'est la vie get mentioned here (which is quite a lot compare to other fanfic) and almost always getting high praise from the people that read it

Honestly wish I could read their other fanfic but I'm not really in any of their other fandom so sucks for me ig :(
