You were probably asking the op, but I couldn't resist telling you about it

The fic is basically a dimension travel that's also a bit of time travel? Because technically post war Harry goes to another dimension where he's in his 4th year and the fic just basically follow along his adventures with the other people there on trying to overcome a lot of different things

And this is not like official or anything but the fic does have this trope that I like where everybody just kinda adores/respect/ loves Harry (platonic tho, I don't think there's gonna be any romance). It also has charismatic and confident Harry
