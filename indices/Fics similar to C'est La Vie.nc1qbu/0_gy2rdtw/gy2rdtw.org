This damn fic left me feeling so empty because idk what other fic could fill the hole that was left by it. I have re read it at least 10 times (probably even more tbh) at this point.

Sadly don't rlly know any other fic like that, the only one I can think of are probably like linkao3(princeps) by lomonaaeren. Still trying to find more fic like this tho!
