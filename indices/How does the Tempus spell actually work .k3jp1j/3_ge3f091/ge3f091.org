It's not a canon spell, so it's up to the writer to decide. In my case, I decided that a wizard who wants to be able to use Tempus casts another spell to tell the wand to check a particular clock whenever the Tempus is cast. Some people would see Big Ben and others might show the digital clock on their bedstand.
