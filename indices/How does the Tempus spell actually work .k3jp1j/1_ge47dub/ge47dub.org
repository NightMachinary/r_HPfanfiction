As others have already said several times, the Tempus spell is completely fanmade with no basis in canon. That said, I want to give a shout to the way it's presented in chapter 64 of linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay). In that fic, the caster has to be focusing on how they want the time to be presented, which can be both good and bad.

On one hand, this makes the spell flexible enough to tell you the time in a different time zone, or even present it to the caster using a completely fictional time system such as stardates from Star Trek. On the other hand, if you're not focused enough, it can tell you that the time is "now, in this galaxy," which is about as unhelpful as you can get.
