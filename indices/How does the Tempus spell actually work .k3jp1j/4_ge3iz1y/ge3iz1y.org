It's a fan creation, but I envision it as a system of arithmantic divination clocks that emit a localized field. The spell, instead of doing a complicated divination of the location of the planets, does a much simpler divination on the value of the field. The divination clocks have two weaknesses: they are impossible to move without requiring a complete recalibration, and they are incredibly expensive. This means only the upper classes have access to the magic, thus creating the reliance on pocket watches for lower classes as seen in canon.

This use of entirely planet-based timekeeping leads to another major difference in magical society: there are no time zones. After all, a potion requiring an ingredient to be added precisely at noon won't care that it is noon GMT, it cares about the position of the sun.

Since most people are unable to afford divination clocks, people select a location to set their clocks to. Mechanical clocks have multiple dials, so a person working in the ministry can see London time to get to work on time, while also knowing when the local shops tend to close.
