It's even worse than that. "Notice me not" is at least loosely based on a canon spell (the one used to make Muggles not notice the Leaky Cauldron or the Quidditch's World Cul Final stadium) even though it's never named.

The "Tempus" spell doesn't have any Canon root, and it's unlikely there are any since Wizards are shown to use watches.
