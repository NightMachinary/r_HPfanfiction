Goyle, Montague and Pansy have wrist watches (nearly every Weasley and a few Order members too, Harry had three on the series), maybe they have something different or unusual, but even then it's not really necessary to describe how they work.

I am so annoyed with the Tempus spell I went to look for any watch mention in the series (and boy, there was a lot, even ignoring the Quidditch matches and characters looking for mischief and wrongdoing).

Harry's was not really described, I think, except to say it was gold, old (from Fabian's), and a bit battered.
