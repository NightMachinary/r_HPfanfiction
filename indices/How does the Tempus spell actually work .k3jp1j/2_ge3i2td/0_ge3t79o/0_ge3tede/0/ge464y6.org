I think weird watches are kinda rare in the series, at least only a few are specifically described as unusual in some way, which is not to say every one should have been described, Dumbledore's (has a dozen hands), the Burrow's (says where the Weasleys are at any time), Ron's seventeen's gift (gold with tiny stars instead of hands), and Dedalus's (enormous pocket watch).

Some people may favor something old-fashioned (like Fudge's pocket watch), but they are not as common as wrist watches (a /lot/ of characters have them).
