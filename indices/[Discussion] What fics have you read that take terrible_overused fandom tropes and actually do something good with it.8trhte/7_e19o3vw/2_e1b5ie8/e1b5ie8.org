I remembered reading a bit of this and not liking it at all. But, I continually see it recommended, so I figured I'd give it another go. It turns out I was thinking of a totally different fic.

This definitely tics all the boxes for horrible tropes, ESPECIALLY dying and meeting Fate which I hate with a passion. But I somehow plowed through the first few chapters and am now enjoying it.

I think the hook of 2 time travelers waring with each other is good. I've not read anything quite like that before. The whole summary should just be, 2 time travelers try to muck each other's plans. I'd have been MUCH more willing to give the story a chance.
