No worries. WBWL = Wrong Boy Who Lived. In other words, for some reason everyone thinks someone besides Harry (or whoever) is the one to defeat Voldemort and saved them all. These are usually twin fics, though their are a number that have alternate BWL like Neville. A lot of these have similar beats too:

- Living parents
- Harry sent to Dursleys, where they are often more abusive than in canon
- Mean or narcissistic fake Boy Who Lived (often Harry's brother/twin)
- Manipulative Dumbledore (surprisingly less in these fics than you would think)
- Slytherin!Harry, mostly to separate him if they are brothers
- Harry is more talented/gifted/intelligent than his brother, and most people who know them actually are aware of this fact

Its relatively common, though there are a number of fics with good WBWL plots. Examples include:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): talented Harry sent to another school
- linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes): basically the same premise as PoS, but it plays the tropes straight
- linkffn(Deprived): has basically a WBWL-style plot (even though its not completely clear who is who), though its somewhat tropey and cliche
- linkffn(Antithesis): a more recent dark WBWL, won't spoil it
