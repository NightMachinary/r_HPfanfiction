Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). Its got everything:

- WBWL
- slytherin!Harry
- magically bonded house elves
- noble houses (and all that entails)
- "seer" luna (not really, but she isn't just crazy)
- "family" magics
- Hadrian Potter

But as the fic progresses, the layers peel apart, and you begin to see the nuance and amazing subversion of the tropes. Who is really responsible for Harry being separated, and why? What causes the muggle hatred towards Harry? And more recently, why is Remus different from the other werewolves (this is possibly the only fic that has genuinely good reasoning for hating werewolves).
