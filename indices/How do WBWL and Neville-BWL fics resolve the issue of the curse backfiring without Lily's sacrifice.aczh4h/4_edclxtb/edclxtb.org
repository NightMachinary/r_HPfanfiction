If you look at the whole thing too close it leaves plot holes wide enough to wiggle anything in.

I mean you want to tell me, that never before anyone was offered/able to save themselves, but instead choose to sacrifice yourself for someone they love? NEVER EVER BEFORE???

It just doesn't make sense. That means it has something to do with Voldemorts terrible soul state and that as fragmented as it was, killing a baby was just too much after seeing how loved it was and being untouched by it.

Or you could just say that maybe there was someone having a good word for the Longbottoms as well, (and far more successful at it, because they nuggled Voldemort to focus on the Potter boy), or have Voldemort in his arrogance offer them a chance to live because they are purebloods as a show of his total victory not only killing the boy, but gaining the parents as well, or placing an Imperio on one of them and in the last second they break it and jump in front of their child
