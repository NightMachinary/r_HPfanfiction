Sometimes they do something where Lily ended up in a coma instead, sometimes literally through a blood sacrifice ritual (I hate these in particular). Some fics make it so that the grandparents are the ones who gave a blood sacrifice, such as Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived by The Santi. Many people also aren't aware or disregard about Snape, which makes a direct swap easier. Often they just handwave it.
