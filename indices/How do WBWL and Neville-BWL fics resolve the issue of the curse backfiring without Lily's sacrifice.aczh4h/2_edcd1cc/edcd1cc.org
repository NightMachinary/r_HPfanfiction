don't some of them have lily still doing blood magic? Falling under the assumption that canon lily must have been dabbling in rare blood magic, otherwise more people would be spared the AK due to the commonness of sacrifices. I think some WBWL have her doing a different type of rare protective magic that doesn't require a life sacrifice? Not saying it's a good explanation, but that's the one I usually use to myself in a WBWL. Guaranteed, most WBWL require much suspense of disbelief in creating the setting for the book. Because... like, really... They both managed to get scars thanks to some random-chance displaced object when the curse fired. And Dumbledore, greatest wizard of the gen, can't figure out which baby had an AK fired at him and which baby's scar is due to a dislodged piece of wood from the cradle. linkffn(2861750) is a funny oneshot making fun of the suspense of disbelief required for WBWL stories for those who haven't read it
