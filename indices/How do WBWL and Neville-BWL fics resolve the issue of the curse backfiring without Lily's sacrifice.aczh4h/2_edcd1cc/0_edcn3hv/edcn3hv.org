Canon refers to 'blood magic' in very vague terms, generally meaning 'powerful protections powered by a loving sacrifice'. It says nothing on whether any other preparation is required (e.g. was Lily 'dabbling', or was her protection accidental?)

I do struggle with fics that portray blood magic as just another exotic field of magic that Lily is researching --- the point in canon is that blood magic is so emotional and instinctual that Voldemort could never hope to understand it. And certainly any fic that has Lily invoke 'blood magic' /without/ the sacrifice contravenes and cheapens canon.
