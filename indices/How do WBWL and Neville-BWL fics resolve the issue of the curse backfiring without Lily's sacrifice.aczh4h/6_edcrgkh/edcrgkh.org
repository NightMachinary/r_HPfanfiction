It's quite simple - throw away the wondrous blood protection that only works at random instances, and use a device of your own making.

Make Divination powerful in a way that the prophecy actually takes root the moment Voldemort casts the Killing curse at Neville. Let the power the Dark Lord knows not actually be a legitimate power, and not some wonky shit like love. Yes, yes, I know, Albus, Hermione and lots of other people say that Divination is wonky - prove those fuckers wrong.

Failing all of that, just change the wording of the prophecy. It's not like poems are hard to write, even half-assed ones.
