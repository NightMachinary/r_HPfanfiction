The way I understood it, Lily's sacrifice only meant as much as it did because she didn't have to die. If she had stood aside like Voldemort said, he would have let her live as a reward to Snape. She wouldn't have had anything to sacrifice if she was going to die anyway.

That's the solution to another common question: why hadn't the whole boy who lived thing happened before if all that was needed was for a mother to sacrifice herself? That's because in other cases, the mother would have died anyway. It wasn't as much as a sacrifice, in theory.
