Aye, I can see why it's confusing. Perhaps Hadrian is often chosen because it means 'black'? (Or perhaps it means 'dark', not 'black'--it does tend to be seen more in darker fics.) Personally, I get more annoyed when I see Potter-Black as his surname in a fic--/that's/ something that makes me stop reading straight away.

Hadrian I can live with, but only because in my head I assume that that means he's crossed some kind of wall that seperates him from being 'just Harry' forever. There should always be a reason and explanation though--like having to forge a new identity so people don't know it's him (in the case of time-travel, dimension-travel (where there may be /two/ Harry's), and fics where he's moonlighting under a fake persona). Otherwise, there's just no reason for a name change.

I quite like the name Harry, personally. It sounds sensible.
