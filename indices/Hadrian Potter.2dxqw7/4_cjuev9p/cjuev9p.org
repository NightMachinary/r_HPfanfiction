You're right in many ways, that people just don't think 'Harry' is cool enough. Most of the time his name is changed for no good reason. Sometimes, though, it's used as a distinction between old and new. There are plenty of valid names that could be used to signify a change of time or personality, though. Hadrian, Harrison, Harold, Henry, (I think I even saw /Harper/, once, which was odd)... They all kind of work as a lengthened form of Harry.
