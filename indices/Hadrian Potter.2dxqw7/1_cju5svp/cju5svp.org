This is one of the things that will immediately cause me to stop reading a fic. I've seen [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a Snake]] recommended a few times, and tried to read it twice. Both times were far enough apart that I forgot why I never finished reading it. Once he decides to go by Hadrian I'm out of there.
