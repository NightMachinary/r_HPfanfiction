[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] Pretty much hits the nail on the head for what you want.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] Also quite good, I didn't finish it because it's ridiculously long, but yeah early Harry stuff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] Somewhat similar to PotDK, and there is LV/HP Slash but if you don't mind/can ignore slash it is an amazing fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories][Harry Potter: Dark Memories]] This was a really enjoyable fic until the end when it started getting way too touchy-feely. Still a good read until it gets sickening.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]] I remember this being great, haven't read it for ages though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] If you haven't read this series yet, do it. It's a 7 fic monster but damn it's good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] I quite enjoyed this too but I don't have much hope for an update. AU-1st yr Harry with a mystery..

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/2/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] This is great. Again first year Harry with plans for more.

Good luck, if you can recommend any other similar fics for me that'd be great too :)
