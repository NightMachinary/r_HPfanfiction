You set your bar pretty low. That being said, I'm not sure there are that many that start from the very beginning and manage to make it through all the years. A lot of the early stuff can be pretty boring, so most tend to start later, like 5th year.

Anyways, since you somehow managed to read through the GM series, you'll probably like the R-series, starting with linkffn(2008185)
