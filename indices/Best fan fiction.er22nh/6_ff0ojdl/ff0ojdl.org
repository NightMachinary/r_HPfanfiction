A bunch of fics of various kinds.

linkffn(Backward with Purpose) My first experience (after hpmor) with HP fanfiction. It's a good fic, and a primer of do-over, or the "Peggy Sue" trope. Harry, Ron and Ginny travels back in time, redoing the canon events after the first go-around went very awry.

linkffn(Delenda Est) The best fic of its kind I've read (at least the first half). Harry falls back in time to a time period before Bellatrix, turns into her canon self, ultimately changing her fate. Includes Harry teaching the Marauders (and Lily, Severus, and the rest of the gang of the era). Puts major focus on the First War.

linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) Follows the life of Severus Snape, from shortly before he is born, to his end in Deathly Hallows in a mostly canon-compilant manner. While I consider a few events implausible (the author tries a bit too hard to excuse his actions at times, especially towards Harry), it's a great fic of its kind.

I can link more specific things (especially if you're interested in fics featuring Severus Snape as a major character) if you're interested. These recommendations were done to basically serve as "entry-level" fics of their kind -- simple fics that doesn't stray too far from the norm, beyond what is expected of it.
