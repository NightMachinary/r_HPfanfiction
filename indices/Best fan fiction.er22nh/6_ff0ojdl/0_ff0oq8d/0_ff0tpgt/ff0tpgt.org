All right. Also, it seems like the bot is broken again, so I'll just directly link the ones I (tried to) link previously too.

Here's some more that I've liked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent]] my favorite Harry/Daphne fic. Unlike most of them, puts very little focus on Lordship shenanigans, which I never cared much for.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/Like-Grains-of-Sand-in-the-Hourglass]] This fic is what got me interested in the Harry/Nymphadora pairing. Unfortunately, most fics of this kind are incredibly clich√© ("you asked for my true form! let's love each other forever"). This one isn't like that -- it depicts Tonks having an accident in the Time Room during the DoM fight throwing her back to the start of 5th year. She goes undercover as a student to watch over Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113737/1/Promise-Me-Love]] I personally never cared much for Draco/Hermione myself, but if you like the idea of a redeemed Draco, this story is wholesome and fluffy. It's a good and enjoyable fic if you don't take issue with the pairing (I read it a while back when I had an urge to read Dramione).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369512/1/The-Peace-Not-Promised]] Severus/Lily is my favorite pairing to read about, and this fic is what got me into it. Severus, after death, gets to re-do his life starting from early 6th year (i.e. after the fallout). Not expecting anything to come of that, he instead focuses on taking on a mentoring role for Slytherin House, showing them that there are other options than Voldemort.
