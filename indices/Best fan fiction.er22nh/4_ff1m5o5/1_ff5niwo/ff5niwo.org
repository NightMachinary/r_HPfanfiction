  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
