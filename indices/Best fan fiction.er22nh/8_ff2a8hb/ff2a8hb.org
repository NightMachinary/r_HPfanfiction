Some of my favourites with a variety of genres:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] - No pairing, what if Hogwarts doesn't start until you're 14?

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503388/1/][Birth of a Phoenix]] - A bash-free WBWL with affectionate siblings that'll make you cry. No Pairings. Could've used a beta, but is still excellent.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]] - Time travel with Harry ending up as a teacher. A there-and-back-again version of time travel. Slash that's more sweet than explicit.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] - A Hermione-centric time travel. Hermione/Sirius. Fantastic story!

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] - A crossover with Firefly that takes place in the 26th century. Firefly knowledge not really needed, but you should watch it anyway. Who doesn't like a space western?

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494][Of a Linear Circle]] - A dude falls out of a portrait in the Slytherin common room. Slash, Snape/OC, but is thus far a minor thing plot-wise. I'm in the progress of reading this and ohmygod, I've been missing out. It's a huge series that's still in progress (1.2 million words and counting).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/][Finding Home]] - Avengers crossover. Watch the 2012 movie or don't, either way is fine. No pairings, Tony & Harry friendship and MoD!Harry. Really wish the later installments weren't abandoned!

- ... I should probably just leave it there. Lucky 7, yada yada.
