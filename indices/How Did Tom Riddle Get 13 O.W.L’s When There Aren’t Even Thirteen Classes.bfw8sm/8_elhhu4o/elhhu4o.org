I don't know what all the class would be, but I always considered that while the class at Hogwarts "prepared" the student to the OWL and NEWT, you didn't have to take them to try exams.\\
The most obvious example is Muggle Studies, the OWL and NEWT is necessary for some jobs (mainly at the Ministry) and with the exception of overeager student like Hermione, I don't see why Muggleborns students should take 3 years of an elective the could already get an O the day they arrived at Hogwarts.

So, in my headcanon, 12 OWL students take 3 electives and work the 2 other by themselves with their 3 times (Muggle studies is obviously simple enough for free time but I don't really which class between Ancient Runes and Divinations can be worked the best without a teacher).
