We don't know how many classes were offered in Riddle's time. It's possible that the wizarding population was higher before the war, so they had more professors, and there was enough interest in even obscure topics to fill classes in them. The population we see in Harry's time may be unusually low, well below Hogwarts capacity, which is why there's always a conveniently empty classroom to duck into when you need one.
