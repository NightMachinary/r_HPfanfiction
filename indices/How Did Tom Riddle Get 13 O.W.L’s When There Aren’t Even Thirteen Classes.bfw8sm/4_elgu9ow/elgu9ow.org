Not to apply American things to British culture, but maybe it's kind of like AP exams? There's like 30 different AP tests, but my school for example only offered like 6 AP classes, but I was able to sign up for tests for subjects not offered, and I just self studied throughout the year, so maybe that's how he pulled it off?
