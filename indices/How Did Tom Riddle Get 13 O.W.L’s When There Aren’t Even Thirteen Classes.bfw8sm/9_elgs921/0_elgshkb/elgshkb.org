I believe in regards to divination that it is said that the topic had not been taught at Hogwarts for “many years” and it seems like Dumbledore is doing something rather out there by adding it to the curriculum, so I think we can rule that one out.

Though I can sort of see Dumbledore removing “dark” classes, I also have a hard time believing it.

Dumbledore was quite keen on the pursuit of knowledge, and something tells me he would not have had removed classes unless they were “really dark” I'm talking like, horcrux kind of dark, and I highly doubt it.

I don't really think there is any other option though, so I guess you may be right. I was kind of hoping that I was just missing something and someone would know the answer, but you may well be right, even if the solution is far from perfect.
