I think you've misremembered this. I searched through my eBook copy of HBP (and the other books, just to be safe) and couldn't find any mention of how many O.W.L.s Voldemort got - at least, barring Ron's joke in CoS that Riddle was given an award for special services to Hogwarts for getting 30 O.W.L.s. I believe this is the passage you're thinking of, but as you can see it only talks about Voldemort's academic record in general terms:

  “He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.” - Dumbledore, HBP, Chapter 20
