Twelve seems to be the standard maximum, being the number that Percy Weasley and Barty Crouch Jr. both got. But we know that other classes are offered at Hogwarts sometimes (was it a Rowling interview or Pottermore that mentioned Dumbledore's infrequent Alchemy class?), so it's certainly possible that maybe Riddle had more, but there's no mention of it in the books.
