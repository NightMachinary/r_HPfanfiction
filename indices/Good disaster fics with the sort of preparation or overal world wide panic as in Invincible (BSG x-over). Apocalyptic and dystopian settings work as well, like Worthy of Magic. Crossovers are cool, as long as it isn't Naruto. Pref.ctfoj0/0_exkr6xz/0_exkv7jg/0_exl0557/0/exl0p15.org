Hmmm interesting... To be fair, I don't remember the wording on the Potter's prophecy at all. All i remember is that its the end of (blank) if a Potter goes to Slytherin. That's it. I thought the reason muggles went insane near Harry was mostly because of the "assumed" horcrux. Which is weird because Jim is a parselmouth as well. Idk, he has so many plot points that I doubt we'll ever see the endgame.
