[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/117/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] seems to be heavily foreshadowing a Worthy of Magic style apocalypse, though it hasn't reached it yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] has Harry come back in time from a post-apocalyptic setting, its first chapter at least fits your request. I didn't like this one much though.
