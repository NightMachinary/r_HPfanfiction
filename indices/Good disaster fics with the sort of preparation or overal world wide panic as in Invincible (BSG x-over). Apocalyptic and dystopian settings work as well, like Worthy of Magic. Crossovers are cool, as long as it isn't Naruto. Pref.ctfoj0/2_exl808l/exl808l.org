Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

This fic reads like a documentary of the events after Harry accidentally gets into a super bowl ad and exposes magic to muggles.

Amongst other things, the discovery that magic makes it possible to duplicate enriched uranium causes an incident significantly worse than the cuban missile crisis with nukes flying and getting portkeyed around to various cities by various countries and terrorist organizations.

It's a million word fic with a lot of things happening, including space exploration, multiple wars and advancements in genetics, the stuff in the summary is only a small sample of it all.
