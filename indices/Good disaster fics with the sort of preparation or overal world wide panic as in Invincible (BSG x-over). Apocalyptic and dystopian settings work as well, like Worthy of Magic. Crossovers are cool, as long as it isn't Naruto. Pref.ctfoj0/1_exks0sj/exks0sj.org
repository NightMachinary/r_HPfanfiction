So lets see:

- linkffn(Incorruptible: A Dementor's Stigma) is the only zombie-apocalypse in the HP universe that you will find (or at least noteworthy ones). Pretty good, though a heavy emphasis on believable wizarding politics.
- linkffn(Sole Survivor) depicts Harry as a wizard surviving in a Mad Max style apocalyptic future.
- linkffn(Beyond the Curtain) is a more recent fic that deals with Harry and others fleeing to Europe post-Voldemort takeover and planning their return.
