In linkffn(Hallowed by ShinySavage), Voldemort never hears the prophecy (or it's never uttered? Don't remember exactly) and ends up obsessed with the Hallows instead. Since the Potters have the Cloak, he still ends up interested in Harry, but for that reason instead. Abandoned unfortunately, but what's there is great, especially the Triwizard Tournament.
