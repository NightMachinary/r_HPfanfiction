Do you go around and tell people eating a cheeseburger/hot dog/taco that you think they have shit taste and should eat a salad/sub/your favourite lunch instead?

When you see someone reading a newspaper, do you go up to them and tell them that they should read another newspaper instead?

Do you tell people playing Pokemon Go that they have shit taste and should play another game?

No? So why do you want to tell others that their taste in fanfiction is bad?
