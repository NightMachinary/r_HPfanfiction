As I've stated on several previous threads about likes/dislikes: Reddit does nothing to train its users to use the feature so it usually devolves into like/dislike. And a lot of subs use it like that. The ones who don't usually go to great lengths to frame the conversation differently. If you accept votes as 'like/dislike', you'll stop worrying about it :).

Now even those of us who try to follow proper Reddiquite (myself included) will downvote these types of threads quite a bit. If the post isn't well formed, I downvote. For "What's That Fic" posts, that means either a shitty title, or a post missing critical information. For that last part it usually is "Does the post answer the same generic questions you would ask of all looking for fic posts". If i have a question that is particular to your post fine, but if it is missing basic information....
