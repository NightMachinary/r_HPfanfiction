Like the other comment said, it's possible for stories to have multiple diverging elements.

A lot of HP fanfiction is basically taking Harry, altering something fundamental about him, and then seeing how he reacts to canon events. How does Slytherin!Harry react to the Chamber of Secrets? What does he do differently?

How does studying!Harry or evil!Harry or magicalProdigy!Harry react to the Goblet of Fire?

I love these stories. I'm not criticizing them. But they are predictable because while they do often diverge from canon elements, it has more to do with Harry's actions diverging the plot, while keeping the next stations of canon similar.

For instance in one story where Lily and James are alive and Harry has a brother, the Chamber of Secret is still opens. Third year has someone from Azkaban escaping. Fourth year has Moody being Polyjuiced, etc.

I'm wondering if there are stories that plays with our expectations a bit. A pretty simple "twist" that I see in a lot of fics is to have a different person get the Diary in year 2. Sometimes it's Luna or Gilderoy or Fred, etc. I'm looking for something like that but a bit more unique if that makes sense.
