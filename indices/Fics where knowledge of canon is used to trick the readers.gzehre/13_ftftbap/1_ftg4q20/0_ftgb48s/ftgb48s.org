The diary comment made me think of this, but in linkao3(full circle by tetsurashian) they find a locket horcrux but it doesn't belong to voldemort. It hasn't been updated in a while though, so we may never actually find out who this new dark lord is, but it's not tom riddle.

If the harry/riddle pairing squicks you out, just know that there's time travel and reincarnation involved so they're both old enough that the age difference is relatively small.
