linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) pretty much does this. It follows the path of canon insofar, it's finishing book 3 rn but book one had quirrell, book 2 had Lockhart, book 3 had time magic, but it does everything in a really unique way, worldbuilds excellently, and has a lot of intricate subplots and fleshes out minor characters in a way most fics neglect. Also it finds a way to make things like dumbledoreâ€˜s third floor announcement make sense.
