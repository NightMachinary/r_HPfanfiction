You have some good points!

I guess part of the reason for this post is that some people try too hard to keep the stations of canon and it's kind of frustrating

In stories where Harry has a brother, his parents are still alive, Pettigrew is in Azkaban, etc. somehow year three is when Pettigrew escape. No matter how divergent things get, in year three someone will escape from prison

Or, no matter how much things change, in year three Lupin will always forget to take his potion !!

I guess I'm looking for a story that isn't too AU. But at the same time I'm kind of sick of being able to predict the next plot point.

And yeah you make a good point, it does seem like a difficult thing to write well
