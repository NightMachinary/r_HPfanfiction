Do changes cause ripples that die down, or ripples that continue spreading? Some stories do one, and some the other, and both are justifiable.

If you're going to abandon the Stations of the Canon, then you need to be able to justify /why/ things don't happen the same way. If Harry is sorted somewhere other than Gryffindor, why would that change whether Lucius plants the diary on Ginny? I'm not saying it couldn't, but an author is going to have to provide some reasonably-logical chain of events to explain why that changed.

What you appear to be asking for is that a story go off in a different direction, just for the sake of being different. The thing about a "surprising" twist is that you don't see it coming, which means that any justification for /why/ things are different has to be laid down subtly. The author has to put down sufficient clues so that you can see exactly why the twist came about, but not until you think back on (or reread) earlier parts of the story. If the clues are too obvious, you'll be expecting the twist. It's a hard thing to do well.
