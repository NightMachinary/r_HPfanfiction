The original Dangerverse series by whydoyouneedtoknow! It's an oldie but (imo) a Goldie. The first in the series is entirely pre hogwarts but the rest are during hogwarts years. The author enjoys subverting expectations and switching up canon while still utilizing the familiar plots (stone, book, escape, etc.) For instance, in year 1, both Lockhart and Quirrel teach DADA, and it cleverly changes up the stone plot.

I say original, because the author has written an /extensive/ number of au's to the original au, in between the installments of the main au. (for context, /just/ the original au series caps out at ~1,899,000 words, not even counting all the spin off fics. The entire Harry Potter is 1,084,170 words.)
