I'm working on a fic where the story pace is x2 speed and oh boy does that make waves and curveballs. 1st year 1st semester sQuirrel wins - partially body for LV but the stone gets destroyed.

He oblivates Hermiony to fuck her up and unleashes the basilisk / diary on the shcool. Cue in the 2nd semester of PS which is now basically a chamber of secretes. Then Sirius happens, in the third semester and at the end of the year for the spring semester the PoA happens but here is a twist Harry reserves his judgement and doen't believe any of them and asks them to prove to him that they are as good as they say by being useful to him.

After that we proceed with a runaway trope, syke no gold in gringotts for ya, build your own secret order hq, and then 2nd year begins with some OC content where there are 2 voldemorts running around and Lockhart is a competent conman that gets recruited by Harry's little band of misfits which is basically the maruaders 2 with Gildroy instead of James.

Then the winter semester of 2nd year starts and we get an introduction to remus as dada teacher, some stuff happens there is a big climax battle in which voldemort (ohmygodno) gets Hermione and Dumbledore killed by sacrificing himself so that his secret weapon the young TM can reenter the wizarding world as the defeater of the Dumbledore's murderer (TM just takes the credit actually, but because not everything went to LV plan, and because A D actually packs a punch, LV sacrifice is real and LV dies for good. However the only witness to that was TM so the plot thickens ).

I also hijack the horcruxes and change them into a save/load magics that just reloads the character to a previous save state when TM dies (for their confrontation Dumbledore did something to disrupt those magics when he killed LV, maybe it pocket phonix tears, I dunno).

Afterwards we enter 2nd year winter semester and we get the fifth book plot, remus retreats in disgrace to the maruaders hq inc, umbridge takes over and at the end of the semester there is a battle for the prophecy in which Harry is bait for the order (but not because he just flew there like a dumbass, but because he is kidnapped).

TM gets the prophecy and everyone in the order except for snape and NT dies. Also all old death eaters die because (gasp) Lucius betrays them all, which was actually a plot of TM, who manipulated him to do so.

Third semester begins with TM being a hero who helped killed off the last of DE at large, cue order of merlin, and a political campaign begins to elect him as HBIC, with LM as second HBIC.

Third semester starts in earnest with Umbridge fucking off back to the government as some stand in for the dead death eaters, for their influance/money/ or because she is just being a greedy bitch. The political landscape is left with mostly neutrals alive and everybody thinks that peace in the land of magic is back.

The third semester of 2nd year begins everybody is freaking out about OWLS which are not in the 5 year but earlier because Hogwarts is actually the best fucking school for magic and teaches its students so quick. Soquickomagad.

Snape gets the dada post, slughorn is back as potions teacher, minerva after an eventful year of teaching and headmastering, stops teaching and is succeeded by Amelia Bones who was fired because of the Harry Potter kidnapping committee found her a bitch who ought to take the blame.

As third year begins owls results come back right before boarding the train and congratulations guys, you failed, and are now on the run from the ministry raging to snap Ron and Harry's wands.

Ron and Harry are now best buds always having eachother backs, and when they get ambushed at King's Cross, a chase scene ensues and they too retreat to maruaderereres hq.

It's time to build that time travel machine that Harry's friend supposed AI, talking to him through his magic glasses been mentioning. End of book one, book 2: let's kill LV the first time. Turns out LV the shade was a save copy from the cup.

It's an adventure comedy.
