[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): PS, COS, POA, TWT, and Horcrux Hunt all happened here, but yet so different.

Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), went through same motions, but yielded vastly different outcomes.
