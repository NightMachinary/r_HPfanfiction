To address your question on Dumbledore, OP, I have to dive into interpretation of what exists and speculation of what can be inferred. But it's mostly my mish-mashed headcanon delivered in a style that's less an essay and more a mix of faintly interrelated comments.

First, the man is old. Really old. Which means that his background would be utterly alien to most Muggles' of the 1990s, not to mention most readers of the series. In the western world, the idea that children are innocents who ought to be protected from the ills of society didn't gain full traction until around the Victorian era (when Dumbledore was born). But even then, that time period was notable for childhood labor and short, grim lives for anyone who wasn't lucky enough to be born into the right class.

It also wasn't unusual at all for people of his time to view a strict childhood as a fact of life. There was a dim view of excessive kindness, which was seen as "coddling." Physical punishment would have been a given, one that few would've batted an eye at.

So, on the one hand, you have a wizard who was born in an era where the idea of children as innocents was coming into vogue; on the other hand, society hypocritically employed children in dangerous work and deemed caring too much for them as a bad thing. He also employs Snape and makes little to no effort to curb the man's behavior in the classroom.

Add to this the views of wizarding child-rearing, which can be gleaned from, oddly enough, Neville Longbottom's background. No one thinks twice of him being dropped out a window. Not even Neville. It's likely that any wizard takes the resilience of magical children for granted, and a "tough love" attitude like Augusta Longbottom's doesn't seem to raise any eyebrows. Also of note: Hogwarts Castle and its surroundings can be pretty damn dangerous at times, but there's no real safety measures, just warnings. (Hello, Forbidden Forest full of centaurs and werewolves and hungry, giant spiders.)

Danger is seen as part of wizarding childhood. Strictness isn't abnormal, it's "character-building." Muggles aren't often seen as a danger to wizards in canon; wizards are frequently a danger to Muggles. Dumbledore probably didn't think that Lily's sister would outright hate her own nephew.

And Harry doesn't exactly go around talking about his home life. I also doubt that the Dursleys would let the neighbors know how they really treat him; they work very hard to maintain a facade of respectability. They know what they are doing is wrong, which is highlighted when they immediately move Harry from the cupboard to a bedroom once the wizards contact him. They didn't want to get in trouble for mistreating him.

All in all, I think most of it is generational and cultural differences paired with a touch of ignorance.
