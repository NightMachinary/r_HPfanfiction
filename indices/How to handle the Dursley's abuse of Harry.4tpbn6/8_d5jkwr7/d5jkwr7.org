Yes, Harry was abused. It was horrible and dreadful. But it never came close to being life threatening. Had he not had the blood protection, his life would have been threatened. He would have been dead. Dumbledore couldn't step in and stop the abuse, because it likely would have ended with Harry being tossed out. Or Harry being removed from the house by the equivalent of CPS. Both would have been death sentences. You could play it as the lesser of two evils in Dumbledore's mind. He didn't want to subject Harry to the abuse/neglect but the alternative was much worse.
