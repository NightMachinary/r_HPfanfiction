You can play the angle that Dumbledore did not actually realize what was going on. Figg did babysit for Harry, but the Dursleys are not about to show their sweet, elderly neighbor anything that might be cause for concern. The fact that Dumbledore did have Figg spy for him shows that he is not omniscient and he probably never showed up to the house.

Doesn't mean he didn't make a mistake though. Perhaps he should have checked up on Harry once a year or so. Drink some polyjuice, impersonate the mailman, etc. Make himself invisible as he says he can in the first book. That's where the anger can come in, without Dumbledore being all "hey, abuse is fine in my book."
