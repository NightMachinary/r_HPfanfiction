The reason why this isn't a big deal in canon is because the first few books are children's literature. Big, mean adults are a trope of the genre. They're handled as foes to be stood up to, not the protag's nightmare fuel from all the beatings. PS doesn't make light of this - it's just not a YA book that the series transitioned into around GoF. People who write outrage fics about the abuse more often than not don't realize or ignore this.

Imo, leave it the hell alone. It ain't worth writing about. Personally, I'd likely click out of a fic if this became a plot point.
