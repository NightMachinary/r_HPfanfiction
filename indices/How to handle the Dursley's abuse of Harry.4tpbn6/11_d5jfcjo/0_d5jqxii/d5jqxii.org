...Wait wait. So you're saying that if I'm writing a story that, until now has had a mostly realistic take on the world, when I get to Harry I should suddenly switch to the cartoon side of things? I agree outrage fics can go overboard, look at the whole "didn't know his name until school" thing, but PS having a lighter world view doesn't mean we have to write it from that world view. By that logic dark fics and those that try to insert politics and culture into Harry Potter are also stupid, and everything should be written in the same tone and style as JK's stuff, at which point why are we even bothering to write fanfic?
