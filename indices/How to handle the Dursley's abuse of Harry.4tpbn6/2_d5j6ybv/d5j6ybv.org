You can portray him as not knowing, which makes him a lot more sympathetic if careless.

You can have it happen "off page," for example, having [character who rescues Harry or whatever] have a private conversation in Dumbledore's office and then coming out and telling Harry that he wasn't going to be living with the Dursleys anymore. It would be understood that the adult in question (or whoever is involved in your story) had bawled him out, but it wouldn't look as bad if we didn't actually see it.
