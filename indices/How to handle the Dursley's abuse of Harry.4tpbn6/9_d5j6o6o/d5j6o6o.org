I think if you avoid the idea of physical abuse it can be more acceptable for dumbledore to miss it. As well as that, we know the Vernon's dislike of magic is based upon fear so attacking harry constantly seems ooc IMO. Also, all of this garbage in some pics about not knowing his own name till primary school or whatever is complete shite so avoid stuff like that.
