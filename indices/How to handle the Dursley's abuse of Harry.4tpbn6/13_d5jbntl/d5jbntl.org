might try something with Dumbledore's age and Figgy status as a squib. Albus was a kid about 1880. Oliver Twist was published in the 1830s to 1840's. Orphans didn't have an easy row to hoe 130 years ago. Harry's treatment wouldn't have been extreme in that time period. Figgy was a squib, squibs were often disowned and abandoned if not outright killed.

They were both good people (in your story) and might hope Harry would find a true home but when he didn't, they wouldn't have been shocked given their life experiences. remember Ariana.

As far as Figgy's reports, Harry's protection at #4 is vague enough that you can make non-interference with the Dursleys a condition of placement either due to how Albus set the protection charm or conditions the Dursleys imposed on the acceptance.

That said.. I don't believe it. It would take me a long time to dig up the exact quote so allow the paraphrasing of Albus talking to Harry in the latter books.. 'I never dreamed such a person would come into my *hands*..' I'm sure he said hands.

Not heart. Hands. Hands shape things, hearts hold them dear.
