Although technically less interesting than exploring themes of child abuse, you can explore supernatural reasons for their behavior. Perhaps Dumbledore /couldn't/ check on Harry personally or allow other magicals to do so because the presence of magicals would interfere with the blood protection in some way (thus a squib monitor). Perhaps the Dursleys behavior is explained by exposure to the scarcrux or perhaps Harry's early accidental magic was a real daily threat to the Dursleys (and their infant son) until they found something that worked (darkness and confinement).
