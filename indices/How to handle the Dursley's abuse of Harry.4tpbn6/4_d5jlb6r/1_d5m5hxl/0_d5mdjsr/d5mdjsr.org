  Canon Dumbledore is competent and benign though.
#+end_quote

Benign, sure. Making him malevolent, or at least terribly callous, is one easy way to resolve the conflict, though. That's why I brought it up.

Competent -- someone is not omnicompetent or universally incompetent. Canon shows that Dumbledore has superb magical abilities and, if I recall, that he can teach well. He's able to quiet a room full of students quickly.

His competence in other areas is mostly unexplored.

In context, I was talking about his ability to act like a social worker in Child Services, effectively. Can he find a good home to place a child, ensure that that home remains safe for the child, and recognize signs of abuse? In canon, he demonstrably cannot.

  not everything needs to be super realistic
#+end_quote

But characters should be portrayed in a realistic way. The story should be internally consistent. It is unsatisfying to readers otherwise.

For instance, Rowling took the "child left on a doorstep" trope, removed of its original context, and added a twist and a new context without considering what it said about her characters.

Is the trope bad? No. Do only bad people leave children on doorsteps? No.

But in the standard version, you leave a child on a doorstep of the church, because it's the next best thing to an orphanage for the period when the trope was born. In the standard version, there is a good reason to avoid talking to people when dropping off the child (it's a newborn and born out of wedlock, in a society where that is more than frowned upon).

By all evidence, Rowling /did not think/ about the implications this would have on her characters. /That/ is why it's bad.

Alternatively, she /did/ think about it, in which case the rest of the narrative is inconsistent. Which is also bad.

  Harry Potter was still an enjoyable read without it.

I can't enjoy it now that I've considered things like this. Does that count?
