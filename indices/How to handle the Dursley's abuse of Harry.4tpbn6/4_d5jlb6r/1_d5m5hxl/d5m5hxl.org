Canon Dumbledore is competent and benign though. Its just that canon is more concerned with being thematically consistent than being logically consistent. Harry is the protagonist, so Harry saves the day. Dumbledore is just the wise background wizard who gives advice but isn't directly involved in the plot. Logically Dumbledore should be doing more, but that isn't his role in the story so he doesn't. No evil or incompetence needed to explain it. Fanfiction is welcome to take a more realistic style where lots of attention is paid to all the possible characters motivations and actions in every situation and how effect follows cause, but that simply wasn't how it was done in canon. Which is fine, as not everything needs to be super realistic, while it adds another layer of immersion, and is masterful when pulled off, its also limiting, and Harry Potter was still an enjoyable read without it.
