  On the other hand, Dumbledore's in a position that, nominally, should deal with children. He should be in a position to recognize the ways in which children become damaged.

Though, of course, children have accidental magic so getting physically hurt is a tad harder, and as far as emotional development goes wizards are weird anyway, so it may be a bit excusable. But we do have canon evidence that he wasn't good at getting to kids fifty years back when he failed with Tom, so ... yeah, one could also just assume that he's good as a teacher or a leader or a powerful wizard but not the best when it comes to actually raising children and fulfilling their emotional needs.
