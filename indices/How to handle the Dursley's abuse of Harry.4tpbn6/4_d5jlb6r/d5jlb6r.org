We have stronger requirements of parents today than Dumbledore had growing up. We consider some things abuse that we wouldn't have been concerned with in 1890.

On the other hand, Dumbledore's in a position that, nominally, should deal with children. He should be in a position to recognize the ways in which children become damaged.

On the third hand, Dumbledore doesn't exactly interact with the students much. His office is hidden and password-protected. And with Tom Riddle, he also mistook Tom being abused and reacting to the abuse with Tom being indelibly evil. He was crud when he was working with children every day; now he's terribly out of touch.

In other words, you have your work cut out for you. If you want Dumbledore to seem both competent and benign, your best bet is to violate canon. The Dursleys were moderately distant parents to Harry, and he'd probably find help in [[/r/raisedbynarcissists]], but they were okay for the most part as long as nothing funny was going on.

That leads nicely into: the kid's got his Hogwarts letter and has gone to school. He's obviously and indelibly magical, so now the abuse starts in earnest. (After the shock and fear wears off, which means it starts after first year.) Dumbledore didn't know because it wasn't happening before Hogwarts.
