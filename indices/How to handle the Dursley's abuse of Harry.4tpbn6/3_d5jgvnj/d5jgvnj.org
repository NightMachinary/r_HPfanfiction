In part it is important to remember that the books are written primarily at the maturity level that Harry is at at the time. So, we have to infer what his life was /really/ like based on his perception. He was definitely abused, it is just a question of how much, and how it was done. Fics that claim he didn't know his name/ have extreme physical abuse are either non-cannon in that respect or have completely gone off the deep end.
