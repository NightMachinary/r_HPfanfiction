Dursleys are cartoonish step parents in the style of Roald Dahl, used largely for comic relief and to set up a contrast with the wonderful wizarding world to which Harry is invited, and except for the act of taking him in, their actions have no consequences whatsoever for Harry's personality or the plot.

So, I'd suggest treating what abuse you can infer as the prosaic analogue of cartoon violence, no more "serious business" than Bugs Bunny dropping an anvil on Daffy Duck's head.
