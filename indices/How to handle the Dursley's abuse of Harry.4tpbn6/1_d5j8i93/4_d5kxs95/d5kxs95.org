FRYING PAN!

(As far as I remember Petunia hit a young Harry with one!)

Also the cat flap, allowing (and actively encouraging) Duddley to harass and beat Harry (the Smelltings-Stick comes to mind, Vernon tells Dudley to hit Harry with it!), locking him in his cupboard (not to mention: Making him sleep in there in the first place!), the hand down clothes (they can afford better, but don't want to!) and the school uniform Petunia makes for him by dying another set of Duddley's old clothes (with some extremely smelly dying solution that's probably not healthy when worn daily), his bad (probably wrong prescription!) broken glasses etc. etc.

So I say that's abuse (it might not be as bad as some cases, like that Austrian man who locked his daugther up to rape her regularly and father several children with her, but that doesn't make it right or OK)

ps: They also allowed Vernon's sister to set her dog RIPPER on Harry and they let her denigrate his parents (not to mention that they themselves were doing this as well!)

ps: It's not "bashing" if you say something NEGATIVE about a character, everybody has got flaws!...hell, I like Sirius Black for example, but I think his feud with Snape (despite the fact that I don't even like Snape!) is ridiculous and saying that doesn't make it bashing!
