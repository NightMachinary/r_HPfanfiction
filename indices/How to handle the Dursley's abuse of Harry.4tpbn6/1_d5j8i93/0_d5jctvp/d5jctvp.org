He was locked in his room and fed through a cat flap. In one of the latter books it says 'Harry knew not to get within arm's reach of Vernon' (paraphrasing). That says there was at least a threat of violence. He was locked in the cupboard for the snake incident, made to sleep on the floor in the shack (did I make that up?). Petunia cut his hair in a way that would've made him be ridiculed. They told the neighbours lies so that he was ostracised. They sanctioned Dudley 'Harry hunting', and Harry was scared enough to apperate onto a roof. They did not provide adequate clothing. These are examples from the top of my head.

Scapegoats and favouritism are a recognised form of emotional and psychological abuse. Withholding food is physical abuse. Neglect is a form of abuse, not providing adequate housing for example, and a cupboard is not adequate. Withholding love, support and guidance are all forms of emotional abuse.

Child abuse is covered by four main blanket terms:

physical abuse

sexual abuse

neglect and abandonment

emotional or psychological abuse

Canon Harry suffered from all those forms except sexual. The Dursley's treatment of him would have been enough for social services to intervene.
