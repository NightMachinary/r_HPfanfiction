*(NSFW/NSFL links are in this post, just a warning.)*

I'm going to disagree with you on one point. Vehemently. Neglect /is/ a form of abuse, not just bad behavior. It's more than just ignoring a child and it can cause [[https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/impact/development/][long term issues]]. The Dursleys might not tick all the boxes, but they are [[http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/child-neglect.html][textbook]] abusers.

Part of the reason people disagree with the "Harry is abused" narrative is because JKR glosses over the reality. In the earlier books, she played Harry's situation more for laughs than anything else, (the tone of which changed as the books "grew up" along with the readers). It's hard to blame her, considering the target audience of her books. She's the spiritual successor to Dickens and Dahl.

But anyone examining his situation through a more critical lens will find his upbringing to be undeniably disturbing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1122772][Here's]] a pretty good meta analysis on how the Dursleys treated Harry -- *NSFW/NSFL* warning as it discusses the different forms of abuse in fairly stark, clinical terms.
