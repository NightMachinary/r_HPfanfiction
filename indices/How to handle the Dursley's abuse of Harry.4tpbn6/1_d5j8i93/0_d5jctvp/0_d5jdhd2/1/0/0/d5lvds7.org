It's less semantics or a need for "rightness" than it is a wish for clearer definitions. That's it, really.

As far as the Cinderella factor goes, I agree. That's in the second paragraph of my post above. JKR married a Dickens and Dahl approach, and that's a big part of why the series is such a draw. It's as close to a modern fairytale as I've seen.

Regarding pushiness: You might be reading too much into my post. Tone is a tricky thing on the internet, so I suppose my point didn't come across very well -- which is, basically, that if the /HP/ series is looked at from a different angle, Harry's situation with the Dursleys was pretty shitty.
