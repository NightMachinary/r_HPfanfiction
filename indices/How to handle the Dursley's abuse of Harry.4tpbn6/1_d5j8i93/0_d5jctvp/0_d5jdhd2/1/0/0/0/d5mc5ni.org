Ah, right, the problem with the tone in writing. I do know that one well, for I had to explain a few times because of it too. And as for pushiness, well ... when I got to your comment, it already had a downvote and it did appear pushy superficially, so I wrote it more or less to let you know that this is happening and that people are taking it this way (though, considering this reply of yours, I might have failed to make it as clear as I wanted it to be; yay for the tone again).

But yeah, Harry's situation is really cruddy and regardless of how one looks at it the Dursleys are abusive pieces of ... thing, regardless of how one puts it, be it abuse, neglect, being arseholes, or whatever other way. And certainly I can subscribe to getting a clearer definition because I once spent a week ping-ponging messages with someone who made a moron out of themselves by not understanding that two homophones are not necessarily the same thing meaning-wise and that redefining one to be equal to the other does not an argument make, but I think in the case of the message you originally replied to it was a case of someone talking about the subcategories (which means that “neglect more than abuse” would mean “it's neglect as a form of abuse more than physical, emotional, or any other abuse”) rather than saying that it's not abuse altogether (at least, that's what I got from their other comments here).

Anyway, I'm ending it right now, since I seem to be starting a journey towards mental Siberia and that's going to result in a wall of text only tangentially related to anything if I let it happen.
