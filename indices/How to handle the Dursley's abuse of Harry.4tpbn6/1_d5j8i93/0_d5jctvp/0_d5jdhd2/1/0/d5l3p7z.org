You know, considering the person you are replying to has already agreed that neglect can be abuse, right now you are basically playing semantics to look more right than them. Or at least that's how it looks to the general populace.

We do know that neglect can be abuse, and in this particular case is. The point is that in the books proper it is shown as “neglect” more than “abuse” because the books gloss over both the behaviour and the possible implications it may have to a child's development; because really, it is played for the “Cinderella” factor. And while I do disagree with the books' act of glossing over the implications---and that other people do too is why this post even is a thing, most likely---and also with Faeriniel's approach to it (because the lion's share of abuse in this case is emotional, with neglect being closely linked to it, rather than it being mostly neglect), you seem a bit too pushy there and this isn't going to make people want to actually listen to what you say.
