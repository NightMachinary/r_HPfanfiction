  I just think that it's important that all forms of abuse are understood, recognised and validated.

My problem with most of fanfiction's depiction of the Dursleys lies there. The authors don't seem to think that what the Dursleys did (mostly neglect and emotional abuse, some physical) was bad enough. I get the feeling they don't think neglect and emotional abuse is abuse and they weigh it less than physical abuse. So they have the Dursleys beat Harry every day, sexually abuse him, and so on. But that sort of treatment is neither backed by canon nor necessary as they already treated him terribly and abusively. The quote by Vernon even points out that they /didn't/ beat him:
