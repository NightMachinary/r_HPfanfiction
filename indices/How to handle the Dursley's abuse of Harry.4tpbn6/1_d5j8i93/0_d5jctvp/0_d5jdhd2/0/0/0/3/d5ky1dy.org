Do you have links (because most stories that look into this make it worse (note: I still think that Vernon did hit Harry sometimes, but I don't think he beat him with a belt and other tools regularly))?

ps: I love seeing the Dursleys punished (so in general I like reading stories where they are worse, still it would be great actually seeing what the canon abuse did to Harry because in the books he doesn't show many signs (I'd think he'd be far less trusting and more withdrawn for example and he would not accept betrayal at all, so Ron doesn't get second and even third chances at all and Hermione doesn't get to boss him around, if he's even friends with either or both of them!))
