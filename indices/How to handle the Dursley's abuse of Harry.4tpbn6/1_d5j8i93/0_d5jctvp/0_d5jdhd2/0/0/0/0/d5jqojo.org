I'd just like to thank you all, particularly [[/u/fenellakettlewich]] for the clarity and interest you've shown in your posts. Honestly, I am probably excessively biased on this front, as I'm personally recovering from emotionally abusive parents, so I'm more sensitive to such things. It was never my intention to ramp up what happened to him, but I do fully intend to explore what happened canonically. And /that/ was abuse. I have a somewhat darkly humorous scene planned out where the main cast, most of whom are very protective of children or else the victims of abuse themselves (albeit usually more damaging then the form the Dursley's used) have to figure who can go get him that /won't/ likely to burn the house down.
