Currently reading the story by The Seeker. It's very good, and exactly how I've always imagined it. I don't understand how people can say what the Dursleys did to Harry wasn't abusive; I can only conclude they have never been bullied. Bullying is terrible and constant, and Harry not only has a bully at school, he lives with three, two of whom are adults and legitimize the actions of the other one. Harry should be /messed up/ - although, shades of that do come through even in canon.

Anyway, what I find most realistic about The Seeker's story is that yes, I can well believe Petunia and Vernon being very careful not to leave any marks or to let themselves get caught being abusive. Abusers do that; anything to prolong their fun and nasty behavior. Some people are awfully quick to give the Dursleys the benefit of the doubt as if they weren't two adults who were horrible to one child in their care while lavishing over-the-top affection and praise on the other. They've always made me sick.

Having said that, The Seeker's story is doing a great job of making me feel some sympathy for Petunia and to see it from her angle. Again, that has its roots in canon, which I think some people fail to take into account - she is a thin, slender homemaker with no living family and no friends to speak of, who lives with a man much, much larger than her, who is the sole breadwinner, believes in traditional values, and has a bad temper and an equally horrible family. What's she to do, behind closed doors, with no support network of her own?
