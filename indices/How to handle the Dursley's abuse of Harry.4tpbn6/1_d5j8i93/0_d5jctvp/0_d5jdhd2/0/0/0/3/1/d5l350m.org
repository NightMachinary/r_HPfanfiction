Actually it depends. Some abused children, especially institutionalised, but not always, go the other end of the scale and make immediate, strong attachments leaving them vulnerable to exploitation or severe depression I'd they feel abandoned again. It's why it's a terrible idea to let white teenagers go and volunteer in orphanages on their gap years.
