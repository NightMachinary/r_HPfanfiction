Completely. I've read some really good stories that explore the results of his canon treatment by the Dursley's, sometimes the subtle things are the most fascinating. His home life really was utterly crappy, as it was portrayed, and no one could go through that completely unscathed.

I like reading an exploration of the effects of his childhood, the different ways that could have made things play out. Because he did grow up unloved, deprived of the simple things every child deserves, they are not little things (when he gets that hug from Mrs Weasley and he thinks that must be how a mother feels, well that is just heartbreaking in itself).

That's not to say I don't ever read fics where the violence is ramped up, or that people shouldn't write it. But his experiences in the books would have left scars, and sometimes psychological and emotional scars can be the hardest to heal of all.
