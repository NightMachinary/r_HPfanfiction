I agree that there is little evidence of physical violence/classic physical abuse against Harry in the books. And the main form of abuse Harry suffered was neglect and emotional abuse, he was not emaciated, he did have a bed of sorts, he was clothed after a fashion. But under any commonly accepted definitions of abuse, he was abused. I don't actually disagree with your general sentiment. What I was clarifying is that neglect #is a form of abuse, so it cannot be said that the Dursley's did not abuse Harry.

I don't mean to get too serious over an imaginary boy and terminology, I just think that it's important that all forms of abuse are understood, recognised and validated. /Climbs off soapbox for the day
