I would also add,

  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.--Book 1

Harry was never or rarely physically abused except by Dudley. He was only starved when he was locked in his room in Book 2. He was definitely emotionally abused and neglected, but he was mostly psychologically healthy and felt safe enough to mock the Dursleys fairly regularly, e.g. "I didn't know it had to be so wet." So he might not have presented as abused. (Disclaimer: I am neither a psychologist nor a child care worker.)

Dumbledore couldn't have involved CPS, as [[/u/onekrazykat]] mentioned, but he could have visited the Dursleys directly. That alone might have scared them into treating Harry better. I think his main mistakes were trusting Mrs. Figg to spot any problems and not visiting in person once a year or so. Because of those, he might not have know anything was wrong beyond the bad blood between Petunia and Lily. (And remember there is no canon evidence that he was monitoring Harry from his office.)
