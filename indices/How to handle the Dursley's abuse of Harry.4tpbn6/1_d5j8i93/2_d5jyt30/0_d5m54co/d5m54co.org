So several things the Dursley's did do are 100% considered abuse by modern definitions. Fanon tends to exaggerate it however. But yes Harry doesn't actually act like an abused child. It basically stems from the fact that the first few books were more fairy taleish and having evil step parts is a pretty common trope. So the Dursley's were made basically cartoonisly evil, and as essentially caricatures/cartoons they aren't meant to be taken seriously so it doesn't actually effect harry much. It wasn't meant to be a real look on abuse, it was just there for background effect, but this gets a bit harder to reconcile as the books got more serious as they progressed.

I agree manipulative Dumbledore is stupid though. He clearly was intended to be a good character, not a manipulative one. Its just that it would mess up the plot too much if he saved the day or was overly involved in whatever that year's situation was so he didn't. In general things often happen for plot convenience rather than them being necessarily logically consistent, so it looks like things are happening too neatly which implies a manipulator behind the scenes. But there isn't one, that's just Rowling's style of writing. Which is totally fine as Harry Potter wasn't trying to be A Song of Ice and Fire, its just not that type of series. Even in Lord of the Rings stuff like this happens, e.g. the eagles not just carrying Frodo to mount doom and the book being over in only 100 pages. Well if Dumbledore figures out Quirell is Voldemort right away and stops him immediately then there isn't a book. Or if the obstacles on the way aren't perfectly situated for Harry's friends skill sets, then he can't make it to the end and have his confrontation with Quirelmort. And thematically he needs that confrontation since it makes a good story.
