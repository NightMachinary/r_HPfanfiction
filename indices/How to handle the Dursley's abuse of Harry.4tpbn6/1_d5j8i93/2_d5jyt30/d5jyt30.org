The biggest indication of how the Dursleys treat Harry is in how Harry treats them. Which is that he dismisses them. Regularly mocks them, and generally thinks they're ridiculous.

The people who believe in the abusive!Dursleys are the same people who believe in manipulative!Dumbledore. Because they can't see the big picture instead focus of a few small details. They're conspiracy theorists, basically.
