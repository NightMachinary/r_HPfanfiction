I feel like Harry suffered from neglect more than abuse. At least that's my reading of canon. All his physical needs are met, albeit barely. Harry is fed regularly, he eats at the table, he attends school.

  /"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured/ - Vernon Dursley - Book 1
#+end_quote

Here we see that Vernon has refrained from hitting Harry, however poorly he has treated Harry otherwise. He doesn't even swing at Harry in book 5 when he believes Harry is responsible for Dudleys Demenor exposure. However, Vernon and Petunia don't do anything to protect Harry from Dudley, his gang, Aunt Marge or her dogs.

They obviously feel threatened by his presence in the house and attribute all abnormal behaviour to Harry. They don't trust him to be left alone, as is demonstrated before the visit to the zoo.

The key to Harry's protection is his mothers sacrifice. Which is only maintained by Petunia's tenuous acceptance of Harry.

  /"She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you."/ - Dumbledore Book 5
#+end_quote

In fact that only people that hurt Harry while under the protection of the house are Petunia and Dudley. Petunia swings a frying pan at Harry in book 2, and only after believing that Harry might have used magic to hurt/scare her child.

Dudley also bullies Harry, which is something that I think all brothers do so some extent. Dudley's behaviour is consistently rewarded by his parents, who treat Harry as a lesser being.

*What is important is that both these people are direct blood relatives.*

Now lets look at Dumbledore's history.

His life is marred by Muggle/Wizard conflict. It lead him to Grindlewald, it cost him his father, his mother, his sister and the love of his brother. Some how I can't see Albus feeling comfortable threatening Muggles or Obliviating them. It would remind him too much of his tragic past.

Finally lets look to the Longbottoms who were tortured by Death Eaters in the weeks following Voldemort's fall. They were both Auror's and likely protected by powerful home enchantments, similar to No.12 Grimmauld Place. Not even they could protect themselves!

Neville (the other choice for the prophecy) is effectively left an orphan, seeing this, and knowing that the Dursley's only grudgingly took Harry, how could Albus not think that he had done the right thing?

Especially after Harry shows up at Hogwarts ten years later as a fairly well adjusted young man.

I realise I've not really answered your question directly but I feel these points need to be taken into consideration for anyone planning to remove Harry from No. 4 Private Drive
