They shook hands series by Dethryl and the R-series by Regulus come to mind. Going by your description it might be TSH is actually the one you are currently reading;

TSH Rewrite linkffn(7659033; 7786722; 7949779; 8120562; 9224700; 10908505), I recommend to read this version of the series. Year 7 is still in the works and will be posted once completed.\\
TSH Original linkffn(6378694; 6382715; 6417928; 6453693; 9158765), this version stops after 5th year as the author started a rewrite.\\
R-Series linkffn(2008185; 2132034; 2576886; 2845160; 3359932; 3658273; 4276801), AU with an aged down Tonks, up till 4th year it's following Canon storyline but starts to divert from that point onwards.
