If you look for SlytherinHarry fics you can find many more, it used to be a quite popular idea.

TSH is the only one I remember top of my head that is actually an entire series rewrite, most will be just one fic that starts in one of the later years (usually 5th) ignoring or bypassing the earlier years (usually the idea is everything happened exactly the same as in canon, just replace Ron With Draco and Hermione with RandomSlytherin).
