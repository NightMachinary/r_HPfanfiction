There's a difference between wanting to read a */Harry Potter/* story and a new story.

As far as I'm concerned, if there are less actual Harry Potter characters than there are OC's, then it doesn't really qualify as a /Harry Potter/ story. I read fanfics because I like to see how people can adapt a character to a different scenario without changing them fundamentally. I read new books because I want to learn of new worlds with different people and how it all works for them. I don't read fanfics to see the author attempt to mix the two.
