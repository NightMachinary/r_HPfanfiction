I know one that sort of has the elements you seek.

It's a collection of short stories only known as "Common sense", where the author gives a spin to certain cliches in fanfiction.

The specific chapters you are looking for are called "A father's Love" parts 1, 2 and 3. This deals with James Potter and his twin sons and how he should deal with one of them being the boy-who-lived.

The whole thing can be found here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/1/Common-Sense]]

I really recommend a full read though since every short story is pretty good by itself.
