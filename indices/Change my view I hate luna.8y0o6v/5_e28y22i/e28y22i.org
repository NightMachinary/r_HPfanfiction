  I just don't get how people can like her or even pair her with anyone.
#+end_quote

I personally love Luna, though I never pair her with anyone, for the very important reason that we never really see her interact with anyone on a potentially romantic level.

  She belongs in a mental ward and therapy.
#+end_quote

People who are admitted into mental wards tend to be either dangerous, either to themselves or to others, or else are unable to function in day-to-day life by themselves.

The idea that you think Luna belongs in a mental ward is, frankly, rather frightening.

As to whether she needs therapy, I'd like to remind you that these are fantasy books. As a general rule, therapists tend to be in very short supply in fantasy books.

And really, does Luna actually /need/ therapy? She seems to have accepted the reality of death and is at peace with it. That actually puts her above most of the characters.

  Her passive accepting of bullying in canon and every single fanfic disgusts me. It is never a view on the powerlessness of the victim but always like, they don't mean it, they are under me, or some other bullshit.
#+end_quote

It's important to point out just how far the bullying goes in canon. Luna's called Loony, which is hurtful, but also a really lame nickname. That's something five-year-olds come up with. If /teenagers/ are calling her that, Luna could quite justifiable find that beneath her.

We also know that her books and clothes are stolen and hidden. Luna's never described in the books as missing clothing--her walking the halls barefoot is from the movies. So the thieving, while hurtful, is also, apparently, not enough to interfere with her day-to-day activities.

Third, Luna describes the taunts and stealing as "all in good fun." You can say that it's "bullshit," but compare what we see with Luna with other bullies. While he doesn't do it often compared to using cruel taunts, Malfoy has been known to physically intimidate his victims. He uses Crabbe and Goyle as muscle and he casts curses at people he doesn't like.

Luna never gets treated like that. She's called an uncreative, if cruel, nickname and people swipe some of her stuff. But she is not physically bullied.

And if the people who pick on her and take her things wanted to attack her physically, it wouldn't necessarily be difficult. Most of the bullying is from her own housemates. She'd be outnumbered and outgunned if they ever decided to ambush her.

  I don't remember if she contributed anything ever in canon.
#+end_quote

That requires its own response.
