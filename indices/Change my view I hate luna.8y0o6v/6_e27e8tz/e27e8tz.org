Here's my argument: Your annoyance with Luna is kind of J.K. Rowling's point. I adore Luna because she's such an accurate depiction of the kind of person who is slightly shunned in real life. Oftentimes in books and movies, perfectly normal, smart, funny people are ostracized by their peers, and it simply doesn't add up. In real life, the people you tend to not want to hang out with are the people who always say things that leave you with nothing to respond with but, 'Er... okay...'

J.K. Rowling has Luna do a lot of subtle things that I think are realistic for a socially awkward person, like Luna /losing her shit/ over Ron's dumb joke.

  'I'll make Goyle do lines, it'll kill him, he hates writing,' said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle's low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. '/I ... must ... not ... look ... like ... a ... baboon's ... backside ....'/

  Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing.

  'That was /funny/!'

  Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and forward, clutching her sides.

What Luna teaches us is that these people -- in all their weirdness and awkwardness -- are worth getting to know as well, that they are smart and funny in their own ways that are different from what we may be used to.
