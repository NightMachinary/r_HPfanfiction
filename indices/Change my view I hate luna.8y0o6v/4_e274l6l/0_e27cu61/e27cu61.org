I don't think it's that she didn't let anything get to her. It's hard to believe that she truly didn't care about people calling her Loony or stealing her shoes. There are instances where she shows irritation or loneliness, like when she responded coldly to Hermione insulting the Quibbler and I believe she once referred to the DA meetings as "almost like having friends".

So more than not caring about what people thought of her, I think she very much wanted people to like her, but refused to compromise or change herself to do so, which is admirable. I probably wouldn't want to hang around her much though.
