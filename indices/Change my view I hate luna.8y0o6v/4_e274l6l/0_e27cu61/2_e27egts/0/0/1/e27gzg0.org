It may be a misconception I don't know if that was ever fully explained, however even if it was true I'd think more people than Snape would know it. Yes Snape was the creator of the spell, and most likely the counter-curse as well, but I do believe others would know the curse, as Draco Malfoy wouldn't be the first victim of the spell. Sure there had to be deaths from it but I do believe there had to also be those saved from it as well. And I think Poppy might know it, if not the St Mungo's people after Snape switched sides. Of course my conception is that it's not just Harry and Snape that know of the curse but I'd assume other Death Eaters as well. Snape was a real Death Eater at one point and I'm sure his buddies knew of the spell, or at least seen it used by Snape at some point and would know of it.
