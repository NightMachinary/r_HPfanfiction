Obviously! That mediwitch has an automatic procedure set up because these children sectrumsempra each other all the time. Did you even think before you posted or did you go with your first kneejerk reaction? Rhetoric question, it's obviously the latter considering you took it to mean "if it can be undone..."

You never even wasted a moment's thought about the place where this occurs - a boarding school, full of young children who misplace and misappropriate their own and each others' possessions all the time. A place where they are required to have little name tags in their clothes, to enable easy and speedy return. A place with a large staff off people who constantly clean up after them and sort issues out so efficiently they are never noticed most of the times. But all you thought of was "if it can be undone..." and your own fears.
