Well who cares if you get Sectumsempra'd when the mediwitch can just patch you right up so it doesn't matter.

The logic of: "If it can be undone than it's not really a bad thing to do and is okay." is not good logic at all. If I go out and get shot or stabbed, and let's say survive it, I can heal and be fine yeah. So I guess than it's not a big deal that I got shot or stabbed. Or if someone breaks into your home and steals your laptop but you go out and buy a new one, well you got a laptop again so what did it matter if someone stole from you anyway?
