I am a med student. Matter of fact, I am. Last year even. But yeah, nope, no one in a white coat would ever use lol, right.

Voices in your head and all the other symptoms you describe are extremely damaging. Extremely and very very. You do not need an open bleeding wound to hurt. Did your friend suffer? Yes, she definitely did. Did the illness do damage to her? It definitely did. Because that is what all illnesses do or they are not an illness.
