Okay, I understand what you mean. I think it is definitely alarming how Luna and her father are described. Something with their relationship seems off. Though I think that this whole "children become exactly like their parents"-thing in the entire HP series is absurd and unhealthy. That goes so far that the suppossed wise guy of the series says that a certain child conceived in rape can not love and calls it poetic justice - which is just about the worst thing I have ever read. And let's not forget the whole Joke that is called HP and the CC.

I am not sure if Luna is that unaware of the world around her, or if appearing like this is just her way of dealing with everything. I am not sure if bullying for example can be stopped effectively, except by finding real friends that can protect you of course, which is never an easy task.

Have you read linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]) ? The main character in it hates the same things about Luna that you seem to hate. It is brilliant imo.
