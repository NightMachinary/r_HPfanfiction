I definitely agree with you.

Same goes for Ginny after her first year and of course for Harry. I read Harry Potter when I was younger and did not realize it, but nowadays the irresponsibility of the adults in it feels horrible to me.

It felt to me that the poster just wanted to put her away because she is weird, not because they were worried about her, therefore I disagreed so violently. I apologize for my reaction and my arrogance towards you.
