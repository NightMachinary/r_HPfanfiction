Hm. That is a good question, I think to some extent almost everyone would benefit from some therapy. My reaction was towards the poster, who said she "belongs in a mental ward and therapy", because they are disgusted by her lack of reaction. I would argue that disgusting someone else by her behaviour is not reason enough to force her into therapy. Luna has suffered because she was bullied, we can not make chance the past, so we ask her the question if she still suffers because of what she has been through. If yes, then yes, I think she should be offered therapy. If not, then who are we to force it upon her.
