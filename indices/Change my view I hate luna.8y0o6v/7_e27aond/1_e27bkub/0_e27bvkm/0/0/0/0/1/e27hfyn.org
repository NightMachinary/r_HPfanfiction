I didn't mean she should be locked away, it was a way of saying she need severe help. Maybe a closed institution would be best in a way that it removes her from a toxic environment (bullying in school, or a equally challenged father).

Any way in my opinion she needs help, because being totally socially inept and bullying is hurting her. In addition not bering aware of the world around her is dangerous in a general sense.
