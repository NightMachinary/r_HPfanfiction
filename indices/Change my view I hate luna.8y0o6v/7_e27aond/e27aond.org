Why the mental ward and therapy? Illness is whatt damages or endangers yourself or/and those around you. Luna does not harm anyone, why does she have to be put away?

She and her dad contributed by defending Dumbledore after the book came out and Luna was described as an important part of the DA. She is one of the few characters that showed uncovered warmth to others in canon, we saw that when she talked to Harry after Slughorn's party. She is the conspiracy theorist she was raised to be, but she does no harm.
