Look, here's the deal about Luna. She is a conspiracy theorist character that was introduced by Rowling, in a similar way that Neville became important in OOTP, because they needed more people than Harry to see the thestrals, plus Rowling started to cotton on to it being a very pro-Gryffindor story. Diversity and all that.

But Luna is perhaps singularly unique in the Harry Potter series for one reason: there is never a point in the story where you can say she was mean or bad or stupid. There is no Ron-walks-away-from-Harry moment, or any Hermione-tattles-to-the-teachers moment, or Dumbledore's ten dark and lonely years move.

She is a kind person. The only people who dislike her or treat her badly are usually petty ignorant bullies. In this way, she is the most like Harry, and perhaps Neville, that the trauma of her childhood loss left a distinct mark on their characters. Her response was that she is never mean, always kind, even in the worst situations.

It has been said that adversity brings out the best, and worst, of humanity. Luna can in some ways represent the best of humanity: optimistic, open to the infinite, and kind in the face of malice and cruelty.
