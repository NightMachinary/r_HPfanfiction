The first wizarding war was ended by the defeat of Voldemort, and only Voldemort was defeated. His death eaters stopped fighting the moment he fell. This would likely happen again in this scenario as soon as Harry bested him.

As to time within Hogwarts? Voldemort gave them one hour to present Harry Potter to them willingly. As to the retaking of Hogwarts? Voldemort had only a token force (which makes no sense) guarding it, you do not need the DA to do so.
