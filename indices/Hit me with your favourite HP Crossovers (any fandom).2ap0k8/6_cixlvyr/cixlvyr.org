  After discovering that Cadence is not who she appears to be, Twilight is sent to another world entirely by the disguised Changeling Queen to avoid her plan being disrupted. When Twilight lands, she discovers that not only have Spike and their pets followed her, but that they've arrived in a world where the main sentient species is human. There's still a magic school, though.
