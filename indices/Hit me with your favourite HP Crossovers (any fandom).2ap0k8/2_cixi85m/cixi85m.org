[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] - Avengers - The writing is absolutely top notch, having an older and more mature Harry entering the Avengers world is a nice change from most of the other fics in this particular crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5379292/1/Bleached][Bleached]] - Bleach - I'm a big fan of bluminous8's writing and this one is no exception, warnings for a slightly sue Harry. The author has written several other HP crossover fics so if you like this one make sure to check those out.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] (and its two sequels) - Dresden Files - Shezza writes one hell of a badass Harry. The parts of the fic that are a crossover are usually explained well enough that you don't need prior knowlege with the Dresden Files.
