[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]: Crossover with Firefly/Serenity, set after the movie's end. So well written it changed my headcanon of Firefly after I finished it to 'of course this is what came after'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2862528/2/Elijah-s-Cup][Elijah's Cup]]: Narnia. Has more of the air of the Narnia books even though it's set in the Harry Potter world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][Harveste]]: Addams Family. Does a good job of mixing the creepiness of the Addams with the magic of Harry Potter. Start of a series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818454/1/Of-Veils-Gates-and-Magic][Of Veils, Gates, and Magic]]: Stargate SG1. Short, but amusing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389264/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Host-Club][Harry Potter and the Host Club]]: Ouran High School Host Club. Silly but fun. Includes slash, but not very graphic that I recall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380273/1/Meadows-of-Heaven][Meadows of Heaven]]: Narnia. Same as the other, has a Narnia air to it, but just a oneshot. Check the author's profile to find the sequel.
