[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10001746/1/The-Potter-of-Thedas][The Potter of Thedas]]: Dragon Age crossover. A very fun and awesome crossover of Harry stumbling into another universe - and meeting some /interesting/ people along the way.

This one is unique. It's a trilogy that is still being updated, I hope. The updates on the last one come very slowly, but they do come. It is a Bleach crossover found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1874144/Eradona][Eradona's]] page. It gets a little whacky in some parts but overall is a good story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1874144/Eradona][Wizard Runemaster]]: Warcraft crossover. A Harry/Harem story that is well written, kinda smutty, and universally funny. I really love this one but it updates infrequently.

I also second the nomination for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]. It is a really good read.
