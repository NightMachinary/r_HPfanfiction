I really liked [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] by Tigerman In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

This is the one where he makes the essences of plants and stuff, if you've read that before. I don't remember if it went deep into harry/Luna's relationship though.
