I've posted it before, but just in case: I think my favorite Luna is in the [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] By Jeconais.

Some of the more common ones, in case you haven't read them: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Lunna's Hubby]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help of a Seer]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6583426/1/Death-s-Doorbell][Death's Doorbell]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][The Dementors of Azkaban]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5140198/1/Jackalopes-and-Jobberknolls][Jackalopes and Jobberknolls]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5107098/1/Voldemort-My-Pet-Inferius][Voldemort My Pet Inferius]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818454/1/Of-Veils-Gates-and-Magic][Of Viels, Gates and Magic]] (Stargate-1 crossover, oneshot), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7382549/1/When-Is-It-a-Contract][When is it a contract]].

Silently Watches' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and WIP sequel are billed to be Harry/Luna. Of course, It is also a Fem!Harry, and the pairing hasn't occured yet. Luna has had a minor role so far. His story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heros]] is Harry/Hermione/Luna.

While looking up stories for this post, I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3226536/1/The-Blood-Tipped-Feather][The Blood Tipped Feather]], which is Harry/Luna.

Do you have any Luna stories recommendations for us?
