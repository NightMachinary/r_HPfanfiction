[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection From Nargles]] is one of the best HP/LL fics I've read. Very fluffy, and very cute.

The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1327362/JJ-Rust][JJ Rust]] has several HP/LL one-shots as well; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3961411/1/Not-Right-For-Him][Not Right For Him]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4236132/1/A-Little-Push][A Little Push]], to list a couple.

Oh, and there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]]. It's unfinished, but it has quite a few nice moments.
