[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7245318/1/Sight-of-Spangled-Silver][If you pardon the late response]]. Warning: hard fic to read, due to perspective. It's written as a stream of consciousness from Luna's pov. Just her thoughts, no description of what's going on or dialogue. That said it is very well done, and once you get used to it, extremely enjoyable.

Also see a ton of protection from nargles and contemplating clouds, I recommend both.
