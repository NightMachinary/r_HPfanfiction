true. I can understand why people mock about with her character because if you want a seer she is the most obvious go-to character if you don't want OC's.

I only really dislike it, if it seems they are taking the changes too seriously, or they say she 'acts' Loony because she doesn't want to get hurt and she is able to flick a switch and suddenly become Super!Luna. Well, fanfics do have a tendency to attract writers that bend /everything/ to fit a new, optimal reality.
