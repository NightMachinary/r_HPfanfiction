Well, if you're not opposed to Luna/Voldemort, I would definitely recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3037156/][Twelve Dark Moons]] by Sophiax. The storyline is a little predictable and cliche but the writing is excellent and the characterization for Luna is one of the best I've encountered. I always find myself going back to it.
