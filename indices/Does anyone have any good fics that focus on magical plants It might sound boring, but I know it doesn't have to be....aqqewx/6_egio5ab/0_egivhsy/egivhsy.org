It's been years since I've read or watched anything lotr related, but I've been able to keep up with everything so far. Well-written, and will keep me busy for a while. Love the potions use, with how he has to think through the process ingredient-by-ingredient and takes into account the plants' natures. I'm looking forward to reading more. Thanks for the rec!
