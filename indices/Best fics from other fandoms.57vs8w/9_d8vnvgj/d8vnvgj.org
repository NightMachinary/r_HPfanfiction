If like me, you have given up on most Pokemon fanfiction, Olivine Romance is the one for you

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8068559/1/Olivine-Romance]]) Some parts are quite 'mature' so there is a AO3 version uncensored but the story is still quite understandable without it.

It manages to not only give the Pokemon world some depth and realism, it also tells a very compelling story. It's somewhat hard to describe, but this fic can make you feel any emotion. Happiness, sadness, joy and a great heaping dollop of frustration too. If you feel like reading something good, read this.
