Well, aside from White Squirrel (who does Harry Potter), my favourite author is probably Saphroneth.

Ashes of the Past, linkffn(7262793) , is one of those absolute doorstoppers; it's a story where Ash Ketchum, following the destruction of the world by Cyrus, is sent back in time by Arceus, with a little bit of training in Aura from Sir Aaron, and the ability to restore the memories of the 'old timeline' to his friends and family.

I solemnly swear that you'll enjoy it, even if you've never watched the Pokemon anime (I know I haven't). All of the characters are likable and/or competent, there's no Super!Ash or anything going on...
