Well, there is /some/ “Super!Ash”, but in my opinion it's well done and more often than not him being in some way overpowered is played for laughs. The fights are actually entertaining, is what I want to say, unless they are things like random mook attacks in which case he overpowers them something silly and that's entertaining too.

That said, this story does contain Squirtle, so people who absolutely cannot enjoy certain things being changed for the sake of amusement and entertainment and better plot progression might not get into it. But if you treat it like a long-running crack fic with actual plot that it happens to be, it's glorious.
