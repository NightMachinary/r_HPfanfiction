linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6148203/1/Worst-Field-Trip-Ever]]) Not the best written by any means, but I have to say the author does a good job writing Toph's blindness into the story--the descriptions just feel right.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6200018/1/Slumber-My-Darling]]) This one is simply heart-jerking. Magnificent story.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9058021/1/When-Past-Meets-Present]]) Another great fic. Unfinished. Probably abandoned. But I honestly prefer it to the Trilogy Comics.

Bridge to Terabithia. Trust me, I only picked the best.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3718824/1/Stars-Over-Terabithia]]) Sadly unfinished. But this was the first fanfiction I ever loved.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655216/1/A-Life-Rescued]]) I had my doubts about this one, but this turned out to be a very well-written fic, and an excellent YA story in its own right.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5630256/1/The-New-Life]]) A Bridge to Terabithia story that may as well be literally in Terabithia.

Avatar: The Last Airbender/Stargate

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple]]) This one is fantastic. I know very little about Stargate, but I loved it anyway.
