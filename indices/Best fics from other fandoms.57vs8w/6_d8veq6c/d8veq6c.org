Okay, so I made some recs [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4pmh5z/what_is_the_legendary_fanfic_in_your_fandom/d4n0qbx?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4ihc6s/if_i_liked_embers_by_vathara_what_stories_in/d3whnd9?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4mmdaz/daily_discussion_for_june_05/d3wy2u0?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4lan96/fic_rec_friday/d3luweq?context=3][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4i7n6w/ficrec_friday_may_6/d2vv7fk?context=3][here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4lan96/fic_rec_friday/d3luvmb?context=3][here]].

They're a bit of a mixed bag. I'm a multishipper as well (het, fem/slash, poly, gen, etc) so there's that, too. :p

ETA: I also have a bunch of Naruto recs [[http://amethyst-rei.livejournal.com/17592.html][here]]. It's not a comprehensive list but lots of my faves are definitely on there.

Also, I'm currently reading (well, listening to) Metisket's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31364][Demon Alchemist 'Verse]] (Fullmetal Alchemist, GEN) ([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/172415][podfic here]]. It's really brilliant and I definitely recommend it.

I also started Bob_Fish's FMA series [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/6053][Wrong Turn 'Verse]] which is shaping up to be quite a read. It contains slash and het, but romance isn't really the focus of the story.
