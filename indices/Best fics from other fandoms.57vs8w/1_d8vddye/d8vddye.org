So here I go.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man]]) An amazingly well done Lex Luthor fanfiction that makes precise use of each and every word to create a fanfic where every chapter is extremely gripping. No expense is spared for fluff with well done characterization and plot rounded off with an ending that's bound to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate]]) Another amazing Lex Luthor fanfiction that's set spanning the entire DC Universe. The plot is set at an epic level and the fabulous writing makes this truly one of the best DC fanfiction there is. The fic does have romance but it isn't forced or overbearing on the plot in any way.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain]]) Written by the same author as above^{.} This one is a Spiderman and Prototype (the videogame) crossover. No prior knowledge of Prototype is necessary. At least I didn't have any prior knowledge of the game to enjoy the quality writing and the original plot. The romance again isn't overbearing on the plot but is arguably more tropey at times. That said, it's well done and doesn't diminish from an amazing fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3294180/1/The-Incredibly-Dense-Mind-of-Lois-Lane]]) A classic funny fic written by arguably fanfiction's greatest comedy writer, Nonjon. This one's set in the comic book world with writing that'll truly make you laugh out loud.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898868/1/Professor-Arc]]) The best RWBY fic I've had the pleasure to read. It's a comedy fic that gets better and funnier every chapter while not falling for the problems that plague most comedy fanfiction. The author is by far the best author in all of RWBY fanfiction and is easily in the top authors in all of fanfiction. His other pieces of writing all deserve their spot on this list, but if I added more there would be a dozen more RWBY fanfiction recs on here so I chose to go with his best one. I really reccomend that you folks check out his other works if you like this one.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11259714/1/A-Common-Criminal-Or-Something]]) Another RWBY fanfiction but one that's much more darker. This one's situated on the edge of deserving to be on here and "what is this fic" level. It's an interesting take on how an innocent youngster becomes a common criminal and not in an idealistic romantic way. The style of this fic can we offputting but the subject matter makes the style worth bearing through, at least until it starts growing on you.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4553963/1/The-Mystery-of-Conan-Edogawa]]) A well done Conan fanfic where Ran pursues the mystery of what happened to Conan. Ran's character is truly fabulous in this fic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6441645/1/Patriot-s-Dawn]]) My favorite Naruto fanfiction. The characters are wonderful and the plot is filled with realistic action and consequences and to top it all off the fic is structured with fabulous writing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10342836/1/My-Adolescent-Romantic-Comedy-Is-Incorrect-As-I-Had-Logically-Proven]]) An Oregairu fanfiction that is actually able provide an amazing characterization of Yukinoshita Yukino. A characterization that fits hand in hand with what we know of her from the original light novels. It's unbelievable how well the writer was able to grasp her attitude and thoughts.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10750716/1/The-End-of-the-Affair]]) An Oregairu fic set in the future that is hard to describe. Alongside the above fic, its the only Oregairu fanfiction that actually is able to grasp the characters, their attitudes and personalities to an accurate degree.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5588986/1/Trust-in-God-or-The-Riddle-of-Kyon]]) My favorite Haruhi fanfiction. I really don't think that any ending to the series the original author provides could be better than this fanfiction.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia]]) The best Code Geass fanfiction out there. An au fic where Lelouch is not exiled and instead grows up with Nunnally in the imperial court. The story is extremely compact and well put together. It doesn't waste any time with fluff but that shouldn't mean that the story feels rushed. Far from it. The plot follows along with the original storyline and the author makes sure to try to bring together all of the original characters in a non forced way.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761190/1/Topple-Your-Kings]]) An extremely well done Code Geass, High School DxD crossover. Lelouch is the same conniving magnificent bastard that is found in canon and it's extremely enjoyable to watch him begin to apply his talents in the DxD world.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11467696/1/Do-Me-A-Wrong]]) A surprisingly well done Bleach and High School DxD. Especially since it's coming from a fandom not known for well done crossovers. Not only is the writing a pleasure to read, but the plot and characters are well put together. Not surprising that this story is written by the same author as Oblivion, one of the better Harry Potter/Elder Scrolls crossovers.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]]) is the best SOA fanfic that I have ever read. By far better than canon with characters actually fleshed out and Kirito not being the generic harem mc he is. The word building is astounding in this one and the plot is more intricate than that of almost any other fanfiction I've had the pleasure of reading.
