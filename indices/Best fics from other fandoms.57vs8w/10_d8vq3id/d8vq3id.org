Since you've mentioned a couple of Superman fics, I'd suggest Veritas([[http://www.lcficmbs.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Forum/6/topic/001338/Number/0/site_id/1#import]]). It explores the reactions of humans to an alien presence in our post 9/11 security environment.

There are a couple of Superman Returns fics- In the shadow of my father(linkffn(3034436)) and Being Jasom White(linkffn(3226609)) which explore the strained relationship between Clark and Jason. It's angsty but pretty good.

If you've watched the TV show Chuck, there's a magnificent fic called What Fates Impose linkffn(5756619). It's not just the best Chuck fanfic, it's among the best fics I've read in any fandom.
