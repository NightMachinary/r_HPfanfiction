[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] has a ton of amazing fanfics, most of which is found on SpaceBattles (if not exclusively, then with nigh all of the discussion taking place there).

Some of my personal favorites: * [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] features an OC benevolent would-be conqueror of the world to make it a better place gets dumped into Worm.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]], and it's sequels, Wake and Legacy, starts with a very simple what-if question from the very start of canon, and spirals wildly from there.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/][A Cloudy Path]] features the protagonist of Worm getting the ability to build technology from the Supreme Commander series, and uses this to become a hero. I am not entirely sure what the word count is, but I'm fairly certain that it's at 1 million. It's huuge, in any case, and does an amazing job of elaborating on characters and taking small events and creating big, believable ripples.

For other fandoms besides Worm, it's mostly Naruto for me, I'm afraid, but there are some gems there. * linkffn(Scorpion's Disciple) takes an antagonist (Sasori) and places him near a 9 or 10 year old Naruto, and has a brief encounter spiral into Sasori beginning to teach Naruto. There is a bit of combat and drama in it, but it has great character development, primarily of Naruto, but other characters gets to shine too.

- linkffn(Legacy Undone) takes a Naruto from some alternate future timeline, and throws him back in an alternate timeline, to when he was about four years old. The point of divergence in the timeline he's sent back to is Jiraiya being dead, which has resulted in Orochimaru still being a loyal leaf ninja. Furthermore, it totally ignores the rampart inflation in powerlevels that occurred around halfway, if not sooner, through Naruto, and creates a believable world with a strong set of OCs. (The OC Daimyo in particular. I'm not entirely sure whether or not I'm joking when I say that half of the comments over on SB are people gushing over him.)
- linkffn(The Lives Worth Saving) is rather like C'est la Vie, if you've read it. There isn't really much conflict in it, but you can't really help but smile when reading it.
- linkffn(Black Cloaks, Red Clouds) is a /massive/ AU whose point of divergence is... something I will not spoil. The results is that the Akatsuki, which were antagonists, are (sort of) the good guys, and where a character who was given very little spotlight in canon gets to be at the center of this, with many OCs and canon characters fleshed out playing a large role.

I don't read many Warcraft fics (mostly because few of them seem worth reading, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong), but linkffn(Frostblood) asks what would have happened had Jaina taken up the mantle of the Lich King, and goes from there. I'm rather fond of it's take on necromancy, and there is a theme in Jaina finding allies in the unlikeliest of places even when those she would have expected to support her fail to do so due to her new burden.
