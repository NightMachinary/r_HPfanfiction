Flashman and the Throne of Swords - linkffn(10784082 ) A crossover between Game of Thrones and The Flashman books.

I have a taste for picaroon, anti-heros, of which Flashman is pretty much the archetype. His cynical opinon of Westeros and its personalities and politics is fun. He gets on splendidly with Tyron Lannister, as you might expect.

I suspect this is a very much a minority taste, and comparatively few would like it. But hey.... it's there.
