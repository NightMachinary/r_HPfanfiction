Riddle doesn't appear all that often in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, he's mostly in the background, but when he does show up, he tends to keep to (the letter of) his deals, doesn't randomly curse people or punish the bearer of bad news, and even turns out to have /partially/ sympathetic motivations (much to Harry's shock; he may well be both right /and/ wrong). He wants to push purebloods to marry half-bloods in order to avoid the disastrous effects of inbreeding, but at the same time he wants to lock out muggle-borns and muggle culture.
