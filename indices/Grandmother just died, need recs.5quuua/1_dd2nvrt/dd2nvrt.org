I have two recs for you dealing with the Queen/royalty

1. Royal Ward - most interaction is with Princess Diana and William and Harry and other staff at palaces. linkffn(10556030)

2. Harry Potter and the Four Heirs - involves a powerful, political Harry and the Queen who has power in the magical government. linkffn(9048823)
