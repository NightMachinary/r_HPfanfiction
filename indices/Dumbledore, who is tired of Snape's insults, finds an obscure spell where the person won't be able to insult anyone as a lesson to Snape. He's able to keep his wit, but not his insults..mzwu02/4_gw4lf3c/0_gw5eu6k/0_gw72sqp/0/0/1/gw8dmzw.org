I concur. I'm in a minority in that I've never been a particularly big fan of Dumbledore - whether in canon or most fanon incarnations - so I find it refreshing (and a little therapeutic) to read a DD I /don't/ want to strangle with his own beard. Quite apart from that, I enjoyed such a sharp and immediate a butterfly divergence that starts a significant part into the events of canon. Both are things I'd dearly like to see done more often.

The former because I wouldn't mind developing a more nuanced view of DD as a character and the latter because it's a great way for an author to skip pointlessly rehashing the stations of canon with only minor changes.

Also, thank you for your two recommendations, especially as I'm not familiar with either of them (yet).
