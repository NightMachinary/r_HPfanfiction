Yeah, it's a very interesting take on Dumbledore. I regret not reading it sooner.

It's that it's more serious in tone rather than crackish, which the description implies, that I think makes for fun reading.

Another fun story that's vaguely similar is linkao3(23702959), it's leans a bit more crack, but there is enough seriousness that it creates the contrast I think funny stories need.

Though in this case Dumbledore is semi-bashed, but it's not a major part of the plot. It's a more lighthearted almost slice of life story.
