I never quite understood why this trope gets pushed. Dumbledore said those words when he was a frustrated teenager and thought that some sacrifices were okay for the benefit of the many... until he had to sacrifice his own sister and, to a certain extent, his brother (because Aberforth never really forgave him).

I wouldn't really mind the trope though if the Manipulative!Dumbledore had a concrete plan or a clear outcome (say elimination of all dark arts or blood related bias). But it's always just Dumbledore being manipulative for the sake of being manipulative or gaining power. Which is quite ooc considering that he himself admits he doesn't trust himself with power.
