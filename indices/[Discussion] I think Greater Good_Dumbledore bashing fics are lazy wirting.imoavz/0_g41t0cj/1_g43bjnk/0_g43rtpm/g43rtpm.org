The solution to that is simple - work it slowly and give him a way in, while giving the non-politics plotlines enough time to grow, die, or evolve.

If I were writing this, I'd have Harry take some leadership position in the student body at the school first, let him build up his Political Skills to a workable degree and really learn how to interact with and direct people and get respect from the Young People of the Magical World. Maybe have him pull the DA together into an actual organisation to solve some problem at Hogwarts (unite the houses, keep an eye on Malfoy, stop bullying, get Snappy fired, improve teaching, etc) and have that come to Skeeter's attention. Since he's already famous, she's got some impetus to go ask him about it. He holds his own against her - not fully enough to destroy her or anything, just a little bit, just enough to actively amuse her - and thus he gets his first link outside of Hogwarts. Not a strong link, but a link nevertheless.

So then, as he's a respected and admired unofficial leader at Hogwarts, some student comes to him and tells him that they know something outside of Hogwarts is happening and they don't know what to do (could be Percy asking for help on whether to report Crouch, for example) so he helps stop whatever was happening and trades the information to Skeeter for a complimentary article. Wizengamot calls him in as a witness, he politics his way through it, then has some more influence there. Again, not a lot, but some.

Maybe that person who passed him information gets penalised for it somehow and Harry successfully defends them, building up respect and influence just a bit more. Anything after that should just bring Harry into contact with individual members, I'd say. Someone mentions their parents are struggling to find something, Harry introduces their children to children of the people who have that thing, then they introduce their parents and are sure to mention how helpful that Harry Potter was. That kind of thing. Individual people do eventually add up. :)

In terms of actual active political authority, I'd have him grow the DA into some kind of lobbyist group first. Have him make deals and suggestions to the Wizengamot types, propose ideas to them from his group, etc. Maybe he calls in some favours, but for the most part he just asks for help - acts convincing enough and honest enough that people start to really think he'd be a useful friend to have. Maybe he makes friends with or gets a mentor role from one of the older members of the Wizengamot, who bequeaths his seat to Harry when he mysteriously dies. Thus, he gets into power. Harry is, of course, in well over his head the whole time, but with determination and the help of his friends (and an 'I believe in you, now go change the world' letter from his mentor), he manages to keep treading water. And technically he doesn't actually have to have stuff in common with the politicians, he just has to make them think he does. A harder-worked Harry at the Dursleys could bullshit knowing all about the delights of a well-maintained rose garden, for example, or share cooking secrets with the Tea Party Old Ladies to give to their elves. Politicians research and prepare, and Harry would have links to all of their children (through the Now-Political DA) to get that information.

If you do it slowly and right, it'd be quite easy to have the other stories grow with him, especially during the early days times when Harry is still building up influence with individual political members. The boarding school aspect of the Stranger in a Strange Land plot would decrease as Harry entered the political sphere more (still be present, but instead of whole classes taking up chapters, it'd probably just be a sentence or two here and there unless more was relevant/needed), while the Greater Magical World aspects would grow. Harry's romance prospects would probably end up coming with him in his political aspirations - either a stereotypical marriage-for-power type relationship or a partner who'd actually grow alongside him into the political role (possibly also a partner-waiting-at-home type, but that kind of relationship is slightly narratively dull to me so I probably wouldn't write it). Technically you wouldn't have to have the Super Genius Indy Harry plot, but that could quite easily be twisted as he focuses more on his political manoeuvres than his coursework as the story progresses. Genius needs conflict and engagement, after all, and as he tired of his scholastic pursuits and grew more interested and challenged by politics, it'd be easy to move his attention from one to the other). Not sure how Voldemort would work in this story - would he take polyjuice and join the political sphere also, would he take the opportunity to kidnap Harry while he's away from Hogwarts, would he just go about his Evil-Villain business while Harry is focused on politicking, etc. I'd have to put more work into this to work out what would fit best. Holidays would be quite easy to integrate into the 'making friends' side of politics, and probably a good 'Dumbledore is an opponent-antagonist, but not a villain-protagonist' subplot to play around with and introduce the idea of Dumbledore not always being on Harry's side. He obviously wants Harry to go back to the Dursleys, which Harry wouldn't want to do. So, you'd have a younger Harry lose and end up back there, then have him slowly work out and test new ideas to get out of there until something works and he can go make friends and politic around.

And well, there's technically no limit on how much you can pile on a teenager, just how much they can handle. If you actively had Harry freaking out about how much work there was and how stressed he was and how he couldn't do any of it, that'd still be realistic. Could have a big confrontation between him and Ron and Hermione, really convince him to bring more people in and ask for help. Could have him start to delegate some stuff to other members of the DA - gets them trusting and liking him a bit more and takes some of the weight off his shoulders. Every politician has a team of people behind them to help out, after all. Like I said somewhere above this, it's not a choice between drowning and walking on water - treading water is a perfectly normal state of affairs for politics.

Sure, there's a lot of problems with the idea of Political Harry vs Dumbledore, but if you sit and think about them you can always find solutions that fit the internal logic of the story. Human Beings are a delightfully creative bunch. :)

The main fun thing about that path, it lets Dumbledore stay in the shadows unrevealed to Harry for a lot longer. He's a manipulator with decades on Harry, so he's not going to be revealed easily, this way just lets you keep that without actually having Dumbledore have to actively do anything in the narrative to remain so. I wouldn't even reveal Dumbledore as a villain until mid to late Act II, myself. An occasional opponent-antagonist, sure, with them debating things and disagreeing in the political sphere, but not an actual villain-antagonist until late. Harry would just see and deal with the outcomes of Dumbledore's actions - seeing the chessboard, but not the player, so to speak.

Also, an additional bonus - you don't even have to use the Ancient Houses system to get Harry into political power. Just the things that make Harry Harry in canon - relentless determination, moralising fortitude, and other people caring about him.
