That actually sounds petty awesome, the balancing would be tricky and such a story would probably be massive to be able to fit so much without rushing or ignoring important things, and with the time-line Harry would probably be done with Hogwarts (or at least be at sixth/seventh year) before either Voldemort or Dumbledore can have a bigger role through the war as before that Harry's focus on politics would likely make it so he didn't have the Know-how to fight them in anything close to equal ground (not actually something bad, such a brake from the canon plot would be good basis for a more original story -plus possibly having Voldemort actually die in 81 and trashing the war plot entirely- and having an adult protagonist that was well-worked through teenage-hood and built upon gives much more to work about than a teen) overall I would definitely read something like this.
