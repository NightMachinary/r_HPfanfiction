Indeed to all of that. Plus, the focus on people over fighting fits the themes of canon a lot better - 'friendship is magic' and all that. :)

Balancing definitely wouldn't be the easiest thing, but I've pulled off more complex pacing in D&D games before - it's just patience and remembering that there's conflict other than one-vs-one strength-of-whatever competition. Remember the goals of the characters and what they're willing to do to get there and conflict (and victory) can come from so many places.

Think about people like the Joker. His goal isn't to kill Batman (most of the time, I don't think? Superheroes ain't really my thing), his goal is just to demonstrate that the world is only one bad day from being like him. So, Batman could kill him, but so long as he went a little mad while doing it, the Joker would get what he wanted.

So, you could have Harry get lucky and manipulate and out-move Dumbledore to Albus' end, thus technically winning, but Dumbledore dies with a smile because he knows that Harry will bring the Order to the world that he couldn't (the 'beat me at my own game... I'm so proud' trope). Hell, you could even... have Harry just plain /lose/ (*shocked gasp*). The sky really is the limit. :)
