I find that the problem is that this often redirects much of the fight to the political/economic arena, which wouldn't be much of a problem if the stories weren't trying to go on just too many directions with a teen as protagonist. Let's count: we first have the boarding-school life plot, which ties (but doesn't fully covers) the changing worlds plot (which treats the adaptation to the magical world), next we have the super/genius/Indy!Harry plot dealing with his success on the academic field and him growing up in power, then we have the Voldemort plot dealing with his interactions with the Said villain in particular (eg. fighting, ideology discussion, Horcruxes, emotional struggle, mind-link...), after that there is often the war plot for how the war is affecting the population in general, his close friends/family and him in particular plus how he will take part in it (going on a killing-spree, go pacifist...), to say nothing about the holidays plot dealing with who and how he is going to spend his summers, frequently we also find a love-life plot and a fame plot.

Now, dealing with all of those diverging plot-lines is hard and I can honestly say that I wholeheartedly respect JKR for managing to do it so well and in such a organic way -even if I would have enjoyed more world-building- but that list has an advantage, they mostly interceded in the power point with the social interaction aspect being only a reasonable amount higher than that of a regular human being. This allows authors to deal with many of the plots simultaneously since the MC only has to keep themselves reasonably social while growing stronger, but when you inject politics in the mix this no long holds as politics by definition depends heavily of social and formal interactions with characters that teens would frankly have almost nothing in common with plus a heavy dose of legalities that (being a made up system) would have to be build upon on the spot. Even if we consider time-turners there is still a limit of how much we can pile on a teen character during a given time-period while keeping it realistic and with the addition of a plot that so greatly differs from the rote the other plots take it gets much harder to stuff it all together without making an unbearably perfect character that will get boring for /everyone/ extremely fast or a drowning character that can't get anything done at all because there are always thousands upon thousands of other questions that need their immediate undivided attention.
