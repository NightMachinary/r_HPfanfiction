I would read that. Dumbledore has always been one of my favorite characters. I fully believe he won the war, pretty much from his office. You gotta treat the ol' dude with respect. He's like the ultimate wizard: powerful, eccentric, wise, secretive, old, always calm and composed, yet he can instill terror into anything he wants. Every time we see him do magic, it's friggin amazing and seems effortless on his part. He's the guy everybody runs to when they have a problem. Him being portrayed as ineffective and meddling and useless is just totally out of character. Voldemort may have called him weak and a fool, but that was never meant in regards to his skill and talent as a wizard, only towards his methodology and ideals, which Voldemort despises. When he fights Dumbledore, he gets desperate before he flees...because Dumbledore is just to badass to beat. Voldemort is screaming and hurling insults and Dumbledore is calmly talking to him like he's a schoolboy that just kicked a cat. Sure he has his shortcomings, but to the point he's a daft old spiteful man that just wants to steal Harry's fortune?
