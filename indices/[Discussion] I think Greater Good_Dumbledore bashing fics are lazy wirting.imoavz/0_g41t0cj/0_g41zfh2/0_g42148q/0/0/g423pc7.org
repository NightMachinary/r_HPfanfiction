Heh. Not in the UK. From the greatest Archmage to the lowest Hedge-wizard, we'll curse your name and mock your existence as colorfully as we can without shame or compunction. We literally had comedians on our biggest comedy shows joking about how our Prime Minister fellated pigs for a good while.

And yeah, Disciplinarian Teacher McG going all "Straighten that tie, shine those shoes!" on Dumbledore when he goofs off is always a delight. :D
