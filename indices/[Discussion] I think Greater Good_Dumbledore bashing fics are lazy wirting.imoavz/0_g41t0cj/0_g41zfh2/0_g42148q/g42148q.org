Yeah, Spite is definitely not Dumbledore's thing. And I think that's what makes him far more interesting as a villain. I love a good Knight Templar villain who genuinely cares and (fanatically) wants to do what they think is good. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? :)

He's definitely daft and old though. No doubts there, mr Nitwit Blubber Oddment Tweak. :D
