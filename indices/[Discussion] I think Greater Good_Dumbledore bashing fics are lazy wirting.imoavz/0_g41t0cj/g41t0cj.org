I mean, yes and no. Often those fics include lazy or unpracticed writing, but they aren't intrinsically bad. An Actual Palpatine-level Manipulator Dumbledore, who can take down half the nations of the ICW with a handful of words in the right ear, could be an incredibly interesting villain if done correctly. The kind of exquisite villain who you actually think might have a point, if it weren't for the methods they use. Likely have him motivated more strongly by Ariana and Gellert - after all, they don't even know who killed her. All that hatred between Muggles and Magicals breeds Chaos, and that leads to confusion and violence. So, in steps Albus Dumbledore, determined to tame the world and bring Order to it all.

Basically a mix between Jygallag and Handsome Jack in purpose, with extreme Palpatine-tendencies in methodology. Maybe a dash of Ozymandias from Watchmen.

So, yeah. Greater Good Dumbledore isn't necessarily bad, it's just all the fics written by those less practiced seem to have chased all the old-hand writers of the fandom away from giving it a try. :D
