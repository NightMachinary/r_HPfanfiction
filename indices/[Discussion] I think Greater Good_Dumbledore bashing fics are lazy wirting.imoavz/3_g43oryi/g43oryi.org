Isn't this like, tautological?

The whole point of calling something "bashing" is to accept it as a lazy or at least biased characterization. Is it really still bashing if you present Albus as a properly written antagonist with rational (if selfish or "evil") motivations and behaviour who acts in a way consistent with his image as a wise and powerful player? To me that's just a variation from the standard Albus, kinda like ravenclaw or slytherin Harry is a variation from canon Harry.
