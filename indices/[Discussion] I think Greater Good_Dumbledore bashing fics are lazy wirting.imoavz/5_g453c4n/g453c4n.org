I think what people dont realise is that Dumblebore was at the end of the day the 'Leader of Light'. And everyone expected him to pull solutions for their problems out of his ass. Him being 150-ish does not help his case. He is a tierd old man trying to do his best. Him raising Harry like a pig for slaughter is what a good/competent general would do. No matter how innocent, the lives of many overcome the life of one. We also know that Dumbledore couldn't have possibly known that Harry would survive the second killing curse. Harry was an anomaly. He did what was needed to be done not what he wanted to do.
