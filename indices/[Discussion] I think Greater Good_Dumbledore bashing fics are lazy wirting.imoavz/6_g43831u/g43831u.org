I agree with true bashing fics, but I also think the term "bashing" is used too frequently with Dumbledore. I don't consider it bashing when Harry views Dumbledore as an enemy or when Dumbledore is manipulative or very utilitarian. Its when so many fics turn him into a mustache-twirling villain and/or idiot that I get annoyed
