Mate, literally any dark!harry fic that isn't utter trash

Well, the trope i hate the most is starting from first year, not doing anything and then not finishing the fic. The trope i like the most is light!harry discovering dark magic and keeping it a secret.

If you have the time, id really appreciate if you could just wrie down as many dark! Fics, i mean some of them are bound to be decent no?
