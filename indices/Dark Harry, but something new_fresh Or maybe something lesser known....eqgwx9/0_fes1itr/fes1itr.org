While not exactly Dark Harry, this is a Harry who could be easily and ignorantly labeled as “Dark” by the other characters. Mostly because Parseltongue is his first language.

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.
