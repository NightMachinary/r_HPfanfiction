Feel free to use it.

And I was more thinking of it as unchangeable rule that the founders made that a student could study at hogwarts for as long as they want as long as they helped defend the school during times of crisis.

They probably also added a magical enforced rule that all magical children were allowed an education at hogwarts after the fight with slytherin over muggles borns.

Once the person had been there long enough I think it likely that Dumbeldore would offer them a job as the head of there hogwarts house.
