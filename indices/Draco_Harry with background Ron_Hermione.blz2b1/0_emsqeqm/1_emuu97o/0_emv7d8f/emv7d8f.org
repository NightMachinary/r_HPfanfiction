The Devil's White Night is one that I read over and over. I love that they use Indian Harry and how they do the whole AU. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ Harry going into an AU where his parents are alive is my favorite but none of them ever get finished!! If I come across any more I can remember I'll give them to you since you liked it!!
