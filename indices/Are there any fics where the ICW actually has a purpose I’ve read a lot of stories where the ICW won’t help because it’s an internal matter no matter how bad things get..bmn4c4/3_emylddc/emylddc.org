My headcanon is that if Voldemort had decided to try to expand beyond Britain, ICW would start to intervene. Basically, as long as the threat is contained within Britain, ICW doesn't want to bother.

This means that I can never see Voldemort as truly becoming as bad as Grindelwald -- even in a case where he truly wins the war in Britain (say, by lack of critical characters in the right place at the right time to cause events leading up to Halloween 1981), he would ultimately lose due to ICW interference once he inevitably tries to go beyond Britain.
