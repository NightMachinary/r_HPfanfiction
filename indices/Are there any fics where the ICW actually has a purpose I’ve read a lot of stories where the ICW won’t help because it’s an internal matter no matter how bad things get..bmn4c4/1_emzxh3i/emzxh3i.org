linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) technically has what you want in that the ICW is a major world power after the fall of the Statute of Secrecy.

However, I personally would not recommend this fic as it also is kind of a crossover with Gulliver's Travels and therefore spends what feels like a hundred chapters talking about centaur wars, like if Binns were a fanfic writer. After the starting point, it also kind of stops being a Harry Potter story. While one of the story arcs involves the ICW stopping Voldemort from becoming the British Prime Minister, the author also likes to describe what's going on at MIT during the story in excruciating detail, and also Vernon Dursley has an American cousin who gets funding from Al-Qaeda to fight wizards.
