It's a bit farfetched? Post-Hogwarts fics that deviate from "Harry gets together with X follows cool profession Y and has a happy family Z" are very uncommon is all. Nevertheless Linkffn(Dudley's Memories) has Harry fostering a orphan and Hermione managing a system of magical orphans.

Linkao3(crawlersout) Harry fosters child Riddle.
