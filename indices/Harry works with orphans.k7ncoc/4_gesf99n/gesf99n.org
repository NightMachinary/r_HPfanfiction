Canon Harry is simply not proactive enough to actually put in all of the effort and planning required for such an institution. There are plenty of fics in which Harry adopts a orphan he comes across but none I have seen in which he opens or works in an orphanage.

Linkffn(To Be Slytherin) has Harry's Slytherin twin sister opening and running the Riddle Magical Orphanage in the epilouge-arc in remembrance of the person Tom Riddle could have been.
