Actually, since it's been brought up...this was a hot topic about six months ago or so in the Star Trek Yahoo group I frequent. There was a minor rant session about the annoyance of young authors writing slash with no idea how sex works, let alone gay sex, followed by a discussion about the responsibility of writing sex somewhat accurately, because as it turns out, a lot of us had got our sex education from fanfic, as horrifying as that sounds. Whether it's because of family choices or shyness or poor education on the topic at school, a lot of people were confessing that Kirk and Spock doin' it in a crappy fic was their first introduction to how sex actually works. With no experience or frame of reference, many of us (when we were young and na√Øve) took smut completely at face value.

It was simultaneously one of the most awful and one of the most fascinating discussions I've ever been a part of, and at the end we all agreed that sex ed in the US needs a serious overhaul....
