It looks like Buzzfeed is embracing fanfic, even though their best of list was shit.

Also, a bit of a tangent: didn't we all take smut with a grain of salt back in the day? I'm genuinely curious as to whether people seriously thought fics were fairly accurate in terms of sex. I can be pretty awkward, so I assumed it would be more awkward than depicted...
