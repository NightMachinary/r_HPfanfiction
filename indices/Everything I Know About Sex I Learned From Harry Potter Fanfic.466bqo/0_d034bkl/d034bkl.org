I really like sex in fanfics because while it's a bunch of unrealistic fantasies, so is porn, but fanfic sex is usually catered towards women's fantasies and porn towards male fantasies.

It's interesting to think about women's fantasies and sexualities being devalued in mainstream, "profitable" culture and fanfiction and the oft-derided romance novel genre addressing that need. I find it almost as interesting as always!a!girl fanfics addressing the lack of interesting female protagonists in profitable popular franchises. See: genderswapped Avengers, etc.
