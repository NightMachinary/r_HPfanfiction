Well, technically, in “Oh God Not Again” which I believe is by Sarah1281, this does happen when you get to fourth year, but it's not the focus of the story. As far as I know bot is still down and I'm on mobile but if you search that title on ffn it should pop up. Time travel humour story, not quite a crack!fic.
