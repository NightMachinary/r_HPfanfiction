Why he need decades? He can learn everything in his sleep from horcrux or a powerful ring which consists the knowledge of Merlin, founders and his ancestors.

Or He can learn everything in time chamber where he lives in complete isolation without doing anything but studying and practicing (But, little poor me couldn't last 3 three days in corona lockdown without going insane). Plus he doesn't even age.

Or all he needed was going to Gringotts and getting the print out of all his powers and subjects he was good at. They perform a ritual for free because he remembered Griphooks name.

When he had all these options why he needs to spent decades to match his enemy whom he dedtroyed while still in diapers?
