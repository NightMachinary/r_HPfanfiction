I might as well ask, there was this one Harry/Lily Luna fic I'd like to find, what I remember is this: Ginny and Harry were divorced (she cheated on him?), but she remarried. So, so they meeting their children, possibly to pick them up from platform 9&3/4 and Ginny's new husband flirts with Lily offering to take her to his villa. Lily also kind of hated Ginny and didn't want to go with her back to her house. I also think Harry paid for his son's wedding, but wasn't invited because Ginny didn't want him to be there.

Harry might've also fucked his son's fianc√©e, but I might be mixing up my stories...
