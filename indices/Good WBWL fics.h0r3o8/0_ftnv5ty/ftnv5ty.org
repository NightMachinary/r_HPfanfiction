  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
