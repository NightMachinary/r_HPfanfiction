linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) doesn't deal with the trials themselves, but it's all about the investigation into all atrocities committed during the war. So it has a lot of stuff on the crimes of the death eaters, but it also goes into regular people looking the other way, turning in muggleborns, and also looking into cases of people on the light side going to far. If you're looking for the themes of justice post war it's a really interesting read.
