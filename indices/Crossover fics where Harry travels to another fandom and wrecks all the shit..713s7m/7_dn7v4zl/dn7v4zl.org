Oh, I got a good one. You know the make a wish series? Well, turns out there's sequels by other authors, like the contract linkffn(9754636) where Harry and gang wreck Naruto's villains shit, or the one before that where Harry wrecks the Justice League villain's shit in Terminal Justice linkffn(11965672). (And it of course starts with Make a Wish linkffn(2318355), and there's a squeal and an omakes/bonus scenes as well by the same author, where he wrecks the Harry Potter universe's shit.

And just reverse the order and read away.
