Harry Potter x Dresden Files

He wrecks a lot of shit. Also is kinda insane. Awesome fic.

Nuhuh also has written a HP x Anita Blake crossover over on the DLP work by author forums called [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-stalking-blood-sack.15818/][The Stalking Blood Sack]]. It's also fucking awesome - no one writes powerful, sort-of-crazy Harry like nuhuh. He tears Anita and all her bitches a new one.
