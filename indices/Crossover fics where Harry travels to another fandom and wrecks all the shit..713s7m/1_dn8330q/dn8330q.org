[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11483808/1/Blood-Stained][Blood Stained]] -- HP/Avengers Crossover. I started this story because Harry/Natasha was intriguing to me. I stayed for a decent plot and action. Recently completed as well. linkffn(11483808)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11301154/1/Wake-the-Black-Wolf][Wake the Black Wolf]] -- Started a new slowly-developing trend of Harry/Witcher crossovers. Updates are slow, but I'd say it's worth the read. He doesn't 'wreck all the shit' but he might, eventually. He certainly has the power to do so. linkffn(11301154)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] -- HP/LotR crossover. Harry is real powerful, or becomes so anyways. It's great, but it doesn't hold a candle to Steelbadger's most recent unfinished work [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]]. linkffn(11027086) linkffn(11115934)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][Harry Potter: Geth]] -- Read this around 2 years ago, but as I recall it was well-written and the Tali/Harry romance was entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11304904/1/Madness-Effect][Madness Effect]] -- HP/Mass Effect. Harry is a mad scientist recruited to female Shepard's collector-assault team. Very entertaining. The author also has prequels/sequels/AUs (Stargate, HP-only, etc) based around this Harry which are equivalently great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4388682/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-that-Waits][Harry Potter and the World that Waits]] -- HP/X-men. While reading this I would get 'Wand and Shield' vibes, but for X-men. Enough said, really.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] -- HP/Avatar TLA. The author merged both worlds fantastically. Hogwarts is a school for all types of bending, which is as far as I will go for explanations. If I remember correctly DLP rated this one quite high in their library.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] -- HP/Dresden Files. Slight Xover. As in most elements are actually Harry Potter. This fic is great though, and definitely worth the read. It's the first installment of a long series by the great Shezza. DLP-approved, I believe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/10/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] -- HP/ASOIAF crossover. The writing quality varies a lot from chapter to chapter, but boy does Harry really turn that world on its head. Lots of civ/city building and warfare.

Edit: Just got home and went through my favorites. Added a few more. Quick tip, there's a ton of good H/ASOIAF or H/GoT crossovers if you do a simple sort by favorites search on ffn.
