  First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better.

The summary is garbage and the first few chapters are mildly entertaining at best. It gets going once a certain person dies, and by that point a lot of readers will have dropped the fic. Otherwise, I thought the writing was decent. The plot was alright and the characters passably believable. My only major gripe with this fanfic is that Harry is just way too confrontational about literally /everything/. It also touches on a lot of the cliches of the HP fandom, won't spoil which ones. I'd sort this one in the guilty pleasure section for the Harry/Natasha pairing. It's not for everybody.
