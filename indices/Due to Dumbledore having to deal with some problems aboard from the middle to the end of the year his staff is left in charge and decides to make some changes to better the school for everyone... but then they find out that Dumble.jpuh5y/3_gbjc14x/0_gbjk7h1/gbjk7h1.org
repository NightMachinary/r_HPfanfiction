Oh, definitely! Lavander always seemed like such an underused character for me, you know, like, she was the girl to whom Hermione was rude a couple of times and that eventually became Ron's girlfriend, and then was mauled by Greyback, but she had basically no importance at all in the story from start to finish, no character growth and minimal personality overall which is such a shame, I mean, what was it like for her to have her favorite class be dismissed out of hand and vocally by Hermione? What was her relationship with Ron like for her and how did their breakup and eventually getting together with Hermione affect her? And how did she deal with being attacked by Greyback?
