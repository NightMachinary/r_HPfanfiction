  divination is an integral part of the job for aurors, healers, enchanters

Divination is so underused in canon and fanfics. I love the idea of healers narrowing down treatment plans or aurors narrowing down a criminal's location.

In The 9th House by Leigh Bardugo (actual novel, not HP related), the book opens up with Yale students predicting the stock market by playing around with a dead man's entrails, something the ancient romans actually used to do. It's called anthropomancy. I would kill to see that go down in Knocturn Alley or have a badass Lavender do it for the war.
