More that Flich is the only authority figure with the sheer unoccupied time to keep watch over the halls in frequent bases, it doesn't matter if the students could take him on a fight, he can tell on them to the teachers, and with his knowledge of the secret passages plus Mrs. Nora working around the clock to track places with too many students he can break the inevitable duels that pop up every now and then before things get too bad. Without him though, student A starts a duel and it both drags on long enough and escalated high enough that the friends of both students get there and feel the need to interfere whether they agree with their friends or not, this ends accumulating and eventually someone will (probably by accident) do or say something particularly beyond the pale, and considering that the students around are hormonal teenagers pumped up on adrenaline in a high-stress combat situation this results in them also going past the limits, at this point even if a professor comes up to try breaking the fight the students are more likely to just attack them too (mob mentality is such a warm and fuzzy piece of human psychology üòÅ). As a result of it the side that manages to make the most damage will probably drive the other away and the group of children previously pumped up on adrenaline will then come down into a terror/shock hangover while still a bit drunk on victory and look to the most well-liked or skilled individual around for guidance, this student that is also a child will have two options, he and his friends can stand-down and take their rightful punishment or they can deny to have done anything wrong at all and dig their heels in to save themselves and their friends of being punished (a punishment that is already harsh but that their panicked minds will turn into some hellish landscape of torture), still riding the high of winning the battle (potentially against a teacher even) and of being named the leader by the students around there is little chance of this leader to heed reason or good sense in this situation and will instead decide to tactically take over part of the castle since their group already proved to themselves that they are battle-capable. Meanwhile the defeated group will grow resentful of their loss and fearful of being punished which will blown into panic at hearing that the other group is still baying for their blood passing through a similar process, both groups being potentially much more harshly affected if there were actual deaths involved, speeding up the process on both fronts, consider that this is something that will probably repeat over and over again and you end up with many factions distrusting one another and thus trying to conquer as much space as they can. Admittedly, this would be a reaaallll long-shot and chances are that the rebellions would be squashed down pretty fast by either the staff or the ministry that both have actively trained and tested fighters plus that either portrayals or ghosts would go call a teacher before it ever got that far, but it was the most far-reaching potential consequence of Flich's being fired that I could come up with.
