Dhampir aren't vampires, they don't need blood (in the Vampire Academy universe).

Besides that, I like vampires in general (the twilight kind notwithstanding) because of the darker atmosphere their very existence brings to the table. throw in a nice redemption story and it's very sexy. This might be consequence of growing up watching Buffy and Angel (and Spike). Even in the Vampire Academy universe the nicest Moroi still needs human or dhampir blood to survive, and they can irrevocably turn into the evil Strigoi with just one act at any time.
