*The Lupins fear Greyback's revenge will not stop with Remus, but might spread to his little sister Hermione. They make an unorthodox decision to protect their daughter without telling their son. Remus has been looking for his sister ever since. Time travel, AU, EWE, NON-CANON SHIPS (underline this bit 8,000 times), etc. Please see warnings.*

The "pairing" here is Sirius/Hermione/James and there /is/ some action between James and Sirius, but it is quite a nice fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]]

*Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.*

Pairing here is Hermione/Sirius, though there is some Lucius/Hermione action as well.
