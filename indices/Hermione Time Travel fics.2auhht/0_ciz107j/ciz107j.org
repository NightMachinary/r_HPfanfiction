I have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1762337/1/This-Time-Around][This Time Around]] on my 'want to read list'. It's a Lupin/Hermione Time turner fic so it has a good chance of filling your criteria. You could check it out if you like.

I've also read The Last Marauder and I enjoyed it quite a bit! I am hoping that the above story will be something along the same vein.

It's so funny, because time travel is my favorite trope for Snape/Hermione fics and I have read quite a few but unfortunately, I haven't run across any that feature her as a 5th Marauder (or I can't remember is probably more accurate).
