Certainly! I have a few I can recommend. :)

Note: Some of these fics are on sites that may require you to login to read.

My favorites:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=11904][A Change is Going to Come]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8751734/1/Thirty-One-Days][Thirty-One Days]]

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] is a fan favorite, although I really didn't care for it all that much.

Others that deal with time travel/de-aging but aren't your standard Hermione goes back 20 yrs to the past fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5352726/1/Second-Time-Around][Second Time Around]] - Snape is de-aged during the canon timeline

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17758][For All Intents and Purposes]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3460114/1/Times_Fool][Time's Fool]] (Good story, but I liked the above two better)

I hope you find a few to enjoy! :)
