You could, but on the other hand we do know that her son changed appearance (even if only superficially, namely his hair) basically on a whim or even less than a whim. As such, with it being something that you learn to control in order not to change rather than something that you'd learn to control in order to be able to use, I think the possibility of it being that she doesn't bother is really low. Sure, it could be said that she simply clamped down on it so tightly that nothing of her metamorphing abilities leaks through, so to say, but I think something like that genuinely counts as a result of shock caused by something traumatic which means it could be “not coming that easy to her” to a high enough degree that it would still count as completely stopping. Really, I think it it were genuinely losing control to the point where it would be harder for her to control her gift then she'd not remain completely the same all the time.

Though, obviously, it could also simply be something Madame Rowling wasn't very consistent on. Though, considering that Taure tried to actually get what was and reach for consistency, well ... I'm not sure if that being the case affects his work as far as I see it.
