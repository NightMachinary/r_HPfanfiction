I'm not so sure about this. Hermione quite often gets spells right on her first try, and it's generally presented as a result of her having studied the material and especially the theory (i.e. having read books about it).

This kinda makes sense. Unlike music and painting, there's not too much physical involved in the casting of magic. There's only so much you can get wrong when it comes to incantation and wand movements - both of which seem to be dispensed with by the more competent wizards anyway.
