That's an interesting point, and an author can vary how well it applies to particular magical disciplines in their stories.

Research and novelty require understanding. Rote performance requires proficiency with the basic operations required. In wand magic, the basic operations seem to be wand movements, pronunciation, and focusing intent -- things that every Hogwarts student practices. With that, it makes sense for a student to learn new spells relatively easily.

In potions making, I get the impression that some of the operations aren't written down clearly, so the skill is in figuring out an exact recipe from the description. But in potions /research/, you need the skill and knowledge in determining how ingredients combine, how to divine the effects from the ingredients and the required ingredients from the desired effects, and what sort of heating and stirring you need to make it into a proper potion rather than an explosion.
