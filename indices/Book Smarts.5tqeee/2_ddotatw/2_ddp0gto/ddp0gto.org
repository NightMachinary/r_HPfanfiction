Is 'experience' different from 'practice'? because I call 'practice' something easy to achieve through repetition of the material, and an important, but not essential, part of gaining power. Trying (and mostly failing) to play a specific song on the guitar is 'practice' and eventually leads to you being good at playing /that song/.

I would think 'experience' is more about general familiarity with the totality of the topic and an ever increasing knowledge of the details. Reading Alchemy 101 isn't going to make you Nicholas Flammel, but performing the various transmutations in the book and reading other support texts and so on will gradually increase your 'experience', and depending on the time spent doing that, might come pretty quickly.
