One thing that bothers me is that quite a lot of fics have some sort of idea that reading a book about a subject or discipline suddenly makes you competent in it. That reading Alchemy 101 suddenly makes you an alchemist.

You can't read /Painting for Dummies/ and expect to pull off a Mona Lisa, nor can you read /How to play the Guitar/ and expect to be Jimi Hendrix. No, you need to practice, practice, practice and then practice some more. You're not some instant expert in some subject because you read some book. You need experience, and a lot of it. That is something that is often forgotten.
