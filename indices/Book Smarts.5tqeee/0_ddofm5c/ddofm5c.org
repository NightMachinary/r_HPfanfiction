I have personally always liked subscribing to this policy. Partially because a lot of fics focus on the science of it, and I myself am fairly STEM oriented as a CompSci major. I like my stories to be internally consistent, which means that magic taking no energy at all is more acceptable than the idea that turning coal into diamonds somehow takes up more magical energy than conjuring or vanishing something. Magic plays fast and loose with energy conservation and physics, so I prefer to discard the pretense that any energy is used, besides mental strain from visualizing concepts.
