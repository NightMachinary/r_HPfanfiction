I always find it interesting how much resistance there is to the concept of *knowledge* being power in wizarding magic.

It's almost as if there was a mental disconnect that science geeks could ever amount to something powerful...

Canon almost spells it out: Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard because he is just that intellectual. Tom Riddle sought out *knowledge* wherever he could. (Evil and obscure very probably, but knowledge)
