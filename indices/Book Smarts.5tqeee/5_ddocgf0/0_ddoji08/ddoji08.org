On the flip side I do buy into the idea that someone could get good at magic fast. The topic of rituals isn't really covered in canon but I imagine there is far more available than just creating oneself a new body using blood, bone, and flesh.

Assuming they all require a form of sacrifice I can see the entire spectrum being labelled dark. Someone like Tom Riddle would gladly do something like sacrifice a human for an improved mind or ability to wield magic.
