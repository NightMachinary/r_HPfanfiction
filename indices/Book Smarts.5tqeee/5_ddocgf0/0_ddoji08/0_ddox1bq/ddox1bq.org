See the issue with that then is why doesn't everyone else do it?

If it requires a live human to be sacrificed, you'd expect there to be people who snatch up muggles or (Fullmetal Alchemist spoiler) [[/spoiler][that the government sacrifices convicted prisoners and uses them as sacrifices]].

If it's possible to get good quickly, there should be some reasonw hy not everyone does so then, and I don't think "dark magic" is enough to dissuade people. What if you had to sacrifice someone who trusted you completely and you valued more than anyone else? That would be interesting then, I think.
