The other problem with that 'win the lottery' scenario is that someone must have done the research to come up with the ritual. And then they either didn't use it for no satisfactory reason, or they used it and nobody since decided to try to follow in their footsteps, or they hid away their research very well -- in which case how did you stumble across it?.

You might, for instance, say that Salazar Slytherin was a squib or even a muggle who learned a science behind rituals and used them to gain magical power through raw genius. Then, after Hogwarts was built, he hid his research notes in the Chamber of Secrets. Tom Riddle adapted the ritual to make himself stronger, but out of respect for his forbear, he left the original notes in place -- but he didn't add his own ritual.

Years later, Harry discovers the original notes and has to figure out how -- no, I can't write Harry so OOC as to figure out a complex ritual from a sheet of paper. Hermione reads the notes, starts applying the ritual to the families of muggleborns (starting with her parents), and tries to defeat Voldemort with numbers. Luna Lovegood looks at it and decides to apply it to herself and nearly dies in the process, but with a complete lack of self-preservation tries again and, with Hermione's help, they figure out an approximation of what Voldemort did to himself. It's nowhere near as effective, but the version they settle on is a lot safer.

Still has the problem of why no one else applied the same principles. After many generations of improving the craft, someone would come up with more impressive works.
