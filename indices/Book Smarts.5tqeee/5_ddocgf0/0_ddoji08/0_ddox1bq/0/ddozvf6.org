Sure some weenies in Hufflepuff might not be interested in that, but virtually everyone in Slytherin and Gryfindor should be covered in scars. There's some waffle about it requiring a good mind for math, but then it's stated to be the sort of thing they teach in Arithmancy in like, 4th year which kind of kills that explanation.

But it's not necessarily quite so clear cut because of something called Opportunity Cost. It has lots of implications, but the one which matters here is the population of Wizarding Britain, and in general the Magical World. Simply put: it is possible, if the population is small, that things which are beneficial in retrospect are non-obvious. /If/ the Horcrux ritual is *really* rare, it is possible that lots of people who would be willing in principle to make a Horcrux will simply not get the chance because they never encounter the books which describe it.

It is /possible/ to 'win the lottery' by finding a dusty tome in a forgotten corner which details the ritual 'Becomus Goddus' the requirements for which are relatively mild... it's just no one read it thoroughly before. The odds just decrease significantly with population size. But if there are only a few thousand Wizards...
