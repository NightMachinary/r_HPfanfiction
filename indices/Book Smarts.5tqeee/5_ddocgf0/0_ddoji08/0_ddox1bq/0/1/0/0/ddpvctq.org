Sure, if it weren't for the fact that the use of runes in the way Harry did apparently fucks with your mind in a major way.

One of the first examples of runes Harry uses on himself, is one which will make his physical body mature faster. The problem is, that aside from the whole 'you're growing more quickly so you have to eat more' thing, the rune also massively lowers Harry's inhibitions, increases his lust, and makes him prone to anger.

I mean, would you choose to carve that kind of tattoo into your skin (especially since you can /never/ remove it)? Would you allow your kid to get that kind of tattoo? If you were the government, would you make an effort to curb this sort of usage of runes?
