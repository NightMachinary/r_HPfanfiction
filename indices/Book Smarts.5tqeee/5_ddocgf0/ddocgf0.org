So I don't actually buy into the idea that students can somehow get super good at magic as fast as possible. The people we've been shown to do exceptional things either worked long and hard on it (e.g. the Marauders becoming anamagi) or the thing wasn't that exceptional (just because Hermione could /do/ the protean charm doesn't mean she understands Charms to a NEWT level. That's like saying someone who knows how to take a derivative before they take Calculus is gifted because they know advanced material. Yes, they are, but no they're not some wunderkind).

  From another angle, Tom Riddle was able to create a Hrocrux while in his sixth year; arguably the darkest magic, the most potent incarnation of enchantment and ritual, and within the capabilities of a sufficiently motivated Sixteen year old kid.

Also, there's nothing stating that the Horcrux Ritual is particularly difficult. Just that it's obscure. Personally I'm a fan of the Prince of Slytherin approach that it's just super obscure (and has alternate conditions that aren't related ot magical skill; won't say more due to spoilers).

Realistically, if you spend all your time outside class learning Magic, you could get good at it. Just like how the kids who spend all their time painting outside of class can go on to become great painters. But it's not a fast process at all. It takes /years/ of dedication to get not-so-bad at it.
