May have worked hard, but in the end it was a confundus charm that won it for him.

He may have showed the desire to do something, but that doesn't mean he did. His brother's don't have large shadows, Bill is a Cure-Breaker, sure, it probably pays well, and he gets to travel, but I bet that he is exhausted from all the work he has to put into it just to make ends meet. Charlie works with Dragons, a job that Newt Scamander got despite being expelled. Percy only managed to be vain throughout the entire book series, and working hard as well as kissing up got him nothing. Fred and George were pranksters, they never amounted to much, heck, they didn't get more than 4 (I believe?) O.W.L.S. The message throughout the entire book series, is that Hard-Work doesn't pay off.

Harry circumvents training for Voldemort, or even preparing for war, and wins.

Ron was mediocre his whole life and managed to become an Auror just because Kinglsey made some idiotic decision.

Hermione was a natural prodigy, it was constantly stated that she was. Even in First-Year.
