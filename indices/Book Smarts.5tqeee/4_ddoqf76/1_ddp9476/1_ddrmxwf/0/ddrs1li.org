I said that Hermione doesn't show much *ambition* (i.e. the desire and determination to achieve success). I'm not saying she's not smart or that Ron doesn't work hard. Hermione studies not to advance herself or out of interest, but because that's the right thing to do.

Another piece of evidence: the Mirror of Erised. Ron desires personal success at school. Harry wants family. According to JKR, Hermione would see her friends and SO:
