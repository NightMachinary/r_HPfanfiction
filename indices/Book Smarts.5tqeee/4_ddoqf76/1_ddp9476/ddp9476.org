Ravenclaw and Slytherin don't have a monopoly on knowledge.

I agree that Hermione doesn't really pursue knowledge for its own sake. She lacks the curiosity and creativity that I associate with true academic brilliance, so would make a surprisingly poor Ravenclaw.

But she doesn't really show a lot of ambition either. She doesn't get good grades in pursue of some grand career goal and she helps her friends /because she is a good friend/. For me, an ambitious person has one or two lofty, long-term goals and is singly dedicated in their pursuit of them. Hermione is very Hufflepuff in her pursuit of knowledge: hard-work for its own sake and to support her friends.

Frankly, I think Ron shows the most ambition of the golden trio. He works hard to get on the quidditch team and shows a desire to get out of the shadow of his brothers. Harry shows a bit within each book (saving Buckbeak, stalking Malfoy) but he's pretty reactive across the series as a whole.
