You seem to imply that ambition necessarily has to be self-centered. I disagree vehemently. If your ambition is to achieve world-peace you're incredibly ambitious, even if it doesn't involve personal gain.

Things that Hermione Granger is ambitious about:

- becoming a stand-out student (Hufflepuff is the opposite, they don't want to stand out at all)
- seeing her friends survive and succeed academically (and the way she helps her friends isn't very Hufflepuff at all: A Hufflepuff would never confound another Quidditch Keeper in order to help their friends, it is extremely unfair)
- ensuring the survival of her parents at great personal cost
- freeing the house-elves, even taking up knitting in order to achieve that goal
- ridding the world of Voldemort (Harry would be completely lost without her in Year 7, he'd probably starve or suffer hypothermia after a few weeks, because he's not actually doing anything to achieve his goals except attending)

There's a bunch more, but I grow tired of this list. Let's face it, Hermione is the most Slytherin of all the characters who aren't straight up evil (and even she has a severe edge to her when she tries to achieve her goals... stealing potion ingredients, disfiguring traitors, cheating). You seem way too much influenced by how Slytherin House (House Evil) interprets ambition, which is only half the picture.
