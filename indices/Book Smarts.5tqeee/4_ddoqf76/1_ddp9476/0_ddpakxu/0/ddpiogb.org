We're talking ambition here, not cunning. I agree that Hermione develops a cunning streak -- but keep in mind, a lot of the examples you provide are done on behalf of her friends and/or require bravery.

Anyway, onto your list:

- Ambitions need to be an achievement (i.e. proactive). /No-one/ wants their friends or family to die or fail. When Voldemort is out to get you and your friends, fighting back is just self-preservation. If anything, I'd say those would be loyalty and bravery, respectively.

- How is 'being a stand-out student' an ambition, in and of itself? Unless you're a glory hound, that's not an achievement. Hermione's stand-out-ness is a by-product of her intelligence and hard-work.

- I forgot about SPEW. Freeing the house elves is a very noble ambition--one that is fogotten after OotP. I'd also argue that SPEW arises from her loyalty to muggle values. Even the way she carries out the 'peaceful protest' is very muggle. Not that Slytherins and muggles are incompatible, but I'd suggest that a Slytherin would take a more nuanced approach.

Also, I think you're pigeon-holing Hufflepuffs. Cedric was a stand-out student and an exemplary Puff.
