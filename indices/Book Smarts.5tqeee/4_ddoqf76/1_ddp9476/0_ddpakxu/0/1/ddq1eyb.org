  Ambitions need to be an achievement (i.e. proactive). No-one wants their friends or family to die or fail. When Voldemort is out to get you and your friends, fighting back is just self-preservation. If anything, I'd say those would be loyalty and bravery, respectively.

Well yes, but this is exactly the point at which ambition seperates from a mundane type of outlook. Yes, no-one wants their friends or family to die, but very few people would go to the lengths that Hermione does to achieve that goal. This is what makes her an ambitious person... she doesn't just hold that idea, she's actively working towards it. Very few people would make their parents forget all about themselves and send them to Australia in order to ensure their safety. Ambitious people set a goal for themselves and work very hard towards it. Need to defeat Voldemort? Okay, I guess we need to destroy his Horcruxes first. How do we do that? A beaded bag might be useful, we'll need lots of resources...

No-one would object to being President of the US, but it needs a certain kind of ambition to actually try to do it, come up with an insane plan that everyone mocks and then actually /become/ president.

This whole thing really centers around the fact that Rowling fucked up big-time with Slyterhin. There isn't a single student in that house who we see that's truly ambitious (certainly not Malfoy; he's just a pampered prince). The only two who come close are Slughorn and Snape (if fate hadn't conspired against him, I'd imagine him trying to become the worlds greatest potioneer - not wasting his time teaching kids). It's even worse in the cunning category.

  Also, I think you're pigeon-holing Hufflepuffs. Cedric was a stand-out student and an exemplary Puff.

I didn't mean to do that, I was generalizing their characteristics. The house system is too stiff to account for all kinds of people. Being ambitious certainly doesn't prevent anyone from going to Hufflepuff, but it's not something that I'd associate strongly with Hufflepuff. Ambition mixes very well with bravery for example, because you need to take risks, but Hufflepuff falls more into the reliable category to me (which is perfectly fine as well, just a different approach).

I don't think we know enough about Cedric's motivations to make a judgement call here, but he's probably the exception in Hufflepuff. If it's about the money then a hard worker would look for better ways to earn it other than risking their life in a blood-sport and I can't see the glory aspect as appealing for Puffs.
