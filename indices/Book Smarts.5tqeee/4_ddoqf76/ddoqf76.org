We seem to define ambition very differently? Learning things for the sake of themselves (like a Ravenclaw) is the anti-thesis to ambition. Hermione most of the time does things for the sake of something else: Better grades, her education, being helpful to her friends. This is all centered around her ambitions (being recognized as a top student by the teachers; a career; defeating Voldemort). Hermione is certainly the most ambitious of the main characters. If you think she isn't ambitious, how do you categorize Harry or god forbid Ron?
