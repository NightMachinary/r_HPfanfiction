  Hermione isn't ambitious because she doesn't struggle. She has an easy time of class, she wants to get 110% on everything not because it gets her something, but because 'being a good student is what good children do' and she wants to be thought of as a good child. But what is it for? She isn't using the teacher's perspectives to get anything, to ensure she was made Prefect or Head Girl or get an in at the Ministry or... anything. Being the teacher's pet in school when school ends at 17 is a means to an end, but Hermione treats it as an end in itself.

I don't share this particularly dim view on her character. Do you think she's stupid? Where does this interpretation on her motivations come from? Is it based on anything except your own cynical world-view? Getting good grades and studying a lot seems like a good strategy to have a successful career... if it weren't for Voldemort or blood-prejudice. Even in Year 2 it's obvious that Hermione doesn't just study for studying sake, considering the whole Polyjuice incident, she's clearly capable and interested in applying her knowledge to reach her goals (which is like one of her defining characteristics in subsequent books; your view on her character honestly baffles me).

  Harry is a little ambitious, because, while he doesn't have many goals, when he realizes what his goals are he isn't afraid to exert the necessary effort.

Harry is the typical "Hero's Journey" type character. He's just thrown into situation and overcomes them out of necessity. In my opinion struggling only barely relates to ambition. Harry always only sees the next obstacle and figures out a way to solve it, there's rarely some kind of planning and goals involved (in the case of the Horcruxes hunt he's just a tool going along with someone else's plans). He has surprisingly little agency for a protagonist and no ambition to speak of. It's not like he's diligently working on a way to rid the world of Voldemort from Year 2 onwards. No, even in Year 6 he is still obsessed with what Malfoy might be doing and seems annoyed by having to get information out of Slughorn that might be vital to the war effort.

  Ron has an ambition, to play on the Chuddley Cannons, but he is not 'ambitious' because he doesn't want it hard enough to exert effort.

Something being an 'ambition' IMHO necessitates you doing something to achieve it. If you don't it's just a daydream/fantasy. It seems pretty obvious to me that Ron is merely compensating for his inferiority complex with his brothers and hasn't even tried to figure out what he wants. He's like multiple steps before even reaching the stage of self-reflection where he could have an ambition...
