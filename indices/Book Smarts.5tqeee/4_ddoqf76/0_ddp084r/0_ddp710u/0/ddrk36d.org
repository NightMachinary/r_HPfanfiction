Yes, Hermione is extremely unintelligent in most senses. She thinks that House-Elves should be freed despite not reading any books on the subject (other than books that would support her argument). She refuses to look at a PUREBLOOD wizard's view of the situation, and she even goes as far as leaving clothes out for them to remotely free them without their consent. Thus making more work for the single house-elf that is free. She is the very definition of a liberal in short. She wants to be progressive for the sake of being progressive, with no other motivation. Hermione's goals are never shown, she just exists.

I agree with the Harry point, Harry was thoroughly un-ambitious for someone who came so close to being in Slytherin. Maybe that was his path to greatness? Maybe the distraction of being liked caused him to forget many things? I feel as if Harry is more oblivious than anything, rarely doing anything unless being told to do so.

Not a daydream or fantasy if in the Mirror of Erised. That's like saying what Harry saw was a daydream or fantasy too. Maybe his true ambition was to get his parents back? Rowling herself said that he would choose the resurrection stone over any Hallow.
