Harry is pretty ambitious.

I think of ambition as being a drive /towards/ something, an objective you want to achieve which will require effort, and then exerting that effort.

Hermione isn't ambitious because she doesn't struggle. She has an easy time of class, she wants to get 110% on everything not because it /gets/ her something, but because 'being a good student is what good children do' and she wants to be thought of as a good child. But what is it /for/? She isn't using the teacher's perspectives to /get/ anything, to ensure she was made Prefect or Head Girl or get an in at the Ministry or... anything. Being the teacher's pet in school when school ends at 17 is a means to an end, but Hermione treats it as an end in itself.

Ron has /an ambition/, to play on the Chuddley Cannons, but he is /not/ 'ambitious' because he doesn't want it hard enough to exert effort.

Harry is a /little/ ambitious, because, while he doesn't have many goals, when he realizes what his goals are he isn't afraid to exert the necessary effort.

Everyone wants /something/, it isn't just wanting that makes one ambitious.
