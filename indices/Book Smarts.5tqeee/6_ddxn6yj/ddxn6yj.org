I've seen a couple of times the view point that magic is just too ordinary for witches and wizards to get excited about. I mean, in theory, we could have high school students learning advanced stuff, and nerds and sporty types do. We have computer geeks who can do incredible stuff at age 14 that is comparable to Hermione learning the Protean Charm, and making Polyjuice, and etc. But most high school students don't. I am well aware there is an incredible range of things I could self learn, and I think they are awesome, but I can't be bothered. High school students can learn how to do an adults job better than them, especially with technology. Some mechanically minded teens could modify the hell out of a broken down old car and turn it into something cool. I had to google before I could /do an oil change/. Yet in theory, there's nothing stopping me from becoming an awesome enough mechanic that I could fix my own car. A 13 year old martial artist or boxer could kick my tiny ass, never mind a 15 year old. An average 13 year old? I could fend em off or outrun them. Probably.

So yeah, Patronus are awesome, but since Dementors apparently usually give little trouble, and Lethifolds don't hang out on the aisle, and kids have no more need for them than a normal kid would need to carry pepper spray in a good neighbourhood. Very handy in case of attackers, but the likelihood of needing it is small. So adults who go into law enforcement or travel to dodgy countries learn it, but kids don't get taught it.
