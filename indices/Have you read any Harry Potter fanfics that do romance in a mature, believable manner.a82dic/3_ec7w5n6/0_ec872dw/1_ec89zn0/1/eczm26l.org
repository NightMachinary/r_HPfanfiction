Korrasami happens at the last second because fans wanted it. It's built up so poorly, the "writers" needed to explain it later on in interviews.

But it's okay, because everything about this show is poorly written. It's just a kid's show after all. Some crappy cartoon throwing around big boy concepts like terrorism and ptsd and spirituality and politics to disguise the fact that Spongebob tackled most of these subjects with more wit and depth.
