Not the guy you're replying to, but I'll say it felt very underdeveloped to me. I want to say that it felt rushed, but really they just went for a walk at the end of season 4 so I can't really say it was rushed. More sudden than rushed, I guess.

I don't think immature and unbelievable are the words I would use, but all the same I wasn't really satisfied with what we got.
