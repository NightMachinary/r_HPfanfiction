How can this story be so fucking good and genuine. Heartwarming and fluff without being trite. Profound about loss without being disheartening. Vibrant about everyday (wizarding) family life without being a soap opera. While Abby and Harry are falling ever deeper in love, with every chapter I'm here wondering what kind of love for this story qualifies as.

Forgot to say thanks [[/u/taliesin19]]! Every chapter's worth the wait.
