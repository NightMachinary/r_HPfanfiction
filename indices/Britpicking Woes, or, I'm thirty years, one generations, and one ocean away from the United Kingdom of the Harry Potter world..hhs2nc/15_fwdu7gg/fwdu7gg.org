I speak Mandarin (non-natively) and while it's no problem to translate from Mandarin to English, it's much harder to translate from English to Mandarin. I view British English similarly. I grew up reading Enid Blyton and I understand it perfectly well, but it's a lot harder for me to write in British English. I'll slip with a “mom” or “She's really smart, she gets good grades” or whatever, or I won't even realize (realise?) when I've made a “mistake.”
