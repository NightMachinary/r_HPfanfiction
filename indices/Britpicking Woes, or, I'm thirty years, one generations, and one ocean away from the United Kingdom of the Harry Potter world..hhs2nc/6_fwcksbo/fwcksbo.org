Brit here.

Hear hear!

You can't be expected to get the subtleties of the language right, and no one should bitch about such linguistic variations. However, there are things that many writers screw up for which there is no excuse: geography, food, and technology being the main ones, all of which are easy to look up.

Of course, if you put the extra effort in to have a native speaker help you that is to be applauded, but it really isn't necessary.
