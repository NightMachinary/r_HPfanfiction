If there's anything I've noticed in my few months in this subreddit, it's that the people often have incredibly high (and sometimes oddly arbitrary to me) standards vis a vis the fics they read. I remember someone saying once that they'd drop a fic if the writer used "Harry said" instead of "Said Harry" (or vice versa, I forget precisely which way they went).

Personally, I think it's because this is a fandom with a million+ fics, a lot of which follow similar trope lines, so people are looking for excuses not to read fics, more than they're looking for reasons to read them.

I've still put out a few britpicking threads myself, but to be honest, I look at it more like writing assistance than a vital service. It's "This is Harry Potter, and the characters are British, so if you wanna get better at writing British, here's a load of Brits to help you learn how to do it!", essentially.

The hostility is just because this is the internet, and hostility is part and parcel of the experience. :D
