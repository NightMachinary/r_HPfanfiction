Agreed. Let's be honest, this is only really a problem on this subreddit. I've never seen someone complain about these things outside of here. Nobody actually gives a shit outside of when they can get some fake internet points out of it. No comments on the actual fan fiction sites ever point out that "pranks" is the wrong term, or something else.

Seriously, why does it even matter? We're reading these because we want to just read Harry doing things that aren't in cannon. I'm not reading these because I want some supreme British literature. If that's what you're after, britpicking is the least of these authors' worries.

This gatekeeping shit is moronic in the extreme.

Yeah, downvotes for being right. What else should someone expect from this cancer?
