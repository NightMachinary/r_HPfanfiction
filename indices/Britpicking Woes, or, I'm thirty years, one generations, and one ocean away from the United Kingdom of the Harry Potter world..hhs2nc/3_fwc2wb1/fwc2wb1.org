I've always said that the heated way that dialect is treated in this fandom is detrimental to the good spirit of it. This is, after all, a hobby that people volunteer many of their own hours on, for no profit, for the enjoyment of others.

I've seen Australianisms, American terms, and British phrases that are very isolated and obscure - and the main thing that has done for me? Is taught me a fair bit about dialects around the world. Other dialects don't hurt me, I usually understand the spirit of where the author is going and it doesn't upset me that they are not writing in the exact dialect of JKR. It's a cultural phenomena of this fandom, and I cope with it by complying with British English where known but ignore people verbalising irritation if I don't get it a hundred percent. I'm from New Zealand - we were colonised by Britain and have a dialect very similar to British English, but some of it didn't stick so there are times when I don't catch NZisms. It happens.

I encourage you to ignore people treating language this way in the fandom when they give their unsolicited comments on your work, and ignore posted content that makes similar complaints on platforms. Historically, grammar and spelling has always been associated with purism, superiority and so on, so we won't see the end of it, and that's alright. We're here for fun, so protect that experience.
