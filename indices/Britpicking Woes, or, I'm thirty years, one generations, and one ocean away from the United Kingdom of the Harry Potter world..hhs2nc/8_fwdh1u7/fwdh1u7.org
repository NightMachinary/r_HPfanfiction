I agree with you - to a point. I will say there has been a rise recently of 'angry' Britpicking posts. Ones where the poster is very offended by common (or not-so-common) mistakes made by non-British authors.

I do think that an author should do research when they are writing a story set in a country and culture that they are not intimately familiar with. That said, fanfiction authors are largely amateurs, and the majority are young. These are free works.

It astounds me how angry people get when they read fanfiction that contains a lot of mistakes and/or Americanisms. Just like it astounds me how angry they get when they read fanfiction that has plot and story elements that they personally dislike.

Rather than complaining and shaming authors for not knowing things about British culture, the poster could make an informative post. One that's not making fun of or yelling at fanfic authors, but one that says, "Here's what things are actually like in Britain."
