  I do not know how to talk like an authentic British person.

Then don't write a British person. Case closed. Writing British people as americans is just bad writing, "idk how to do it" is not an excuse. If I decided to write some kids or elderly americans but had them speak like a Parisian technocrat because that's what I know to do and that I'm not willing to try and learn how to be more accurate to the context it would be asinine and lazy too.
