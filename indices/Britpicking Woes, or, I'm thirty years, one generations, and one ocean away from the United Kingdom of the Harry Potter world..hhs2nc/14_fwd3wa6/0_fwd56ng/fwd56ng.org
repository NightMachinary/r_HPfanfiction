And this is the exact sort of attitude that made me post this in the first place. By your logic, I shouldn't write anything that's not set in the 21st century and in the USA. No HP, no Naruto, no LoTR, and no to a whole bunch of other settings created by non-Americans or set in worlds where the characters logically wouldn't speak 21st century American English.

A bit silly, don't you think?

/Obviously/ I do the best I can with what I know, and even with the limitations of my knowledge there are ways to preserve the characters' vocal traits with tone and narrative voice. But there are just some things that I, as an American who never was a British schoolboy would never know.

As a related aside, Tom Scott on Youtube did a video recently on the difference between the American and the UK versions of the kids song "Jingle Bells, Batman Smells..." and other differences. Link for the interested: [[https://youtu.be/V5u9JSnAAU4]]
