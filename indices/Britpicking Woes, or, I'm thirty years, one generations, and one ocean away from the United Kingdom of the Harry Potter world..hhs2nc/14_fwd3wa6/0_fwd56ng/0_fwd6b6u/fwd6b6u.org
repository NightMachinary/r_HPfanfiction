  And this is the exact sort of attitude that made me post this in the first place. By your logic, I shouldn't write anything that's not set in the 21st century and in the USA

That's exactly what I didn't say m8. i said you had to make /a reasonable effort/ lest it falls under the category of bad writing. If you're content with it then by all means do what you want, it's not like most fanfiction have award-levels of writing to begin with.

I'm not saying you shouldn't write a British character because you're american, I'm saying that your op is just ranting about how you want to write an american character, by all means do so, but writing an american characters and calling them british is stupid.
