Kinda.

I'm kind of writing an original fiction thing right now. I've set it in what's an AU for IRL to avoid having to do any actual research because screw that, but the character's American. And no matter how much I hate the term "vacation", there's just no way that he's not going to say that for holiday. And so he says vacation. And if it somehow comes up, actually it probably will, that we'll come across some nappies, well he's going to say diapers. It'll be realators (will have to learn to spell that... ah, realtor), mom, faucet, fall and all the other big ticket words all the way through. And why? Because that's the character's reality.

No-one's expecting that you go out and learn how to write idiomatic scouse or whatever. I mean, look at the Harry Potter books. As long as you say snog for kiss, ah... actually, grab a non-American edition. The point is that reading Harry Potter is not at all like watching, for example, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet or The Boys from the Black Stuff or, hell, even Hot Fuzz, where you get these clearly "regional" dialects and terms. The characters in Harry Potter have dialogue that wouldn't at all be out of place in an X-Men comic with the sole exception of Hagrid and the occasional word (most notoriously, snog). All anyone's saying is that if you're going to have dad!Harry, is that he's buying nappies, dummies and whatever Brits call cots.

Look, we all know that America is incredibly insular. I mean, I'm from a part of the world that semi-regularly hears about American news programmes giving us subtitles (nothing happens here) but it really should not be too much to expect the characters to not be saying classic American words. Even just remembering to write mum over mom.

It's quite different when it comes to the narrator's voice. Because the narrator isn't really a character and is under no obligation to describe or see the world in the same way that any individual character does. And while I would probably find it a bit strange to have an American narrator with British characters, it'd be quite hypocritical given [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/to-the-ordinary-world-everybodys-got-to-write-an-azkaban-fic-sometime-2785009bffe8][the way I write]] and what I like to read in narrators (e.g. Thackeray in Vanity Fair or Pratchett in Discworld or, most memorably, that one comic where it had "he's right, it's a bomb" as a narration device)... that is, ones with a clear presence anyway. So, why not an American narrator with British characters? Is it any weirder than having a narrator at all? (Here's me calling third person omniscient a narrator.)

OTOH I've never been one for kidspeak or so on. The idea is to imagine the voice of the character imposed over the text. Kids are going to say some words wrong or use the wrong words more frequently. It's just a thing. But that still means not doing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HBxfDzZaic#t=1m43s][this]] (usually, note that it makes sense for the character in that situation). There's a (possibly more) fic out there somewhere that posits that part of Snape's antipathy towards Harry is in his noticeably posher accent, which contrasts with Snape's affected one. And both sometimes say certain words in the way that no southerner would (presumably this means a short a, e.g. trap and bath have the same a sound or something). This isn't reflected in the dialogue /at a word choice level/. Or, if it is, it is very subtle and I can't tell what's going on. But it's not equivalent to "translation convention".

I guess... compare Rahne, Gambit, Rogue or Chamber to most X-Men characters. Those are American writers (for the most part) making sure to include dialectal terms or pronounciation guides (in Rahne's case) for a mostly American audience. And, at the same time, if they need to speak Japanese or Skrull or whatever it's probably just <hey, this is speaking Japanese>. I don't share these accents... and it's really freaking strange to come across NZ accents even in NZ... so it's quite possible it is completely cringey but they do it anyway.

Now, a lot of Britpicking is directed to a group of writers who have a genuine interest in trying to recreate the British feel of the books. They want to hear about the difference between porch and porch (a distinction I cannot explain but read about in one of those threads) or that your characters are probably expecting kippers for breakfast if they're millionaires (it's from the hilariously titled song [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZahtmWhH5g][Breakfast in America]]... the song's narrator imagines, much like many authors do, that Brits and Americans eat the same breakfast foods). And these big "Britpicking" threads are, realistically, the best way of providing a space to do that. And the choice of using the word porch or whatever is probably something the narrator has to grapple with.
