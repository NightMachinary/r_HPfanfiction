Apropos of nothing, I had pancakes with bacon and maple syrup for breakfast at a bar/cafe in Soho a few years ago after a full night's drinking. It happened to be on the menu and I'd recently read Stephen Fry's Making History, in which a British character found himself in America, tried it and loved it.

I can confirm that the combination is utterly delicious and if any Brit finds him- or herself in a situation where it's on offer, they should try it.
