There should be attempts at authenticity, but I'm curious as to know if that's whats leading to the whole Victorian era/nobility related tropes. Simply because its the easiest frame of reference for worldbuilding.

[[https://professormcguire.tumblr.com/post/165200382179/slytherin-and-eton-a-primer-on-the-british-school][This piece on Slytherin/UK public schools comparison]] showcases the worldbuilding Rowling put into the series highlighting classism. Trying to emulate this form of worldbuilding is gonna be challenging given the intracacies of classism in the UK, hence the attempts of a magical Victorian world.

Another example is how Aurors are depicted as police, given how there was another post on how common it was to have Aurors as police in fics. It could simply be that its easier to depict them as police given the number of police procedural shows and go from there. If someone wanted to depict Aurors as magical British special forces thats more research. Hell, making Aurors as magical British SF isn't possible if we're trying to be accurate, given that the SAS(or any UKSF unit) doesn't recruit from the civilian population whereas Aurors go straight from Hogwarts to selection, given that the magical world doesn't have a military. Which seems nitpicky as hell as an observation, but so is getting irritated at the word "prank" in fics imo.
