I definitely prefer the work to feel British, but have rarely found benign non-British details to break my immersion to the point that it counts against the work. However, the author has to accept that the reader will know the author is not natively British. If someone cracks out pancakes for breakfast and eats â€˜biscuits' with their gravy I immediately perceive the author as an American.

There's also a question of degree. For example, I would see a prom or thanksgiving chapter as an author's fancy, and would likely skim these sections. Pancakes for breakfast, on the other hand, just wouldn't rise to the level of immersion frustration. Non-British details will only break immersion to the degree that the reader is familiar with British culture, and I wonder if this is the reason why this topic is often polarising, especially with the work being a massive international export.

However, I'm writing all of this as a kiwi, so I won't be as attached to the Britishness of the work compared to a Brit like yourself. I'm also a recent arrival to the fandom because of my age, so I'm always interested to read about the perspectives of longer-time fans like you.
