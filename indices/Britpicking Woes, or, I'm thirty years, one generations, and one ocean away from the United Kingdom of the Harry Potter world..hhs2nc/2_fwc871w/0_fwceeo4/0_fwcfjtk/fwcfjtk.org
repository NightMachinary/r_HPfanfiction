The funny thing is that the average story quality in the fandom would likely rise significantly if people were more willing to just abandon telling stories in Britain and start telling original stories, set within the HP universe but within their home countries, with authentic cultural references, original worldbuilding, new characters and plots.

Imagine if, instead of having 100,000 cookie-cutter indy!Harry fics where Harry inherits a ton of titles, becomes a super wizard, then still gets knocked out by Pettigrew in the graveyard to keep the story on canon rails, we had 100,000 original stories set in America, India, Turkey, Egypt, China, Greece, Norway, Japan... all of them telling the stories of new characters, with interesting worldbuilding and novel plots.

Sure, most of them would still be badly written. But at least there would be variety.
