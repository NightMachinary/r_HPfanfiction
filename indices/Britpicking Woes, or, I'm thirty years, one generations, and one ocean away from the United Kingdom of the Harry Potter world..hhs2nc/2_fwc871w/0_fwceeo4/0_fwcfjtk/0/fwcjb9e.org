Preach it, brother, preach it!

The question is the language. I am a Czech, and there is the fanfiction writers community around the server [[http://budec.net/]], which created the idea of the Czech magical school [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][at Budeƒç]]) (which is truly magical place, even as Muggle I see it), but most of stories are in Czech. I was trying to write to that community, but Czech fanfiction community is so small (and overflown with Drarry, and teenage trash), that it feels like writing just for myself. So, now most of what I do is in English and in Britain, but you are right, that is not right either. Grrr. I just so wish life was easy!
