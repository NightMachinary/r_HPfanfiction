As an American, reading an HP fic, would you find it strange if characters used Japanese terminology such as referring to Professor Snape as "Snape-san"? Would you find it odd if all the characters refused to eat beef, as in India? Would your immersion be broken if the characters periodically interrupted their day to pray towards Mecca?

I suspect you would. In which case: why should American cultural references and language be treated exceptionally?

There's no real difference in principle between "Snape-san" and pancakes for breakfast. Unfortunately, if you want to write about a place in a way that comes across as authentic rather than immersion-breaking, you /do/ need to know something about that place. If you just impose the language and customs of your own culture on a foreign place when you write about it, then anyone who /does/ know about that place will find it off-putting.
