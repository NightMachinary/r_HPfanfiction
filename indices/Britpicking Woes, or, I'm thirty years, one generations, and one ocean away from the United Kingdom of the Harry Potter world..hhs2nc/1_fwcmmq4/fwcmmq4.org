I understand your point of view. However, as a British reader, I am always going to find Americanisms in HP fanfic as jarring as I would cultural or language imports from any other world culture.

So much media (films, tv and books) we consume in the U.K. originated in the US. It's the same language, so it's expected to mean the same thing. When we got an amazingly popular book and film series that were British, used British language, culture, even actors, and were being consumed all over the world, that was really awesome. So yeah, when you see Americanisms (and it really does tend to only be Americanisms and not other cultures that crop up) it jars really badly.

None of that means US writers shouldn't write HP fic, but taking a bit of constructive criticism on things that just wouldn't happen in the U.K. is appreciated. We're not asking you to use British spellings and grammar in your writing, just try to avoid the pancakes for breakfast, thanksgiving dinners, paying for healthcare....

Also, I've been called on Britishism in American based fandom writings (and been accused of being a non-native English speaker, as though other forms of English don't exist) - but if I get something wrong, I'm happy to adapt it. I don't get why the same consideration can't be given the other way, and it feels a bit like US exceptionalism sometimes.
