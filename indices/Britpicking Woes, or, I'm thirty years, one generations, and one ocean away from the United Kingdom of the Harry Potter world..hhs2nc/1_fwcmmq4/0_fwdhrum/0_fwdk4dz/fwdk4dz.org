So, you're never going to get everything right. Absolutely not. I mean, Im from Scotland and our school system is completely different to England's, as is our legal system, so even I have to check stuff for England. And things like that change over time, so writing a Marauders fic even Brits are checking dates different things applied - and that's practically no time in a country that's had researchable culture since before the Roman occupation.

It's too much to expect someone who has never lived in the U.K. to know regional differences. We don't even all know the various regional differences, as is shown on almost every Brit picking thread ever. And anyone being an outright prick doesn't deserve you caring about their opinion, although beware of falling into the trap of taking a typed comment as being rude because you can't hear tone and it's being critical - I do this a lot and it's why I hate texting, and quickly written reviews and comments can definitely do that (and I've had someone apologise when I wrote a reply back to them about it once so it really isn't always meant). But in general, don't listen to someone who is being a knobend.

However, I'd also say if you don't know and can't research the regional differences, don't try writing regional differences and instead gloss over it - it's much more jarring to get those things wrong than just to /not/ try and write a Manc backstory for Snape for example. A Brit calling you out for not recognising Snape is a Manc is being a douche - but writing in detail about a specific region you have no experience of, without a good reference and getting cross with Brits for finding it off putting is another story.

A lot of Brits (myself included) are happy to Brit pick. If you would like the help, but don't have one already and don't know where to ask, then put an A/N at the start of your story that you'd appreciate the help if someone wants to give it. Also, this sub is full of Brits who will comment on a thread asking for help with Britishisms or British culture. Just ask, we like to help and it's lovely having people try to engage with our culture.

Unfortunately, before HP the prevailing attitude was that modern British culture wasn't that cool and nobody cared overly much outside of the U.K. - if you were going to consume English language media outside of the U.K., it would be American. This leads to the double whammy of there being very little easily available guidance for non-Brits setting their writing in the U.K., but also a U.K. audience that feels very prickly about one of their biggest modern cultural exports being Americanised.
