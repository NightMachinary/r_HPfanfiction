Aye, but frequently the feedback is given in a hostile or patronizing way. I have a British friend that looks over my chapters before I post them to catch the obvious things I missed, and it's really helped me learn about the differences in language and culture. That said, doing a lot of research and getting someone to check for regionalisms is a bit unfair to expect of an unpaid and amateur writer. It's certainly a good thing if you see it, and it's absolutely fair to expect professional writers to spend the extra effort.

What would be really nice is if there were good and comprehensive resources available to amateur non-British authors. When I do my research, it's by doing a lot of googling and trawling through shitty website after shitty website to try and find how things actually are in Britain. And sometimes, as with the school system post I made on this subreddit a while back, I still miss the mark, even after /days/ of research.
