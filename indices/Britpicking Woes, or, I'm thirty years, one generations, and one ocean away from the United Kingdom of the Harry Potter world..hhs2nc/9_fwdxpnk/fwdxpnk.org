I've said all this before but it bears repeating: a lot of Britpicking really is nitpicking because it's totally unnecessary. I don't care whether you spell it "traveller" or "traveler", "honour" or "honor". I'll wince a bit at "gotten" but generally let it slide because it's becoming more common over here.

But if you have Harry putting on sneakers and skateboarding to the mall to meet Chet, Schroeder and Tad before heading to Taco Bell... then you're not even trying. Similarly, I can just about let people off using words like "Fall" instead of "Autumn" or "sidewalk" instead of "pavement" in narrative text, but if Harry or another British character used those words it would be plain wrong.

If you're using Americanisms in a certain way then it can ruin the reader's immersion in a story. You bring up Lord of the Rings, well fair enough: what would your reaction be to Frodo telling Boromir to go fuck himself? It's totally out of character and, assuming that sort of thing happened frequently, it would ruin the story. The same is true of Harry Potter.

I've betad for [[/u/Starfox5]] who preferred pure 100% British idioms and spelling, and for [[/u/TE7]] who just wants the really obvious stuff fixed. Well actually he probably doesn't even care about that but he gets it anyway, like it or not.

Nobody expects you to be able to write fluent "British". I've also said before that I wouldn't expect 99% of British people to be able to write correctly in the huge array of local idioms and accents that we have. You just have to read the awful mess people make of Hagrid's and Fleur's accents. But if you're not even going to try to avoid incorrect dialogue then your story is going to be bad. It's that simple. If you can't do it yourself then find someone British who can spell - there are a few of us left - to check things over for you.
