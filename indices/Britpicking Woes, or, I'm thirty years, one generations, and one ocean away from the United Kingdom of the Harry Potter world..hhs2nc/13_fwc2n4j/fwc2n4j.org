I totally get what you're saying. In the past I've always tried to lesson Americanisms when writing HP fanfics (that have sadly never seen an audience because I've never been able to finish a story & I refuse to publish unless it's finished) but I always fall off the wagon & end up just writing in American English. It's one of the major factors as to why I want to write a fic set in the HP universe in modern America, specifically Texas 'cause that's the dialect that I grew up speaking.
