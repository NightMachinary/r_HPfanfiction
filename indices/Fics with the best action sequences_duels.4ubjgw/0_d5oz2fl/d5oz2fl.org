Seconding JBern, but also in linkffn(A Black Comedy), the fight between Harry, Sirius, and Voldemort, though really short and only one of two fight scenes in the entire book, is pretty high on my list. The second fight scene in Hogsmeade is one of the best 'somewhat' realistic Harry kicking ass scenes.
