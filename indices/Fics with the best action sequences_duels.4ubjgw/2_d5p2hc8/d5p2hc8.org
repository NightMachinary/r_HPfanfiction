I would have to preface this by saying that a great many of the stories I am going to suggest aren't that good; however, they do contain brilliant fights.

To continue then: I must third the recommendation of Jbern (particularly the fights in Bungle in the Jungle, even if the story has problems), and A Black Comedy. I would also suggest linkffn(The Wastelands of Time); linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) has some very well done fights, though the story isn't that great as a whole; the Denarian Knight series is pretty good; linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has some good sequences; linkffn(Delenda Est), and linkffn(To Play the Devil) has a number which I enjoyed.
