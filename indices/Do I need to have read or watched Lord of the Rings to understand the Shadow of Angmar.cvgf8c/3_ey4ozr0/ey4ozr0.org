The events of "Shadow of Angmar " take place (for the moment) before the one of LotR. So reading the books or watching the movie would not give you much informations. If you really want to learn about the Lore before reading it, you would probably have more informations reading the Silmarilion. But as people said before, the author really took the time to explain the world so you should be fine even without having read anything.
