As someone who has little specific experience with LotR (one inevitably absorbs the very big basic points just via cultural osmosis, even more so if one is interested in fantasy or just in nerdier topics in general), it is not necessary to have read the books to enjoy the fic. You definitely get the sense that there are people and places and names of significance that you don't have the inherited context for, but it does a good job of explaining things such that you don't get lost.

 

(As AutumnSouls states, it does so to the point that it definitely slows the pacing in order to try to fit in the massive amount of information that Tolkein's works contained. I personally am fine with slower paced stories, more content is more content, but that isn't for everyone)

 

While to some extent I may not know what I'm missing out on from the lack of previous LotR reading, the only thing that sticks out to me that I'm not getting is that it's clear that half the point of the story is how Harry's existence in the world and his actions change things in comparison to canon. Without knowing that canon, obviously I don't notice/see those changes. It doesn't hamper enjoyment of the fic or anything, but it's something that non LotR fans are locked out of by definition.
