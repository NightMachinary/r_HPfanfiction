Well, you might also want to try linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) since its also by Lens of Sanity.

The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) checks the violence and madness buttons so hard the pen went through the paper, though its not humorous.

Seventh Horcrux linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) also seems to meet all your requirements. This one is arguably the most popular comedy in the fandom, possibly next to A Black Comedy.

Most of nonjon's works fit with your requirements as well.

The-Boy-Who-Could-Not-Die linkffn(The-Boy-Who-Could-Not-Die) is unfinished, but its one of the freshest takes on Horcrux!Harry I can remember.
