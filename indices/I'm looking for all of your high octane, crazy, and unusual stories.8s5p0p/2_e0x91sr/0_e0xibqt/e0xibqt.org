Doghead Thirteen's new story "The scourge from the north" on the Caer Azkaban yahoo group. It's only four mega-chapters and two parts of a fifth long, and was very hard to find but my god. It's already so long, so good, and so refreshing I love it! I finally found it late one evening and started reading and then noticed the sun was coming up by the time I'd just about finished. I can point you in the direction of yahoo group, or if you'd like link you to a Google Drive folder with all of it in there.
