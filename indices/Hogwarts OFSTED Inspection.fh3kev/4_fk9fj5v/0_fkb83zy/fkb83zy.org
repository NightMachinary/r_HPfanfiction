I may be wrong, but I'm fairly sure that Ofsted do not have the power to remove teachers from schools. Ofsted also care more about the improvement achieved in school than the grades themselves, and since Hogwarts does not teach English, maths and science, there's very little they could do to actually monitor progress. The grades therefore probably wouldn't matter too much.

However, they definitely do inspect lessons, and if Snape's teaching was determined to be sub-par, the school would be advised of that and be expected to take action of some sort.
