Well, theoretically, they would all fail. The curriculum is magical, not mundane, so classes lile mathematics or english don't exist. That may count as an instant fail, I think.

However, the magical classes could be approximated to mundane ones - herbology and Comc to biology, potions to chemistry and physics, arithmancy to mathematics, runes to ancient languages, flying to PE, things of that nature.

I'd like to see a crackfic that has a squad of inspectors circumventing the repelling charm in the most ludicrous of ways, and eventually arrive at the castle itself. They meet with the headmaster, and everyone scrambles to "mundanize" the classes.
