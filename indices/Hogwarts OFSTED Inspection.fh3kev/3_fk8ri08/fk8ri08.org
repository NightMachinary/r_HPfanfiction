Yeah I just can't see it getting a good grade at all at ofsted, the curriculum is inconsistent in quality between subjects, there's seemingly no differentiation for high ability and low ability pupils to be pushed to their individual capabilities and not all teachers create environments conducive to learning (though for the most part they do seem to be knowledgable in their respective subjects). Behaviour management is inconsistent and learners attitudes to learning is shown to often be poor. Peer on peer abuse is rife and often unpunished or insufficiently punished and little is done to stop abuse of those with different heritage. The curriculum is not broad enough to offer personal development beyond the curriculum itself (or I don't remember it shown to be in canon) and does not prepare learners for life in modern Britain (they may live alongside modern Britain but I mean I'm hypothesising an ofsted report for a fictional school so let's suspend logic here a little)

the provider prepares learners for life in modern Britain by: − equipping them to be responsible, respectful, active citizens who contribute positively to society − developing their understanding of fundamental British values − developing their understanding and appreciation of diversity − celebrating what we have in common and promoting respect for the different protected characteristics as defined in law.

On the positive side learners are expected to complete their course and are seemingly not off rolled and leadership does protect its staff from bullying (pity its at the expense of the bullying of the children by snape but I guess we can't have it all). Safeguarding overall is non existent though so I would say that would have hogwarts shut down quicker than you could wave a wand to obliviate

I may have thought too much into this...
