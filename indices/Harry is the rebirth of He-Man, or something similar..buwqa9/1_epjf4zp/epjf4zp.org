I am Harry, Boy Who Lived, vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort. This is Dobby, my fearless friend. Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic sword and sang:

"Eleven years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope / for a destination...

"And I realized quickly when I knew I should / that this world was made up of this Ministry of Magic / or whatever that means..."
