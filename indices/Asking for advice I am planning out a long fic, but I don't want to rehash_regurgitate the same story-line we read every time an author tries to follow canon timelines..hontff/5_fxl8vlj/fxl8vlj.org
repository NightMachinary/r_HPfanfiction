I think a thing to decide early on is how much divergence you're willing to deal wtih. My partner is writing a year-per-longfic story with a very different POV and the initial year follows closely to canon because the viewpoint character isn't involved enough to change things, although some small things DO get changed by their existence. These changes snowball over time and by 5th year, the existence of the out-of-canon viewpoint has interplayed enough with the canon HP events that things start to happen very, very, VERY differently. Books 6 and 7 will basically be entirely different.

I think it can be difficult to do a story where events diverge very little from canon while still keeping things feeling fresh, especially with a Harry viewpoint, unless he makes some very different choices. And if he makes different choices, depending on what those choices are... it'd be weird for things to play out exactly the same, and the further along you get, the more things will diverge. I think the further your viewpoint character is from the canon trio, it gets easier in some ways to maintain the canon timeline, if that's what you want to do.
