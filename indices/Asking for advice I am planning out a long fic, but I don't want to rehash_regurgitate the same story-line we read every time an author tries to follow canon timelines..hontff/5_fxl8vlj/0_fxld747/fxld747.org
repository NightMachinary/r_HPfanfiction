Thank you, that's really helpful. I'm actually planning on a lot of divergence happening almost immediately which will directly impact Harry's life (including but not limited to replacing one of the trio)... but despite the twist, I don't want the focus of the story to be all about him.

What I'm going for is matching the timeline, in that there still 7 years at Hogwarts, and some events outside of their control will be affected by the divergence, but not prevented by the divergence.
