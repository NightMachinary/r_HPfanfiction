Cool. I've already planned that one is found pre Harry starting Hogwarts so I think we're on the same page here. Always nice!

In all honesty the more I think about it, the more I think the events of PS are not necessary to the wider story. Let Quirrell get trapped in the mirror of his own volition. Harry can concentrate on another, unique, adventure in his first year!
