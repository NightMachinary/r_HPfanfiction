People say this a lot, and I think I get what they mean but I also don't. Maybe you could help me out?

I understand that it's really boring to read over and over again "they went for the stone then they went for the basilisk then someone escaped from Azkaban and then Harry got put in a tournament," even if it's slightly different people (Harry and Draco being best mates rather than Harry and Ron for example) or done in a slightly different way (Harry befriends the basilisk rather than kill it).

BUT. If you want to tell a story about Harry and his time at HoggyWartys and how he destroys Voldemort, are there not some fixed points that have to happen? At the very least, the Sword of Gryffindor has to get the basilisk venom into it so it can destroy Horcruxes, Sirius has to appear in some fashion so they eventually meet Kreacher and can destroy the locket, and Voldie has to be resurrected.

Unless by "don't follow canon" you mean "throw the whole thing away, no horcruxes, have Voldemort destroyed in a completely different way," which I would support because it's, as I'm sure you'll agree, more interesting than a tweaked rewrite. But I've rarely seen it done well.

So, if you're a "don't follow canon at all" person, what sort of things would you like to see? Asking for a totally self interested reason as, much like OP, I'm looking to move on to the "Hogwarts" section of my WIP!
