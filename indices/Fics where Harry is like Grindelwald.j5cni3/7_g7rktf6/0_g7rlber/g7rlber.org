I mean rather a Harry with the Grindelwald personality, whether he succeeds or not is up to the author (I have yet to see a fic of revolutionary Harry in which his efforts fail). I'm also excited that he has details like Harry being interested in human experimentation or getting kicked out of Hogwarts like Grindelwald was kicked out of Durmstrang (For valid reasons, not for the crap that some authors of Azkaban!Harry).
