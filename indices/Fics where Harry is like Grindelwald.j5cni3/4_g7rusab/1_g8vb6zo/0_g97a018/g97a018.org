[[/u/Katherien0Corazon][u/Katherien0Corazon]] Oh dear, I never saw the reply I got!

But: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The-Black-Heir][The Black Heir]] basically took over my life for a few intense days. It's Harry/Voldemort, and Harry/ a few others (but I found it believable and was actually secretly rooting for it). The writing is something you need to get a bit used to, but it's still quite amazing considering that English is like the author's 3rd language. I don't want to spoil it too much, but The Black Heir, at almost 900k, is only part 1. Harry is immensely powerful, pretty much on the same side as Voldemort in the sense that he wants the Dark to be back in its rightful place, not hidden. The author's world-building is honestly some next-level stuff; it just goes beyond what you might expect.

And Grindelwald has a prominent role in it, but a bit further in the story. Honestly, this fic just constantly surprised me with the plot twists and how well it was layered.

The second part is a WIP but already at 700k+ words, so you'll have lots and lots of reading pleasure.

You might enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18316175][Son of Magic]] -- Harry/Tom Riddle - MoD Harry goes back in time to hopefully save the magical world from the muggles. He's super powerful and starts worming his way into politics early on to do it right. It's still a WIP but I'm soooo down for the intrigue.
