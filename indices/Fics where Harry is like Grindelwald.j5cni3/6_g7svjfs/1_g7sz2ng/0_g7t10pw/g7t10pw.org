Yeah, there's a couple little oneshots as a followup too. I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for, exactly, but some of the points are there. Also: the shadow magic part is pretty cool. Fair warning tho, this Harry is rather... apathetic. If his 'follower' cares, then he cares. But beyond that? Nope. Couldn't give a toss. He IS a lot closer to Grindelwald than Riddle at any rate.

Finally... lots of that author's stuff is great: Potter Rage, Choices and Princeps are three more series' that are worth checking out off the top of my head.
