We've all seen the typical fics where Harry has the exact same personality as Tom Riddle and Dumbledore almost had a heart attack the first time he met him (the plot from there boils down to: the hat sends him to Slytherin before touching his head, he becomes head of Slytherin in two days, forms his own cult, rules the world, etc).

Could you give me some fics with this?
