Well the most obvious is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][The Rise of A Dark Lord]]. Is also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3646122/1/First-Impressions][First Impressions]], although this is only a one shot. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22303858/chapters/53272282][Dark Possession]], although at the rate the author is going I will be an old woman by the time chapter 15 comes out. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25798594/chapters/62663878][Avada Eyes]] it is a fairly recent one with regular updates. Those are the ones that are most similar, to find more I would advise you to check the tag "psychopath! Harry" that is in Ao3 or I think there are also a few threads on this same subreddit dedicated to looking for this type of fics.
