I don't know if you got my post right, but I'll explain it anyway. I do not want a Harry who is the reincarnation of Hitler, but one who has the same character and methodology of Grindelwald, but not necessarily the same cause. There are many ways to do this well without incurring fascist ideas, for example, there is The Sum of Their Parts, which shows revolutionary Harry's fight to demolish a ministry ruled by racism and corruption, all in order to create a better future for his godson. Or maybe, "With the Strength of Steel Wings" Which shows a Harry who wants to bring both worlds together, but has no desire to subjugate Muggles. Anyway, I would not mind reading a fic where he have the same ideas and intentions as Grindelwald, as long as it makes sense and is well written
