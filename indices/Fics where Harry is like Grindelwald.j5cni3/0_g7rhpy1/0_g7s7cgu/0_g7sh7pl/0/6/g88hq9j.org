It's stupid to be that concerned over spoiler tags, if you're going to be that paranoid... might as well not be on the internet at all. Or alternatively, do like what I did below, using a simple cypher. /Because if you know it's about an manga/anime, and theres an manga/anime you're trying to stay spoiler free, if you're stupid enough to decode a cypher that is also in spoilers, it's on you./

I think even using a cypher is overkill, but eh... The amount of reddit users who're using applications that don't support Reddit's spoiler tags is minuscule, I guess someone could accidentally click on one, but still... There is the argument to make sure those who're using outdated apps remain spoiler free, but reddit isn't windows, if you're using something significantly outdated you should be fine with the fact that certain features aren't available to you, like spoiler tags, and in the process that you yourself might get spoiled.

Regardless, are you talking of nbg? (ROT13 - if needed, rot13.com) That's the closest I could think of that I know of. In which case, I guess... But other than the whole preemptive strike, I don't really see them being similar at all.
