I guess, yeah. It's more of an opinion thing of mine. I suppose being more safe then sorry is good, but... eh... I feel at times it can be taken too far, but I guess if you don't take it far enough there are those who'll get rather... Vocal about it.

And yeah, that's what I was thinking of, but I don't feel they're exactly similar, while both are going for preemptive strikes, aot is focusing more on him doing it for freedom, while in the synopsis of op, it's for the defense of his friends, if that makes any sense.

I guess they're quite similar, when I think about it some more... It's just their motivation for doing it varies significantly, I think. For example, I think Harry in the story OP proposes would do everything he could to avoid the death of his friends, even if it goes against their will, but as you see in the latest chapter of AoT, Eren does not force his friends to follow along with his plan, granting them the freedom to choose whether to work with or against him, even though if they oppose him it could result in their deaths.
