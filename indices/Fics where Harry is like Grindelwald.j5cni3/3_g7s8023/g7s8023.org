Do you know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][Sum of their Parts]]?

It has the plot that Harry goes Dark for a worthy cause - and he pretty much walks the thin line between revolutionary and serial killer. "More Grindelwald than Voldemort" is even a line of the fanfiction.\\
Only thing that doesn't fit your request: Dumbledore is dead already in that fic - it starts after Hogwarts. But he talks with Albus' portrait.
