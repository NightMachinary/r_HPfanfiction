11-year-old Harry started running, as fast as he could. Then he leapt forward. A wandlessly-cast muscle-strengthening charm helped him kick off, an air-displacing charm helped neutralise air resistance, a customized variant on a cushioning charm kept him from breaking his legs as he bounced along, getting faster with each kick.

A muggle police officer was puzzled when his speed camera registered something going past at hundreds of km per hour towards London; all he saw was a small blur.

The patrons were startled when the door of the Leaky Cauldron banged open and an unidentifiable blur whooshed through, before seemingly vanishing (or Disapparating) at the wall leading to Diagon Alley.

The Gringotts goblins in the lobby didn't bat an eye as a blur whooshed through and leapt over the minecart leading to the vaults. Time was money after all, and the tiny vial of blood labelled 'Identification' left on Griphook's desk was as good as a key in these fanfics.

Ollivander at his wand shop, Madam Malkin at her robe shop, and various other Diagon Alley shopkeepers blinked as /something/ short stirred up a whirlwind in their stores, taking what they wanted and leaving exact change.

Dumbledore tilted his head at the very odd magic-mirror-call he had just received, before wandering across his office and retrieving a particular thick book; 'A Guide to Bizarre Events & What To Do About Them (by Aurican Pulaparte)'.

A few minutes later, Harry came through a public Floo in Hogsmeade...and, screeched to a halt.\\
There, standing in front of him, was Albus Dumbledore, wearing a full bandoleer of potions, Fawkes perched on his shoulder, and, even more inexplicably, roller skates on his feet.\\
Seeing him, the aged headmaster smiled, before thrusting out a finger, "Harry Potter! I would like to join your party!"
