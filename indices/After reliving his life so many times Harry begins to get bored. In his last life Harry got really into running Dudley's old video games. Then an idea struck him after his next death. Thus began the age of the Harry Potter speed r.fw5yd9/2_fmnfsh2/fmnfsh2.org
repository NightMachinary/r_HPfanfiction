"Harry, why are you doing squats against the wall?"

Harry briefly stopped what he was doing. Looking up, he sees Hermione giving him one of those looks that is clear that she is questioning his sanity, again.

"Shush Hermione. This is a frame perfect trick", Harry snapped with annoyance. Backing up against the wall, he took another squat and then immediately tried to turn around.

It only succeeded in Harry getting his face intimately close to the cold stone walls of Hogwarts. Somewhere far away, Harry could swear the castle was beginning to laugh at him.

"Harry?" Hermione tried again.

It was clear that Hermione was not going to give up distracting him. Harry sighed.

"There's no death trigger behind this wall. If you crouch and then turn at the same time, you can go into the wall. Since we are also directly below the room where the Philosopher's stone is, the game will then place us into that room as it is confused as to where we are."

"In addition, since we did not go through the fire gate, Quirrel does not spawn."

"Harry, the what sto-"

"Since Quirrel did not spawn, the game then thinks that I have defeated him and moves on to the ending screen."

"I basically skip the entire first year with this trick here."

"By the way, I also end up with the Philosopher's stone in my inventory, but that's a useless item which we toss away in year 4 to a dragon."

"So please be quiet. I was on a world record pace but I may need to restart if I fail this attempt."

"Harry, what are you talking about? The Philosopher's Stone? Isn't that a legend to make you immortal?" Hermione's eyes went wide as she tried to comprehend the flood of words that just rushed at her.

"Also, I'm sure if you can fly through walls, it would have been in Hogwards: A hist-"

Hermione stopped mid-sentence.

Harry Potter had disappeared.

"Congratulations to *Gryffindor* for winning the house cup!"
