For fourth year, you might be able to clip into the quiddich pitch, then go to the center of the ungrown maze, which is allowed because normally the tournament officials have spawned by this point and they stop you from entering the maze early. Then it's just a matter of summoning the cup immediately, which takes you to the ending cutscenes and skips the boss fight entirely.

For fifth year, the final event happens in Dumbledore's office, and no other events take place in there (that I remember), so clipping into that should end the year. Actually, now that I remember it, you see the entrance to the DoM really early on, so clipping into it then quickly exiting it might trigger the Dumbledore/Voldemort cutscene and trigger the end of year like that.
