// Last one (Maybe?) Unfortunately, the ending triggers for books 4-7 are all outside. The devs clearly watched the speedruns.//

"Harry, can you PLEASE take the practice seriously? The snitch is no where near the tower. This is Oliver's last chance to win the Quidditch cup before he graduates!" Ron moaned.

"Also, if he doesn't win the cup, I'm sure he will fail his exams on purpose and I'll never get a spot on the team."

"Harry, are you... Doing that thing again?" Hermione asked, catching on a lot quicker this time.

Harry let out a grunt of frustration.

"The what thing?" Ron asked

Harry looked at Hermione, waving his hands to allow her to explain.

"Harry is doing that thing where school suddenly ends. Again."

"They got smarter and placed the end triggers in a place outside the castle, where you cannot get to until the event with Sirus Black getting kissed by Dementors happens." Harry complained.

"That's a good thing!" Hermione said. "He was a mass murderer!"

"He's also my godfather whose innocence will only be known to the world when he is dead."

"Wait, that's terrible!" Hermione exclaimed.

Harry shrugged, before continuing.

"The only time we get out of the castle is during this one Quidditch practice before our one match. If I fly at a precise angle straight into an angled wall, I will go straight into the room where Sirus Black is supposed to be."

"Flying at a high speed towards a wall? Won't that kill you?" Ron asked, concern for his best friend clear in his voice.

"Nah, it's a sloped wall." Harry dismissed his issues.

"I'll have a quick set of dialogue with my godfather. He then flies away because the Hippogriff that was supposed to be there, isn't. We then watch the ending cutscene of him flying majestically in the sky by himself, and then we are done for this year."

Hermione nods.

"That makes sense."

"What? How?" Ron looked at his friends as if they were insane.

"Anyway, what do you say to your godfather, Harry? This is the first time you are seeing him right?" Hermione asked.

"No idea. I typically take a sip of water or read my mails when he is talking."

"Well, good luck Harry. I'll be packing my stuff. Let's go Ron." Hermione turns to leave, dragging an extremely confused Ron with her.

As Hermione and Ron were approaching the castle doors, a familiar voice boomed across the school.

"Congratulations to *Gryffindor* for winning the house cup!"
