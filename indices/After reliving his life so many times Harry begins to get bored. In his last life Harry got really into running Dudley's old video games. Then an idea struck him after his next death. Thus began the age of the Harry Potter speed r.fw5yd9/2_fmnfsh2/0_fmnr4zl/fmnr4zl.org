"Harry, can you at least pretend to care about the Polyjuice potion? This is a very dedicate potion that even renowned potion masters consider difficult to create!" Hermione chidded Harry, as she looks through her notes to decide the next ingredients to add.

Ignoring her, Harry went to the nearby wall with a book in hand, and began jamming the book into the wall.

"Oy mate." Ron exclaimed. "Have you lost your mind?"

Realising what Harry is trying to do, a look of realisation slowly dawned on Hermione's face. She quietly puts her ingredients back into her bag.

"Ron, Harry did this... thing last year. I don't know what he did, but the school year immediately ended."

"Have you lost your mind? I thought we were going to brew the polyjuice and get proof that Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin!"

"This game. Seesh.", said Harry, as he continued to jam a book into the wall.

"This is just so inconsistent."

"For those of us who are watching, confused, do you mind explaining?" asked Hermione, ever the bookworm.

Harry stopped what he was doing, and looked at his two friends.

"What I'm doing is called "Prop clip". Long story short, I'll go through this wall here since this is the first time I get access to Myrtle's toilet, but the event trigger to open the door isn't activated yet."

"However, we can still go through the door, go straight down to the chamber of secrets."

"Since we are still on chapter 10, Hermione isn't petrified yet. So the trigger for Ginny to appear in the chamber doesn't exist."

"Wait, Ginny? My sister?" the volume of Ron's voice growing in the same pace as his concern.

Ignoring him, Harry continued.

"Since Ginny doesn't spawn in the chamber, previous Voldemort doesn't spawn as well. This skips a 15 minute dialogue which I had to previously sit through all the time until we found this clip"

"More importantly, this means that the Basilisk's spawn cannot be triggered. With no Basilisk in the chamber with me, the game thinks that I have defeated it, and thus the final cutscene is triggered."

"It's all posted in our very friendly discord.", finished Harry, as he turned around and began slamming the book into the wall again.

"Uh mate, did the girl's loo scramble your brains?" Ron sputtered. Looking for help beside him, Hermione gave none as she simply shrugged.

"Look mate, Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin! I know it! That slimy snake..." Ron stopped mid-sentence as Harry suddenly disappeared through the wall.

A sense of deja vu slowly crept up Hermnione's neck.

"Congratulations to *Gryffindor* for winning the house cup!"
