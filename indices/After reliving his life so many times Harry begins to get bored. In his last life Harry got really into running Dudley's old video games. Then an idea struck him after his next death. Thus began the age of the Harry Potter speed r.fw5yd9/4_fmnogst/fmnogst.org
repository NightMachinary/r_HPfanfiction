This prompt reminds me of this one fic I read a while back where Harry beat canon so many times he turned it into a speed run until the hat offered him the chance to go to a harder universe. Then he ended up in a world where the school rivalry was between Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff rather than w/ Slytherin. Then Cedric Diggory released the "monster of Hufflepuff" and the experience was so horrific that the surviving members of Hogwarts ended up transferring to Beauxbatons. (Putting this up here in the hopes that maybe somebody can rec it so OP and others can enjoy, but also because it was an absolutely crazy plot.)
