linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina) Luna doesn't become a huge part of the story until later, but the amount of murder she does certainly qualifies as evil. all the content warnings.

linkffn(Lady of the Lake by Colubrina) not as evil/dark, but convoluted and supporting evil!Hermione. once again, Luna isn't the main character in this, but her part is interesting. there's a lot of Ron bashing, Molly bashing, and Ginny bashing in this.

linkffn(It's Always The Quiet Ones by PixelWriter1) oneshot, Luna unleashes eldritch horrors upon Hogwarts
