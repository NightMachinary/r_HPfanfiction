We do celebrate it, but not nearly as much. I gather Halloween is a BIG thing in the US; my friend in Orlando gets excited every year for a bunch of themed haunted houses and sends me vids of tons of people walking about in costume and stuff. Seems to go on all October.

It's a lot smaller in England. Kids trick-or-treat, and there might be parties, but it's a much smaller holiday.
