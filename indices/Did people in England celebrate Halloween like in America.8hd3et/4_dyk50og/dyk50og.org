It depends on the era and the location.

My father grew up in the late sixties, early seventies and Guy Fawkes was a much bigger deal (Penny for the Guy, Bonfires, Fireworks, Parties). Halloween had some rumblings but really took off in the late 80's and early 90's, with our parties being some of the early ones in our area. In Northern Ireland (where my mother is from), street parties were more common than going trick or treating.

It's all going to depend on area too. While we do a massive Halloween thing at our house, our house is known for it as the Halloween house because no one else really does it to our degree. around 50/50 on trick or treaters, 60/40 around here because there's many elderly people and many people who just won't answer the door in general. Eggs and flour are restricted substances in many shops in the lead up, and become 18+ only. There are a lot more trick or treaters now, though. We used to do 40 'goodie bags' and have some leftover. Last year, we hit 140.
