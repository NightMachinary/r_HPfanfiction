Oh damn then, maybe it's because I'm from Scotland, I just assumed England was the same. Every single year we have Halloween here and it's very big. In fact my local town celebrates it on the last Friday before the 31st. (Instead of the 31st) lots of kids used to double dip for sweets on the friday, and then on the 31st they'd go to another town or a city to get extra sweets lol.

Of course adult parties are big also, booze and an excuse to dress up in fancy dress.
