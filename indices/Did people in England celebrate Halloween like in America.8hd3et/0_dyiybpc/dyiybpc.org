Yeah they do.

Halloween predates the founding of America.

It's said to be from an old celtic holiday, Samhain. It's probably Scottish in origin. (Which is probably why JK Rowling used it as she's obsessed with Scotland irl. By used it I mean have a lot of events conspire around the 31st of October.)

Robert Burns actually has a poem named Halloween which he made in 1785, if you don't know who he is, he wrote, Auld Lang Syne.
