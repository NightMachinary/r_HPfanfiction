Just for another perspective, which may or may not be similar to the UK, I'm from Australia.

I didn't hear about Halloween existing until year 7 and none of my friends ever did anything. When my younger sister was in year 7 six years later her friends went trick or treating that year and the next two but that was pretty much it.

At university, colleges will throw a party as will each faculty's student group.

As an adult living in the suburbs there's about 1 in 10 houses with some cheap decorations up, the supermarkets sell lollies 1/2 price and have a half of one side of an aisle dedicated to halloween. The people that give out lollies rarely dress up themselves, where I lived someone posts out flyers each year letting everyone know that trick or treating is from 6-7pm and to put up a small decoration on your mailbox if you're participating. Most of the trick or treaters were 10 or under accompanied by their parents and maybe 25% of the people were young teens in small groups who looked like dressing up and going to the houses was a chore that paid in lollies.

It definitely seemed like american movies and television was the only reason Halloween made any ground here but now the young kids are growing up with more and more american shows so they really want to go around. It's not seen as a particularly fun activity by teens and it's just a costume party, at a bar or someone's sharehouse, but with a horror theme for uni students and then it's just remembering to buy a couple cheap decorations and some lollies as an adult.

Not every suburb would have trick or treaters though, only the more family oriented ones. People living in most suburbs could easily never know it was halloween.

Back in the 1990s I'd never heard of halloween at all though (born in 1991).
