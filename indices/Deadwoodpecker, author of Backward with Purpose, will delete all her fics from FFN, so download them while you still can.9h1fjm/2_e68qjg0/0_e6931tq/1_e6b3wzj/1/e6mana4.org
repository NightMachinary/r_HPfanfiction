I know this is an older post, but I can assure you that no one wanted her to take anything down üôÅ. Everyone is in agreement that she is absurdly talented and an asset to the fanfiction community. Deleting fanfic was entirely her choice, and it doesn't look like she's going to do that anyway. (And it's just my opinion, but I feel she welcomed everyone into her personal life by inviting the entire H/G subreddit to friend her on Facebook. If she'd intended true privacy, all of this could have been avoided.)
