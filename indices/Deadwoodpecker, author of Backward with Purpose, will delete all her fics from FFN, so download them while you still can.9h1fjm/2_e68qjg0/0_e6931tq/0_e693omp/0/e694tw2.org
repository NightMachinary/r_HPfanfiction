There's no thread as far as I'm aware - as I understand it she had a Facebook page that she shared with fans, where she out up pictures of her husband and children. At some point on the Facebook page or a discord channel or something, someone revealed that the photos had been stolen from neighbours and friends. I didn't see any of the drama myself, mind, so this is all second hand.
