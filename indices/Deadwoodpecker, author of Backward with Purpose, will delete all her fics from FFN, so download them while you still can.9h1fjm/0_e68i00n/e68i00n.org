I don't understand why authors do this. It happens a bunch with game mods as well, they get tired of the work and somehow deleting stuff is an answer to their problem?

The internet means it still exists, all that is accomplished is making your work less accessible to those who wish to enjoy it. Instead of linking someone to fanfic.net we resort to bootleg .epub file downloads which may not work in a few years when someone stumbles across them.
