As someone who has deleted works off FF.net, for me the reason was simply that I no longer liked those works. I don't mind them floating around the internet, but I don't want to advertise them either.

It's essentially the same reason as why people don't upload awful pictures of themselves and set them as their profile pic on social media. Some might call this vanity; I prefer to think of it as image management ;)
