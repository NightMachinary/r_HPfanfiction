Hm. Personally, I am staunchly against the "right" of artists to keep their works from the public. If you put it out once, you have no right to take it back and deprive people who /did/ enjoy it of it. This goes for fanfiction as much as for movies, television, books, etc.

(I believe there ought to be a law where if the copyright-holder of a book or movie or music hasn't made that item available to the public in fifteen years, they'd lose the right to do so for a year while some government agency would make them available online for a small, set price. If at the end of the year they're ready to rerelase it /themselves/ it'll be taken off the government site.)

I have a fic I wrote years ago that is /terrible/, but it's receiving some positive reviews even now and out of respect for the posters thereof, I've kept it up, with an added Author's Note at the beginning saying "I'm keeping this up because of my principles but yes, I know, not that great... here are the titles of some other, newer fics of mine you should probably be reading instead".
