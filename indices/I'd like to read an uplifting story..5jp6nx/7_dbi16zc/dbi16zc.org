*Part 2*

linkffn(2732391) has dark humor. linkffn(10295029; 3268063; 1662773) are fluffy, as is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4551745/1/Betelgeuse][Betelgeuse]], which is pronounced "beetlejuice".

linkffn(4562496; 9341068; 7836497; 3774124; 3689325; 3515127; 5769888; 4588140; 899503; 278213; 3157379) have no pairings.

The crossovers I know of that are light and fluffy are linkffn(7006036; 8316155; 11554161; 2900912; 7483805; 5474040). linkffn(7033463) has a series of short fics to accompany it. All of them are wonderful, and it remains my favorite Supernatural crossover fic.
