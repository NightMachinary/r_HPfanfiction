*Part 1*

First off, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994953/Ava-Miranda-Dakedavra][Ava Miranda Dakedavra]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1798349/cathedral-carver][cathedral carver]] both write good humor.

There's linkffn(8035176) that is a little OOC but has funny introductions. I found Harry and Ron to be pretty funny in linkffn(4564029).

linkffn(3737967; 5665397; 4657205; 9426374; 6982913; 6201195; 6084154; 7468770; 4230888; 3632659; 2217444; 2774683; 988687) are all hilarious. And because I can't remember how many fics the bot can call forward in one parentheses, there are also linkffn(6975743; 10598969; 11323128; 4093690; 11565260; 7512124; 1963887; 6286999; 4213464; 11187179; 7554031; 6059628; 3203150; 8412548)
