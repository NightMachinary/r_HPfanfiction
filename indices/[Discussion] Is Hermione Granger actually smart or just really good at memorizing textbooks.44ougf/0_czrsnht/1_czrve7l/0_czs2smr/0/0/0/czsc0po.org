1.  McGonagall's Chess Game
2.  Privet Drive + Flying Car
3.  Aragog's Nest
4.  Entering Chamber of Secrets, /with a broken wand/
5.  Shrieking Shack
6.  First part of 4th year: A case of jealousy overriding his brain. They were /14/.
7.  Department of Mysteries
8.  Guarding the school the night of Dumbledore's death
9.  Getting Harry out of Privet Drive for the last time
10. Going on the Horcrux Hunt.
11. It's funny, but people forget that when he left during the Horcrux Hunt, it was because of the Horcrux's influence, and he would have returned right away except for apparating into a group of Snatchers. Harry and Hermione had already left by the time Ron excaped the Snatchers. Leaving briefly = Ron's fault. Being gone for more than a few minutes = not Ron's fault.
12. Being able to use the deluminator to find Harry and Hermione's position, if not them directly.
13. Diving into a frozen pond in winter, covered in his clothing, to save Harry.
14. And every-damn-thing else in the series.
