McGonagall's Chess Game -- his only ability. Chess and Quidditch. And he never take a part even in school-wide chess tournament.

Privet Drive + Flying Car -- no danger, just fun. If he really care about Harry, he need to ask his parents for help. Or older brothers - NOT Fred and George.

Aragog's Nest -- most stupid idea. Why they do not take brooms with them? Actually, any sane wizard will always carry broom with him.

Entering Chamber of Secrets, with a broken wand -- to find his own sister. And (good to him) doesn't face any real danger.

Shrieking Shack -- he doesn't enter it himself, he was dragged here.

First part of 4th year: A case of jealousy overriding his brain. They were 14. -- idiot.

Department of Mysteries -- idiots.

Guarding the school the night of Dumbledore's death -- no real danger. Or someone will be killed. Probably Hogward wards protect students, and will react to student murder. So Death Eaters do not really use letal spells. Or not target them.

Getting Harry out of Privet Drive for the last time - idiots. Polyjuse and taxi. Man Eve Moddy visits, transfigure Harry to weasel and take with him in his packet.

Going on the Horcrux Hunt -- and eating all food. Moreover, do nothing here.

It's funny, but people forget that when he left during the Horcrux Hunt, it was because of the Horcrux's influence, and he would have returned right away except for apparating into a group of Snatchers. Harry and Hermione had already left by the time Ron excaped the Snatchers. Leaving briefly = Ron's fault. Being gone for more than a few minutes = not Ron's fault. -- left (or run) in wartime - usually means desertion with appropriate punishment. May be, you remember film - but in book, they left not immediatelly, but at least few hours later.

Being able to use the deluminator to find Harry and Hermione's position, if not them directly -- do you understand, that Dumbledore really do not belive in Ron, so he need to give him specially crafted tracker for Harry? Because if deluminator can find anybody, Dumbledore must use it to find Voldemort ten years ago. So it is crafted to track Harry.

Diving into a frozen pond in winter, covered in his clothing, to save Harry - idiots. Both.

I do not see any loyality here. Bravery and Stupidity, nothing else.

Neville Longbottom is loyal - not Ron.
