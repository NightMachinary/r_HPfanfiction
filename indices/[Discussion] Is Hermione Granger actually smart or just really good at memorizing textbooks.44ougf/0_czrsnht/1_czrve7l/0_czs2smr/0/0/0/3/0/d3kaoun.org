It seems like you are seriously confused about what the topic of the discussion is about here. It's about LOYALTY and how Ron was willing to risk his own life to help out his friends, not about whether those ideas are good or not, or maybe you do know what the topic is about but is just looking for whatever way you can to twist and distort the truth from the canon.

  McGonagall's Chess Game -- his only ability. Chess and Quidditch. And he never take a part even in school-wide chess tournament.
#+end_quote

The point is he sacrificed himself so that his friends can go ahead and try to stop Snape from obtaining the Stone. If that's not loyalty then I don't know what it is. There might not be any chess tournaments? Remember it was the best game of chess played at Hogwarts over many years

  Privet Drive + Flying Car -- no danger, just fun. If he really care about Harry, he need to ask his parents for help. Or older brothers - NOT Fred and George.

  Aragog's Nest -- most stupid idea. Why they do not take brooms with them? Actually, any sane wizard will always carry broom with him.

  Entering Chamber of Secrets, with a broken wand -- to find his own sister. And (good to him) doesn't face any real danger. Department of Mysteries -- idiots.

  Guarding the school the night of Dumbledore's death -- no real danger. Or someone will be killed. Probably Hogward wards protect students, and will react to student murder. So Death Eaters do not really use letal spells. Or not target them. Getting Harry out of Privet Drive for the last time - idiots. Polyjuse and taxi. Man Eve Moddy visits, transfigure Harry to weasel and take with him in his packet.

We are talking about his loyalty, NOT whether what he did was a good idea. Yes, some of his actions were not very smart, but it's mostly because HARRY or someone else was making the decisions not himself, don't you get that? It is clear that those adventures are very dangerous and potentially life threatening. For example, the facts there are potentially Death Eaters involved in HBP and he will actually need to fight Death Eaters and you can say there are no real danger just because nobody died (Dumbledore?) with a straight face? Really? Under those circumstances, did Ron ever ran away in fear of his own life? No, he went ahead because he was loyal to his friends. You seem to be just trying to twist and distort everything he do and dismiss them with lies. Seriously hate him all you like but don't make up lies about him like he's not loyal.

  Shrieking Shack -- he doesn't enter it himself, he was dragged here.

You seemed to have forgotten what Ron said to Sirius when he thought Sirius was trying to kill Harry or you're deliberately not mentioning it in your hate.

  First part of 4th year: A case of jealousy overriding his brain. They were 14. -- idiot.
#+end_quote

What he did wasn't great for sure, but remember Harry also did not behave that well either?

#+begin_quote
  Going on the Horcrux Hunt -- and eating all food. Moreover, do nothing here. It's funny, but people forget that when he left during the Horcrux Hunt, it was because of the Horcrux's influence, and he would have returned right away except for apparating into a group of Snatchers. Harry and Hermione had already left by the time Ron excaped the Snatchers. Leaving briefly = Ron's fault. Being gone for more than a few minutes = not Ron's fault. -- left (or run) in wartime - usually means desertion with appropriate punishment. May be, you remember film - but in book, they left not immediatelly, but at least few hours later.

Ron did nothing on the trip? Hmm, let's see what he did... 1) Discovering the Taboo and saving all their lives 2) Leading the Trio when Harry abandoned the quest 3) Supplied his friends with lots of information about the wider wizarding world which helped a lot with maintaining morale Yes he didn't return until the next morning that was because he was held by the Snatchers all the time beforehand and apparated to the wrong place. It does not mean that he did not intend to return immediately, thus you point has no relevancy whatsoever. Harry also goaded him into leaving which you didn't bother to mention. Remember even though the Weasleys were considered blood traitors, they were STILL allowed to go about their daily lives because they are pure-bloods so Voldemort does not impact them as much as Harry and Hermione. It makes Ron's decision to go on the mission even more heroic than the other 2 because he DID NOT HAVE TO. This is what loyalty means, risking your life to help out your friends even when you didn't have to.

  Diving into a frozen pond in winter, covered in his clothing, to save Harry - idiots. Both. I do not see any loyality here. Bravery and Stupidity, nothing else.
#+end_quote

Harry was being stupid by not considering that he might drown in the pond, Ron was being brave and loyal because he dived into the freezing pond to try to save his best mate even though he might be killed himself. Clear?

EDIT: I should probably add that stupidity and loyalty are not mutually exclusive as you seem to be implying, just because Ron might have done some stupid actions (and Ron is actually NOT stupid) doesn't mean he's not loyal.
