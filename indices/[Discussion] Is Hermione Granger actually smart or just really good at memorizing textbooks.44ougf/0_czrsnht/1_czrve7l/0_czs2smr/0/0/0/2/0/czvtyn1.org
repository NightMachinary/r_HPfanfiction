1.  If he didn't think Harry going forward to be worth it, if he wasn't a loyal friend, he wouldn't have sacrificed himself.
2.  Once again, loyalty to/with Harry led him to lead his brothers on an illegal, potentially International Statute of Secrecy violating rescue mission in an enchanted Muggle artifact of dubious legality
3.  Loyally followed Hagrid's words and went with Harry into a nest of giant, terrifying versions of his /worst/ fear.
4.  Loyalty to his family and friend led him to joining Harry in plunging the depth's of Slytherin's secret chamber with a malfunctioning wand.
5.  Standing up in defense of his best friend against someone he thought to be an insane criminal while on a broken leg. How isn't that loyalty?
6.  This is a conflict of loyalty, inspired by him believing his best friend to have betrayed/misled him. Because he was /14/, and like all teenagers (all teenagers, for all time) a hormone-driven nincompoop.
7.  Went with his friends into certain mortal danger (they thought /Voldemort/ was in the DoM, remember?) to rescue another friend. Loyalty.
8.  Guarded the school because his friend asked him to.
9.  Supported/protected his friend by being his double in a risky extraction plan.
10. His strong feeling of support to Harry led him to accompany Harry on a multiple-Horcrux hunt.
11. A cursed Horcrux locket overrode his loyalty to his friend momentarily, causing him to leave, and bad luck kept him from returning, not a lack of loyalty to said friend.
12. Love and loyalty to his friend's is what allowed the deluminator to take him to Harry's and Hermione's approximate location at least twice.
13. Loyalty led him to dive into the frozen-ass pond to save his friend, like a loyal dog rescuing its child owner from drowning.
14. Every. Damn. Thing. Else. In. The. Series.

And don't forget that the definition of loyalty according to Merriam-Webster is:

#+begin_quote
  a feeling of strong support for someone or something
#+end_quote

Which every item on that list is a result of, or in two cases a conflict in regards to.

EDIT: I feel like ranting. My whole damn point earlier is that even though they are Gryffindors, Harry, Ron and Hermione exhibit the traits of all the different Houses. Harry is strongly Slytherin, Hermione strongly Ravenclaw and Ron strongly Hufflepuff. Of course, Harry is also loyal to his friends like a Hufflepuff. Hermione can be extremely cunning (second year, Polyjuice Potion) and when it comes to something he is interested in, Ron can be very intelligent (chess, Quidditch [being a fan of a bad team isn't an intelligence thing, so don't even try arguing that]) and isn't intelligence a trait Ravenclaw admires? The lines between the Houses aren't absolute, and this is where the vast fucking majority of fanfictions go to utter fucking shit and make characters one-dimensional caricatures of what House they're sorted into. The Sorting Hat seems to put students into Houses based not just on the traits they have, but on the ones they hold important. Take Neville for example. Tons of fucking awful fics bring up the point that early on he seems to be more of a Hufflepuff than a Gryffindor, yet to him bravery and courage are things he admires and wishes to be.

*tl;dr* Adding Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin as adjectives to bravery, loyalty, intelligence and sneakiness/cunning respectively is Neanderthal non-subtle, childishly stupid and people should stop doing that.
