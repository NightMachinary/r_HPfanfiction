Yes, I totally agree with you! The Trio are all too complex to be able to fit unquestionably into one House. Just because they are all Gryffindors does not mean they do not display behaviour that are consistent with that from other houses. I could also add that Hermione also has some Slytherin (resourcefulness when she is given time to plan something) and Hufflepuff (loyalty) qualities.
