Interestingly, if you look at the main three, you'll notice something interesting. Across Harry, Ron and Hermione all the Hogwarts Houses are represented. Obviously there is Gryffindor where they were sorted. There is Slytherin, where the Hat would have put Harry. Hermione could have been a Ravenclaw. And Ron has the loyalty of a Hufflepuff. Their conflicts and challenges also relate to these secondary (as I think of it) house alignments they have. Harry struggles with various secrets (of Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, himself) and ambitions (Voldemort's). Hermione's are those of knowledge (house-elves, Half-Blood Prince's books, existence/importance of Hallows). And Ron's are of loyalty (4th year, leaving in /DH/ due to the locket's influence and his troubles in joining back up).

The story wouldn't work without Hermione there to balance out the Trio.
