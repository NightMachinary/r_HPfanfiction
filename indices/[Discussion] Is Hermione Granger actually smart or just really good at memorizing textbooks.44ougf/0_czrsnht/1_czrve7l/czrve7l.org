Honestly, I find you judging her on the basis of not finding bubble-head charm rather unfair. I think that she would have undoubtedly found it was it not for the story requiring Barty Crouch Jr aiding Harry to win the competition.

If anything, she was realistic and often the voice of reason of the trio.
