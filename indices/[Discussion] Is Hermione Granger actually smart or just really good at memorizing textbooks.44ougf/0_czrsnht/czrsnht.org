She is smart, but fanfiction exaggerates her abilities a hundredfold. If she can't even find the Bubble-Head Charm, despite scouring the library for spells that can help you breathe underwater, then she's not going to uncover any ancient Egyptian rituals like fanfiction has her do so often. She also has a very unintelligent tendency to dismiss certain magical matters as fables, /despite only learning several years prior that magic exists/.
