I am not going to try to provide a credible interval for Hermione's IQ, but here's another data point that hasn't come up so far. In her second year, Hermione spent a bit more than a month in the Hospital wing after taking Polyjuice with cat hair. Harry and Ron brought her her homework, and didn't seem to have any trouble keeping up. Then, she got petrified for almost a month. She /still/ did well enough in class to be allowed a Time-Turner load.

And, while she burned out in her third year, she wasn't only taking more classes than physically possible, she was also trying to master a completely foreign legal system, from books. (Harry and Ron stopped after one trip to the library, IIRC. Hermione persisted.)
