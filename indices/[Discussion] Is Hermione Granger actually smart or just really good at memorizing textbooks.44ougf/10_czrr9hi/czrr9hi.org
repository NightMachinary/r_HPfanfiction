Both, some what. She memorises textbooks well and is very smart, but she's not supremely intelligent at all. Her weaknesses make it pretty apparent that she relies more on planning and being logical than taking action or being more open minded. She's bad at Quidditch and not that good at DATD when compared to her skill in other subjects. Those are two things that require more of a good reaction time than thinking slowly and keeping to a comfort zone which is what she does best. The fact that she's so against the idea of Deathly Hallows existing shows that she's too logical for her own good as well.

She's not that socially intelligent either. Goblet of Fire pretty much hammers this fact home, with the overwhelming amount of times that Harry is bothered by her reminding him that he has yet to figure out how to survive some of the deadliest stuff a student could go through. It's logical, but it's not how people work. It's also the main reason why Harry generally has more fun with Ron.

Put simply, Hermione's pro-logic, anti-instinct.
