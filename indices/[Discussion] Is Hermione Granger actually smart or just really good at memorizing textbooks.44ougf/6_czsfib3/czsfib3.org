Is she a 'creative genius' like say, a Dali, Kahlo or Mozart? Definitely not. (none of the Potter characters are).

Is she a 'scientific genius' like Darwin, Newton or Turing? Nope, there really does not seem to be a physical or mathematical pattern in magic which these characters can unlock. I don't think Dumbledore or Voldemort have that type of brain power.

Is she a philosophical genius like Socrates? A political genius like Machiavelli? A culinary genius? A military genius? A comedic genius? A circus genius?

My point is there are many types, and if you're thinking of the autism-spectrum rain-man type that can count cards in the air and note the order in which they fell then, quite clearly, no.

Could she develop the skill to become a magical genius? I think her, Bill Weasley and Percy Weasley are the ones with all the qualifications we've seen (Mirroring Dumbledore and Voldemort's OWLs and NEWT performance, having teachers gush about their abilities).

I think he has potential to be a magical force, and possibly could have been if her Ravenclaw traits were more dominant. But while Dumbledore chose the academic side later on in life and forwent power and glory and positions in politics, I think Hermione is well on her way to becoming Minister for Magic. She chose the societal impact route. Good for you nerdy girl.
