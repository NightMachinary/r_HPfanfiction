For me, what makes Hermione spectacular is her wide array of different kinds of knowledge. She was never particularly awesome at one thing, she was just really good at most things, and extremely passionate about learning and kindness. I rather think that's better than being a genius.

(Sidebar, if I was jkr, I would be sad if people thought of her as a genius, as one of the notions behind the Golden trio is to try and relate to as many children as possible.)
