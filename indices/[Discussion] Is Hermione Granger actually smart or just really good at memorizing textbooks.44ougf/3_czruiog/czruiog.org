Yes, she is very smart. We can quibble about the definition of "genius" if you want- she didn't create stuff like the Weasley twins did.

But she was consistently one of the first to understand magic in basically every topic under the sun.

She is able to APPLY that knowledge, which I think is the biggest indicator of intelligence. She figured out the monster was a basilisk before literally anyone else in the school.

She created the Cursed parchment and coins of the DA, which is implied to be very advanced.

Basically everyone who knows her says she is the brightest witch of her year.

I mean, what else do you want? She's not writing on the walls, spouting jargon about fundamental magical principles- Rowling very rarely mentions magical mechanics at all.

She's excellent at learning, at researching, in usage, and is able to apply all three of those talents to the problem at hand.
