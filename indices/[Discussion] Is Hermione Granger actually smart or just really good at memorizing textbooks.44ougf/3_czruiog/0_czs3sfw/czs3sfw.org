These are good points. I'd also point out that Hermione spent a lot of her time babysitting Harry and, to a lesser extent, Ron. Who knows how much "smarter" she'd have been if she'd had friends who supported /her/ rather than mostly relying on her support of them.

A good example we have of this is the Marauders. Remus was the 'academic' one but everyone agrees James and Sirius were very talented and smart as well, and we get the impression they all worked together on their big projects like the Map and the Animagus transformation. Perhaps not with the perfect cohesiveness of the Weasley Twins, but we get the idea they were a really effective team.

The Trio had a very different dynamic; Ron was uninterested, Harry distracted, leaving Hermione to be the mastermind behind everything from the Polyjuice Potion to the Defense Association. She even had time to start an organization pushing for the rights of House Elves, completely on her own, which her friends at most viewed with amusement, but didn't provide her any intellectual engagement on, let alone real support. And this is despite Harry having clear evidence that /some/ House Elves are abused, through his friendship with Dobby.
