I am always under the impression that Hermione was supporting Harry along with Ron because Harry just had so many problems that he really needed his friends to be mostly there to support him unless someone else like Dumbledore was doing the job. As a result Hermione never got the chance to shine herself until the war is over.

If you take a closer a look at a lot of Harry's achievements especially those that require planning or research of any kind, it's usually Hermione doing all the background work like organising the DA, doing the Horcrux research in HBP and DH, organise the Horcrux hunt trip using that beaded bag she created, etc. Harry as the hero unfortunately only seems to be there at the end every time inspecting the results and reaping the fruits of her labour but didn't do much to help out in the actual process. However, when it comes to fighting evil directly, Harry is clearly better especially given Hermione's tendency to freeze up in really dangerous situations.

Harry seems to be rather disinterested in anything not directly concerning him as long as nobody is in physical danger because he does have the heroic “saving people thing” that Hermione mentioned. Otherwise he seems to be just looking for a fun and easy life at Hogwarts. Like what you said, Harry was just as uninterested in SPEW as Ron was, even though he was brought up in the Muggle world unlike Ron meaning he was supposed to have a more negative view of slavery than Ron. By the end of the series even Ron was more interested in the house elves' welfare in general than Harry was.

I also tend to agree what comparing smart people from different generations is quite difficult to say the least considering they are facing completely problems, working with completely different friends and having completely different backgrounds. Like what beetnemesis said, it's quite difficult to conclude definitively who is more impressive: the Marauders or Hermione.
