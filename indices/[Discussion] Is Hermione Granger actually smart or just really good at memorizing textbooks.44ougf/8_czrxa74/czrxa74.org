Well, the fact is she *isn't supposed to be a genius.* Canon Hermione is intelligent, but JKR, with all three characters, shows that they aren't extremely special, but still manage to accomplish all that they did. Holding Hermione to a regular standard, she's far beyond all others of her age, in magical theory and understanding, as well as well above average in casting (112%, case in point). Someone says she couldn't find the bubble-head charm, year 4, well, it wasn't her job to help Harry, she wasn't exempt from classes. She was still attending all her class and still maintaining her position at the top of class, researching in her free time. And even then, She is extremely logical, and if you'll refer to year 6, she didn't use the HBP's instructions because she didn't see *why* they work. Overall, she is intelligent, and accomplishled far more than most others at her age.

Edit : For all people saying she's too closed minded and that she joined the wizarding world only x time ago to be forming opinions, let me point out she only doesn't believe in those tales which don't have any evidence, or mass belief from the greater part of the wizarding world, or chance of possibility. (Crumple Horned Snorcacks - only believed in by a reputably crazy family)(The Deathly Hallows : She entertained the possiblity (The Elder Wand, The cloak), and *might* even have said so for the ring if Harry wasn't so obsessed at the time, and if it wasn't for the fact that horcruxes were more important (you may say this wasn't so, but its what I like to think))
