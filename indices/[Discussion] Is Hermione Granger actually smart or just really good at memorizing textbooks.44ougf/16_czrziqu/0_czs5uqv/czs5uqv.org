I think the thing that tipped Hermione off was remembering that Harry was hearing a voice that no one else could (at least right before Mrs. Norris was attacked, though I think it happened at least one more time? Been a while since I've read /CoS/) which was not a data point that Dumbledore had.^{1} Slytherin was an incredibly talented wizard, so who knows what he could have done to make a monster that could petrify or kill.

1. This, of course, assumes that Dumbledore wasn't utilizing Legilimency on Harry. If Dumbledore was,^{2} the issue becomes one not of Dumbledore's and Hermione's intelligence, but of manipulative Dumbledore.
2. I personally find this unlikely. If we were truly dealing with a manipulative Dumbledore, Harry would have known about the Prophecy for a long time, from childhood, where he would have been indoctrinated by Dumbledore.^{3}
3. Nested footnotes!
