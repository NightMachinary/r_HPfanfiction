I asssume she is a genius, since that is how she is portrayed as. It's always tricky to deduce a character's abilities from the events in the books since the books, from volume 1 on, constantly make characters act dumber than they are so the plot works. Unless we all agree that Dumbledore is dumber than a rock for not figuring out the basilisk despite Hermione managing it, taking a broom to an emergency meeting and not the floo or apparate, making traps to keep away (or at least fool) a Dark Lord that did not stop three first years, failing to spot his old friend being replaced, etc. etc.
