  It's been nearly a decade since I read all of the original 7 Harry Potter novels and after stumbling across the fact that J.K. Rowling specifically mentioned that Harry achieved an Outstanding in the Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. while Hermione didn't

Bits and pieces of this have appeared in other posts here, but I thought I'd put them together here. A while ago, on a different forum, a bunch of posters and I tried to sort out precisely what they could have thrown at Hermione that led her to get an EE in DADA when Harry got an O. The passage in question is as follows:

    and then, on Thursday, Defence Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall.

    ‘Oh, bravo!' cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. ‘Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...'

    He leaned forwards a little.

    ‘I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point ... ?'

    Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.

    ‘Expecto patronum!'

    His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.

    ‘Excellent!' he said. ‘Very well, Potter, you may go!'

I can't take credit for this, but the best hypothesis we had (IMO) was that:

1. They had to actually banish a boggart. That's less about magical talent and skill (since they learn it in 3rd year) and more about recognizing the boggart as such and thinking under pressure. The latter is something Harry is both naturally good and experienced at, whereas Hermione isn't. She may have lost points there.
2. Patronus Charm is not taught until NEWTs if at all (which makes sense, since unless one knows Dumbledore's messenger Patronus trick, it's completely useless to almost everyone), so can't be a standard part of the OWLs: only Harry got a shot at the bonus points, and the dialogue is consistent with that. Notice that Hermione could have demonstrated one as well, given the opportunity.

So sum it up, what made the difference was not magical skill but the non-magical combat-related aptitude. That, and favoritism.
