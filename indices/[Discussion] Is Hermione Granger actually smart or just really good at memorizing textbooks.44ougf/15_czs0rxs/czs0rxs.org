First of all, you need to be smart to be able to memorize textbooks. If you have someone who isn't smart, they're not going to be able to do that. Additionally, DADA seems to be a more practical subject than many others. While knowledge is an important factor, skill, bravery, luck, are all just as important. Hermione didn't get perfect on her third year DADA exam, not because she didn't know what to do, but because she couldn't overcome her fear. (Quick recap: As part of the exam, students faced a boggart, and that was where Hermione failed) We also don't know why Hermione didn't get an O on DADA, but I think it's safe to assume she lost points on the spell casting portion. If this is the case, it's possible that the lost points where due to something other than a lack of knowledge or genius.

I also don't think that, following your definition of genius, it is at all possible to classify Hermione as one or not. The engineering student who knows tons of facts about bridges might still be a genius. Before learning or discovering any new facts, you must first have an understanding of things that have been discovered before you. Stephen Hawking is a genius, but he also would have started out learning thousands of facts and theories about stars. Since we only see Hermione in this initial learning phase, it's hard to make a decision either way. Even in fanfiction though, it's rare that Hermione fits your definition of genius, unless it's a next-gen fanfic. Usually, she's just an extremely intelligent student who knows her stuff, and that's how she is displayed in canon.
