That's just fanon Hermione. While she is obviously very intelligent, with a talent for research, and possibly an eidetic memory (or at least a very good memory), she isn't naturally gifted at everything she tries her hand at, and we see no evidence of her being creative or inventive or revolutionary in any way. <-- Edit: I concede that this statement is an exaggeration. I would rephrase as 'We see no evidence of her being inventive or creative to the /extremes/ seen in some fics.' I don't think she left school and turned the wizarding world into Sweet Valley High five minutes later (thank goodness).
