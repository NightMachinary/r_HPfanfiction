I remember Hermione as being the intellectual of the group but I now realize that I based that assumption on her doing all her homework and doing well on her exams. Unlike our school system where tests are designed to test the ability to either solve a complicated math problem or persuading a reader to change their outlook in reading/writing class, the test questions in the Harry Potter universe deal with regurgitating facts from textbooks. None of the questions mentioned in the O.W.L. required any critical thinking whatsoever.

So why is she, in your eyes, intelligent?
