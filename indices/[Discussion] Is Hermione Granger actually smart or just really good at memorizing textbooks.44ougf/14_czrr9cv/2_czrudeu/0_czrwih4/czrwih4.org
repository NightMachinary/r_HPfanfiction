There are different types of intelligence, and that's mostly why. She did well in school and she is very book smart - therefore, she is intelligent. The word 'intelligent' doesn't imply 'genius' or 'polymath', so I consider it a fair assessment. It doesn't mean she's good at everything - but it's very clear in canon that she is not /un/intelligent. A lot of smart people aren't good at critical thinking, simply because it's not where their natural intelligence lies. I don't think that makes them stupid.

Likewise, Harry and Ron are both intelligent - in completely different ways. Ron has a talent for strategy (chess), and while we have no proof that he's master level, we also don't /need/ proof of that, because not being an elite genius doesn't automatically make a person stupid. I don't care to split hairs or measure the characters' IQs, as it's enough to know that they're fairly smart people and what their strengths are. Since they're fictional, it's all academic anyway, so I don't feel very strongly about any of it - as long as authors don't start writing any of them as knuckle-dragging morons (or as omnipotent Ã¼ber-geniuses), I can accept just about any interpretation of their intelligence levels.
