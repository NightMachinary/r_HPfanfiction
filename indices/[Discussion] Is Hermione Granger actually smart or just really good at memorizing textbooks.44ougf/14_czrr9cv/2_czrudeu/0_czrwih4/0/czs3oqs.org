I totally agree with all your points, I guess what I was trying to say, but came out poorly, is why is Hermione classified as this absurd 9001 IQ monster who can solve literally any solution just because she's so smart in a good amount of fanfic?

Yes, I get that she does well on her exams but from my own personal experience, the friends I have who get hundreds on every exam are the ones who prepared heavily in advance while also cramming each and every index card of notes they made the day before. None of them will probably ever invent an entire new way of doing something like how Hermione can figure out a way to "shield electronics from magic," "figure out a way to kill the most powerful man alive with zero risk."

Again, not saying she isn't smart, sorry if it came off that way, but I'm saying she isn't "smart" like the way she is in fanfic.
