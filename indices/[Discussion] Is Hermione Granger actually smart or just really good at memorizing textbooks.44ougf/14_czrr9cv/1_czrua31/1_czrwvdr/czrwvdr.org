I don't consider her picking up most magic very quickly to be proof of her being creative or inventive, just as being prepared for class and, yes, she is very gifted in Charms class. I'm not saying she's stupid or not talented, either - she would be a Mary Sue if she was gifted at /everything/, though, and she isn't, and that's a good thing.

I always gave Harry more credit for solving the abstract problems. She provided the research, and they often collaborated, but I felt like Harry was the one putting it together when it counted. This is just a matter of opinion, but I was never really impressed with the DA's security, to be honest, so I guess I unconsciously discount it - but fair enough, that was pretty inventive.

Just to be clear, I love Hermione, she's one of my favorite characters, so I wasn't trying to say she is stupid or worthless - I just also like to guard myself against turning her into a Sue, too, so I try not to exaggerate her good /or/ bad qualities. It can be hard to stay balanced and not go too far one way or the other.
