Yes, Harry was an above average student judged by his OWL results but not at the top of the year like Hermione and he didn't do anything extraordinary at school other than flying and DADA. Perhaps if he studied harder he could have done better at school. However, I think his shining moments generally came when he was in grave danger on those dangerous adventures which is the opposite to Hermione who worked the best when she was given time to plan and research (and it doesn't have to be very long, like that time in Umbridge's office she only needed minutes to come up with the plan to lure Umbridge into the forest)
