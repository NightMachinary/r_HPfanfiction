The Protean Charm that Hermione used to create the DA coins was a NEWT level spell. We don't know whether it was a 6th year or 7th year standard spell. For all we know, it is something that was taught during the 6th year.

Not enough data to come to an accurate conclusion beyond: Hermione was skilled enough to cast an NEWT spell before taking her OWLs.
