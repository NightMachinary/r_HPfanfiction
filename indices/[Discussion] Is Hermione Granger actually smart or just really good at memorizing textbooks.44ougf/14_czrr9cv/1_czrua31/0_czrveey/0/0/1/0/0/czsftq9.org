If it was just wand motion + incantation = successful spell, Harry wouldn't have had trouble learning the Patronus (Hermione has trouble with this one too) or the summoning charm. Transfiguration would be a much simpler, easier course. Yet, in the case of Sectumsepra, Harry was able to cast it knowing the incantation, wand motion and that it is "for enemies."

From this I would posit that a successful spell is composed of this: being magical + wand motion + incantation + ? = successful spell, where the ? can be any or a combination of (but not limited to) theory to symbolic knowledge (for enemies), emotion (Patronus and [according to Bellatrix, but she's nuts] the Cruciatus) and power (so speaks Moody as played by Barty Crouch Jr.).

EDIT: Frankly, there isn't enough data to know, other than some spells are harder than others.
