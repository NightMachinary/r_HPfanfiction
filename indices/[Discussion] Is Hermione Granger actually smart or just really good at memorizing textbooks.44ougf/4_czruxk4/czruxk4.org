Until the introduction of the Deathstick, I thought it was canon that extraordinary magical ability only comes through intense study and rigorous practice. I'd imagine that Hermione has a wide vocabulary of spells, but doesn't have the time available in her busy study schedule to master every spell she comes across. This could give her the ability to cast a plethora of spells accurately at a rather intermediate level, but wouldn't give her the talent to expertly cast extraordinarily complicated spells without significant revision and failed prior attempts.

Ultimately, though, JKR had a character master - or fail to master - a specific spell only when it was vital to the narrative. It's true that there are notable gaps in her research abilities. Someone else has already mentioned that she failed to find the Bubble-Head Charm before the Second Task of the TWT. I think it's appropriate to mention her quote to some librarians regarding Madam Pince (another potential underutilised source of information):

  "I would like to apologise for you and any other librarians present here today and my get-out clause is always if they'd had a pleasant, helpful librarian, half my plots would be gone. 'Cause the answer invariably is in a book, but Hermione has to go and find it. If they'd had a good librarian, that would have been that problem solved. So ... sorry."

It seems to me that JKR very consciously left holes in Hermione's abilities not to discredit or demean her character's intelligence but to further her narrative.
