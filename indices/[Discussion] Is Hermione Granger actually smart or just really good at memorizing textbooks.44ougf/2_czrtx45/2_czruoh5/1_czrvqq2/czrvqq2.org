  What has Hermione, or even Harry done to be considered intelligent?
#+end_quote

Hermione: 100+% on a Charms exam, as someone part of the magical world for less than a year. Takes intelligence. And it's not just a fact regurgitation, but includes practical portion as well. Of her 11 OWL exams: 10 O and one E. And these tests are both theoretical (fact memorization) and practical (application/use). Takes intelligence. Not Einstein, Oppenheimer or Linus Pauling intelligence. But still real, above average intelligence. Kept her two best friends from figuring out for a whole year that she was attending classes at the exact same time. Figured out that Slytherin's Monster was a basilisk. Mastered the Protean charm (DA coins) in her 5th year. Brewed Polyjuice Potion as a second year, in a dingy, run-down bathroom.

Harry, is an interesting case. Excepting Defense against the Dark Arts, academically he would most likely be considered an average, or a bit above, student. However, when it comes to weird magic, he has an instinctual grasp that seems to be beyond anyone that we see in canon except Dumbledore and probably Grindlewald (I include Grindlewald because it is heavily implied that the only difference between Dumbledore and Grindlewald are of philosophy/character and Dumbledore being a hair more skillful). Knowing he could cast a Patronus because he saw future-Harry cast one in his past takes a... strange kind of instinctual intelligence about the nature of magic and time. Take a look back at the /Priori Incantatem/ during /GoF/. He *knew* that he had to push the bead where his magic and Voldemort's met towards Voldemort's wand, while Voldemort was confused, scared and shitting himself (figuratively). And remember, according to Dumbledore Voldemort was the most accomplished student Hogwarts has ever had. There is also Harry's instinctual recognition that the doe Patronus was friendly, while there was no evidence for it to be so. There is also, very shortly after the doe Patronus, that Harry knew that Ron had to destroy the locket because Harry understands the incalculable magic of certain acts, which is not something you would find in a textbook.

Honestly? Your OP (and especially the title) put forth a false dichotomy of "[x] is either a genius or not smart." Intelligence is a thing of degrees, different directions and there is no good way to accurately quantify intelligence (IQ is not a measurement of total intelligence, and its use as a measurement of a kind of intelligence is highly controversial).

She can memorize facts and apply them (skill at magic) while completely ignoring other parts of magic that don't match her worldview (outside of cases of abuse, house-elves don't want to be free. Discounts the possibility of the Deathly Hallows existing until Ollivander goes on his Elder Wand talk) and being socially stupid (1st year, 3rd year, 5th year, 6th year).

But yes, Hermione Granger is actually smart.
