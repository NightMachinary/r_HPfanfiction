The egg dancing was, if I remember right, the first years charm test?

The OWL for Charms at least, had both a practical portion and a written portion. We actually see Harry start taking the written portion (wand motion and incantation of the spell that makes objects fly) and the practical is montaged (he overpowered/overdid his Cheering Charm). We know from /Snape's Worst Memories/ and Harry's own OWL that the Defense against the Dark Arts OWL had a written portion (the /SWM/ OWL had a question on werewolves) and a practical involved use of defense spells.

Of the Divination OWL, we know for sure about the testing of use on Crystal Balls and tea leaves. Ancient Runes involved translation. In Potions you had to make at least one potion.

As a note: the Defense OWL did not include use of the Patronus Charm. Professor Tofty had heard that Harry could cast a corporeal Patronus, and offered extra credit if Harry could do so.

It seems clear then, that OWLs test 1. Knowledge. Of both facts (incantations, werewolf distinguishing features) and most probably theory. 2. Skill/application (use of the knowledge)
