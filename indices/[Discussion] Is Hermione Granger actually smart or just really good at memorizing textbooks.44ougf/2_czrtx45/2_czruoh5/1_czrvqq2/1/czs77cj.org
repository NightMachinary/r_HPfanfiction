The only problem I have with the O.W.L.s is that I'm not sure what that actually test. Do they test your repertoire of spells? Do they test how well you do those spells? I.E. a corporeal patronum vs. A misty shield. Do they test your ability to overcome a certain scenario using what you've learned? I remember Harry having to make an egg dance so did they grade based on the eggs dancing or how well he performed the incantation and the wand movements?
