Comparing Harry to his parents seems distinctly unfair. First, they were raised in seemingly loving and caring households. That type of upbringing gives you a leg up. Harry's confidence was utter trash, its not until later in the series that he starts to realize he has potential and acting on it.

Secondly, neither of his parents had to deal with a yearly adventure featuring one of the most dangerous dark wizards of all times. That type of thing is going to take up a lot of your time, and without very precise guidance(which Harry never had) it would probably hold you back.

Also, although James and Lily were clearly skilled with magic, we don't really have a clear idea of just how talented they were. James was obviously a generational talent at transfiguration, but Harry seems to at least match him with quidditch. And we don't know if James made the map or not, it may have all been Remus and Sirius. In all reality it was probably an accident the thing worked at all, or else they would have just made another when Filch confiscated it. Lily is 'talented'. That is all she is described as, and as she is a war hero and people are describing her to her orphaned son, it isn't unlikely they exaggerate just how wonderful she was.

I would love for Harry to have been better at magic in canon. I would have loved for canon magic to really have been fleshed out and described in detail. But I can understand why he wasn't, and thus why magic itself wasn't.
