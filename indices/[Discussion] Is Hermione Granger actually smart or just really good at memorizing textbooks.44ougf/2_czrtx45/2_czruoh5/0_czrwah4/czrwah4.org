What has Lily done to make herself into a genius? From what I recall, she was just described as a very good potions student. Of course, she's got to be fairly adept at dueling to be a part of the original Order of the Phoenix, but no evidence about her being a genius. Harry is very good at DADA, conjured a NEWT-level corporeal Patronus (that even some adults can't) at the age of 13. He's good at dueling, too, and I think he's got good enough instincts and reflexes when it comes to fighting. Not a genius by any means, but I don't think it's fair to call him 'infinitely worse' either.
