Harry is better at Quidditch, I'd say.

Hermione also made the enchanted Galleons and enchanted contract for the DA. While I don't think it would occur to Hermione to make a magical artifact like the map (absent compelling reasons), I think that because she's way busier and more driven the the Marauders and because she spends less time thinking outside the box.
