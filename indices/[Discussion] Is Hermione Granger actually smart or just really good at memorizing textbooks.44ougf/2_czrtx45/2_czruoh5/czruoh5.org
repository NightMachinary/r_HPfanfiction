Personally, I'm not a fan on the canon Harry Potter due to him being infinitely worse in every aspect than either of his parents. I'm pretty sure that you'd be hard pressed to find anything that Harry does better than either James or Lily. I consider those two, along with the rest of the Marauders and Snape to be the geniuses of their generation. Creating such an intricate and immensely useful magical artifact while still in school, using magic and combining different spells in ways never even spoken about in the franchise, speaks magnitudes to their genius. What has Hermione, or even Harry done to be considered intelligent?
