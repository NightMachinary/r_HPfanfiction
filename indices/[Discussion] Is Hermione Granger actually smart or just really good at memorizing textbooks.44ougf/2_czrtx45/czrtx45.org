Hermione Granger is a skilled, intelligent student. For proof of that, just take a look at her OWL results (and 1st year Charms exam). She's also rather clever (see figuring out that Lupin was a werewolf). But is she a genius or prodigy? I would say no, especially if you compare her to Snape (potions prodigy and Dark Arts prodigy), James Potter (animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Sirius (animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Lupin (part of creating an amazing magical artifact and I assume helped with three attaining animagus forms by 15), Wormtail (while Lupin and Black both claimed that Peter wasn't magically gifted, we cannot truly trust their opinions due to personal biases. I would argue the same thing with what McGonagall said, because that would naturally have been in comparison with the other students of the time. Also an animagus by 15, part of creating an amazing magical artifact), Grindlewald, Dumbledore and Voldemort.

If there were any of the main three that could be considered a magical genius, I would honestly put forth Harry. Look at what he has done with magic, and what he understands of magic. The first example that comes to mind is the receiving of Gryffindor's sword (as stated in DH, actions can have incalculable magical power). Then there is the ever popular example of the Patronus Charm at 13, though I am less impressed by him casting it then with his explanation to Hermione (which she didn't understand). And virtually the entirety of /Deathly Hallows/ was Harry and his instinctual grasp of deeper, strange magic.
