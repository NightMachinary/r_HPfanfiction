we have very little information on how those school tests are conducted. It could be a case of her being good at memorizing information and the testing skewed heavily toward simple fact recollection - which is a relatively big deal in a world without computers and medieval indexed information storage.

If so, she wouldn't be considered anything special in context of many intelligence measuring tools we have today.

That said 'intelligence' is often like that - it is more of a measurement of how well a persons mind is adapted to a given set of circumstances and a genius in one setting can be seen as mediocre in another if their abilities don't fit the requirements.
