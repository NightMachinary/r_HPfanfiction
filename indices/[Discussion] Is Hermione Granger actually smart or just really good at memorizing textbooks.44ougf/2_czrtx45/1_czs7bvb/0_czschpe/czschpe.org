I was not claiming *anywhere* that Hermione is a genius. I am claiming that she is, /at the very least/ academically intelligent. O's are Outstanding and E's Exceed Expectations. Even if we assume that O's are like A's and E's are like B's, 10 A's and a B on ELEVEN SIMULTANEOUS SUBJECTS is a sign of intelligence.

  we have very little information on how those school tests are conducted

We know the OWL tests contain one or both: 1. a written portion (Divination was not mentioned to have one) 2. They contain a practical portion (I don't believe that Ancient Runes and Arithmancy had a practical portion beyond the written concerning the natures of the courses)

For the tests/exams given by the Hogwarts professors, they all seem to be practical based. For potions, create a potion. For charms, cast a series of charms. Transfiguration was to transfigure something. Divination was using Divination. Remus Lupin's obstacle course. Lockhart's vanity survey does not count as an actual test. So we know that /at least/ Hogwarts professors focus on using/applying the spells and magic they have learned for a grade.
