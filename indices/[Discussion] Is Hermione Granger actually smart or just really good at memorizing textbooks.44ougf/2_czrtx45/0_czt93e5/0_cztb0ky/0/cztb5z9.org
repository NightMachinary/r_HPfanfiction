Just reread the scene... I'm not seeing it. Basically, Harry is pretty desperate at that point, dodging the basilisk's tail, praying for help:

    ‘Help me, help me,' Harry muttered wildly, ‘someone, anyone!'

    The snake's tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face. The Basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance. He rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the Basilisk's tail swung over him again.

    ‘Help me ... help me ...' Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the Hat. ‘Please help me!' There was no answering voice. Instead, the Hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.

    Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head, almost knocking him out.

So what he does is put on the hat that lands in his hand and continues to do the same thing as he was doing a moment ago, but into the hat. If someone powerful, wise, and benevolent sends you a magic hat, yeah, you put it on. What else are you going to do?
