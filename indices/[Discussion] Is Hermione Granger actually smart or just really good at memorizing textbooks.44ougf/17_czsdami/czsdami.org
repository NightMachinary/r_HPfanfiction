She reads a lot, when no one else does (at least amongst the small crosssection of people we see). That gives her some knowledge that wouldn't normally be picked up in class, but that's it really. She probably does it because she's been under the impression that as a muggleborn, she would be behind everyone else who has grown up with magic, but in trying to correct that assumption, she actually got herself ahead of the curve, since apparently there's no pureblood nerds at all (perhaps that's why Daphne is so popular?). But, being a nerd and being a genius aren't the same thing. It's a shame that she's frequently the worst written character in any given fanfic because the author is always too busy jerking off to how perfect and awesome she is and how Harry can't even take a piss without her help.
