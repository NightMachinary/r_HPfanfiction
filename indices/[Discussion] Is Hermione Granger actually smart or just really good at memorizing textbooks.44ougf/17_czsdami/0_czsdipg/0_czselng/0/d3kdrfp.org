Yes I agree that if Harry and Ron studied harder at school and were less obsessed with Quidditch then they would have done much better at school although I am still not sure they will be at the same level as Hermione who has memorised all her textbooks before the school year even started. Considering how they didn't seem to be that studious students and still achieved quite good results in OWLs, I am amazed to keep hearing people who say they are stupid.

I agree with what you said about Harry and Ron having some advantages over Hermione. However I still think though Hermione had the most advantageous family background out of the Trio. Harry although he had a huge vault of gold and was famous, but he had to live in perpetual abuse with relatives who don't love him before he found out he was a wizard. Ron has a big and loving wizard family yes, but he was also overshadowed by all his brothers and his baby sister as well as being dirt-poor for almost all of his childhood meaning he had to get everything second-handed. It was constantly implied that his parents was hoping that he was a girl which did nothing to help with his self-esteem. Hermione on the other hand was a single child from a quite wealthy family. Yes, she might not be as wealthy as Harry but considering how her parents were always able to take her to overseas holidays her family must be pretty well off. Her only disadvantage is that she had to learn the magical world by herself which can be rectified much more easily compared with the emotional problems Harry and Ron experienced and the financial problems Ron had.
