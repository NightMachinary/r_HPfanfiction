Yeah I agree, both Daphne and Fleur's names are just so much more pleasing to the ear for some reason.

Also a reason why I brought this whole thread up is that I honestly feel that if Harry or Ron actually ENJOYED researching and studying, they'd be on the same level as Hermione was portrayed to be. No offense to those who believe that everyone is born equal, but Harry and Ron have a lot of advantages in the wizarding world when compared to Hermione.

Ron has a huge family from which to draw resources and advice.

Harry is the boy who lived, that title along with his bank vault, opens so many more doors that Hermione will never get through. It's like comparing Donald Trump with that nerdy girl in your class.
