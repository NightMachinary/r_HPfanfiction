Being good at memorization is correlated with being smart in general.

She solved Snape's logic riddle.

She deduced that the monster was a basilisk and using the pipes.

She decided to use Galleons to contact DA members.

She was smart enough to handle logistical details for the Horcrux hunt.

Not as smart as Dumbledore, Voldemort, or even Snape. She's in the same level of competence as Lily Evans, or Professor Lupin. Very good, but not Great. However, she's got the work ethic of anyone in the former group, which means she can punch above her weightclass from time to time. Probably the best student in 10 years or so, imho.
