Its never said that she's a genius. Its often mentioned that she is an extraordinary student and gifted in her use of magic, but not that shes on a level of a Voldemort or Dumbledore and thanks to Rowling she never will because she became a fucking Ministry drone... /fuck the epilogue/.

Ahem... sry. Anyway, we do see her practical usage of her knowledge when she made the polyjuice, researched the basilisk, or made the DA-Coins. So we can get from that, that she is capable of applying theoretical knowledge, which is for the most part what differentiates an intelligent person from a stupid person. She gets many spells after Harry, but that could merely be her overthinking it. However, when it comes down to picking a concept apart, Hermione Granger is the one to go to.

Also, many people forget that there is no such thing as "total innovation". Even the greatest minds - Newton, Da Vinci, Einstein,..., took inspiration from others. Mankind invents by remixing. True genius are just able to take from very abstract places. It has been like this since the first human connected the dots between lighting and flint being smashed together.
