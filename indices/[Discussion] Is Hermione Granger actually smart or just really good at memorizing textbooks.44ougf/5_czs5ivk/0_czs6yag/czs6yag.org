Correct me if I'm wrong but, wasn't there a whole war going on during the time the Marauders were in school? James and Lily died at the age of 21 and the first war lasted for a decade if I remember correctly. All of their family members died during this time so it's not hard to imagine that they were in a situation similar to the one experienced by the Hogwarts students that remained in school during the seventh book.
