For the people who say the trio was much less gifted and did less stuff than the Marauders (map, animagus transformation), well, I'm sure the Marauders didn't have their time taken up by such pesky things as basilisks and the Triwizard tournament, not to mention Voldemort's direct interest in Harry.

Who knows, if they'd had a peaceful schooltime, they may all have become Animagi, too, or created something as powerful as the map.
