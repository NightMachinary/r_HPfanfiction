Canon Hermione is a typical "an excellent pupil". In Russian, where is a name for such girls: 'отличница'. Literally - someone who get only 'outstanding' marks. It's typically girl from good family, with parents able to spend some money and time on children, and motivated for studying. Get highest marks in all subjects, make perfect homework but rarely have talent in anything specific. Usually such girls can't apply even basic learned skills outside of classroom, so Hermione is one of the best.

She looks like genius in comparison to lazy idiots like Ron and Harry.

It's more or less clear from her Outstanding OWL on Wizarding History, and attempt to take Muggle Studies in third year.

Spending days to actually remember all historical facts is useless if you are not planning to become professional historian - it's much better to read some history books to get a common 'feeling' and learn facts up to Acceptable level, spending extra hours to get better in really useful subjects.

Muggle Studies is useless to muggle-raised, and if you are 'just curious' how wizards learn about muggles - just read the book and, may be, visit one or two lessons in spare time. No, it's clearly attempt to get one more O in OWL/NEWT exams.
