Depends, if we go with the compulsion route Vernon definitely doesn't have the willpower or the intellect to resist (specially if Harry warns the diary to not seem strange); if it doesn't have a compulsion then I guess Tom would be able to bait/trick him into it, like, presenting itself as the perfect target since it has to take whatever insult and indignity Vernon throws at him without any way of retaliating or means to ask for help, alternatively it could appeal to Vernon's more greed/prideful side by helping him in manipulating his bosses and co-workers and flattening him with empty praises.
