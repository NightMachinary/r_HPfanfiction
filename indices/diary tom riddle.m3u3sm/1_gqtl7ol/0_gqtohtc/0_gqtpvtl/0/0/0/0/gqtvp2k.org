The order? Depends, Petunia would probably get a bit more attention, but unless Dudley also died (negating the protections) they would probably not investigate that deep, they /do/ have more things to do with their time. If it is Vernon I can see everyone (including Miss Figgs so it doesn't even get passed forward as a serious matter) just chalking it up to a heart-attack/obesity-related healthy problem and not investigating /at all/.

Not sure if the ministry even keeps tabs on the Dursley's, chances are that they would only even be aware of called there for some reason, and even then the information would probably take it's time climbing the bureaucratic ladders and passing through gossip at the speed of light but become progressively more outlandish to the point that by the time it gets to someone interested the story is just plainly too wild to be taken seriously.

Depending on the time Voldemort would probably hear about the death from either Lucius, Severus or the mind-link with Harry. Depending on how much he hears his reaction could be anything from shrugging and moving on with his business up to sending Lucius on a cruciatus-induced vegetative state and trying to get the diary on his side (with or without success).
