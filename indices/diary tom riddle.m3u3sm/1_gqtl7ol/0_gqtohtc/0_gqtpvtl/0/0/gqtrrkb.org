Unless the diary got Harry to spell it so Vernon doesn't notice it is magic? Like, some kind of notice-me-not specifically for the fact that it is magical paired with a compulsion to write on it maybe? Alternatively it could go to Petunia to write her gossips and Tom keeps himself from being too obviously magical, only tweaking what Petunia writes so it becomes more scandalous while she isn't looking, it could probably get himself a body by the end of the summer and nothing of worth would be lost.
