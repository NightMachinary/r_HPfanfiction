I've felt this several times throughout my life, actually. I started reading fanfiction when I was twelve. And I've looked back several times, and I believe it's the same reason a lot of people don't get tattoo's, "I look back and think I was an idiot five years ago. In five years from now, I'll think I was an idiot." Our tastes change and we mature or just change as a person because of circumstances. That being said, I still enjoy linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) even years later.
