Had to look it up- I first was introduced to it somehow around 4 years ago with the Northumbrian stories (Tales of the Battle was the first thing I read). Probably just because I never have enough time to read all that I want to. You can see large gaps in between me adding stories on my favorites list through those 4 years and that's usually when I got into some series or other books (also a bit of an amateur historian with a focus on early U.S. history so I read a lot of nonfiction books from that era).

I've got 9 WIPs that I'm reading right now, 5 of those are updated weekly so they keep me happy and I like to watch this sub for others that are worth reading.
