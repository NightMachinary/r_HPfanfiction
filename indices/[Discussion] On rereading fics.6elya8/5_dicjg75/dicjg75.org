I've re-read Carnivorous Muffins Lily and the Art of Sisyphus a few times, I re-read a lot of esama's and Tsume Yuki's works as well. I like going back and re-reading fics, especially one-shots. I'm more likely to re-read fics from other fandoms though, just because I know the HP ones pretty well or I need a break from them.
