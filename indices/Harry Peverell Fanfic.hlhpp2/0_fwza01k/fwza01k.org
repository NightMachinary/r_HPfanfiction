Technically, it's a fem!Harry, but it's otherwise exactly what you asked - The Last Peverell, by animerocker646. Basically, she keeps trying to save Modern Magicals and they keep fucking themselves over, so she's sent back even further in time to the Marauder's era to get a headstart on Magical Self-Annihilation.
