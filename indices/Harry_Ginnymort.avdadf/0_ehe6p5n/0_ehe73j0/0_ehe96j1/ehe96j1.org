A much older Harry would later reflect that ever since the inexplicable collapse of the Death Eaters and the disappearance of Voldemort himself, his life seemed rather blessed.

He was immediately accepted to any job he applied for, and interviews seemed more formalities than anything else.

Political opponents and general media shit stirrers never persisted for long. The latter would often go so far as to make public apologies.

Hell, even that one asshole who broke his arm in one of the amateur quidditch league games soon suffered an accident that left him with a permanent physically debilitating injury, making it impossible to ride a broom.

Harry could never quite pinpoint when his luck did its complete reversal, but when he was feeling particularly sentimental he liked to think that it must have been the day of his very first date with the girl who would in time become his perfect wife.
