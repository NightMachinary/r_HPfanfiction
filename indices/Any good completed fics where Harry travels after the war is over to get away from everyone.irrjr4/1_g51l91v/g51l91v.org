So... I have a fic that goes over Harry travelling and learning a lot of different magic and stuff, but it doesn't actually showcase the travelling itself. Harry basically goes back to his younger self after travelling the wizarding world for a few years and he celebrates the pagan holidays and all this shit and it's absolutely brilliant. It's called linkao3(Grounding Magic A-T). I recommend reading the other works of the series, as well, because the worldbuilding and characterizations are absolutely brilliant.
