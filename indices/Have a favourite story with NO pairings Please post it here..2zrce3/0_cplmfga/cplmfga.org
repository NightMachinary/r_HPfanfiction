  I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.

  A librarian's job is never done... especially not at Hogwarts... and especially when a certain toadlike High Inquisitor is nosing around.

Harry's sole hope of survival lies with Severus Snape, Hermione Granger, and, of all people, Neville Longbottom.

#+begin_quote
  There have always been certain unwritten rules at Hogwarts. Gryffindors are not friendly to Slytherins. Nobody learns anything in History of Magic. And nothing much ever happens to Theodore Wilkes Nott, apart from bullied by his own housemates, overshadowed by his clever friend Blaise, and ignored by everybody else. What happens when unwritten rules start to change?
