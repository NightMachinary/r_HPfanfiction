The title gave me a silly idea: write up a scene of Harry, after forest AK, is confronted by an entity (Dumbledore, Death personified, whatever) and is allowed a re-do from eleven. His reaction: "No". The entity replies "Very well, who should I give a do-over then?". What follows are one chapter per person he replies -- Sirius, Hermione, Remus, Colin, Albus, Severus, James, Draco, etc.
