I think that's the key thing - in the story he's not so much maturing as aging. He's not growing into a better person so much as just growing more experienced.

The story ends with him living a "happy ending" version of his life where he's beloved, successful, and has a family, but we're never actually told what it's like inside his head. The implication being that it's fundamentally not that much different than the time he tried to be a dark lord. He always feels detached, like others are just actors on a stage of meaninglessness.

In the classic /Groundhog Day/ movie, we see the protagonist learning and growing as a person and then putting that learning into effort to save more and more people. He catches a kid falling from a tree, but instead of becoming despondent over that "save" getting reset, he /just keeps doing it/. He even shouts "You've never thanked me! I'll see you tomorrow... maybe."

The linked one-shot feels like it should be the first of a two-parter. Like this first one is him learning more and more and eventually optimizing the best life - for himself. He then falls into depression and then pulls himself out by learning to optimize what's best for others or for the greater good, or The Will of the Force or whatever the fuck you wanna do with it. You could still do a happy ending here.
