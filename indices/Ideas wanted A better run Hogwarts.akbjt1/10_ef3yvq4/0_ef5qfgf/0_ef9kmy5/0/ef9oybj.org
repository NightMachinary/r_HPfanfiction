But you still can't become a doctor or an engineer right out of high school. You learn the basics like biology and physics and then go to college to study more advanced/specialised subjects. Likewise, Hogwarts teaches the core subjects, and then those who want to become healers or curse breakes can get training with an apprenticeship at St.Mungo or Gringotts. For people who are interested in spell creation and mysticism, there is Department of Mysteries, and so on. And many students are going to inherit their family business, or play Quidditch, or work as a clerk at the Ministry, and they don't really need any of that fancy stuff at all. Like, how many jobs would require alchemy knowledge?
