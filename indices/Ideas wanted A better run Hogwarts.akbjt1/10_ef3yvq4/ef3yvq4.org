Better explained magic - I like a combination of Skyrim, HP cannon, out of the night, and prince of a dark kingdom

More students (say 20 per house per year minimum)

More teachers and subjects - restoration or healing - alchemy - mind arts - spell creation - curse breaking - Dueling - enchanting - advanced core subjects - ritual magic - illusion and mysticism - dark arts - wandless magic - conjuration - magic and technology

Sports - fencing - Dueling - battle school (great fic too!)

Houses that only get points that apply to sporting contests and academic scores Everything else is just separated by year. House doesn't have to matter except in competitions. Dorms assigned randomly and change yearly (separated only by gender. 4 dorms each gender non house affiliated. Eg 1A - boys and 1A girls, 1B Ect.) 10 cubicles per dorm(non private, just low walls) and 2 people per cubicle. People can choose these beds. 2 dorm cops (older prefects that have private rooms attached to dorms) can give punishment individually. Year 4 move to shared private rooms (2 people) and above that it's private studies. This was close to the way my boarding school was run.
