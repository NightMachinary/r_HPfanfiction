The only real problem is understaffing for core subjects. While Trelawney has a couple of classes a week and is free to lounge with her bottle of sherry, McGonagall has three time as much classes and has to juggle two other positions as well, Sprout has a dozen greenhouses to tend to and Snape has all the hospital wing and probably other potions to brew.

I like it when fics add Art classes or some introductory courses for Muggleborns, though sometimes writers focus too much on describing all these shiny new clubs and choirs and football teams and healing courses. If they are introduced, they must have some relevance to the plot or character development.
