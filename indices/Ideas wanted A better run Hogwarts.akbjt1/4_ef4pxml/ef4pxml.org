I know it's usually the realm of Lord yada yada yada, but honestly culture classes for muggle-born and muggle raised make sense. And the same for purebreds/magic-raised to take mandatory muggle studies.

If I were to suddenly move to Britain or France or somewhere else, I would have at least a rudimentary idea of the country and the culture there. Muggle-borns have no clue about the world that they are moving into and the Muggle world has advanced by orders of magnitude in the last few decades. Even in the 90s, when Harry Potter is set, the world was hugely different then it was in the 70s and 80s.
