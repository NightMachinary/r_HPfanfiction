  but everyone stays in the same dorm split by year mates

I would argue that smaller dorms or even single rooms would be preferable over some barrack style dorm where 20 people share a room. Because honestly, I would refuse to go to such a school and rather learn French than to suffer through that.

  Students can only go one floor above their grade.

What's the point here? The restricted section is off limits because the contents can be dangerous (dark magic, complex potions which easily go wrong), but why would you ban students from reading a book on Thestrals or the history of magical Europe just because it is not within their scheduled curriculum? What if someone is interested in Potions and wants to read some of the advanced material because their teacher is an abusive bastard? Or read up on the monsters they know from Muggle folklore?

  NEWT students required to tutor younger kids

Why make that compulsatory? And a lot of people are simply not good at teaching. Hermione would completely overwhelm some poor first year and Malfoy would probably sabotage a Mudblood by telling him/her false information simply to fuck with them.

If you want to improve Hogwarts, fix the pureblood supremacy and the teachers who suck at their jobs (Snape, Binns, Trelawney, Hagrid for anything but NEWT classes). Those are by far the biggest issues.
