Ah when I was think of the dorm thing I was thinking either singles or one kid from each house not all together like that.

Now that I think on it I agree but I still like the idea of students running study groups or tutoring. Though I can't think of what reward would work. As for the library it was more of the thought that you don't want first years hurting themselves by trying magically costly spells.
