I like the idea of NEWT-level projects and it fits in with the British education system as A-Levels require independent coursework. My A-Levels in Business Studies and Psych for example required me to write a business plan for a start-up in our city and to carry out a psychological study. Other subjects have more traditional essay-based submissions but are still the student's own choice so it allows for a lot of variety.

It also leaves lots of room for creativity in fanfic to have characters figuring out what they should do for their projects and it can even be tied into the storyline as a whole by having them discover something which can help in the war (or whatever else the story revolves around).
