  That's not going to happen. Have you ever even seen a real school?? This isn't going to happen. Fred and George tutor some poor kid? This is just completely not how schools work.

I'm massively late so I imagine you won't reply to this (nor do you need to), but thought I'd say this for any other people who read this thread.

It's doable and has been done. My school had older students tutoring younger ones. It worked to varying degrees depending on the chemistry between them.

My school also had something called vertical tutoring, where our form groups didn't consist of people just from your academic year, but instead had students from 11-18 all in the same form.

It kind of helped encourage kids to socialize across years, and in the better cases the older students helped out younger ones in beneficial ways and learned to take on some responsibility.
