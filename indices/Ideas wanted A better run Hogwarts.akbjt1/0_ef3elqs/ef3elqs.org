A couple of things:

#+begin_quote
  More sports & Clubs
#+end_quote

There are clubs in canon. Harry just did not care for any of them, so we don't know them. But there is both a choir and a gobstones club that are mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  NEWT students required to tutor younger kids (1hr a week)
#+end_quote

That's not going to happen. Have you ever even seen a real school?? This isn't going to happen. Fred and George tutor some poor kid? This is just completely not how schools work.

#+begin_quote
  More teachers & Teachers have assistance (maybe they are working towards their mastery)
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is ridiculously understaffed. We would need three times as many teachers for each course. years 1-3, years 4-5 (OWLs) and years 6-7 (NEWTs) should be handled by different teachers.

We would also need an entirely separate support staff for the "boarding"-aspect of Hogwarts. Positions like "head of house" are a full-time job in itself and not something you do while also teaching transfiguration to 7 years!

#+begin_quote
  House elves run a small farm to keep food cost down
#+end_quote

For all we know this already happens. Harry never bothered to find out where the food comes form.

#+begin_quote
  Weekend classes for things like music, art etc
#+end_quote

How is this a different category from "clubs"??

#+begin_quote
  (Not sure on this one) still having having houses but everyone stays in the same dorm split by year mates.
#+end_quote

As insane as it sounds: the houses are NOT an invention of Rowling, but a real thing British boarding schools do... Also, if they aren't sleeping in the same dorm, then what is a house even??

#+begin_quote
  Eight story library split by year. Firsts year on first story going up. Eighth floor for restricted action. Students can only go one floor above their grade.
#+end_quote

why? This just forces kids to a common level and stops the genius ones from getting ahead. This is actively a bad idea!!
