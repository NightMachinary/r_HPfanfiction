  Why? And even in Muggle schools, forced PE classes generally are not really all that well liked by everyone. Sportsy people enjoy them, others might find them a time waster.

This one at least, beyond the children's opinion of it, makes some sense. It allows to work for a minimum level of fitness, provides some of the physical activity children need (especially in a school environment that's mainly sedentary activity) and helps with learning and training coordination. The latter is not quite as critical anymore than it would be with younger children but is still an ongoing concern.
