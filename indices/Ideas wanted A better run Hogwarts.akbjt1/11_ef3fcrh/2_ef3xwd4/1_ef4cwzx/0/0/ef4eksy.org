  They likely learn that in classes. They have to hit stuff with spells
#+end_quote

I wasn't aware that they hold wands with their feet or any other part of their body. Coordination is NOT limited to the hands.

#+begin_quote
  They have sports children could play. And the thousands upon thousands of steps they need to climb provides that as well.
#+end_quote

NOT enough. Not nearly enough to make any meaningful impact. And "could play" is not getting them off their arses and getting them interested in things.

#+begin_quote
  They don't really need that. And if it is needed for health concerns, they do have potions
#+end_quote

They do need that. And you don't need to fix what you can prevent.
