  I wasn't aware that they hold wands with their feet or any other part of their body. Coordination is NOT limited to the hands.
#+end_quote

And PE doesn't teach you any coordination besides running or maybe doing a few pushups. That you can do easily when you are ten. I'd agree with you if PE did teach coordination, but it doesn't.

  And "could play" is not getting them off their arses and getting them interested in things.
#+end_quote

And PE doesn't make anyone interested in sports either. If you are not athletic you are simply gonna hate the class, if you are normal you are simply not gonna care, and if you're atlethic then you already do it in your free time.

  NOT enough
#+end_quote

So sports and excise are not enough? What more could you want?

#+begin_quote
  They do need that. And you don't need to fix what you can prevent.
#+end_quote

They do get the minimal amount of exercise and if they didn't, the potions could give them it.
