  Nope. All of my schools were bog standard middle-of-the-road
#+end_quote

Then perhaps it is dependant on the country.

#+begin_quote
  It does, if your PE teachers are not competent to teach a proper curriculum.
#+end_quote

They are competent. But curriculums are not chosen by the teachers. They have little power in that regard.

#+begin_quote
  So? We already established that your PE teaching was bottom-of-the-barrel.
#+end_quote

No, we have not. We have two people that have different experiences, you and me. It doesn't mean that mine is the bottom of the barrel if you received much more.

#+begin_quote
  And that is one of the reasons why there is a comprehensive PE curriculum and not just a weekly push-up club.
#+end_quote

Which is not very relevant to what I said. My point was that just because you do pushups/play basketball/etc, doesn't mean you are going to enjoy it or do it in your free time.

#+begin_quote
  At best it is uncoordinated physical exertion.
#+end_quote

I see. Then by that regard, lifting small weights is the same thing really.

#+begin_quote
  No, it still isn't.
#+end_quote

Then we differ in option.

#+begin_quote
  You believe the potion that requires hourly renewal is a valid permanent solution to physical issues? Mind=blown.
#+end_quote

You clearly don't understand me. If there are potions that can make the user fall in love, speak the truth, change into a different form, or even age, there is very likely a potion for the issue we are discussing as well
