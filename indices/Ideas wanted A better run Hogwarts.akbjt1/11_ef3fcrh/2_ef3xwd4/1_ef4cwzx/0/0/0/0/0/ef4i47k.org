  Swimming, gymnastics, even dancing are all part of the PE curriculum.

Heavily depends on your area. I've been in 4 schools(High school included, we moved a lot) and none of them fit what you are saying about PE. Dancing was one of the after school clubs we could take but that's it. I'll admit in my high school we did have swimming lessons but those were a few weeks in a year and nothing complex. Again, something a simple 10 year old could do. Maybe you went to a very privileged high school or something and they had all that stuff, but none of my schools had it.

  I feel sorry for you for having such shitty teachers you learned none of that.
#+end_quote

I had amazing teachers and truly awful ones, yes. But that in no way relates to the PE topic.

#+begin_quote
  Oh yes it does! Seen it happen.
#+end_quote

Oh no, it doesn't. I have seen the negative reactions and people getting more uninterested in sports.

#+begin_quote
  That just points to you having shitty teachers.
#+end_quote

Not at all. Not everything bad is the fault of a teacher. Some people don't like doing push-ups. Some people hate basketball/football(soccer)/ect.

#+begin_quote
  Your examples were not sports and exercise
#+end_quote

Oh so walking thousands of steps to every class and anywhere you want is not an exercise? Weird. I guess whenever I step on a stair my leg muscles just decide to not work then. I mean, a normal school has....say 20 steps per floor? That is not an exercise, I agree. But climbing 2 floors, each a couple of hundred steps, just to get to one class is. And, again, they do have actual sports.

  and it can't.

There's Polyjuice, Ageing Potions, Love Potions. Truth potions, and stuff like that. I'm sure there's a potion for this as well.
