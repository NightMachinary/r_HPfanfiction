  And PE doesn't teach you any coordination besides running or maybe doing a few pushups. That you can do easily when you are ten. I'd agree with you if PE did teach coordination, but it doesn't.
#+end_quote

Oh yes it does! Swimming, gymnastics, even dancing are all part of the PE curriculum. I feel sorry for you for having such shitty teachers you learned none of that.

  And PE doesn't make anyone interested in sports either.
#+end_quote

Oh yes it does! Seen it happen.

  If you are not athletic you are simply gonna hate the class, if you are normal you are simply not gonna care, and if you're atlethic then you already do it in your free time.
#+end_quote

That just points to you having shitty teachers.

  So sports and excise are not enough? What more could you want?
#+end_quote

Your examples were not sports and exercise. They were what amounted to some flyers on a pin board and uncoordinated exertion.

#+begin_quote
  They do get the minimal amount of exercise and if they didn't, the potions could give them it.
#+end_quote

They don't and it can't.
