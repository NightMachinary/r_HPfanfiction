  Heavily depends on your area. I've been in 4 schools(High school included, we moved a lot) and none of them fit what you are saying about PE. Dancing was one of the after school clubs we could take but that's it. I'll admit in my high school we did have swimming lessons but those were a few weeks in a year and nothing complex. Again, something a simple 10 year old could do. Maybe you went to a very privileged high school or something and they had all that stuff, but none of my schools had it.
#+end_quote

Nope. All of my schools were bog standard middle-of-the-road

#+begin_quote
  I had amazing teachers and truly awful ones, yes. But that in no way relates to the PE topic.
#+end_quote

It does, if your PE teachers are not competent to teach a proper curriculum.

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    Oh yes it does! Seen it happen.
  #+end_example

  Oh no, it doesn't. I have seen the negative reactions and people getting more uninterested in sports.
#+end_quote

So? We already established that your PE teaching was bottom-of-the-barrel. How do the negative impacts deriving from that invalidate the positive impacts of competent (or even semi-competent) teaching?

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    That just points to you having shitty teachers.
  #+end_example

  Not at all. Not everything bad is the fault of a teacher. Some people don't like doing push-ups. Some people hate basketball/football(soccer)/ect.
#+end_quote

And that is one of the reasons why there is a comprehensive PE curriculum and not just a weekly push-up club.

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    Your examples were not sports and exercise
  #+end_example

  Oh so walking thousands of steps to every class and anywhere you want is not an exercise?
#+end_quote

As I told you already it isn't. At best it is uncoordinated physical exertion.

#+begin_quote
  Weird. I guess whenever I step on a stair my leg muscles just decide to not work then. I mean, a normal school has....say 20 steps per floor? That is not an exercise, I agree. But climbing 2 floors, each a couple of hundred steps, just to get to one class is. And, again, they do have actual sports.
#+end_quote

No, it still isn't.

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    and it can't.
  #+end_example

  There's Polyjuice, Ageing Potions, Love Potions. Truth potions, and stuff like that. I'm sure there's a potion for this as well.
#+end_quote

You believe the potion that requires /hourly/ renewal is a valid permanent solution to physical issues? Mind=blown.
