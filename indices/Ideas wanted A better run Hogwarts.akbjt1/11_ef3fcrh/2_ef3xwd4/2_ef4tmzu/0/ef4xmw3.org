  It works however the author decides it works- if we went exactly by canon every fanfiction would just be.. canon. I mean honestly...
#+end_quote

You can have different things while still respecting canon rules.

#+begin_quote
  Then teach what it is related to, honestly.
#+end_quote

Why? Anything useful from that language you learn in terms of spells.

#+begin_quote
  And of course it failed- it was run by Lockhart and Snape
#+end_quote

Snape would teach it pretty well.

#+begin_quote
  ep, teaching pineapples to tapdance is of the utmost importance
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Yeah, you're right. There certainly isn't a summoning charm, duplication charm, Patronus charm, (all of which saved Harry's life), water making charm, unlocking charm, nope no useful charms at all. In fact, they should just simply remove that lesson.

#+begin_quote
  though it is more useful than most transfigurations- I'd hate to have to hunt down a rat to make a box because that's the only spell for it I know.
#+end_quote

Animagus are transfiguration, there's human transfiguration(Into items, animals, lice), animal transfiguration, item transfiguration, vanishment and conjuration also fit here. Nope, useless, let's remove this lesson too. Actually, while we're at it, let's just scrap all lessons entirely. I'm sure they are all useless.

#+begin_quote
  How many times did Harry say/think that Dumbledore and Snape seemed to know all his secrets or something along those lines?
#+end_quote

Once as far as I recall was there actual evidence for this. You are free to prove me wrong

#+begin_quote
  Why try to get more money? Seriously? Tons of reasons, extra teachers to reduce class sizes, replace the brooms that are falling apart leading to accidents,
#+end_quote

Except everything is funded by the government, not the school canonically. And while extra teachers would be nice, they were doing fine without. And even then, not like you can hire multiple teachers for DADA. And can you provide any evidence for your broom statement? Canonically they are of less quality than new brooms, but it's a school broom, what do you expect? And they are not essential.

#+begin_quote
  to put in place additional changes and upgrades.
#+end_quote

Like?

#+begin_quote
  I'm not saying to charge em a door fee- but getting them into the door and trying to convince them to donate...
#+end_quote

"Hey guys! Now that you're here, can we pressure you to give us your cash? No? How about a guilt trip? No! Please don't leave!"

#+begin_quote
  Yes, and that's why the school brooms are crap-
#+end_quote

Please do provide non-fanon evidence

#+begin_quote
  but you're telling me the teachers wouldn't like a raise if nothing else- like say getting additional teachers for dangerous subjects- Professor Snape certainly could have used an assistant to stop Dunderheads from adding this or that and cause accident for example.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, although I assume they are paid well. And Snape could always use House Elves for help.

#+begin_quote
  besides the Muggles will learn of witches and wizards eventually and bigots still exist, still hunting down witches
#+end_quote

That is a fair point, assuming they will ever learn of Wizards. And that is a big assumption.

#+begin_quote
  So there isn't some super easy disarming charm that rapists and thugs could learn?
#+end_quote

Huh, and you said charms were useless. And it wouldn't help. If they disarmed you, they will also instantly knock you out or stun you or paralyze you.

#+begin_quote
  Why not- it'd give an anchor to the curse- a reason why Dumbledore couldn't break it- if perhaps it was a sentient being behind it, a piece of soul constantly reinforcing it perhaps.
#+end_quote

If it was on Tom's trophy, Dumbledore could easily find and deal with it. And why would he place his horocrux there? Besides, this thread is about better run hogwarts not about horocruxes.

#+begin_quote
  You wouldn't expect your mechanic to be able to preform rocket surgery, why are you expecting an old man to be the expert of every single field better than ones that have dedicated their entire lives to it?
#+end_quote

Maybe, just Maybe, because he is one of the most knowledgable and powerful wizards?

#+begin_quote
  yeah Dumbledore's a super wizard, but how much practice does he have cursebreaking? We don't know that- did he go out of his way to study cursebreaking? Are there skills typically learned person to person in the field? Are there tricks the books don't cover?
#+end_quote

Probably at least some, considering he managed to place Grindelwald in his fortress which was likely heavily protected with all manner of spells and curses.

#+begin_quote
  I know how to grow food in small quantities- gardening you see and could do so in an emergency probably- I know how to obtain water and I redid most of the plumbing on a house, I could manage a leanto at the very least. So ha.
#+end_quote

Good for you. Most of us probably don't.

#+begin_quote
  Really this is about worst case scenarios, and it's such a central part of the magicals way of life- what's wrong with teaching them the basics about wands and wand crafting so if the muggles attack and they're scattered to the winds they won't be useless should their fragile stick break?
#+end_quote

Because wandcrafting is extremely difficult and dangerous. You need to obtain the cores, some of which come from very dangerous creatures.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, because the hat doesn't already do that to sort you. Harry was a special circumstance- most students won't have old men scheming to keep them in an abusive house so they'll stay alive.
#+end_quote

How many muggle adults care about bullying? Not a lot. How many care about abuse? Not a lot. Hell, some of them consider it a possitive trait. Helps build character and all that.
