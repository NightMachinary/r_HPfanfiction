  Have you cracked open a dictionary? The pronunciation symbols are an utter mystery to me, maybe with time I could figure it out- but mispronouncing a spell is said to have dire consequences (though I'm betting Flitwicks anecdote "And saying the magic words properly is very important, too --- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." is probably an exaggeration to help kids remember how important it is.
#+end_quote

Since we have no proof on Flitwick's words I'd assume its more of a warning. Sorta like you warn your kids that if they misbehave a boogeyman will steal they away/Santa Claus will gift the coal/etc.

And for the dictionary, we were taught from early on to read it in my second language so I assumed a lot of people were taught English like that. English is my second language

#+begin_quote
  but I still say the kids are meant to be using the library to supplement their education and learn useful spells.
#+end_quote

Which is fair, but Hogwarts likely provides the most needed education. If you need to learn how to clean or shoot fireworks out of your wand, library awaits!

#+begin_quote
  Newt could very well have a magical zoo,
#+end_quote

Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  so why did Hagrid get the job of Care of magical creatures instead of a Transfiguration master that could make sure his creations didn't kill anyone?
#+end_quote

Because if you encounter a wild magical Leon you need to know how to not piss it off. You might not be skilled enough to transfigure it or you may be to afraid to kill it.

#+begin_quote
  For that matter, why get pets and not just transfigure animals
#+end_quote

I'd assume that you want the best quality. Then you breed them. Sure a Transfiguration Master could probably make an animal better than any other, but the same Master likely doesn't give a shit.

#+begin_quote
  Why date, just transfigure a woman out of a chicken?
#+end_quote

Social taboo, extremely difficult to do.

#+begin_quote
  but museums?
#+end_quote

Schools never take you to any museum that could be fun. It's always the dull and uninteresting ones.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, books> movies for canon.
#+end_quote

True, although I don't consider movies canonical at all since Rowling was barely involved and some of the plot was cut, changed, characters got shafted, etc.

#+begin_quote
  I see you've already choosen to stand with the Wizards when the war breaks out. What magical can cast hundreds of spells in a minute like a machine gun?
#+end_quote

They don't need to. Apparate to the government, Imperius the leaders, war over. Apparate to nuclear bombs, nuke the muggles, war over. Fly over a city and Fiendfire. War over. They don't need to attack directly. And if they are shot at, shielding charms.

#+begin_quote
  (Like making food out of magic) that we could do with technology (Lab grown meat).
#+end_quote

Wizards can do that too. Everything a muggle can do, a wizard can too. They just have magic as a bonus.

#+begin_quote
  Apparating place to place is probably going to be the worst- just because an alley has no people doesn't mean a camera can't see into it.
#+end_quote

Many cameras are low rez and frequently overwrite existant footage which creates 'ghost sightings' and stuff like that. They'd assume its just that. And even then, who'd believe Magic exists?

#+begin_quote
  Not enough influence to delete a viral picture or video on the internet that could be downloaded, sent via email and a host of number of ways that even if Wizards turned out to be expert hackers, you just can't get rid of.
#+end_quote

Viruses are a thing. They can do that. Alternativly, burn all the servers in the world. Impossible for muggles, couple of hours for Wizards.

#+begin_quote
  and wands/magic can do more than just injure/kill.
#+end_quote

Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  hiring such gems as Lockhart,
#+end_quote

To be fair, he needed to fill that position and not many are eager to take on a cursed job.

#+begin_quote
  , Snape
#+end_quote

Kinda had to. Snape was his spy and ally.

#+begin_quote
  and that guy with Voldemort on the back of his head.
#+end_quote

Didn't he do that as a bait?

#+begin_quote
  ime, yes, but he has hobbies too- though we never see it Dumbledore's said to like bowling (said on his chocolate frog card) for example, and we have no idea the work load he's under- I bet he has a backlog of mail when he returns from the ICW, a lot of people asking his advice if nothing else.
#+end_quote

...I honestly never considered he had hobbies. Huh.

And he can always not answer the advise asking letters

#+begin_quote
  Additionally it can't be easy to find DADA professors when they all die/go insane/flee from Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

True

#+begin_quote
  Not to mention Alchemy which seems like a rather demanding field though we know next to nothing about it canonically.
#+end_quote

True

#+begin_quote
  Wards is just a word describing a grouping of related spells for protection-
#+end_quote

Except in fanon they are super easy spells that offer God-Tier protection. They are supposed to be incredibly difficult to perform.

#+begin_quote
  Besides- finite incantatem could very well be the brute force method
#+end_quote

That likely works only on simple spells. Otherwise, Nevile's parents could be easily cured by Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  even if the wands a little floppy that counts for more than a bit
#+end_quote

Fair enough, but even then it's incredibly hard to do

#+begin_quote
  Then Hogwarts should do the right thing, not the easy thing- screen for abuse. If the staff don't like it, well, that's mighty suspicious, isn't it?
#+end_quote

If they are anything like muggles, not at all. It's above their pay grade to care. Maybe they are better, and maybe they care. Muggles don't.
