  I suppose that's true but having everything exactly the same... I'm not a huge fan of canon compliant if you couldn't tell.
#+end_quote

It doesn't have to be exactly the same. The story could take place in Russia as Stalin gained power or something. All it needs to do is follow canon magical rules.

#+begin_quote
  Learning how to speak the languages would simplify learning new spells without teachers, along with spellcrafting.
#+end_quote

Not at all. Just because I learned French doesn't mean I know History any better. Same thing.

#+begin_quote
  Forget if it's in the book or Rowling said it at some point but Snape is said to teach people how to deal with people like Snape- perhaps he could do a good job- he didn't do too terribly in DADA, but... Consider his potions class. He can't even stop Longbottom's potion mishaps, what chance does he have to do the same with spells?
#+end_quote

He did pretty good in DADA. And Longbottom is extremely clumsy and without any great talent(in first few books). He also had to supervise many different students. If he had a house elf to help him, it wouldn't be a problem.

#+begin_quote
  Yep, I said it was more useful- but it had it's useless bits
#+end_quote

Like what? And even Muggle subjects have useless bits. We learn about many of irrelevant physics theories simply because they used to be important.

#+begin_quote
  simply that many of the spells seemingly have no purpose beyond potentially as training wheels- and that students aren't always self-motivated enough to research useful spells on their own that put the theory learned there to use.
#+end_quote

Look, The lessons do teach actual spells. I can provide the full list of all the spells of transfiguration used in the series. Clearly the lesson does its job.

#+begin_quote
  Not conclusive proof by any means but it seems plausible.
#+end_quote

A lot of things are not conclusive proof and plausible. Doesn't mean it's true.

#+begin_quote
  To say nothing of kids disobeying curfew
#+end_quote

No proof that this is common

#+begin_quote
  ow many accidents did we see in classes?
#+end_quote

Only in Snape's lessons. And considering how dangerous the subjects are? Not a lot.

#+begin_quote
  though again, it's up to the author to decide whether they're in dire need of replacement or not.
#+end_quote

I'd argue they don't need replacing unless there's a big surplus in the budget, but you are correct. It's up to the author.

#+begin_quote
  upgraded wards perhaps
#+end_quote

Again, not a thing. And Dumbledore could do it for free.

#+begin_quote
  more books for the library (as new books do get made),
#+end_quote

Fair enough, although I don't think they make new books that often.

#+begin_quote
  money to fund field trips
#+end_quote

I have no idea where they would go, but portkeys exist. Dumbledore can easily make them.

#+begin_quote
  It can be done fun- casino styled games, raffles and the like.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, although it would be super easy to cheat.

#+begin_quote
  Elves are never seen creating potions, might not know what to look for.
#+end_quote

Dobby was able to recognize gillyweed so they do have some potions knowledge. And if they don't... "Hey, elf? See this thing?" "Yes, sir!" "Make sure that this (describtion of what shouldn't happen)"

#+begin_quote
  onsidering muggle parents and the Prime Minister already knows about Wizards I wouldn't say it's an assumption.
#+end_quote

Nobody would believe them. And obliviators exist.

#+begin_quote
  Spells take time to cast.
#+end_quote

A whole half a second or a second. And wandless magic doesn't? And would be strong enough to protect them? Let's assume it is, well, the mugger/rapist/etc, will also know wandless magic. And he has the benefit of a suprise attack.

#+begin_quote
  Possibly could- and how isn't making and defeating a cause for the DADA curse not helping Hogwarts run better?
#+end_quote

Fair enough, and yes he could.

#+begin_quote
  Knowledgable and powerful- but human- he has his limits, not only through his morals but from time constraints as he had three positions in the Wizarding world along side a war to prepare for and fight
#+end_quote

He had plenty of time when the war had ended.

#+begin_quote
  Even so, it could be likely that he used a brute force method that can't be used without disrupting other wards
#+end_quote

Why not? And Again, not a thing.

#+begin_quote
  Veela's can use their hair- it's quite possible witches and wizards can do the same- it doesn't have to be the death stick.
#+end_quote

Veela's are more magical, I believe

#+begin_quote
  That's not a point in favor of allowing abuse to continue... Positive trait, I'll be sure to quote you on that next time some bullying./abuse victim commits suicide.
#+end_quote

That wasn't my point. My point was that people likely wouldn't care. And Do Not quote my words. People consider it a possitive trait. Doesn't mean that I do. Don't take my words out of the context.

Anyway, it's late and I'm going to sleep. I will reply later
