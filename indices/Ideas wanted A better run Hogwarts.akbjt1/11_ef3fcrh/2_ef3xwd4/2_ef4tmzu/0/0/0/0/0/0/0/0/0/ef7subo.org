  fun field trips do exist

Fair enough

  If it that easy then why is so much copyrighted content still on the internet illegally?
#+end_quote

Because hacking is not easy. And despite what the companies claim, they suffer no actual losses.

  I think it'd be a closer war than you think.

Again, Wizards don't even need to show up. Just send one guy to deal with the government and maybe the nukes while the rest go to the pub

  guns seem to have a greater range than spells
#+end_quote

Depends on the spell. Taboo spell, Fiendfire, trace are all long rage spells.

  Shielding charms take time
#+end_quote

About as long as to press the trigger on a gun

#+begin_quote
  things like Snipers exist
#+end_quote

Fair enough, although Wizards could always apparate and kill the sniper if one of them dies. Or portkey out.

  I think Rowling wanted Dumbledore to be the good guy, but didn't count on her later putting even better spells in her books otherwise the stone would be under a fidelius charm- though it's possible she meant him to be some grand manipulator trying to force the confrontation early, to resolve the prophesy- though the idea of testing Harry with it is absurd- too likely Harry would die and I doubt even Dumbledore could have weathered the shit storm of this national hero being killed on his watch.

Likely this tbh
