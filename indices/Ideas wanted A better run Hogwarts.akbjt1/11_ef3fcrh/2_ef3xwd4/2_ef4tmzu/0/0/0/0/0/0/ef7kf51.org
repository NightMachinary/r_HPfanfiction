  Well if it doesn't then our debate loses all its value. Literally, anything and everything is both true and false.
#+end_quote

Hardly- you've already made me rethink some ideas that on the surface looked good.

#+begin_quote
  Which is a fair point, but the pronunciation is likely to be written as well. Like a dictionary.
#+end_quote

Have you cracked open a dictionary? The pronunciation symbols are an utter mystery to me, maybe with time I could figure it out- but mispronouncing a spell is said to have dire consequences (though I'm betting Flitwicks anecdote "And saying the magic words properly is very important, too --- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." is probably an exaggeration to help kids remember how important it is.

#+begin_quote
  It's more or less practice. One does not fix cars on his first day, same thing here.
#+end_quote

That's more or less what I've been saying- useless spells for learning theory and as building blocks... but I still say the kids are meant to be using the library to supplement their education and learn useful spells.

  Why would they go to a zoo? They are wizards. They can magic animals into existence or transfigure a rock into a lion. Planetariums are not that popular even with Muggles so I don't think they'd like it much. And they are kids/teens. They don't care about museums.
#+end_quote

Newt could very well have a magical zoo, though transfiguring them instead is a good enough idea- so why did Hagrid get the job of Care of magical creatures instead of a Transfiguration master that could make sure his creations didn't kill anyone? Maybe the behavior of the transfigured animals is only as good as the knowledge of the person creating them, or maybe control over them is more direct or any number of reasons.

For that matter, why get pets and not just transfigure animals? Why date, just transfigure a woman out of a chicken?

More many zoos have tours with knowledgeable staff.

Planetariums... Maybe they wouldn't care, they see the stars enough, but museums?

There are some really fun/cool museums out there, like Discovery Children's museums- I used to beg my parents to take me. And what kid doesn't like seeing massive dinosaur skeletons?

#+begin_quote
  They might have a lot of work, yes, but it's not like they'd miss an elf or two for a more dangerous lesson. That and I don't consider movies canonical so...yeah.
#+end_quote

Yeah, books> movies for canon.

#+begin_quote
  Because Wizards don't need to advance. We made nuclear power to kill our enemies. Then we realized we can use it for power. They need neither of those things. And besides, everything a Muggle can do, Wizard can do too if they cared enough to put in the effort.
#+end_quote

I see you've already choosen to stand with the Wizards when the war breaks out. What magical can cast hundreds of spells in a minute like a machine gun? There are limits, either due to some sort of magical core (not canon as far as I Know), depleting one's innate magic power, or things that are supposedly impossible with magic (Like making food out of magic) that we could do with technology (Lab grown meat).

#+begin_quote
  Yep, and besides, Wizards don't do stuff like that in public. And if they need to, they have plenty of subtle invisible spells. Obliviate, Confundus, Imperio, etc.
#+end_quote

Well, maybe outside of wars but you're discounting just how many security cameras are in the muggle world and just how many wizards are ignorant of them. Apparating place to place is probably going to be the worst- just because an alley has no people doesn't mean a camera can't see into it.

#+begin_quote
  Why missing? They could probably see what they wanted to see. And, remember, Wizards do have a lot of influence in muggle world too. If they realize there's evidence, they will destroy it.
#+end_quote

Not enough influence to delete a viral picture or video on the internet that could be downloaded, sent via email and a host of number of ways that even if Wizards turned out to be expert hackers, you just can't get rid of.

#+begin_quote
  Guns are also cool and fists are curtches from a certain point of view. Doesn't mean that everyone learns to use a gun and carries it everywhere.
#+end_quote

That doesn't quite add up- wands are more like guns than fists, and wands/magic can do more than just injure/kill.

#+begin_quote
  Lets be honest here, he did jack shit as a headmaster.
#+end_quote

He did worse than jack shit, hiring such gems as Lockhart, Snape and that guy with Voldemort on the back of his head. Though maybe he really didn't know what he was doing there.

#+begin_quote
  And that still leaves time. He's not busy 24/7. Maybe in the first month after the first war he was. But realistically they would run out of things to do. And I don't think he is a head of magical UN, simply a part of it. And I assume you meant Englands Wizarding Court when you said government?
#+end_quote

Yes- I couldn't spell it off the top of my head if I wanted and didn't feel up to googling just for the name- and it looks like you felt the same.

Time, yes, but he has hobbies too- though we never see it Dumbledore's said to like bowling (said on his chocolate frog card) for example, and we have no idea the work load he's under- I bet he has a backlog of mail when he returns from the ICW, a lot of people asking his advice if nothing else.

Additionally it can't be easy to find DADA professors when they all die/go insane/flee from Hogwarts.

Not to mention Alchemy which seems like a rather demanding field though we know next to nothing about it canonically.

Hell, maybe he's writing his memoirs and RIta found the rough draft after he died.

#+begin_quote
  Wards aren't canonically a thing. Different Difficult Protection spells layered and combined are a thing although it's not clear to what extent.
#+end_quote

Wards is just a word describing a grouping of related spells for protection- so what if J.k. didn't use it? She didn't use the word teleportation or if she did she didn't use it often, but saying someone teleported in Harry Potter just means they apparated or otherwise magically transported themselves somewhere.

Besides- finite incantatem could very well be the brute force method- JK R. never went into detail. Maybe it uses blunt force, wiping out any active magic (spells) with the raw power of the caster, or maybe it makes a magical black hole that sucks all magic out of that spot and dumps it in Disneyland or another dimension- whatever.

#+begin_quote
  More magical, the better the wand.
#+end_quote

Something is better than nothing, and I imagine despite seeing some fanfics that are claim the contrary that a person's own hair would be a good match for them- even if the wands a little floppy that counts for more than a bit.

#+begin_quote
  I believe we both have been quoting eachother in and aware about the context. Now if you were to go and say that I support child abuse and say nothing else, people are going to get the wrong impression. It's going to be the Pewdiepie is Hitler scandal all over again. I do not support child abuse.
#+end_quote

Then Hogwarts should do the right thing, not the easy thing- screen for abuse. If the staff don't like it, well, that's mighty suspicious, isn't it?
