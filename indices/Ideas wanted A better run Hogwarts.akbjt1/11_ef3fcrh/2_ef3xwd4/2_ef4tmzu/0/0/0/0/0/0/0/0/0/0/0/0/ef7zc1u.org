Taken down fast but some people still saw them- and with something like this... that's enough really, secrets once out are hard to get back in.

President has and knows some but all, or all that knows- probably not- probably knows that knows that knows that knows- and every time the wizard goes after one/a person he risks exposure on security cameras or a muggle getting a lucky shot off.

What if the President is a wizard though? Or has muggleborn on his staff? Also why are we talking about presidents, I think they have a Queen and Prime Minister over in England where they'd logically start.

Wordless magic is close to newt level, and wand motions can be complex, try a swish and flick then try a trigger motion- the trigger is faster. If you have a gun you could totally take on a first year on Halloween.

Even a jab with a stick vs a trigger motion is a pretty close race. though

Goodnight again, yep, been fun.
