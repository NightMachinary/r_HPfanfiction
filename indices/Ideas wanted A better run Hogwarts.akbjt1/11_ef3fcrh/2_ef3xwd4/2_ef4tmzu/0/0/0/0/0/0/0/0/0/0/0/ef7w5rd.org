  Ah, but some people really care about their copyrights- companies with movies in theaters certainly don't want bootlegs on the internet. No, it's not so easy getting rid of stuff off the internet- and the more people try the more we upload them, even making memes out of them (Nsfwish).

Except some companies like Microsoft have no grounds for copyrights seeing as most of their Eula is not valid under the law. That's why they don't go after people who resell their keys super cheap. It is legal despite their wishes. And plenty of companies know better than to push. They don't want to be massively fined or have an incident that forces them to change stuff. And Movie theaters can't do anything about bootlegs, at least the Chinese ones. I believe they are legal...at least in China they are. Unless you mean filming and reuploading it on the internet? Which gets taken down fast if they care. At least from public torrents/youtube. There are private torrents and those are more difficult to tackle, yes.

  Do you know all the people with nuclear codes? For sure?

President likely has them. And if he doesn't, he likely knows who does. Imperio. Know you do too.

  The locations of all nukes that can launch without any outside help?

President argument applies here too. Most defenses fall against magic. You simply can't protect against it if you are a muggle.

  Wand motions/saying the words takes longer than twitching a finger surely, not everyone is a super wizard.

Wordless Magic is not even NEWT's level. And wand motions are pretty darn quick. And even if wordless magic wasn't a thing for some reason, saying is pretty fast too. When Harry started casting Sectusempra, Draco was about to finish his Crucio spell. That means Harry easily said that word in less than a second. Hell, speaking phrases very fast is fun and easy, provided it's not super complex

Going to sleep again, was fun debating
