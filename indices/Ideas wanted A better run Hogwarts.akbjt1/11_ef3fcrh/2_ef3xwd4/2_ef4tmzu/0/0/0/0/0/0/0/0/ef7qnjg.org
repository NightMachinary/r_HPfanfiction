  And for the dictionary, we were taught from early on to read it in my second language so I assumed a lot of people were taught English like that. English is my second language

That's what the wiz-kids need then.

  Schools never take you to any museum that could be fun. It's always the dull and uninteresting ones.
#+end_quote

I don't know about that, though we didn't go to many museums when I was in school we did take a field trip to Seaworld- fun field trips do exist.

  Viruses are a thing. They can do that. Alternativly, burn all the servers in the world. Impossible for muggles, couple of hours for Wizards.

If it that easy then why is so much copyrighted content still on the internet illegally?

  They don't need to. Apparate to the government, Imperius the leaders, war over. Apparate to nuclear bombs, nuke the muggles, war over. Fly over a city and Fiendfire. War over. They don't need to attack directly. And if they are shot at, shielding charms
#+end_quote

Shielding charms take time and guns seem to have a greater range than spells- things like Snipers exist- I think it'd be a closer war than you think.

We never find out- obviously three kids getting through defenses to keep out a Dark Lord is absurd but.. Honestly I think Rowling never planned much ahead with her series- someone could have accioed trevor the Toad for Neville (upset kid and a simple spell to get him happy again, why not?), we don't hear about the great hall being off limits for any reason (such as apparation practice) until Harry's old enough to go through it himself, and a lot more little things like that.

I think Rowling wanted Dumbledore to be the good guy, but didn't count on her later putting even better spells in her books otherwise the stone would be under a fidelius charm- though it's possible she meant him to be some grand manipulator trying to force the confrontation early, to resolve the prophesy- though the idea of testing Harry with it is absurd- too likely Harry would die and I doubt even Dumbledore could have weathered the shit storm of this national hero being killed on his watch.

  That likely works only on simple spells. Otherwise, Nevile's parents could be easily cured by Dumbledore.

It may not be an active spell but nerve/brain damage, or perhaps torture induced catatonia.
