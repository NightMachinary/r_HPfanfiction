  All it needs to do is follow canon magical rules.
#+end_quote

It doesn't need to do any such thing- why would it?

#+begin_quote
  Not at all. Just because I learned French doesn't mean I know History any better. Same thing.
#+end_quote

Ah, but if you saw writing in french you could likely say it outloud? It's all about pronunciation.

  He did pretty good in DADA. And Longbottom is extremely clumsy and without any great talent(in first few books). He also had to supervise many different students. If he had a house elf to help him, it wouldn't be a problem.
#+end_quote

Yes, Dada he did better, but house elves to supervise something they may not understand- it really depends on the elf's I suppose. More, a lot of wizards don't really consider them and Snape may follow along with that- though really, any teacher that becomes a students greatest fear... I'm not a Snape fan, lets just agree to disagree.

#+begin_quote
  Like what? And even Muggle subjects have useless bits. We learn about many of irrelevant physics theories simply because they used to be important.
#+end_quote

A lot of the overly specific object/animal to object/animals- would you ever make a pincushion out of a hedgehog? Why not just go to the store- it'd likely be quicker than trying to find a hedgehog. The only explanation for learning some of those offbeat spells I can think of is is to teach concepts/theory that can aid in more advanced transfigurations or other transfiguration spells that aren't shown taught- such as a more freeform kind of transfiguration spell, or using more common things to transfigure.

  I have no idea where they would go, but portkeys exist. Dumbledore can easily make them.
#+end_quote

Some places cost money to visit. Where they could go, for free the Ministry would be a good choice- it is the seat of their government. Museums, Planetariums, Zoos... There are a lot of choices, many of which would or could cost money.

#+begin_quote
  Dobby was able to recognize gillyweed so they do have some potions knowledge. And if they don't... "Hey, elf? See this thing?" "Yes, sir!" "Make sure that this (describtion of what shouldn't happen)"
#+end_quote

True, they can clearly be taught- though I always got the impression- unsubstantiated aside from how busy they seem in the kitchens in the movies more than the books- that they have enough on their plates as it is, then again Dobby was supposedly able to clean the whole Gryffindor Tower.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody would believe them. And obliviators exist.
#+end_quote

They probably wouldn't... Other than the ever increasing proof, satellite images with stretches of land missing or distorted possibly depending on how unplottable wards work. Security images and other recordings of witches and wizards doing insane things- though special effects make that murky. Still, it rather seems like a matter of time when Muggles advance and wizards seemingly stagnate. It's like you said before- not many new books eh?

#+begin_quote
  A whole half a second or a second. And wandless magic doesn't? And would be strong enough to protect them? Let's assume it is, well, the mugger/rapist/etc, will also know wandless magic. And he has the benefit of a suprise attack.
#+end_quote

Well, that's a logic hole, but .. Okay fine, wandless magic is cool and wands are phallic crutches, how about that?

#+begin_quote
  He had plenty of time when the war had ended.
#+end_quote

Did he? It's still head of the magical UN or whatever it is, a head of the England wizarding government or at least a moderator, a headmaster, and he was likely still concerned over Voldemort and how he survived- as he always suspected he /did/ survive, didn't he?

#+begin_quote
  Why not? And Again, not a thing.
#+end_quote

We don't know whether it's a thing or not because it wasn't shown.

#+begin_quote
  Veela's are more magical, I believe
#+end_quote

Might be, but where's the cap off on how magical a hair has to be? We don't know and it's the fanfic authors choice, I figure.

#+begin_quote
  That wasn't my point. My point was that people likely wouldn't care. And Do Not quote my words. People consider it a possitive trait. Doesn't mean that I do. Don't take my words out of the context.
#+end_quote

I just did, we've been quoting each other off and on.

Goodnight, nice debating with you.
