  If you're there you might as well disable the security footage as well. And just keep a shielding charm on at all times, besides, why would they shoot on sight?

I meant if you're at war- and who knows if shield charms can stay up constantly or if there's a drain, and if Mr Weasley is anything to go by ... Well I doubt he even knows what a security camera is.

  Not all. Avada Kedavra has an easy wand motion that I can do just as fast as someone pulling the trigger. It's a very fluid motion. Or just point and obliviate. No motions required

The AK is a mouthful though- and it's one of those spells that they can't seem to do silent or if they can they don't for whatever reason.
