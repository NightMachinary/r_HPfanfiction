  It doesn't need to do any such thing- why would it?
#+end_quote

Well if it doesn't then our debate loses all its value. Literally, anything and everything is both true and false.

#+begin_quote
  Ah, but if you saw writing in french you could likely say it outloud? It's all about pronunciation.
#+end_quote

Which is a fair point, but the pronunciation is likely to be written as well. Like a dictionary.

#+begin_quote
  'm not a Snape fan, lets just agree to disagree.
#+end_quote

I'm not a big fan of him either

#+begin_quote
  A lot of the overly specific object/animal to object/animals- would you ever make a pincushion out of a hedgehog? Why not just go to the store- it'd likely be quicker than trying to find a hedgehog. The only explanation for learning some of those offbeat spells I can think of is is to teach concepts/theory that can aid in more advanced transfigurations or other transfiguration spells that aren't shown taught- such as a more freeform kind of transfiguration spell, or using more common things to transfigure.
#+end_quote

It's more or less practice. One does not fix cars on his first day, same thing here.

#+begin_quote
  Some places cost money to visit. Where they could go, for free the Ministry would be a good choice- it is the seat of their government. Museums, Planetariums, Zoos... There are a lot of choices, many of which would or could cost money.
#+end_quote

Why would they go to a zoo? They are wizards. They can magic animals into existence or transfigure a rock into a lion. Planetariums are not that popular even with Muggles so I don't think they'd like it much. And they are kids/teens. They don't care about museums.

#+begin_quote
  True, they can clearly be taught- though I always got the impression- unsubstantiated aside from how busy they seem in the kitchens in the movies more than the books- that they have enough on their plates as it is, then again Dobby was supposedly able to clean the whole Gryffindor Tower.
#+end_quote

They might have a lot of work, yes, but it's not like they'd miss an elf or two for a more dangerous lesson. That and I don't consider movies canonical so...yeah.

#+begin_quote
  Still, it rather seems like a matter of time when Muggles advance and wizards seemingly stagnate. It's like you said before- not many new books eh?
#+end_quote

Because Wizards don't need to advance. We made nuclear power to kill our enemies. Then we realized we can use it for power. They need neither of those things. And besides, everything a Muggle can do, Wizard can do too if they cared enough to put in the effort.

#+begin_quote
  ecurity images and other recordings of witches and wizards doing insane things- *though special effects make that murky.*
#+end_quote

Yep, and besides, Wizards don't do stuff like that in public. And if they need to, they have plenty of subtle invisible spells. Obliviate, Confundus, Imperio, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Other than the ever increasing proof, satellite images with stretches of land missing or distorted possibly depending on how unplottable wards work.
#+end_quote

Why missing? They could probably see what they wanted to see. And, remember, Wizards do have a lot of influence in muggle world too. If they realize there's evidence, they will destroy it.

#+begin_quote
  Okay fine, wandless magic is cool and wands are phallic crutches, how about that?
#+end_quote

Guns are also cool and fists are curtches from a certain point of view. Doesn't mean that everyone learns to use a gun and carries it everywhere.

#+begin_quote
  a headmaster,
#+end_quote

Lets be honest here, he did jack shit as a headmaster.

#+begin_quote
  Did he? It's still head of the magical UN or whatever it is, a head of the England wizarding government or at least a moderator
#+end_quote

And that still leaves time. He's not busy 24/7. Maybe in the first month after the first war he was. But realistically they would run out of things to do. And I don't think he is a head of magical UN, simply a part of it. And I assume you meant Englands Wizarding Court when you said government?

#+begin_quote
  We don't know whether it's a thing or not because it wasn't shown.
#+end_quote

Wards aren't canonically a thing. Different Difficult Protection spells layered and combined are a thing although it's not clear to what extent.

#+begin_quote
  Might be, but where's the cap off on how magical a hair has to be?
#+end_quote

More magical, the better the wand.

#+begin_quote
  We don't know and it's the fanfic authors choice, I figure.
#+end_quote

I suppose, but then what's the point of debating then?

#+begin_quote
  I just did, we've been quoting each other off and on.
#+end_quote

I believe we both have been quoting eachother in and aware about the context. Now if you were to go and say that I support child abuse and say nothing else, people are going to get the wrong impression. It's going to be the Pewdiepie is Hitler scandal all over again. I do not support child abuse.

#+begin_quote
  Goodnight, nice debating with you.
#+end_quote

Yeah, it was nice debating with 'ya.
