  You can have different things while still respecting canon rules.
#+end_quote

I suppose that's true but having everything exactly the same... I'm not a huge fan of canon compliant if you couldn't tell.

#+begin_quote
  Why? Anything useful from that language you learn in terms of spells.
#+end_quote

Learning how to speak the languages would simplify learning new spells without teachers, along with spellcrafting.

#+begin_quote
  Snape would teach it pretty well.
#+end_quote

Forget if it's in the book or Rowling said it at some point but Snape is said to teach people how to deal with people like Snape- perhaps he could do a good job- he didn't do too terribly in DADA, but... Consider his potions class. He can't even stop Longbottom's potion mishaps, what chance does he have to do the same with spells?

#+begin_example
  > Hmmm. Yeah, you're right. There certainly isn't a summoning charm, duplication charm, Patronus charm, (all of which saved Harry's life), water making charm, unlocking charm, nope no useful charms at all. In fact, they should just simply remove that lesson.
#+end_example

Yep, I said it was more useful- but it had it's useless bits that the only reason for learning them I can see is potentially to teach theory that's useful for more than just the spell itself.

#+begin_quote
  Animagus are transfiguration, there's human transfiguration(Into items, animals, lice), animal transfiguration, item transfiguration, vanishment and conjuration also fit here. Nope, useless, let's remove this lesson too. Actually, while we're at it, let's just scrap all lessons entirely. I'm sure they are all useless.
#+end_quote

Very few learn to become animaguses, human transfiguration can be useful but also dangerous- and I'm not saying the field of transfiguration is useless, simply that many of the spells seemingly have no purpose beyond potentially as training wheels- and that students aren't always self-motivated enough to research useful spells on their own that put the theory learned there to use.

#+begin_quote
  Once as far as I recall was there actual evidence for this. You are free to prove me wrong
#+end_quote

Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling lightblue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed. "Innocent until proven guilty, Severus," he said firmly.

Not conclusive proof by any means but it seems plausible.

#+begin_quote
  Except everything is funded by the government, not the school canonically. And while extra teachers would be nice, they were doing fine without. And even then, not like you can hire multiple teachers for DADA. And can you provide any evidence for your broom statement? Canonically they are of less quality than new brooms, but it's a school broom, what do you expect? And they are not essential.
#+end_quote

Were doing fine without- how many accidents did we see in classes? To say nothing of kids disobeying curfew, or first years getting homesick.

More, after wars there are typically baby booms.

Evidence for the broom statement... Huh, I'll be damned, [[https://www.pottermore.com/book-extract-long/first-flying-lesson][looks like you are right about this]], though again, it's up to the author to decide whether they're in dire need of replacement or not.

Still, there are more things than just brooms that could use money- upgraded wards perhaps, more books for the library (as new books do get made), money to fund field trips and more.

#+begin_quote
  "Hey guys! Now that you're here, can we pressure you to give us your cash? No? How about a guilt trip? No! Please don't leave!"
#+end_quote

It can be done fun- casino styled games, raffles and the like.

#+begin_quote
  Fair enough, although I assume they are paid well. And Snape could always use House Elves for help.
#+end_quote

Elves are never seen creating potions, might not know what to look for.

#+begin_quote
  That is a fair point, assuming they will ever learn of Wizards. And that is a big assumption.
#+end_quote

It's a matter of time I'd say- considering muggle parents and the Prime Minister already knows about Wizards I wouldn't say it's an assumption.

#+begin_quote
  Huh, and you said charms were useless. And it wouldn't help. If they disarmed you, they will also instantly knock you out or stun you or paralyze you.
#+end_quote

Spells take time to cast.

#+begin_quote
  If it was on Tom's trophy, Dumbledore could easily find and deal with it. And why would he place his horocrux there? Besides, this thread is about better run hogwarts not about horocruxes.
#+end_quote

Possibly could- and how isn't making and defeating a cause for the DADA curse not helping Hogwarts run better?

#+begin_quote
  Maybe, just Maybe, because he is one of the most knowledgable and powerful wizards?
#+end_quote

Knowledgable and powerful- but human- he has his limits, not only through his morals but from time constraints as he had three positions in the Wizarding world along side a war to prepare for and fight.

#+begin_quote
  Probably at least some, considering he managed to place Grindelwald in his fortress which was likely heavily protected with all manner of spells and curses.
#+end_quote

Maybe- we have no idea what if any support he had before the final confrontation do we? Even so, it could be likely that he used a brute force method that can't be used without disrupting other wards.

#+begin_quote
  Because wandcrafting is extremely difficult and dangerous. You need to obtain the cores, some of which come from very dangerous creatures.
#+end_quote

Veela's can use their hair- it's quite possible witches and wizards can do the same- it doesn't have to be the death stick.

#+begin_quote
  How many muggle adults care about bullying? Not a lot. How many care about abuse? Not a lot. Hell, some of them consider it a possitive trait. Helps build character and all that.
#+end_quote

That's not a point in favor of allowing abuse to continue... Positive trait, I'll be sure to quote you on that next time some bullying./abuse victim commits suicide.
