  That is not how it works. And besides, it is an extremely rare subject that less than a handful people know in all of wizarding Britain.
#+end_quote

It works however the author decides it works- if we went exactly by canon every fanfiction would just be.. canon. I mean honestly... Besides, it's entirely possible Snape was teaching the quick and painful method, trying to turn Harry's mind into an attack dog at best- something I could see him doing. [[https://eocinstitute.org/meditation/meditation-will-increase-your-capacity-for-learning/][Meditation in itself is said to be beneficial to learning]] as well.

  Most of it isn't even related to Latin. Some of it is, but only a tiny bit
#+end_quote

Then teach what it is related to, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  That was tried in the second year. It was a massive failure. Combined with the lack of teachers and the fact that there is a different teacher for DADA and it simply becomes not feasible
#+end_quote

I later go on to say get more teachers. And of course it failed- it was run by Lockhart and Snape.

#+begin_quote
  They are in charms and DADA. And Transfiguration has lots of practicality, most of it is just for the upper years tho.
#+end_quote

DADA- depends on the year and the competence of the teacher. Charms? Yep, teaching pineapples to tapdance is of the utmost importance- though it is more useful than most transfigurations- I'd hate to have to hunt down a rat to make a box because that's the only spell for it I know.

#+begin_quote
  You yourself pointed out why that is a bad idea.
#+end_quote

People said the same things about ending segregation- it has it's problems but it can be argued it's the right thing to do.

#+begin_quote
  Never happened canonically with Dumbledore and only once with Snape. And that was after Harry almost murdered Draco.
#+end_quote

How many times did Harry say/think that Dumbledore and Snape seemed to know all his secrets or something along those lines? More- every time Harry was noticing Dumbledore's twinkle could have easily been.

  Gather donations from alumni.
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  Why
#+end_quote

Why try to get more money? Seriously? Tons of reasons, extra teachers to reduce class sizes, replace the brooms that are falling apart leading to accidents, to put in place additional changes and upgrades.

#+begin_quote
  No one would attend paid reunions.
#+end_quote

I'm not saying to charge em a door fee- but getting them into the door and trying to convince them to donate...

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is free. No tuition fee no nothing. All they need to buy are books, a wand, and clothing. Schools supplies for seven people (Used) are less than a single galeon
#+end_quote

Yes, and that's why the school brooms are crap- Okay, I admit that's the biggest and most glaring example of why they need more money but you're telling me the teachers wouldn't /like/ a raise if nothing else- like say getting additional teachers for dangerous subjects- Professor Snape certainly could have used an assistant to stop Dunderheads from adding this or that and cause accident for example.

#+begin_quote
  Except it is never needed. It only is useful in war times. And those are supposed to be rare. Even then only the most gifted can do it, and even they prefer using wands.
#+end_quote

You're taking a lot of the magic out of magic- never useful? So there isn't some super easy disarming charm that rapists and thugs could learn? Even outside of war there's going to be criminals- besides the Muggles will learn of witches and wizards eventually and bigots still exist, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt#Modern_cases][still hunting down witches]]

#+begin_example
  DADA - change the name
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  Why?
#+end_quote

Might bypass the curse, possibly not but hey, it's something easy enough to try. Sides' one should learn how to defend against others in general- not every criminal is going to know dark magic.

#+begin_example
  or have Tom Riddle's award to the school be a hocrux
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  why?
#+end_quote

Why not- it'd give an anchor to the curse- a reason why Dumbledore couldn't break it- if perhaps it was a sentient being behind it, a piece of soul constantly reinforcing it perhaps.

#+begin_quote
  One of the most powerful wizard in Wizarding Britain couldn't break it in 31 years so no fresh out of the school curse breaker ever will.
#+end_quote

It's all about specialization- yeah Dumbledore's a super wizard, but how much practice does he have cursebreaking? We don't know that- did he go out of his way to study cursebreaking? Are there skills typically learned person to person in the field? Are there tricks the books don't cover?

You wouldn't expect your mechanic to be able to preform rocket surgery, why are you expecting an old man to be the expert of every single field better than ones that have dedicated their entire lives to it?

#+begin_quote
  I see. So you know how to make all of your essentials then? Food, water, house and all that stuff?
#+end_quote

I know how to grow food in small quantities- gardening you see and could do so in an emergency probably- I know how to obtain water and I redid most of the plumbing on a house, I could manage a leanto at the very least. So ha.

Really this is about worst case scenarios, and it's such a central part of the magicals way of life- what's wrong with teaching them the basics about wands and wand crafting so if the muggles attack and they're scattered to the winds they won't be useless should their fragile stick break?

#+begin_quote
  Great idea. Let's let a hat mind rape your secrets and hope that someone will help you. Harry was starved, people knew that and nobody did a thing.
#+end_quote

Yeah, because the hat doesn't already do that to sort you. Harry was a special circumstance- most students won't have old men scheming to keep them in an abusive house so they'll stay alive.

And diseases- okay fair enough, didn't know Rowling went on record saying wizards are immune to that stuff-but there are magical diseases, dragon pox and the like.
