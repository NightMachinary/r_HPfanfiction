Harry did not almost murder Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought

Harry had a perfectly valid justification (self defence against an attempted Cruciatus) and he had no malice afterthought. After that incident, Malfoy should have been expelled and tried. Punishing Harry makes no sense whatsoever.
