#+begin_quote
  Start off the kids with occulmancy classes
#+end_quote

That is not how it works. And besides, it is an extremely rare subject that less than a handful people know in all of wizarding Britain.

#+begin_quote
  Obviously Snape and Dumbledore wouldn't like not being able to peek in the minds of trouble makers
#+end_quote

Never happened canonically with Dumbledore and only once with Snape. And that was after Harry almost murdered Draco.

#+begin_quote
  you have to kill them or ship them off to the Goblin mines to shovel dragon shit,
#+end_quote

Fucking extreme isn't it?

#+begin_quote
  Latin Class so they understand spell composition better. (though it's all supposedly pseudo latin anyway)
#+end_quote

Most of it isn't even related to Latin. Some of it is, but only a tiny bit.

#+begin_quote
  History: Replace Binns, possibly with ghosts/paintings that aren't boring and experienced history- or have a teacher that uses those as guest speakers
#+end_quote

Binns being useless is a fanon cliche. From Harry's tests we can see that he covered more subjects than just Goblin Revolutions.

#+begin_quote
  Castle could probably use insulating
#+end_quote

Hot air charms exist so the castle is likely covered in those.

#+begin_quote
  Wards need updating bad
#+end_quote

Wards don't exist

#+begin_quote
  trolls shouldn't get in school, nor cursed diaries
#+end_quote

If wards did exist it is reasonable to believe that the strongest Dark Wizard ever could enchant his diary to get passed them. It was created in Hogwarts after all. And that same wizard could help to get a troll inside.

#+begin_quote
  Muggle sports
#+end_quote

Why? If the muggleborns wanted them they are free to form their own clubs and play. Nothing is preventing them.

#+begin_quote
  Better career guidance
#+end_quote

They did have a good one. Just because Harry wants to be an Auror, his head of the house shouldn't spend 5 hours trying to convince him otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  Healing course
#+end_quote

Why? And besides, there is a lack in teachers and not every child will want it. I mean, Muggles don't get Doctors courses unless they want to be doctors.

#+begin_quote
  Dueling course
#+end_quote

That was tried in the second year. It was a massive failure. Combined with the lack of teachers and the fact that there is a different teacher for DADA and it simply becomes not feasible.

#+begin_quote
  PE class
#+end_quote

Why? And even in Muggle schools, forced PE classes generally are not really all that well liked by everyone. Sportsy people enjoy them, others might find them a time waster.

#+begin_quote
  Sell off the stuff in the room of requirement to pay for it all,
#+end_quote

Except for the fact that no one knows about it.

#+begin_quote
  or make a magical museum out of it and charge admittance.
#+end_quote

In a school out of all things? And most of the stuff there was junk anyway. Also, why paid museum?

#+begin_quote
  Field trips
#+end_quote

Forced field trips, especially the ones you have to pay for, are the worst things about schools.

#+begin_quote
  More inclusive (Invite vampires and shit), double edged sword because werewolves are a bad idea-
#+end_quote

You yourself pointed out why that is a bad idea.

#+begin_quote
  Gather donations from alumni.
#+end_quote

Why?

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts reunions to drum up some money maybe.
#+end_quote

No one would attend paid reunions.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of paying for something as far as they know might be parlor tricks that won't earn a good living.
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is free. No tuition fee no nothing. All they need to buy are books, a wand, and clothing. Schools supplies for seven people (Used) are less than a single galeon.

#+begin_quote
  DADA - change the name
#+end_quote

Why?

#+begin_quote
  or have Tom Riddle's award to the school be a hocrux
#+end_quote

why?

#+begin_quote
  handling the curse and destroy it (Hire cursebreakers to go through every inch of the school or have Aurors do it.).
#+end_quote

One of the most powerful wizard in Wizarding Britain couldn't break it in 31 years so no fresh out of the school curse breaker ever will.

#+begin_quote
  Practical skills aren't much seen
#+end_quote

They are in charms and DADA. And Transfiguration has lots of practicality, most of it is just for the upper years tho.

#+begin_quote
  I mean wand inspection day, have all the students wands tested since Neville and Ron used floppy wands and that's just no good- they weren't getting a good education with those things.
#+end_quote

Doesn't work. Using your fathers/grandfathers wand is kinda a tradition and even us muggles are ready to hang people when they tell us to abandon or change our traditions. And besides, in rare cases like Ron's where the wand breaks, people would assume they would go to their head of the house and solve the problem

#+begin_quote
  Maybe teach wand crafting and shit so they can make their own
#+end_quote

Maybe teach people Rocket science, it might help if you ever need to leave the planet in an emergency. My point is, that just like rocket science, wand crafting is a long and serious and hard work.

#+begin_quote
  when you're dependent on a stick and don't learn how to make one- well that's just kinda silly when it's supposedly so essential.
#+end_quote

I see. So you know how to make all of your essentials then? Food, water, house and all that stuff?

#+begin_quote
  Wandless magic (maybe for 6/7th years if it takes a lot of power), wands are often seen as a crutch.
#+end_quote

Except it is never needed. It only is useful in war times. And those are supposed to be rare. Even then only the most gifted can do it, and even they prefer using wands.

#+begin_quote
  Have the sorting hat screen for abuse
#+end_quote

Great idea. Let's let a hat mind rape your secrets and hope that someone will help you. Harry was starved, people knew that and nobody did a thing.

#+begin_quote
  check ups for all students- perhaps requiring wizarding vaccinations before admittance.
#+end_quote

According to Rowling magic cures all non-magical diseases. Here's the quote:

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.
