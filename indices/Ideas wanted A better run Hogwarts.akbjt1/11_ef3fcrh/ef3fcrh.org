  NEWT students required to tutor younger kids (1hr a week)
#+end_quote

Pain in the ass- Newts are already stressful as hell apparently- do it on a volunteer only basis, perhaps paid or with extra credit- same with student teaching assistants

  House elves run a small farm to keep food cost down
#+end_quote

Been done a time or two- I even saw a fic where the supposed real purpose of the Room of Requirement was to serve as a farm during sieges, simulating perfectly an outdoor environment- and leading some credence to it... the great hall- one of their earlier attempts at an indoor greenhouse stronger than glass (I assume unbreakable charms depend on the base material at least partly with this theory)

  Eight story library split by year. Firsts year on first story going up. Eighth floor for restricted action. Students can only go one floor above their grade
#+end_quote

I've seen all house common rooms with temporary copies of relevant texts/supplementary reading for each year done before, using professors I think to supervise, gradually ending house prejudice, it was a bit too easy though, crack for sure.

Now, further ideas:

Start off teaching the brats about the wizarding world/school- yep, orientation day, sucks for them but at least no work the first "class day".

A guided tour through Hogwarts and/or maps handed out that at least show the route to their classes, the library, bathrooms, the healer's office and the great hall and stuff.

Start off the kids with occulmancy classes if you want to make it easier for them to learn and depending on how you want your occulmancy to work. Obviously Snape and Dumbledore wouldn't like not being able to peek in the minds of trouble makers so sadly you have to kill them or ship them off to the Goblin mines to shovel dragon shit, or have them have a change of heart or something.

Muggle subjects- at least a writing class for first years so they know how the hell to write essays and what is expected out of those essays.

Latin Class so they understand spell composition better. (though it's all supposedly pseudo latin anyway)

History: Replace Binns, possibly with ghosts/paintings that aren't boring and experienced history- or have a teacher that uses those as guest speakers. Possibly have Mrs Frizzle teach the class- or maybe Mr Peabody- I seem to remember a fic where Mr Peabody adopted Harry as his boy and eventually took over for Binns.

Castle could probably use insulating- and electricity would be nice for the muggleborns if you can work out how to plausibly make it work- one fic I saw had them build something just outside of the wards, a power generator and a 'modern' muggle home otherwise for the most part- revamped muggle studies.

Wards need updating bad- trolls shouldn't get in school, nor cursed diaries or any of the really bad stuff on the list of banned items, nor howlers, etc.

Quills suck- a lot of fics have them as wand cores to prevent cheating or spelled to but nothings stopping them from just putting those same cores or whole quills into a felt pen or something. Paper would be nice too.

Muggle sports, or at least a basketball like version of Quiditch. Quadpot too (again on broom sticks but one of the balls explodes like hot potato or something)

Better career guidance- perhaps allowing shadowing of professionals and/or career days.

Healing course

Dueling course

More diverse meals, healthier too possibly

PE class

Sell off the stuff in the room of requirement to pay for it all, or make a magical museum out of it and charge admittance.

Better potions classes if your Snape is incompetent (Some fics show him as strict because potions is dangerous and for all we know his first lesson was why to take potions seriously and after that he started at the beginning with basics of potion preparations and potion ingredient reactions charts and shit.

A planetarium so kids don't have to ruin their sleep schedule a night every week- instead have outdoor classes once or twice a year or something.

Field trips- I've seen trips to the ministry of magic, muggle london (for muggle studies students) and the bank because goblins.

More inclusive (Invite vampires and shit), double edged sword because werewolves are a bad idea- they let the thing roam free on full moon nights putting everyone in danger- Snape almost got eaten by the thing- sure it's not his fault but safety should be any schools first priority followed by a good education.

Gather donations from alumni.

Hogwarts reunions to drum up some money maybe.

Yearly/biyearly dances/proms (Research what's done in the UK, I know it's different from the US)

Have the elves provide birthday kids with cake.

Parent/teacher days where the muggles can see what their kids are learning instead of paying for something as far as they know might be parlor tricks that won't earn a good living.

DADA - change the name or have Tom Riddle's award to the school be a hocrux and/or carry the curse of DADA- and destroy it- or have the Diadem in the room of requirement handling the curse and destroy it (Hire cursebreakers to go through every inch of the school or have Aurors do it.). Target practice should be a thing- paintball (with a paint spell) dodge ball (With levitating spells) to help learn aiming/blocking unfriendly AKs with a solid object might work.

Practical skills aren't much seen- it's like most of the classes are teaching the fundamentals necessary for preforming any spell (transfiguration doesn't make much sense if that's not the case)- which means the only people getting a good education are self-motivated people and those that spend a lot of time in the library researching new spells like Hermione- you should change that- kids shouldn't be expected to know that without being told or be expected put in the effort needed on their own. It's like they're breeding incompetence.

Penis, er, I mean wand inspection day, have all the students wands tested since Neville and Ron used floppy wands and that's just no good- they weren't getting a good education with those things.

Maybe teach wand crafting and shit so they can make their own- at least a basic wand that will be better than nothing in an emergency- when you're dependent on a stick and don't learn how to make one- well that's just kinda silly when it's supposedly so essential.

Wandless magic (maybe for 6/7th years if it takes a lot of power), wands are often seen as a crutch.

And that's just off the top of my head.

Edit: No one should hold more than two positions, much less 3 or more- no time for that. Possibly dedicated heads of houses (hundreds of kids with no supervision- no wonder things get so crazy). Possibly more teachers.

Edit 2: Have the sorting hat screen for abuse and/or have mandatory check ups for all students- perhaps requiring wizarding vaccinations before admittance.
