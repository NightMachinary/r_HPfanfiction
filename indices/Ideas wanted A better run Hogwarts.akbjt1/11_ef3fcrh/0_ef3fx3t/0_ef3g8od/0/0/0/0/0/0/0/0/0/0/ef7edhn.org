So all werewolves are bad because most of the British ones rally behind a madman in desperation? That's... a viewpoint I don't share, but fair enough.

(Again, I agree that these specific people should be punished for what they did. They are not 'good' people. But they are not 'evil' because they are werewolves, but because what society paints them as. Saying their species is at fault is, in the end, racist, as there is no canon proof that all werewolves are evil (except for Remus, for some reason).)

In the end, even canon rebukes this, obviously painting the anti werewolf legislations as evil (as seen e.g. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-werewolf_legislation][here]] ) as well as depicting discriminating actions, like Lyall Lupin calling werewolves "soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death", as a bad thing.

I'm not even saying that it isn't fair game to paint them however you want in fanfiction, I just disagree that canon demonises them to the extent you've been describing.
