  I never said that they were evil because they are werewolves. I said that 90% of the werewolves in canon are evil and that they are evil because they rally behind a child murderer and do the bidding of magical Hitler.

Well, to me it pretty much looked like you said it's not racist to say werewolves are evil:

  Given how Lupin is the only non-murderous werewolf, that is not called racism (speciesism?) but common sense. Werewolves are not cuddly men who have a chocolate addiction, they are killer machines who live to spread their curse by brutally attacking others.

Because otherwise I totally agree, besides Remus all canon werewolves seen are pretty much bad guys and it doesn't speak too much for them that they rally behind people like Greyback or Voldemort. Though I can still see where they are coming from, even if this is obviously not the right way to go. (In the end, Remus /was/ privileged, being allowed to even attend Hogwarts...)

  He is not book canon in that form. In the books, he pisses of Greyback, who promptly decides to get retribution by infecting Remus. And that's the guy the other werewolves chose as their leader. Which brings us back to the first part.

Fair enough, he's not canon. I was just trying to show how the whole universe tries to make it clear that not all werewolves are evil by showing that anti werewolf laws and phrases are bad too. Umbridge's anti-werewolf legislation /is/ canon after all.

And I still believe it was Greyback choosing himself as the leader by simply rallying other werewolves with no other options to his cause. I mean, it's probably better than to be oppressed and hated by everyone with no reason? At least in their mind. Rallying up the unsatisfied people is surprisingly easy as a bad guy... Guess what Hitler did, too, in the end... :/
