And that legalisation is probably the only thing where Umbridge had a point. I mean, not even Lupin was safe to be around because, as proven in canon, wolfsbane is not foolproof. Even the "best" werewolf came very close to mauling/infecting three children through gross negligence on his side (and Snape's). That's why hating werewolves is common sense. There is no safe werewolf. Each of them we get to know is proven dangerous.

A general workplace ban is the wrong option, but the current legalisation is entirely inadequate. Ideally, you would detain them in a secure location around the full moon and force them to wear a tracking device. And chuck the criminal ones into Azkaban of course.
