Your answer actually doesn't contradict mine. At least not directly. I never denied that there were loads of werewolves working for Voldemort, but we never know if they are being murderous assholes for fun (like Greyback) or if they're angry at being denied their basic human rights based on a condition outside of their own control.

Of course, what they end up doing is terrorism. I'm not questioning that - I'm questioning their motivation. I believe that it's more desperation driving them than simply all of them being mindless beasts.

There actually is a quote in your linked article making it even clearer to me:

#+begin_quote
  *Remus Lupin*: "/I've been living among my fellows, my equals. Werewolves,... I'm not complaining it is necessary work and who better to do it than I?/"\\
  *Harry Potter*: "/How come they like Voldemort?/"\\
  *Remus Lupin*: "/They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life./ "
#+end_quote

So... Yes, in canon there is a group of terrorist-werewolves around. But basing all werewolf personality traits on a group of extremists can't be right either. As this is exactly what's making these extremists get their followers.

(Imagine it being switched around - werewolves are ruling and humans do not have the right to work and need to register themselves. How long would you think it takes for a group of the most violent humans to gather a lot more sympathisers who just want their basic rights, forming a big terror organisation? Does this mean all humans in this scenario are evil now?)
