Where do you get that idea from? I mean sure, Greyback is practically the definition of what you describe, but other than him and Remus we know practically no werewolf in canon. We do know though that the wizarding world in general seems to heavily discriminate against them, with Remus unable to really get a job, everyone being afraid of / outright hating werewolves etc. (Not sure if this 'Umbridge always tries to push stricter anti-Werewolf laws' thing is canon or fanon though.) Which might possibly be connected with them having a very bad reputation, thanks to people like Greyback, so... yes, there are most definitely /some/ werewolves like him.

But honestly, the probability of many werewolves being simply normal people who are driven to violence as they're already heavily discriminated against (werewolves are not allowed to go to school for example, as Remus was an exception thanks to Dumbledore) is pretty high in my opinion. So it would be really easy to rally them against the rest of the wizard society (which in turn, of course, confirms what the rest of the society thinks about them, thus creating a vicious cycle). That doesn't mean that they're all mindless killers though. If anything, admitting werewolf children to a school, granting them the same rights as 'normal' wizards would probably help to improve the general 'werewolf problem' by a lot in the long term...

Of course, that part is speculation too, but just based on what we know of the two canon werewolves we have really isn't enough to say that all werewolves are murderous beasts. At least not in the Harry Potter canon. (I mean - in their wolf form they most probably are, but that really only is a case once a month, during which there are possibilities to create safe environments for them to transform, I assume)
