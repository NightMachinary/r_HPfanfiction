So how is that an argument regarding safety? In the Harry Potter universe, every eleven year old kid is running around with a wand that can kill you with, like, thousands of spells and nobody cares... And there are dozens of dark wizards 'proven to be dangerous' and it's still not common sense to hate all wizards for it. (Well, there always seem to be marginalised groups of wizards too though - and surprise, they often start rebelling as well, like muggleborns under Voldemort's regime)

To be fair, better laws regarding the actual transformation would probably make sense, but everything that's touching the ~29 days/nights a month where a werewolf is /not/ dangerous (at least not because of his 'condition') is just wrong.

I feel like we're going in circles by now though, so perhaps it would be simpler to just 'agree to disagree' on this issue, seeing how it was simply not a focus in the books so basing arguments on the scraps available is pretty hard and ends up automatically going into the assumption route.\\
You assume they're mostly evil (?), I assume they're mostly desperate. We'll never know - but that's what fanfictions are for, I guess. We can read/write whatever we prefer.
