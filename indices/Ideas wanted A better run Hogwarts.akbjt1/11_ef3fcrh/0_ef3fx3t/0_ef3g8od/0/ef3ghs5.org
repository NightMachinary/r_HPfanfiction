It would only be one night a month and we know that using the room as something else doesn't affect the other rooms.

And since they would know everyone who was a werewolf they could have them get together and the have a healer give the potions so they would know everyone got them. And since the bite only takes effect during the full moon no matter how much peer pressure it wouldn't matter. And I am sure the house elves could find anyone missing or running late.
