It's a waste of the room- it's basically a holodeck that's criminally underused.

I'm thinking a separate property off hogwarts grounds for werewolves that they floo to on the night of full moons.

After all, Remus forgot his Wolvesbane and that's just too risky. Besides that, kids are dumb- I could easily imagine some kid /wanting/ to become a werewolf and convincing an even bigger idiot to give him a little nibble. Edit: Hell- not just kids- there are adult furries that would love nothing better.
