And why are you restricting non-restricted knowledge? Hamper learning, will you? Yes, not everybody is Merlin, Dumbledore or Voldemort but a lot of kids will learn extra stuff in areas they are interested in and the true geniuses will not like it if you don't let them learn (some might even transfer to Durmstrang etc.)!

No trick-stairs (and other such dangers!), no sexist staircases! Either the boys dorms also get a defense against girls or the girls get theirs removed!

Economics class and politics (for people who are interested)

Wizard-Studies for muggle borns (mandatory for muggleborns and muggle raised half-bloods!) and Muggle-Studies (not taught by a pureblood, but by a muggleborn - mandatory for purebloods and wizard raised half-bloods!)

More teachers (seriously, I doubt McGonagall has any free time - Deputy Headmistress, Head of House, Transfiguration teacher etc. - I bet she'd love not teaching the first 3-4 Years! Only taking OWL-Year and above students! Same goes for Snape, I bet he'd be friedlier (or at least not a total asshole) if he had time for more research and less "dunderheads" to teach!)

Students get their own rooms (can't do homework in a crowded and loud common room! Hell, even a library isn't the quietest of places!)

Students can earn special rewards (peeks at the teachers' private book collections or something like that!) and are allowed to decorate their rooms (older students might to expansion charms, transfigurations etc.)
