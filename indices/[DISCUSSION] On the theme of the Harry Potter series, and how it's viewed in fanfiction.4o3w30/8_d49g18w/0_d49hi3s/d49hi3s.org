Actually they weren't starving him. He got three meals a day; the only meal we see is a bowl of cold soup which, while being a shitty dinner, provides enough sustenance for a small twelve year old.

I'm partially playing devil's advocate here, but honestly, what we see in PS and COS was the extreme of their treatment. In PS he got his 'longest punishment to date' which was about a fortnight grounded; this is based on the assumption that Dudley's birthday falls in early to mid June, and he was ungrounded when school let out. However, I'm also assuming 'locked in the cupboard' is being grounded (ie, he can attend school but is not allowed to roam outside afterwards; is allowed out for meals and washroom use) and not literally being in the cupboard 24/7.

In CoS, he was also essentially grounded (albeit indefinitely). But, by his own admission, he wasn't /ever/ starved in his life (GoF believe is where Harry says it 'the dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he had never been allowed to eat as much as he liked'); again, I am interpreting 'not allowed to eat as much as he liked' to mean he wasn't allowed seconds or thirds, rather than denying him full meals.

All this said, the first few books obviously have exaggerations and are more fairy-tale-esque than the later ones, so I tend to dislike viewing them through a real-life lens, because as we all know, keeping a child in a cupboard is abuse IRL; but in PS it's just part of the fairy tale nature of the evil family trope.
