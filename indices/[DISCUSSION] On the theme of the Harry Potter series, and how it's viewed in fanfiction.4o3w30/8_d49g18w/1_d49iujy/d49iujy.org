They had him locked up / they had grounded him for the debacle with Dobby, where they not only got to know that he wasn't allowed to use magic, but also that he (supposedly) *had*. Also, as [[/u/derive-dat-ass][u/derive-dat-ass]] said, they didn't really starve him.

I don't ever expect fanfiction to be canon, or even be close to it, but I'm expecting a Harry Potter fanfiction, not a random book. Not that it was a bad story, but look at Emperor. Is it unreasonable to expect at least /something/ to be set in the world, except the fact that magic exists and you've named your OC Harry Potter. Deviation from Canon is good, it's excellent, but at least be in the world of Harry Potter.
