The massive problem with the themes in the Harry Potter books as I see them are twofold. The first is the obvious upping of the darkness factor as the books go on. In PS the Dursleys treatment of Harry isn't meant to be seen as some horrific abusive treatment of a child, it's all just a framing device for a childrens book, one that's been used for hundreds of years the protagonist is a downtrodden servant to a horrible family but it turns out that he's actually really special. Harry Potter is basically magical Cinderella, that is all it is, it's a whimsical kids book about a kid who finds out he's actually a rich, superfamous hero wizard. It's kid wish fulfillment.

However as Rowling decided to target the original readers as they aged with the next books (smart move) they get darker and darker. As that happens it becomes difficult to reconcile the earlier whimsical adventures with the darker later series. I think she realised this and toned down the extent of the Dursleys abuse in subsequent books.

The second problem when it comes to fanfiction is no matter how dark the books get, they're still young adult books. They also happen to be the best selling young adult fiction books ever with a hugeee fanbase consequently every single little scrap of information has been deeply read into, every character interactions EVERYTHING. This isn't ASoIaF where every minor sentence may hold a clue to a characters feelings or motivation but yet people still read the books that way and they use it to pull character motivations and opinions that might not be there.
