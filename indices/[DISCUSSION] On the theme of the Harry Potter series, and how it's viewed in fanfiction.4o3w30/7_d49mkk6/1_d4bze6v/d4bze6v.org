It's part of the running theme that's been there from book one, unfortunately. From the beginning, 'ambition' is seen as evil. The house of the bullies and bad people is associated heavily with being ambitious, and wanting to achieve great things through whatever means one has. By contrast, the exalted Gryffindor house is a house of the passive, in bravely embracing that which is expected of you, rather than fighting it to become something greater, like a slimy Slytherin might.

Harry receives a magical item from Dumbledore that makes him completely unseen, therefore the perfect passive observer, and also is related to the Peverell myth in-universe. Which brother survived? Oh yeah, the one who hid and acted completely passive rather than attempting to actually do something with his life-changing gift. And so, the pattern repeats itself. Wanting to do things that are important to you is denigrated, like Hermione with her house elves. Doing what others expect of you is exalted as your nature, as per Dumbledore's little chats with Harry. Don't be ambitious, go with the flow and be brave about it. God help you if you're poor, and don't have a fucking vault full of your parents' cash to fall back on in times of need. According to Rowling, if you're from a poor starving family, it's probably better if you just starve, because being ambitious and wanting to actively raise your station in life is unnatural, and in some cases, evil. Classism, basically. Know your place, peasant.

God help you if you don't have rich friends of your parents to randomly give you a top-of-the-line Quidditch broom, so that you never have to worry about winning ever again. If Harry had had to use a crappy broom, and won anyway, that would be something, but he's practically cheating in canon. He denigrates the Slytherins when Malfoy's father buys a bunch of new brooms so they can beat him, yet nobody points out that his Firebolt is... well, doing exactly the same bloody thing. And this hypocrisy is seen as a /good/ thing, that should be emulated. God, some of the messages in the HP series are just absolutely poisonous when examined up close...

The Voldemort/Harry dichotomy is an important part of a larger pattern, and I think you're absolutely right in pointing it out.
