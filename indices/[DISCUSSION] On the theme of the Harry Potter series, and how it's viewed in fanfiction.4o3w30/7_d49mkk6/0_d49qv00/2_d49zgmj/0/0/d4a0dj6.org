Thanks for demonstrating my point. The Killing Curse is much more severe than the Cruciatus, and yet this distortion of canon doesn't matter to you. It's not important to you whether Draco tried to hurt or kill Harry. Just like it doesn't matter to you whether the Dursleys neglected or abused Harry. Your inability to understand nuance is the prime fault that I criticized in the first place.
