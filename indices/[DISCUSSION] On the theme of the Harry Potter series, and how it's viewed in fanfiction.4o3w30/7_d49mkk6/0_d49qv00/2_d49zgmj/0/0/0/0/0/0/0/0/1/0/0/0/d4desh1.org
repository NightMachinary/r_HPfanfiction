Yes, if you look at it as an isolated incident with no history between Harry and Draco. But there is history between them, quite a lot in fact, and for some people Harry attacking Draco and blaming it on him wouldn't be that much of a stretch, even if /we/ know it to be untrue. As already noted, that does mess up with the “intent” bit; we know the act was not deliberate and not intended, but people in-universe might see it otherwise.
