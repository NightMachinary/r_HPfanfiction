While I don't like Draco, I will point out that going straight-out to memory reading or pensieves isn't something we've seen happen in the books at any point when it comes to situations of this ilk. They'd just go for checking what spells were cast and that's it as soon as it becomes apparent that Harry did cast and Draco did not cast, unless the last few spells of Draco's were just as questionable in nature. Not to mention that the one to discover it was Snape, who we know had reasons not to go for memory reading or using a pensieve, too, which you seem to be forgetting because it's more convenient to you that way.

I won't say why exactly he got off because it's played poorly as far as I see it too, but no, from my perspective right now you are simply going “oh, I know better, it has to be as I say”.
