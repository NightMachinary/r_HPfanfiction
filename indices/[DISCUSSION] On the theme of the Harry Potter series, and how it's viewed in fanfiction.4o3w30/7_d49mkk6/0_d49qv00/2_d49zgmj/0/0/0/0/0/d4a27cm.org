If you have reasonable cause to suspect you'll be killed - and Draco using an Unforgivable is enough of a reason to suspect that he'll kill you instead of risking Azkaban - you are allowed to use lethal force.

And even so, if someone wants to torture you - and please stop treating this as "brief harm", it's fucking torture, the worst pain you'll ever feel - you are allowed to defend yourself with lethal force. You seem to have no clue what torture does to people.

You could make a case that "reasonable force" means stunning should be done - but that only works if the stunner is actually as effective as the lethal spell. And even in that case, Harry could easily claim that, faced with being tortured, he didn't think of using that spell, and that would be an excusable overreaction - a judge wouldn't expect him to keep his calm and act fully rational if threatened with a Torture Curse.
