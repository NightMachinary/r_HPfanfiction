Do you understand that just because Draco is forced to murder Dumbledore doesn't mean he can use that as an excuse for every crime he commits? Or do you actually honestly believe that Draco could kill Blaise, Pansy and Daphne for shit and giggles, and still claim "I was under duress"?

Punishing Harry for reacting with a lethal curse in the face of a torture curse - which he had been suffering from before - is sick, wrong and evil. If that's how Hogwarts is run, then no wonder that no one opposed Voldemort, and so many innocents were murdered. Hogwarts basically teaches you "Defending yourself is wrong! Murdering innocents is right!"
