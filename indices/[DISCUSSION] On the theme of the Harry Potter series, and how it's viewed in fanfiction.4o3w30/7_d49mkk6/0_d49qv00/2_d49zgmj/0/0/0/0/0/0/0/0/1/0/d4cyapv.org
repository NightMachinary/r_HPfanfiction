As far as I know, if she had an unknown thing that she just found on the spot and tried to use it to defend herself when the act was already occurring or at least there was proof that it would have occurred, it would count as manslaughter which is a crime but generally not something you get sent to jail for, especially not if it was done in self-defence and in a crisis situation.

That said, what Harry did was essentially taking this unknown thing and aiming it at someone who was basically acting threatening but hasn't thrown the punch yet, and then pulling the trigger, all that while carrying around a taser he could have used instead. So Harry's case isn't being judged as harming someone by accident because there's enough signs that say “this was on purpose, unless this guy is a complete moron” that it was easier to think it deliberate from Harry (the deliberation which, might I remind you and others who will read it, makes for the difference between murder and manslaughter).
