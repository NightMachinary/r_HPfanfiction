Well, generally I do write exactly like that - "And now they do X because it makes sense for them". My HP/BtVS crossover was planned to focus on Hermione spy at Hogwarts and play a cat and mouse game with Umbridge in 5th year. I wrecked the plot on the first day school began, because the reactions of the different characters that led to that simply made more sense than what I had planned. "Patron" had major changes to other characters simply because I wanted a Dumbledore who actually acted wise, experienced and benevolent. So, he'd not ruin the education of his students by hiring incompetent teachers. Which meant neither Quirrell nor Lockhart were incompetent. He wouldn't leave Harry with a family who hated the boy, so the Dursleys didn't hate him - they still feared magic though. And so on.

Characters should move the plot, not the other way around.
