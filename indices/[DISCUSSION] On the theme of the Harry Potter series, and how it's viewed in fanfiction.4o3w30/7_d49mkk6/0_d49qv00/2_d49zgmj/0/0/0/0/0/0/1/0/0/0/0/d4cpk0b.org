Sigh. What motivates Draco doesn't matter when it comes to judge Harry's action - you'd know that if you had any idea about law. Harry knows that Draco is about to curse him. He doesn't know, nor does he have to know why - all he knows is that he is in immediate danger. That's what makes it self-defense situation.

Draco on the other hand is under duress with regards to murdering Dumbledore. Not with regards to attacking Harry. He cannot claim successfully that the Dark Lord forced him to use a Torture Curse on Harry because Voldemort didn't do that. Draco has the order to murder Dumbledore. Not to torture Harry. He can't, say, kill students and then claim Voldemort made him do it. (Well, he can claim it, but it's not true.)

Or, I'm trying to break this down to a concept you might understand, obviously being a layman: If a bank director's family is kidnapped and he is forced to go and get the money from the vault for the kidnappers, he can't kill his neighbour for trying to talk about the weather or the lawnmower he borrowed last week and hasn't returned yet and then claim he was under duress.

Unless Draco was specifically told "curse Harry with the Torture Curse if you face him or we'll kill your parents", he used an Unforgivable without being pressured to do so.
