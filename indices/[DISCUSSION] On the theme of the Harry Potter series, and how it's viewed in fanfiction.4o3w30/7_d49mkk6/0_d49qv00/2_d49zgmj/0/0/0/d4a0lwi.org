I think the Longbottoms would like to have a word about you with regards to how harmless the Torture Curse is. If they had a mind left to talk.

It's not important whether Draco tried to kill or /torture/ Harry - either way, lethal force to defend himself is justified. Especially since Harry has to expect that Draco will not leave him alive after torturing him, since he'll not want to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban for casting the Trorture Curse.

(Canon rates the same punishment for either curse as well, by the way.)
