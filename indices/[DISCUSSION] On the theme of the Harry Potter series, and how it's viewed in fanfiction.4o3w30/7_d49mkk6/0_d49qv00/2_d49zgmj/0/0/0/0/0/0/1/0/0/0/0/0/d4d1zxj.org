Draco's family and himself would have been murdered if he failed at the task he was given. Yes, this counts as duress.

You're latching on to the "Harry is in danger" thing. It's not the issue here. Both Harry and Draco were at confusing situations - Draco particularly. Harry himself used the Cruciatus in those situations, and wasn't sent to Azkaban. I already said that Harry's use of the curse is legally ambivalent, but again, it is very much /not/ the lawful thing to do.

Once again - Harry used a curse which he doesn't know, that he never cast before, in self-defense, instead of using a spell like a Stunner that he is familiar with. You'd expect the opposite in this situation.

Harry gets punished because he did something that was completely opposite of what is taught at Hogwarts. He acted stupidly. He got punished for it. I understand why your personal sense of justice protests that, but it doesn't matter, but the punishment was not out of place. The fact that it was given shows that this is how things are done in the Potterverse, which doesn't comply with your personal sense of justice. You don't like it, but that's how things work, so stop inserting your own morality into this.
