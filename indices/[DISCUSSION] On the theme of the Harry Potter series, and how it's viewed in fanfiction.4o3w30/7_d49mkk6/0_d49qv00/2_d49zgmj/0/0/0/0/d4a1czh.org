The Longbottoms were tortured for a long time by a master of the curse. Draco probably didn't even have the kind of sadism necessary to fuel a proper Cruciatus, as we see in DH, and he wouldn't have killed Harry, as we see in the beginning of the year. He used the curse in exactly the same situation that Harry used it - in a time of extreme emotional aggravation.

It's very important whether Draco tried to kill Harry or just to bring him pain. This isn't even nuance, that is... the basic difference between instant death and a short bout of pain. It's mind-boggling how you just take those to be of the same severity. People who think Draco was trying to kill Harry instead of just hurt him are the same who think the Dursleys beat Harry every day instead of simply neglecting him. A complete distortion and misunderstanding of canon.

I also don't know where you take your morality or law from. In reality, the use of lethal force is very rarely justified by law. Notice that Crouch only authorized the use of the Killing Curse when dealing with Death Eaters when the war got very severe. There's a long tradition of military ethics about what is okay to do at war. The term "war crime" refers, in this instance, to the use of lethal force when other ways of subduing an opponent (i.e. Stunning) is optional. You'd know that if you had actually bothered to read about actual war history instead of wars in fantasy fiction. All of this is even without mentioning the extreme complexity of Draco's situation in HBP (in real wars, when someone commits a crime under a threat to his or his family's life - like Draco explicitly said in HBP - he might not be punished at all).
