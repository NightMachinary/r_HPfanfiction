It doesn't matter what motivates Draco - Harry sees him attacking with a spell that will see Draco in prison for the rest of his life. That means he can reasonably assume that Draco will not let him live and testify.

Harry had a way to subdue him, but he was in a situation where he couldn't be expected to think rationally and cool under pressure. He was already a victim of that spell. Of torture. It's entirely excusable that he reacted with the first thing he thought of.

He does not deserve punishment for almost killing Draco.

And you don't understand Draco's legal situation at all. He was not forced to use an unforgivable. Voldemort didn't tell him "Use the torture curse on Harry". Voldemort told him to kill Dumbledore. Draco had other spells to use. (That you condemn Harry for defending himself, but not Draco for trying to use the Torture Curse says a lot about your morals.)

Harry getting punished is the same as black women getting executed for defending themselves against white rapists in the Deep South - a sick and wrong act.
