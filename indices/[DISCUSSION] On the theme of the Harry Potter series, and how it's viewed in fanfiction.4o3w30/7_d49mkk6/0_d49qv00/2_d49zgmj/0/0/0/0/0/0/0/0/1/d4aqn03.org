If the UK actually assumes that a victim of a violent crime, like a woman about to be raped, can be expected to pick the most appropriate means of defense and not the first that comes to mind, and would prosecute her for killing the rapist, then there's something really, really wrong with its law. It certainly is not the case here in Switzerland.
