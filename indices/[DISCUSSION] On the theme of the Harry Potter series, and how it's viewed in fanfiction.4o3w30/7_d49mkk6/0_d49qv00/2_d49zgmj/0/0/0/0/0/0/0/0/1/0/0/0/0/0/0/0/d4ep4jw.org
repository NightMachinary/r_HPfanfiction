I won't argue that the plot isn't railroaded way too heavily in the last books, because it is, including this moment. What I am arguing about is that though for us the situation is railroaded, the characters did have reasons to act the way they did; admittedly the fact that they had those reasons was railroading itself (Dumbledore trying to redeem Draco, for one, or Snape not wanting anyone to know that he'd created a curse like a bajilion years ago) and a stupid one at that, but if you want the outcome of the scene to be different then you'd have to rewrite those reasons of the characters and not just take the scene and go “oh, and now they do [x] because it makes sense to me”

/That/ is what I am talking about. Because it's common knowledge that many characters in the last books behaved as if they were just plot devices, and much of their motivation and reasons were plot-devicey, so if you want to change how they act you'd have to basically rewrite them into real characters rather than just change the outcome of some scene because it doesn't align with your vision; of course it won't, not with characters written to make the plot move as it does.
