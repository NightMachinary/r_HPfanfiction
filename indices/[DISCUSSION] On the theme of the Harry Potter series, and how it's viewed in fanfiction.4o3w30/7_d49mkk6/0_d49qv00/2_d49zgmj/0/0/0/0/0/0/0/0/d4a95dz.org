You're right, I don't live in America. The use of lethal force IRL and in HP is very different, because, as I said, using a Stunner is just as effective as a Sectumsempra, while IRL you don't have that level of control with guns. Still, you'll find that most European countries aren't so lax about it. If we're talking about the UK, which is where our story takes place, it can reach quite ridiculous levels where robbers who were injured by home owners can often sue them (see this [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-125551/Wounded-burglar-sues-Martin.html][article]] for example).

The key here is intention, which is made much clearer when using magic. If your intention is to hurt or maim, it is unlawful, while if you're just trying to subdue, it is legal. To use a curse that maims instead of one that stuns is certainly regarded as unreasonable by law - both state law and war law.
