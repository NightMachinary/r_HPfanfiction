That's not what I mean by duress. You're talking about how Harry was stressed in that scene. Well, look at Draco. When Harry finds him, he's literally having a nervous breakdown and crying to a ghost in a bathroom because the Dark Lord is threatening to kill him and his family if he doesn't carry out his plan - he says so plainly to Myrtle. He is clearly not acting out of his own will, or tries harming people for "shits and giggles". He had Harry at his mercy on the train and didn't do anything. He is much, much more terrified and confused during that situation than Harry is. Just like Harry lashed out with a Sectumsempra instead of a Stunner, Draco lashed out with a Cruciatus.

You're presenting things as black or white, right or wrong, but as I said, this situation is much more complex. It isn't alright killing someone just because he had committed a crime, when you can subdue him at any other way. Perhaps this is your sense of justice, but know that many others see it as needless violence.

Harry wasn't punished because he used a lethal curse in a duel, he was punished because he did something that goes against everything that is taught at Hogwarts - that is, using a spell in a very dangerous manner. I have already wrote about how even harmless spells you are not familiar with can have disastrous results. McGonagall and Snape basically wanted to drive that lesson to Harry's mind (Harry had earlier actually planned to test that curse on McLaggen, just to demonstrate how bad his judgement in that matter was). Whether Draco should have been punished is an entirely different matter, which has more to do with Dumbledore's stupid plan than with the school or justice.
