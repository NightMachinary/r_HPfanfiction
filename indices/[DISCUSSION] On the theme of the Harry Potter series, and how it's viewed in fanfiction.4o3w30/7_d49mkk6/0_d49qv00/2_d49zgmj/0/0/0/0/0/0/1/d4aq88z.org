If someone wants to torture you, you are allowed to use lethal force. That is the law in the Western World. Just like you are allowed to use lethal means to defend against a rapist. If you have non-lethal means which are as effective, then you should use those - but that's usually not the case in our world. We just had such a case at court yesterday.

Harry had all the reason to assume Draco would torture him, and then kill him to cover his tracks. that's a clear cut means of self-defense.

Your weird, sick idea would mean that if someone wants to kidnap and torture you, you'd not be allowed to shoot him in self-defense. That is not the case, I assure you.

Self-defense does not apply to revenge, it's in response to an immediate or on-going attack. Again, you seem to not understand the law.

What Harry did is justified by any decent law since in his situation, no one could expect him to react cool and controlled and choose a stunner as if he was an experienced auror. He was a kid, threatened with torture and death, and simply reacted with a spell he hoped would save him.

Draco on the other hand should have been sent to Azkaban for life for his attempt at an unforgivable.
