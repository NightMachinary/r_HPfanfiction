No, I'm sorry, it appears that you just don't understand the law - and Switzerland is very different from other European nations in its regard for using weapons.

Don't confuse self-defense with "lethal force". It's not the case. I've already explained why shooting someone is extremely different from cursing someone. If someone is raped and shoots the attacker, he does it in order to incapacitate the attacker. It might lead to death as a side result. The intention here is the difference. Harry had a way to subdue Malfoy without using lethal force, and he chose a potentially lethal way. That he was confused is understandable, but it's still /not/ the way to handle things legally.

Draco was acting under threat of death to his and his family's life - duress. In many Western courts, that would absolve him of guilt. Again, this is actual law, not your idea of what a "decent law" is.

There is a current ongoing legal debate in Israel over a soldier who had shot a terrorist after the terrorist was down. The soldier claims that he did it because he thought the terrorist was still dangerous, which is understandable, but there are witnesses who claim the opposite - that the soldier simply wanted to kill the terrorist, who posed no threat. In this case, the soldier would go to jail for using needless lethal force. The very same could be said for using a lethal curse instead of a stunner.

And, once again, let me remind you that we are talking about a school punishment here, not a court punishment. And Harry certainly deserved that punishment, if only to teach him not to use curses which he doesn't know the effect of and could potentially be lethal, in a fight where he /didn't/ intend to kill his opponent.
