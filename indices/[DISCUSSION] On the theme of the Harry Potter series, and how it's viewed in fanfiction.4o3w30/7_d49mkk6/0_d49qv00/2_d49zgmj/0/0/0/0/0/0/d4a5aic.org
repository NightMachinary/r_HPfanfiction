First off, don't inject your own morality into this. We're talking law here. Lethal force is something that's only employed when no other means of protection are available. It doesn't apply in this case.

If someone wants to torture you, you are /not/ allowed to use lethal force, not according to the standards of the western world. The assailant's intentions are irrelevant. And, as I said, I don't think Draco had it in him to use the Cruciatus to its full extent - it would have been hurtful, but not torture, as we've seen with Harry's usage of it in OotP. (And it's not exactly an isolated case in the series - one can make the claim that Hermione's parchment curse tortured Marietta, and, according to you, it gives Marietta the justification to kill her.)

A stunner would be just as effective as a Sectumsempra. Harry would certainly, in this case, have an excuse, but it doesn't mean that this is the acceptable reaction. You'd expect him to use a spell like a Stunner, which he knows intimately, rather than a spell he never cast before and that doesn't know the effect of.

The final point here - if we go back to the original comment - is that Harry was punished for what he did. He was punished because what he did went against everything that Hogwarts teaches. First, he caused a potentially lethal injury to a fellow student instead of using a Stunning spell - or just getting out - and second, he used a curse which he didn't know, which he never cast before, and that /could/ be lethal to his understanding (/"for enemies"/). Hogwarts teaches to use magic safely. What Harry did is something that simply should not be done, no matter the situation - spells have to be practiced and taught properly, because even the most harmless spells (Levitation for instance) could have the most terrible consequences if cast improperly.

What Harry did was understandable, and there's no doubt that the issue is complex - both for him and Draco - but it is certainly not justified by law.
