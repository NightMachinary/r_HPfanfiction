And once again it goes back to Snape. We do know Harry is a reactional character, basically a narrator in character form who generally doesn't do things out of his own initiative. And Snape had a vested interest in making any investigation not happen, so Harry just went along with it because nobody actually told him to give proof of that sort.

Not to mention that no, you cannot prove intent by using pensieves. They'd still just see Draco trying to cast something that was very bad but not actually doing it, and they've never seen him cast it before so Snape might still try to make it appear a bluff, and then Harry actually cast something “only” quite bad.

Was it played badly? Sure, it was, yes. In any rewrite, you can make it happen however you want and it would probably make more sense than the original version, but in said original version there /is/ a reason why it all played the way it did, and though some things definitely don't make sense, this isn't actually one of them, not with Harry and Snape being the way they are and with Harry's and Draco's history being what it is and with them not actually having a way to detect intent just like that and thus having to assume.
