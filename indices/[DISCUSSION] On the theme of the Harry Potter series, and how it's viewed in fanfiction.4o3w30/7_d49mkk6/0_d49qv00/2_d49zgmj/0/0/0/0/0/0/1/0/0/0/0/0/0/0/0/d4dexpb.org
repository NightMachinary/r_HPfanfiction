Harry had no way to know that Draco was "Under duress". And he shouldn't be punished for his reaction because we cannot expect him to act perfectly in that situation. That's my point. Its not alright to kill someone for a crime - but it's alright to kill someone if they are attacking you with an unforgivable. Expecting kids to have the skills and wits of a veteran Auror, and punishing them for the lack of that is wrong and sick. What the punishment drove home was "Defending yourself against an unforgivable is wrong" and "Draco can do no wrong!" All the drivel about poor Draco caring for his murderous father and his mother, both supporters of Voldemort, is pointless since no one told Harry that. All Harry knew was that Draco got off again and he was punished. Lesson learned.
