You know, I do understand what you are trying to do, and I don't agree with some of the things the other side writes, but here is a little thing for you:

Regardless of the intent, getting hit with a Cruciatus means likely being disabled and at the mercy of someone who already is, by the time of casting it, demonstrating willingness to use the darkest of spells. Even if he does not possess the mental or emotional aptitude to use them fully, it still is very dark and very illegal and I don't think it needs to be said that though Cruciatus is on a lower level than Avada Kedavra they were taught about those spells---alongside Imperius---at the same time and as the three worst ones. In that regard, Harry could and probably would be excused had he gone overboard with defending himself.

The reason he actually didn't get excused is simple, if you think about it. Because Harry stopped Draco from casting rather than stop the curse from affecting him and only then fighting back, there's no proof of Draco actually doing anything like that, and at the same time there's proof enough of Harry casting a curse that might not be as bad as those but still undeniably is dark stuff. As such, he was in a situation where he was the one who cast the darkest spell and the other party was actually harmed, so it mattered not what spells anyone /attempted/ to cast but couldn't; to put it simply, there was proof that Harry cast a dark spell at Malfoy, but no proof of Malfoy doing the same. And there's no excuse that “oh, he didn't know what the spell does” because /what kind of idiot uses an unknown spell in a fight/ and with him already having a history of not particularly caring about authority figures it wasn't much of a stretch to think it done deliberately by Harry.
