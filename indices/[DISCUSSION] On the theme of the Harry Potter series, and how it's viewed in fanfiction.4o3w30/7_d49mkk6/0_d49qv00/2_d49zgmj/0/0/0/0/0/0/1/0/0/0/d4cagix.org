/sigh/. Again, you insert your own morality into this debate. It doesn't matter. You keep insisting that "It doesn't matter what motivates Draco", but it is, because that's how the law works. We don't know too much about magical law, but if duress is an acceptable defense against the use of an Unforgivables - like with real life shooting - than it won't get him in Azkaban.

Your self-righteous idea of what counts as just doesn't matter to me or a court. Study the concept of "duress" in law before you make another ignorant post.
