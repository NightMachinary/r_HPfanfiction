No one "denigrates" James' sacrifice. The reason why Lily's gets so much attention was that she had a choice. Voldemort would have killed James no matter what, but Snape had begged him for Lily's life. But she chose to die rather than stand aside and let Voldemort kill her son. The magical protection only happens when you have a choice to live on or die for someone else and you actively choose to die.
