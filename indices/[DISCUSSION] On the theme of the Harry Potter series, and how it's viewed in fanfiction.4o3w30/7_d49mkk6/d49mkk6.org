  Too often, I've seen the tone of fanfiction to be only about making Harry powerful; a weapon.

When you have time, you enjoy the journey. When there's a Dark Lord come to kill you and everyone you care about, you kill that fucker as fast and hard as you can.

  a lot of authors take the Harry Potter story to be "stupid" as "We see no real change to the world; even after Voldemort, bigots are still bigots, and there is still so much discrimination, so what's the point."

More like, what was everyone /doing/ in those seventeen years? Harry was apparently teaching his kids to fear Slytherin. Ron was apparently learning to -- well, not /hate/ muggles, but certainly view them as less than human. Hermione was, it seems, happily ignoring this /and/ the relative contempt Ron had toward things she thought important.

We segued from a heroic victory to banal evil.

  Well, I'd like to hear all your views

For me, it feels like it's about fatalism and predestination and a bit about how you shouldn't fight the "natural" order of things.

Tom was born of a pitiful mother (who really deserved better) and a father she raped (which isn't excused by her home life). He started tormenting the other kids with magic by the time he was ten. He received a wand with immortality as one of its traits -- immortality being against the natural order and therefore evil. And all his steps from there were evil. Dumbledore saw that evil in him from the outset, but he couldn't take any steps to curb it; he just looked on with suspicion and disapproval, even before Tom did anything unspeakable.

Harry was born of good, loving parents. He was a good boy because he was protected by his mother's love, which sheltered him from the effects of his family's abuse. He followed Dumbledore like a lamb, always stayed on the side of the Light -- except for a couple brushes with the Unforgivables, but he's a good boy, so that can't affect him, right? And then he goes to his death like a good boy, to contrast him with Tom, who did everything he could to avoid death.
