For me, Harry Potter isn't so much about the story of Harry as it about the setting of the wizarding world.

And, while the canon story makes sense in light of external factors(writing for children, trying to force a theme, etc), internally the story is deeply flawed and makes little to no sense. Fanfiction often tries to correct that, to my approval.
