The point isn't what the British magical government is or is not, it's that the *Harry Potter* books aren't about it. The topic is what the /theme/ of the series is, not how the world it's set in is. I haven't yet read the Cursed child, but purely from canon, there isn't much to show it. As I said, he was treated badly, but there isn't any instance of crossing the line from bad into abusive.
