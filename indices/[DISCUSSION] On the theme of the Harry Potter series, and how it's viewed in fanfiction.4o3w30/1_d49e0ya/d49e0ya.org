I think that the tendency of many writers to focus on the weapon aspect of Harry is because they rightly point out that every member of society is handed a loaded gun that from their very first year of use, are taught the ability to brutally murder others even though it is framed as being something else (Diffindo, the Severing Curse). With that in mind, these children are generally not taught to use these incredibly powerful tools as weapons, but instead to focus on the more practical day to day uses of them. But with a class called DADA, it is always going to be in the back of their minds. Furthermore, it seems like every generation, a dark lord emerges in every society, so clearly theyre all doing a bad job about educating the next gen. Id like to see a fic where wands are not allowed use outside classrooms until graduation and even then, there are "safeties" put on the wands. (and im not talking about the Firebird Series)

As for Dursley violence, you can be desensitized to it without necessarily getting PTSD. Some of the darkest fics I have read took the abuse to the highest level possible before introducing harry to the magical world. One I can recall was pretty amazing, but I dont remember the name of it.
