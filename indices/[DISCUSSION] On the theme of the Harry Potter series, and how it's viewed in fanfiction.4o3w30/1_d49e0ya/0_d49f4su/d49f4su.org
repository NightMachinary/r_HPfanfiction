It is a very valid point, but keep in mind, magical people have a very high resistance to harm, and at least for me, magic is hugely intent based. The resistance, as i say, if you look at it the same way, when Buckbeak claws Draco, just think what the affect would be to a non magical. A huge creature, as big as, say, a horse, and with sharp talons, rearing up and putting it's claw to you, it would definitely go right through. And also, in ny mind, diffindo would be enough to maybe cause shallow cuts, but not much more, as even a (according to me) dark(ish) spell like Sectumsempra had the effect you expect with diffindo. Also, the kind of healing that the world has access to makes it a lot harder to harm unintentionally. Yes, the potential is there, but a gun is honestly a very very bad comparison, as at the core, a gun can only harm. Maybe a Swiss knife, yes, you can cut someone with it, but it's not really that easy to kill, no way without trying. And also, even though you could use a curse from a wand, you also need to know how to, and have the level of power/expertise.

I'm by no way saying it isn't a weapon, just that the society that uses it would not have this perception.

As for the Dursleys, well, what violence? That's my point, isn't it, looking at canon, you see there isn't any event that could *be* abuse, not just seen by Harry as such. The closest it comes is bullying by Dudley and his group, and the dursleys ignoring it.
