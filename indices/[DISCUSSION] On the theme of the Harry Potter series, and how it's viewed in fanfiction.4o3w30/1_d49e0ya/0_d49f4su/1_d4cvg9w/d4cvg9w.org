  As for the Dursleys, well, what violence? That's my point, isn't it, looking at canon, you see there isn't any event that could be abuse, not just seen by Harry as such. The closest it comes is bullying by Dudley and his group, and the dursleys ignoring it.

Well, kind of not. The entirety of their behaviour towards him is emotional abuse via neglect and other stuff; likewise, the fact that he talks back to them is not proof that it's all good, but rather something that likely had happened because of said abuse, as a form of defence, and this is also where his whole problem with authority comes from. That said, most people writing fanfiction know nothing about abuse, emotional or physical, nor do they even seem to be aware that emotional abuse is a thing, and the results we get from that is the overly exaggerated caricature with them beating him to death every day or worse.

So yes, they did abuse him, but no, it isn't the kind of over-the-top thing some people are making it out to be. There wasn't a boy who was so scared of everything that he couldn't do anything; instead, there was a boy who lived at the same place as people he was related to but did not live /with/ them, could not rely on them, had nobody /for him/.

For example, his studying habits, they aren't (as some tend to think) something that happened because of the Dursleys threatening him not to get higher grades than Dudley (what a ridiculous idea that is, in any case), but they definitely are something that happened because with nobody caring about his grades nor giving him any acknowledgement for trying there was no need for him to try at all. In a similar vein, the fact he tries to talk to them (like the bit with the flying motorcycle in the first book), isn't because everything is fine but rather because he is under the impression that nobody cares about him any more than the Dursleys, and thus that nobody cares about him at all, but he knows he can't just escape and go somewhere else and he still needs to talk occasionally because people generally do have that need and so with nobody caring (seemingly) he talks to anyone; this is why he's gotten attached to Hagrid so quickly despite Hagrid being visually a bit scary, as the guy did demonstrate to Harry that he does care specifically about him, and this is also why Harry stopped talking to them outside of when he needed to after the first book.
