Technically, Diffindo is a cutting /charm/, though, not a curse.

It's definitely something dangerous, I agree, but they do have magic protecting them from harm in various ways and probably a way to attach limbs back with a single spell for as long as there's no curse damage. So with that in mind, you'd probably have to put a lot of effort into it to make using it on a wizard or witch actually lethal. And while oh, sure, it is a possibility, we shan't forget that many mundane things that we have access to can be quite deadly if you put in a lot of effort as well. Our own bodies can be used as weapons, and if you are creative enough then so can most tools we are using; the question isn't “can you?” but rather “do you?”, and though the answers we've gotten from characters in the actual series vary greatly some fanfiction authors seem to be under the impression that every character would answer “yes” to the latter one.

As for the cupboard, the books never mention how big it actually is and what the movies show (a tiny bit of space) isn't actually canon, but it isn't uncommon for some house designs to have a “cupboard under the stairs” that is actually quite a sizeable storage room at 6 or 7 square meters (give or take 70 square feet) and just awkwardly shaped due to having a slanted ceiling, and Madame Rowling's later notes confirm that his cupboard is one of those. Oh, sure, it definitely is very much not a good thing that they put him in there, but it's not quite as drastic as some fanfiction authors make it out to be; they're still arseholes and definitely not good people, but they didn't make him sleep in a place the size of a cargo crate.
