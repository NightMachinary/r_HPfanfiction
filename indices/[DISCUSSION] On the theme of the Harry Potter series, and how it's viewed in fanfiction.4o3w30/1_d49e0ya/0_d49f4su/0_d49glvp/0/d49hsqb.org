The potential for harm is there, and it is a lot, but as you said, they are taught to use wands as tools. And I can see why Harry as a weapon is appealing, I myself like the plot when it's done well, just, when you take an eleven year old and then try to use this plot, it makes it very hard to believe. Training in magic, alright, it's all okay, but always, what comes with it is the /thinking/ like an adult, the maturity not present in young children. A story I read, not really pertaining in any way to wands/weapons, one of my favorites, is Fantastic Elves and where to find them, ans it is so amazing for me because of the way we see Harry's thoughts. The author gets the childlike thought process, that innocence very well. Thats the core that's missing in most such stories.

As for the cupboard, it wasn't just a little box, but it had a +cot+bed, a place for all his clothes, the few toys he had, and everything. It was really bad if them to only give him a cupboard, though. As for the locks, I think all rooms and cupboards already have a latch/lock, don't they? I don't think they purposely had one installed. Yeah, I see what youre getting at, but still, the way it's seen by the community, I feel it's a little much. Maybe im wrong here, but his personality at the start of the books is what makes me feel this way.

Edit: It was a bed, a proper full bed, with space under it for lost socks to hide. I don't know why I remembered cot, maybe from some fic...
