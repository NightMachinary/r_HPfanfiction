Eh, I'm not saying that your work would be 'hated', but that some fans would likely hate your writing, even if it was better than what Rowling was capable of in her heyday, and say that it is not as good /because you are not JK Rowling/. Rabid fans, basically, and those who idolise her work to the point that it overrides any critical thinking skills they may possess.
