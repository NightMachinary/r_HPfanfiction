I think you've hit the nail on the head, really. Just wanted to elaborate on the canon thing... I suspect it has to do with suspension of disbelief. A large number of people in the fanfiction community have already suspended their disbelief for canon, therefore fics that are cut similarly to canon receive benefit from the pre-existing suspension. They are more easily believed, in short, because they are familiar.

If you reboot, or drastically alter the Potterverse to actually make sense, you are almost writing an original fiction loosely inspired by Harry Potter, and therefore you run into both readers who do not suspend their disbelief due to it being original fiction, and irate fans who believe 'you changed it now it sucks'. It's like... it's no longer good enough to write a mediocre canon-compliant H/G fic, because you're asking people to suspend their disbelief separate from the canon they've already accepted, so your writing has to be at a much higher standard. And due to the reverence you not to earlier books, you could actually write /better than Rowling/ and people would still hate you.
