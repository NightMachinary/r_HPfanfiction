What do you want? A few hundred thousand words of Harry growing up, getting excited over the same things he did in canon, overcoming the same obstacles he got through in canon, with the same lessons in canon, with just a few thousand words of new stuff? At that point, you might as well just read the books over again.

Most people, even /writers/, seem to hate breaks from canon. Yes, you /could/ have Harry all excited over broomsticks again, but since we've already been there and done that a billion times, it's a bit dull. Since canon is fussed over like the community is its helicopter parent, it's not like you can take Harry on wild new adventures with any sort of ease. He still needs to deal with Voldemort, be mentored by Dumbledore, make friends with Hermoine and Ron, etc.

That being the case, even with their interests being so restrictive, their expectations are incredibly high. After all, unless a work is unbelievably good, it will "never hold up to the books". This is despite the quality of the books, mostly the early books, being /vastly/ overstated. As somebody else already pointed out, there are massive issues with the universe that go completely unaddressed, and therefore don't actually hold up to any sort of scrutiny.

If the story you want is to be well-made, it would have to start from the ground up. It would, in essence, be a Harry Potter reboot fic. Naturally, it would be very poorly received. It could do original characters in an original plot. New heroes, new perspectives, new adventures, new challenges, but would you even read it? It's not, after all, the characters people love.

I think you're asking for things that just aren't feasible. A fic written like the first book would just be outright poorly written for anything but children. A fic that corrects the obvious issues with the series loses the original tone. A fic which circumvents it all doesn't have enough to hook the vast majority of readers.
