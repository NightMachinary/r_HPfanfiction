I agree with you, OP. There were a lot of themes in canon who are being, for lack of a better word, bashed in fanfiction and in the fandom. The triumph of friendship and compassion over individual power and ruthlessness, the nostalgic appreciation of an older form of culture, the whimsy charm, the rejection of pretension (Tom Riddle turned into Lord Voldemort - take note, Lord Potter fans), and, most of all, the weaknesses and flaws that all people have. All of those are simply shat on in fanfiction and fandom.

That's not to say that I completely agree with these values, or like these themes, but they are what made this series so beautiful, and eventually, successful, in my opinion. You can subvert and dismiss them, but to bash the books for them simply makes you look like you didn't even enjoy the series - in which case, why are you even here?

The world fanfiction presents very often lacks the humour of the series - it is usually completely boring, technical, pent up and lacks wonder. Not to mention that the humorous, sarcastic qualities of characters like Harry and Ron are so commonly ignored. This humour, in my opinion, is what separated the latter books from being just another grimperp young-adult angstfest. The tendency to exaggerate the Dursleys' abuse is a good example of the lack of subtlety that results from lack of humour.

Instead of faulty, morally questionable characters, you get these perfect, savvy, flawless, totally good or totally evil little kids, who just don't feel real, and aren't likeable in any way. The nostalgic whimsical tone is mistaken for incompetency and backwardness, often replaced with a bureaucratic, machine operated, soulless world that is supposed to be an improvement. You can see it very clearly in this thread, where every flaw the characters and institutions have is criticized, instead of accepted for how complex and interesting it makes everything be.

About your request, It's probably not coincidence that the story I believe best captured the essence of the series - linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) - is a crack story.
