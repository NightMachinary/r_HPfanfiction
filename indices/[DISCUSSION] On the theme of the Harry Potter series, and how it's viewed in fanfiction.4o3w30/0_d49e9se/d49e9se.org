More than love or friendship, the Harry Potter series is about /choices/. Voldemort /chose/ Harry over Neville as the threat to him, after /choosing/ to believe in the prophecy. Voldemort gives Lily the chance to live, but she /chooses/ to sacrifice herself for Harry. Harry /chose/ to argue against Slytherin, and thus became a Gryffindor, and so on and so forth.

Harry and Voldemort are dark reflections of each other. Both coming from unloving family situations, are orphans, have brother wands, and even look similar. Yet, as Dumbledore said in CoS, it is choices that define us. Voldemort chose one route, Harry the opposite. Voldemort chose to fear death, Harry chose to accept it.

Heck, the prophecy that is so important in the last couple books? Only is important because Voldemort believes it to be important. And this is what pisses me off about a shitton of fanfiction. They come up with some crap about prophecies always coming true, subjects of prophecies being bound to the prophecies and nothing else can harm them, prophecies warping reality/circumstances so they come true. Harry never faced Voldemort because some prophecy forced him, but because he chose to. He /chose/ to go after the Stone. He /chose/ to plunge into the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. He /chose/ to save Pettigrew from Lupin and Sirius. He /chose/ to stand tall and fight Voldemort in the graveyard instead of just allowing Voldemort to kill him. Harry /chose/ to go the Department of Ministries to save Sirius. Harry /chose/ to accompany Dumbledore on an attempt to gain a shard of Voldemort's soul. Harry /chose/ to leave all he knew behind and hunt for horcruxes with only his two best friends. Harry /chose/ to walk to his death to save everyone. Harry /chose/ to come back to life. Harry /chose/ to face Voldemort at the end, when everyone thought he was dead and could have fled.

Choices, free will. That is what Harry Potter is about. Not Fate making everyone its bitch.
