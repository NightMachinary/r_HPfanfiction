I agree, but I would like to add that the concept of choices is coloured by a bizarre twist on Calvinism, as far as I've been able to determine. Dumbledore's talk of choices is oft misquoted.

So while people may /choose/ to do things, there is a strong thread of people having an essential nature that dictates those choices beforehand. This is reflected in many aspects of Rowling's world, from the cliquishness of the adult characters, to the Sorting process, to the stereotypical nature of many of the supporting characters. The Sorting in particular has some very odd social constructs built around it, and I don't think all of them are in-universe so to speak. Rowling's hangups about social structures show through, too. Your choices matter, because they show others what you /truly are/, not because the outcome is in question. Voldemort would never choose differently, it's just not in his nature to do so. These books are, from what I can tell at least, 'The Scorpion and the Frog' writ large.

There may be no overarching 'Fate' controlling the Potterverse, but you are utterly helpless in the face of your own intrinsic nature.
