Dumbledore is the most complicated character in the series, and yes, most people see his decisions as highly questionable, the fact remains that, realistically, even if Dumbledore had decided to raise Harry as a weapon, it honestly wouldn't have worked against the "most feared dark wizard of all time", as the Dark Lord was reputed to be; highly skilled and experienced, I really dont think Harry would have defeated him in fair combat.

Even leaving that out, yes, I agree we don't see enough justce in the series, but Dumbledore was truly trying to give Harry a chance at being a child, rather than having the prophecy hanging over his head.Maybe it was wrong, maybe not, that's a personal opinion. I personally think he wanted the best for Harry; that he truly cared.
