I think the problem is the unintentional mixed dark themes that are never properly addressed. Even if it was childrens fiction, the world should have had some semblance of cause/effect crime/punishment.

Instead we see a home life that was unjust, possibly criminal.

I'm pretty certain its at least a reason to take a child away if you make them sleep in a locked cell under the stairs. Lock them in their room and feed them through a cat flap etc. But we never really see any resolution or comeuppance to the Dursleys and no adult ever speaks out or up for Harry. If they did we have to assume they were obliviated so Harry could stay under Dumbledore's blood protection.

Teachers attempting to kill Harry nearly every year he is at Hogwarts and very little is done about it, Harry has to take care of himself because the adults are nincompoops.

Corrupt government... is probably the most realistic portrayal since sometimes there is nothing you can do to fight back short of full revolution.

Dumbledore knows Harry has to fight for his life, yet never gives him more than a normal education. It is super easy to see why people believe he was meant to die all along.

The unintended themes of the series lead to dark conclusions. As a child you may not read into it much, but as an adult it is either a series of very evil but coincidental events happening to a child, or there is a mastermind behind it all training a weapon of war who will answer to the wise grandfather figure.

Another example is how apparently, the Malfoys once again got off completely clear of charges at the end because Narcissa decided to help Harry. No justice at all.

Fanfiction takes a dim view of many characters based on these themes, and attempts to correct them. Making Harry a CAPABLE weapon instead of sending him off to die is just one way to fix what is perceived as a very wrong situation.
