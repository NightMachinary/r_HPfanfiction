I headcanon that Durmstrang and Beauxbatons (and the rest of the eleven) are only the boarding schools. There are plenty of day schools, possibly with dedicated Floo networks or assigned portkeys for the students to go to and fro each day.

I simultaneously headcanon that "no Muggleborns at Durmstrang" is a mistranslation. In East Europe, they still practice changelings - Muggleborns are swapped with Muggle orphans if identified young enough, and if not then their parents hexed to believe them killed. The young Muggleborns are then adopted by pure blood families and raised as their own. Durmstrang's policy isn't based on blood status, but on family status. No Muggle /raised/ at Durmstrang, meaning Harry wouldn't be allowed either.
