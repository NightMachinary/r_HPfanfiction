The canon is quite straightforward. There are eleven /permanent/ schools of magic. Everyone else is either homeschooled, apprenticed, or goes to more temporary institutions. These last would essentially be one person who decides to be a magic teacher and gets students during the course of their career. When they retire, that's the end of that school, and new students would have to find someone else. This is how most schools operated during many periods of European history, so it's a historically accurate idea.
