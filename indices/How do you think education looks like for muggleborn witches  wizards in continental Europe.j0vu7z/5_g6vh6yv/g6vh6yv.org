Technically, it could be anything. The eleven schools are just the ones that got registered with the ICW. So, there could be equally large schools run by and for Muggleborn throughout Europe, for all we know. Hell, could just be that Beauxbatons takes every Muggleborn in Europe. Floo and Apparition are readily available, so transportation is a non-issue when it comes to 'catchment area'.

Probably the most likely option is like the magical equivalent of Ragged Schools or Pop-up Education Centres. Few teachers, low funding, little more than the basics, just make sure that you aren't gonna break the statute or kill anyone type places.
