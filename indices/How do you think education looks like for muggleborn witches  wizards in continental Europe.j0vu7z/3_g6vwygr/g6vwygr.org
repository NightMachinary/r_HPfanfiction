Honestly, the schools seem bit weird. I would expect that the oldest school would be in Greece or Italy.\\
For the rest, I would say you need to look what the areas of influence were when Statute of Secrecy was established (1689)

+ geography doesn't really mean much here, look at historical ties.\\
Lithuania, Poland + Belarus, Ukraine likely would have a common school from the commonwealth times, since the commonwealth would be older than the statute, so I wouldn't see a reason why they wouldn't be together after statute which was established while commonwealth was still going strong\\
Estonia and Latvia would be bit odder case. During establishement of statute, they were either fully (Est) or partly (Lat) under Swedish rule, however, the ruling class was always Germans. So I suppose that they both could have gone for either some school in Germany or Sweden, but I don't really see that happening as they were looked down upon. So I would say here it was more apprentice-ship until more recent history.\\
Scandinavia is likely to have it together, yeah, I would say their school would be likely in Sweden (or maybe Lappland in Finland, hm), since Sweden controlled FInland at the time. Denmark and Norway at the time were together. So my guess is that there are two Nordic schools since I don't see them cooperating to make a single school in the region at the time. + Iceland is likely to have had apprenticeship system.

Well, I don't really want to comment on other places as I am less familiar with their poltics during the time.
