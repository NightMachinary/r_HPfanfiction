Some points to remember:

Of the eleven schools, several are still unnamed- they could also be in Europe, though that would leave large parts of the globe uncovered.

Those are only the schools registered with the ICW- smaller schools and correspondence courses are confirmed to be things.

Tutoring and master/apprentice relationships might be options for some, especially those with wealth, though they are likely to be more accessable to wealthy purebloods than muggleborns.
