Durmstrang presumably is in Scandinavia, since Dumbledore greets Karkarov as a friend from the North. Compared to Scotland, there's not much more North in Europe.

Furthermore, we have three other magical schools that each cover a continent.

I don't think the scale of these (or Durmstrang) is well thought out but this what we have in the "source" material.
