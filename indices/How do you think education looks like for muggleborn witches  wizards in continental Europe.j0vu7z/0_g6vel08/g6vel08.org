The idea that Durmstrang covers almost all of eastern Europe plus Northern Europe is ridiculous. Krum is Bulgarian, Poliakoff sounds Russian-ish, I say Durmstrang is in Ukraine or Belarus or Bulgaria or Hungary.

I want to see a school that looks at pre-christian beliefs of Northern Europe. The Vikings had tjeir magical beliefs in plenty; seiðr, völva, runes etc. I'd love a magical community where runes is a popular way of casiting magic, where there are creatures from Nordic mythology (giant wolves, eight-legged horses, non-human beings like draugr, elves or wights, etc)
