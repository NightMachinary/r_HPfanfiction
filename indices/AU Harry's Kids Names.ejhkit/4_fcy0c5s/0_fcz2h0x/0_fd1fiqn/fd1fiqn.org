He was born in 2005? I don't think I ever quite realised the epilogue was in 2016. That's rather weird to think about. If Harry and Ginny were the typically... liberal-minded parents of that era that tended to disregard age warnings on video games, James could've been playing Call of Duty by that point. Or be utterly devoted to Fifa games. Or goddamned Pokemon Go. There could be kids hunting pokemon in Hogsmeade. Jeez.
