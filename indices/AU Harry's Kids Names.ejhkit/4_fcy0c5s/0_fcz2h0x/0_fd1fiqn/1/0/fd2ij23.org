Heh. God, could you imagine? 2017, September comes along and... not a single Muggleborn child turns up. The Teachers panic, think it's a third blood war, go to find out what happened only to have a hundred kids tell them that "Of course I'm not going to Hogwarts. You people don't have WIFI!". Then they work out the Electricity issue and the Muggleborns get the Pureblood kids addicted to Flappy Bird (Flappy Phoenix?) or something. :D
