Harry's kids were born in the 2000's, so Bob would be a pretty strange choice and it's never been that popular of a name in the UK anyway. However, the year James Sirius was born (2005), his first name /was/ actually the fourth most common name in the UK, so your idea is already kinda canon.

But are James, Frank, Alice, Fred, Bill, Arthur, Molly, Ron, & George not "muggle" (by which you mean traditional white English, I'm assuming) names? They're all purebloods. Canon has no actual wizarding naming conventions, other than the Blacks.
