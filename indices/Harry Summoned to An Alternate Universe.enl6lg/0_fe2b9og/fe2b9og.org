Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville get bamf-ed to an AU where Remus married Lily, James is a twat, and Snape is nice. They're all a little mad from being the last bastion of rebellion against Voldemort in their home dimension and most of the plot is people from the new universe freaking out about them. Totes fun.
