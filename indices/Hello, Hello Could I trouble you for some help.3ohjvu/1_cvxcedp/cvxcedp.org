Sentient Hogwarts is seen in linkffn(The Merging). It doesn't play a huge role, but it's there and done in a reasonable manner, I feel.

You ask for MoD crossovers, but I'd like to mention a non-cross: linkffn(coming back late). One of my favorite stories. Harry as MoD influences the plot, but it's done well, rather than being something stupidly powerful.
