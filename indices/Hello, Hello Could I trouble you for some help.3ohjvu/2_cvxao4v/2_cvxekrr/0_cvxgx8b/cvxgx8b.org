This, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]], is a Sherlock crossover that I love as well. I've just re-read it, in fact. You'll almost definitely need to have seen Sherlock (With Benedict Cumberbatch) to understand it.

It's on a different website than the others, but don't let that put you off of it. Typically I only frequent AO3 and FFN.
