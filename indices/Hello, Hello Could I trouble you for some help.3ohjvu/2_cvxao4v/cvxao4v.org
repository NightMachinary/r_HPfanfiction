So... the fic I'm recommending doesn't actually fall under any of your criteria... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/12/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]]. I recommend this because it /might/ eventually loop back to being the Master of Death, but it's not a crossover. Depending on how often you frequent this subreddit, you might see it mentioned a lot. I think I would always rec this one, though. I love it.

To make up for my blunder, I'm going to rec some that do fit your criteria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] is a lovely Azkaban fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2219655/1/Never-Trust][Never Trust]] is a post-Azkaban oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9899145/1/Great-Expectations][Great Expectations]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] are both Avengers crossovers that utilize being the Master of Death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] is a Firefly crossover. I hadn't seen Firefly before reading this, and I still understood most of it.
