I'm not sure what an animangus is, but it sure sounds painful. Or weird. Or both.

That being said, I don't remember any stories in which any of those would be primary themes around which whole stories are framed, but nonjon's comedy fics (linkffn(2354771) and its continuations) do sort of use metamorphmagic for something (mostly for comedy), and it's also sort of used in this story (linkffn(3036211)).

Oh, and chapter 18 of this: (linkffn(8222091)) explores the concept, though it's just a one-shot and some liberties are taken with the world of the story (namely, there are some changes to the world of the story that are not a direct result of Harry having this particular ability that is being explored); all in all I think it's readable and actually nice and something I can envision (generally speaking) if someone as shallowly-rooted in his own identity as Harry had access to an ability of this sort.
