Yeah, I know what you mean. Sadly, it's really hard to find a story like that, most likely because it is, all in all, a novelty skill that doesn't make the character that much more powerful and thus not many people bother to use it. Heck, I'd love to read a good story that deals with it (well, there are some, but the few I remember of them are ... just decent, I guess, and don't deal precisely with metamorphmagic as it is but rather with what the author envisions as being it, and it's not the same). Heck, I don't even remember the names of the other fics now, so I gave what I could and that's that for now.

And yes, I know it's “animagus” and I know what it is. I just have a really weird sense of humour so I took to the mangled word; you probably shouldn't pay attention to it because my jokes (or what passes for them) are mostly nonsense.
