As a healthy hot-blooded male, I have no problem with femslash...as long as the characters aren't just like "Normally I like guys but suddenly I have the urge to do the lesbian sex to you", also more often the not summaries that advertise slash typically end up being smut. So, I shall take your word for it.

As long as there is no sudden "Dicks Dicks Everywhere! Explicit scenes feature only dicks!" I think I can handle it. =P
