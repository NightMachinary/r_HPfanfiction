So some folks already on here have explained the whole "blank slate" aspect where you can make her whatever you want while still having some basic guidelines (Slytherin, Pureblood, Sacred Twenty Eight, Somewhat outside the typical).

However, as someone who personally LOVES Daphne Greengrass/Harry Potter pairings (or similar), I will explain why she is, in particular, appealing to me.

So apart from the blank slate aspect, she can be utilized in some really interesting ways.

First off, Shes Slytherin allowing a Slytherin connection for Harry, either from outside the house looking in or as an ally if Harry is sorted into Slytherin.

Secondly, She likely has stature, is a pureblood, and has a mysterious background which allows her to play many roles and wear many faces, especially when connected to a figure such as Harry. Her family name is also a bit of an unknown as it pertains to the war(s) and Voldemort. Again, this allows for interesting choices to be made regardless of the direction its taken in.

She is also implied to be a beauty. I'll be honest, apart from liking her name, I like the idea of Harry with a beauty by his side as they both achieve greatness in whatever form it is.

This next one I feel people often overlook but I think its an important factor:

The "Astoria Factor"

I like the intriguing aspects Astoria brings into the picture. Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are only children. Ron and Ginny have a massive family and it's all brothers. The point is, by having a slightly younger sister (1-2 years younger), it brings a dynamic not often seen around Harry and allows for some interesting development. Pair Harry with Astoria as well? Have Daphne die and Astoria connects with Harry later? Have Astoria die or Harry save her or something else intriguing happens to change Daphne? Have Astoria bring Draco around to Harry's views or Daphne bring Harry around to Astoria/Draco views? You get the picture.

To a lesser degree, Fleur and Gabrielle also work for this.
