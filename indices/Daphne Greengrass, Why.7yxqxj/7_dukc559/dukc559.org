What drew me to Daphne as a character initially, was that she could be a Slytherin student who isn't a huge twat. Canon lacks sympathetic Slytherins, even though just statistically speaking they can't all be bullies, and or Voldemort supporters, etc. Depending on what the author wants to do with her, she can be a really interesting character.

Does she believe in blood purity? Why or why not? If yes does she change her mind or the mind of another character like Harry? Can she teach, Harry and or Hermione things about wizard culture that Ron doesn't know or didn't think to bring up (nice world building opportunity here)?

Her personality is a blank slate so the author can create a character who fit their needs.

I also quite enjoy Harry/Daphne as a pairing because there can be a hidden friendship/forbidden fruit element to it with Gyriffindor/Slytherin element. The author can also use a friendship or relationship to address the house rivalries and maybe unify them. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a Harry/Daphne fic that doesn't have the same cliches like Ice Queen Daphne, Ancient and Noble Houses, Ron/Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny bashing, Mary Sue Daphne, Gary Stu Harry, Marriage contracts, etc, but there is a lot of potential for the character and the paring as a whole. Some of those cliches can be okay if handled properly, too.
