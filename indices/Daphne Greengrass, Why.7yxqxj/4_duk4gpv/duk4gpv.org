HP has a lack of sympathetic Slytherins (they are basically House Evil) and an even bigger lack of cunning protagonists.

Daphne makes sense in a lot of ways. She's also a good opportunity to bring Pureblood Politics into everything.

Harry having some kind of relationship with Slytherins also adds a great source of conflict and is a convenient escape route from Dumbledore and the Weasleys.
