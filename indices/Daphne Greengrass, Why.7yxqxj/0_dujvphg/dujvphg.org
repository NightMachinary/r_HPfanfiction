Essentially, Daphne Greengrass is a blank slate. We know almost nothing about her. We know she's in the same year as Harry. We know she's a pureblood, a Slytherin and a member of the Sacred Twenty Eight. Beyond this, such little is known about the character that she can be made into whoever the author wants her to be. She's the perfect catalyst for 'Harry marries wealthy pureblood girl' without having to commit to certain already established personality traits.

It's similar to fics in which Hermione is paired with Theodore Nott. He's a named character with no established personality. He can be an evil Voldemort loving maniac or a poor teenager forced into service by his father. You can just twist them to be whoever they need to be in your story.
