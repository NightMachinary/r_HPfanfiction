I don't know. She's literally just a name given once as a student who took OWL's with Hermione in OOTP. That's it. She didn't even have her House mentioned, or her family, or her friends, or her blood status, or anything else ever. She's just a random one-off name. I could make her a deaf, sweet little Hufflepuff who likes to chew gum and play Quidditch if I wanted to and that would be as valid as any other fanfiction characterization about her. :)
