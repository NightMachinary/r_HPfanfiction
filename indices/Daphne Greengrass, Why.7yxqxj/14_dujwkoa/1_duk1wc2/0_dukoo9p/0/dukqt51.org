Even if I was interested in reading that pairing, HP on AO3 is all but a wasteland.

AO3 is so overwhelmingly dominated by slash and blatantly squicky slash that I can't read anything over there. Even stories that have pairings I'm interested in I can't read because almost every single fic in HP there is slash.

I have no problems with background slash (Charlie Weasley, or any other canonically unpaired character), but that is nonexistent on AO3 it's either all Harry slash, or Draco in leather pants crap.
