Most times I feel that Mustang is way too smart compared to the smarter Daphne that I've read. She's just fucking awesome. Not to say that The Reaper is anyway dumb, but she's like miles and miles and miles ahead of him. Kinda like Harry(canon) is compared to Dumbledore or most fanon-Daphnes.

Btw, have you read Iron Gold yet ? I'm saving up to read the previous series in one go and the read it. If you have, is it good ? Can I expect some fluff from Darrow and Mustang ? Sevro ? I read the excerpt a few months ago, which I think is the first half of the first Chapter, and it has Lysander and Cassius, but that's all.
