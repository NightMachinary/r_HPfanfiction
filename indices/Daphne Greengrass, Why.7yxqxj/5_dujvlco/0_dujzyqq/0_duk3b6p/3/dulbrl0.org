To be fair I work with the unit Pascal daily and is in 2nd year of university [Engineering]. But still didn't know the guys first name. Just like I don't know the first names of Newton, Watt or Euler. (Best guesses being Edward, Thomas and Isaac.) Even though they are the basis of my entire education.
