Sorry, but I'm not playing the exceptions disprove all generalities game.

Other than the unambiguously down market Weasleys, and for some reason Harry (whose parents demonstrated straight up Chav values using a nickname for his proper first name), no one is referred by a nickname nor were any girls named some yuppy cutesypoo traditionally male name.

It all comes down to unvarnished ignorance. Blaise is in no way a name used in English speaking populations. It isn't traditional, nor even an obscure English name, it's a French male's name.

EDIT: And to demonstrate my own ignorance, the name is actually Greek in origin from Saint Blaise (who was a man).
