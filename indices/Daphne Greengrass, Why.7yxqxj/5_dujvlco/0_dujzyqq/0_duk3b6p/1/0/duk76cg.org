At least in the early German translation, they had to pick a gender for grammatical consistency in the first book when Blaise was sorted (the source wasn't clear) and they chose female. They fixed the translation after the sixth book was released, where his gender became clear.

The name does sound quite feminine to me, to be honest, and as a child who grew up with Harry Potter, I didn't know of Blaise Pascal until much later - Blaise Zabini is the first Blaise I encountered.
