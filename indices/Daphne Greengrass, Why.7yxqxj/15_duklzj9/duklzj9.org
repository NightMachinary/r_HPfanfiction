Honestly, it's because she's easy.

Get your mind out of the gutter. Not in that way.

She's a blank slate, meaning that authors have license to do what they will with her. (Again, mind? Gutter?) You can't make Ginny or Hermione into something too discordant with their canon selves or a substantial fraction of the fandom will balk. But someone as nebulously defined as Daphne? Have at it. Make her a femme fatale, a Death Eater wannabe, a violin prodigy, a foil fencing champion, a displaced Native American, an Ice QueenÂ®. She's plot putty.

And she's a Slytherin, so you have instant house-dynamic conflict and the possibility of family conflict with Harry and the gang.

She's just an easy character to write. And sometimes when writing fanfiction you just want to stretch your wings a bit and don't want a complete mental model of a stock character. "Ron, teaspoon?" much?
