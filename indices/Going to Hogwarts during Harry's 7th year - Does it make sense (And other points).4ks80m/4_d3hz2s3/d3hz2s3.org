The whole Thicknesse Regime was set up as a clear parallel to Nazi Germany, or in fact almost any police state.

- a basically legitimate government
- new laws that excluded a part of the populace
- but procedurally correct laws
- a veneer of lawfulness over everything

So most people handled it the way people always handle it. They tried to keep their heads down. A minority had both the foresight and the means to leave and did, but most people simply didn't have the opportunity to /resist/ or /leave/.

EDIT: There is the basic belief everywhere and everywhen that "It won't be that bad. They can't really do that"
