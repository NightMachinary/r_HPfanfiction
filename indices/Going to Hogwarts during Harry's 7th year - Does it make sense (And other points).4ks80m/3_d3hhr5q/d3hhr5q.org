Just possible explanations:

  while Death Eaters so obviously had control

Sure it was obvious to the people who had actually been fighting them (and us, the readers). But remember that most people just got their information from the Daily Prophet, which was mostly a Ministry mouthpiece, and other Ministry propaganda (pamphlets against mudbloods). And Voldemort wasn't the face of the Ministry, Pius Thickness was (who wasn't a famous Death Eater like, say, Bellatrix Lestrange or Sirius Black).

The coup occured on August 1, when Hogwarts letters had probably already gone out, probably from trusty McGonagall, so students might not know Snape had taken over until they got there.

The Weasleys weren't attacked because they were purebloods. As long as Voldemort kept his pograms targeting muggleborns, neutral purebloods would have less reason to resist him. If he started attacking purebloods, he'd get more resistance. Voldemort only attacked Bill and Fleur's wedding because Harry might be there.

  Why was there even a moment's doubt that it was indeed Harry that the snatchers has captured and brought to Malfoy manor?
#+end_quote

Because the Malfoys are cowards and the penalty for wasting the Dark Lord's time could be death (the Malfoys had failed Voldemort multiple times before). They had to be /sure/. Maybe Granger and Weasley had established Harry doubles to distract them or waste their time. Maybe Greyback was trying to trick them to improve his own position.

  What would you do as say, a half-blood, or blood traitor during that time-period?
#+end_quote

Set up safe houses and start trying to hide muggleborns and their families. I'm not sure they would even need fake identities (at least at first). Britain has a population of over 60 million and Death Eaters don't know how to use a phonebook -- just move somewhere else, don't do magic, and don't say Voldemort's name (unless you can setup an ambush for snatchers).
