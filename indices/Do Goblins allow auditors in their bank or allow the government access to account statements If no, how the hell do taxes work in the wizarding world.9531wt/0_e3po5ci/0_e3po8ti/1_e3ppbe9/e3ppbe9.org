I expect even if they aren't book-canon, if you asked Rowling she'd say there are taxes in the wizarding world. I don't remember the books enough to say myself, though, and all I can find is a movie-canon Gringotts advertisement which talks about a "Hexing Tax". Which looks from the advertisement to be basically a net worth tax, though I could be wrong.
