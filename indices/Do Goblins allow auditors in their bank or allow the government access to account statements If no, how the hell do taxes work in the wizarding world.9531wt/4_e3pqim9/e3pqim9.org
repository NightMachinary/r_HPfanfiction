My headcanon is that the goblins are so insular, isolationist, and mistrustful of other races, especially the wizards, that they don't allow external auditors in to look at their books or their accounts. They have their own internal audit department that periodically tests controls over things like account balances and vault access. No one leaves the bank until their reconciliations balance to the knut and pity the goblin that allows a control to fail even once.
