The reason I assumed Gringotts may be involved in the process is because things like this seem to be mostly on the honor system. We never see any of this in canon. You buy something? It's a cash transaction. You're being paid for something? Cash transaction. There's no paper trail.

With no paper trail, fraud becomes /extremely/ easy. You have absolutely no way to verify if a business is lying about how much they charge for goods (or, at the very least, how much they've made from selling those goods) nor how much they're paying their employees.

The only form of verification I could think of would be to directly audit or get account statements from the bank in which every Witch and Wizard seems to use - Gringotts.
