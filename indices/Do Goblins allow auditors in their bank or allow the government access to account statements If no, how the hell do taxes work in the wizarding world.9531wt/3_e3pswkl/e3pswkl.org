Why would a bank need to be involved with the taxes?

I expect the Revenue Authority would want Tax returns filed with proof of income; payslips and the like for individuals, and a record of sales for businesses for things like Value Added tax and financial statements for corporate tax.

The only thing the bank would possibly used for is to facilitate payments and refunds.

And a wizard/witch may not keep their gold at Gringotts. Not that it matters as discussed above
