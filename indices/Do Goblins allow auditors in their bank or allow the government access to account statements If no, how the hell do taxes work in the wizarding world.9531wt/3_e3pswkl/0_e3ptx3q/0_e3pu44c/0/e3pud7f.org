  But you can still file a tax return to claim rebates on medical aid and/or pension funds

Same in the UK, but for the vast majority of people it's pointless because they have nothing to claim. Pension contributions via salary sacrifice are already factored into the PAYE system and the NHS means no tax relief for medical insurance or anything like that. Occasionally you do randomly get a rebate cheque in the post that the Treasury has calculated for you though.
