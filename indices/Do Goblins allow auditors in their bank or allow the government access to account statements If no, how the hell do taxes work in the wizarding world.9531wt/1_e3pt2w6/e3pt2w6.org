It's entirely possible that Wizarding Britain doesn't have regular taxes the way we have them today, they're mostly a 19th century invention. There'll be customs and excise at the borders, duties payable on the sale of various goods and assorted transactions and a certain amount of government-owned assets that generate rents and similar incomes. The rest of it is done the old-fashioned way: you - as either the Minister or the governing cabal behind him - farm out the various licensing and enforcement offices to your cronies, and they squeeze the plebs for as much as they can get away with in fees and fines while giving you a suitable kickback.

There were bits of the English government still working that way as late as the Napoleonic Wars. A society that split off from us in the late 17th Century with no external pressure to evolve more efficient funding and governance, for Defence spending if nothing else? I could well see them keeping the old 'system' going, not least because it benefits rich, upper-class gobshites with generational wealth that lets them basically run the government as a part-time hobby - if you're rich, you can give your friends breaks on whatever they need, while soaking the commoners for all they're worth just to see the pitiful looks on their faces....
