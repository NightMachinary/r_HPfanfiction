Well, the wizards could be required to hand over statements from Gringotts themselves to document their wealth and income. Or the taxes are limited to value-added tax of sorts, or taxes on land and buildings. Alternatively, businesses could be paying for licenses instead of taxes - sort of like a poll tax for businesses. Which would also be a possible tax system for the wizards and witches- everyone pays the same amount, regardless of wealth or income.
