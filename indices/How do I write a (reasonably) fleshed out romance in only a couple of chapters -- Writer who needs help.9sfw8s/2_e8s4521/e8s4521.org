One of my pet hates is when a FF writer uses too many words. You can say an awful lot with a few words.

Use a readers imagination more than describing ever minute detail.

Think if JK what has she really said about what Hermione looks like? Teeth hair and eyes. And yet we all have a very clear image inside our heads about what she looks like (even without Emma)

It's like with drawing. Draw what isn't there.
