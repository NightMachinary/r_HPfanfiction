Heart-breaking or heart-warming are two different things entirely. You should be clear how exactly you want your readers to perceive their relationship and go from there. Generally speaking, if you don't want your story slowed down by showcasing a romance between two secondary characters, it's completely okay to just show the one defining moment that made it all possible, that got it all started. You can just slip in a few lines every now and then after that without bloating the plot while maintaining stringency.

If you want a heart-breaking romance, you should probably aim for two important scenes. One to establish their relationship and the second one to introduce the tragic element. You needn't have them in the same chapter either. You could make the first scene bittersweet, leaving the reader to guess why the characters feel so torn about it -- only to later reveal that the mother left or something.

Just keep in mind that you mustn't overdo it. Secondary/background characters hijacking whole chapters is a sure way to derail your story.
