  I also don't like Harry and Hermione's holier-than-thou attitude. Nearly every observation they make about the wizarding world has them looking down on it.

The wizarding world rejected Harry outright. Even in cannon Hermione has a great dislike for parts of the wizarding world, it is easy to see that she is more disenfranchised with what happens to her in the story.

  Harry and Hermione are of the opinion that muggle science is nearly on par and soon better than magic.

Harry says at one point he thinks muggle science it close to discovering magic independent of discovering the magical world, that is completely different.
