  The wizarding world rejected Harry outright. Even in cannon Hermione has a great dislike for parts of the wizarding world, it is easy to see that she is more disenfranchised with what happens to her in the story.

This doesn't make it any less annoying. And is a problem I adressed in the post above (about how the author makes the wizarding world look worse and the muggle world look better, just so that the main characters can rant.)

  Harry says at one point he thinks muggle science it close to discovering magic independent of discovering the magical world, that is completely different.
#+end_quote

Yeah, Harry says that at /one point/, and a lot of other things about muggle science and magic at /other points/. Though it's been a while since I read the story and I really can't be bothered to look through it again to find the relevant quotes. I vaguely remember something about cars being superior to magical transportation or whatever. This discussion is more than two weeks old.
