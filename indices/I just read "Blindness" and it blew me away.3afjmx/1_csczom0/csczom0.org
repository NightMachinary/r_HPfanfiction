Well.. Theoretically it's well written, but something about the writing style just doesn't sit well with me. It's tedious to read at times, because it always has the same pace(?) - I mean even when there are action scenes it's not really exciting. The writing is very passive. Most of the things are told rather than shown, dialogues are rare. (Though this is getting better in the later chapters.)

I also don't like Harry and Hermione's holier-than-thou attitude. Nearly every observation they make about the wizarding world has them looking down on it.

Further, Dumbledore is completely OOC (just so that the Wizarding World looks like an even worse place, I guess), wizards can run out of magic, and Harry and Hermione are of the opinion that muggle science is nearly on par and soon better than magic.

This fic really takes the wonder out of magic by over-explaining it and trying to make it somehow fit into muggle science. So, while I acknowledge that the writing is theoretically good, I just can't understand the enthusiasm.
