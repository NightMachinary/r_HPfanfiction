Yeah, I agree, it's reader's preference. I too think it can be interesting when the less than perfect parts of the wizarding world (corruption in the Ministry etc.) are addressed in a fic, but I think there should be a balance, and here nearly, if not all of the experiences Harry and Hermione have with the wizarding world are negative, while the muggle world is portrayed in an overly positive light. (Dumbledore casts the blind Harry aside without a second thought while Petunia suddenly is the nicest person around - things like that are just a complete canon reversal and make me think the author just did it to make the muggle world a better and the wizarding world a worse place; or when Hermione says that in the wizarding world human experiments are permitted, while in the muggle world they aren't. The author makes this additional stuff up just to make the Wizarding World look bad - or at least I can't think of another reason for things like that).

Edit: And not to forget about the part where the author makes up that Harry is a Lord and has seats on the Wizengamot, for seemingly no other reason than that Hermione can rant about it and say how out-dated the wizarding world is and how far better the muggle-system.

So my problem isn't really that the author is critising the Wizarding World, but that she is making it far worse only to show how superior muggles are in every way. I prefer it when authors work with shades of grey, instead of painting everything black and white.

I'd argue that the muggle wouldn't win. The wizard can cast a protego and non of the bullets will hit, while the muggle has no way to shield himself from a spell. So technically a wizard only has to use a shield charm until the muggle has run out of bullets and then finish him off... (it is canon that protego can shield from physical objects, and fanon that it can't). The wizard could also apparate to stand behind the muggle, imperio him, confund him... All a muggle can do is try to shoot before the wizard acts.

Edit: In canon wizards don't get tired from using magic. They get tired from running and jumping around while using it, but casting spells and curses by itself never tires them. Otherwise they would complain about being tired/weaker after classes etc. Here this happens a lot. E.g. Chapter 11, the Dementor scene: "His lungs burned; his magic was weakening from the constant stream of levitation around him." Or generally in the later chapters, when Harry has this ability to kind of really see, he can never use it long because it takes too much of his magic.
