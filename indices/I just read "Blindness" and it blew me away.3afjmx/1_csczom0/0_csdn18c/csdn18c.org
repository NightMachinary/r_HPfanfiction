It's reader preference. I love this story /because/ of all of the "faults" you've just deacribed.

The stable writing pace is something that allows me to casually read through entire chapters in one sitting, something I love doing, and despite not being th most stimulating at times, I still get heavily invested in the plot and characters.

The wizarding world is far from a perfect place, and I like when story's use this as a plot device. Again, this is pretty much a preference thing.

Dumbledore is somewhat out of character, but it's fanfiction. All the characters are somewhat out of character. Where in the story did it imply wizards could run out of magic? They can get tired from expending a lot of it, pretty sure that's true HP canon.

I would argue muggle science is on par/better than magic, in many aspects. Place a wizard with a wand and a muggle with an assualt rifle in a room and tell them to fight to the death. The muggle wins. Magic is much better from a medical standpoint. Alternatively, there isn't any magical "explanation of the universe" like muggles have with the Big Bang and quantum mechanics. Both sides have their strong points.

As for trying to fit magic in with muggle science, I absolutely love it. I'm the type of person who looks at a rainbow and questions how and why it exists before admiring its beauty.

Every opinion has its antithesis.
