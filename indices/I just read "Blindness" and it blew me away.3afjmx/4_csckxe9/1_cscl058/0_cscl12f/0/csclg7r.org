[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past]]

It's an AU where the sorting hat was an eighth horcruxe, and a Mary Sue. A damaged, ptsd Harry finally defeats voldemort at 28-30 years old. All his friends and family are dead and he manages to go back in time. Not everyone likes it because of some of the ideas and themes, but that's partially because it was the precedent for a lot of tropes in fanfiction.

But no one can really disagree that the writing isn't top notch.
