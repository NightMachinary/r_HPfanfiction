Ehhh... while I totally agree he's op, I gotta say it isn't written in without pretty elaborate exposition and explanation.

I mean the premise is that he's A: Capable of literally seeing life and magic, and B: No one else can, and thus no one else can really comprehend how magic /works/ like he can. And C: That lead him to being vastly underestimated.

If the author keeps writing I'm sure any future antagonists will not.

Edit: And I'm pretty sure that this sight only works the way it does because of how he was blinded. In the story the author informs us that there are very few blind witches or wizards and all of them blinded later on in life. The first few chapters are really good about the discrimination and difficulties of the disability, but that isn't really the point of the entire story. I mean while it may be interesting I would be significantly less interested in a blind Harry who can do basically zero magic.
