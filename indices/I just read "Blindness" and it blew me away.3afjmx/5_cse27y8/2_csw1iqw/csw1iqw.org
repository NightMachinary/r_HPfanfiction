I think it is worth reading now. I too am not a fan of incomplete stories, but this is a good one to make an exception for. As stated it is divided into 4 parts, part 4 hasn't been released yet. Part 3 ends well. It is a good spot, a character realizes something at the end, but it isn't a huge cliffhanger, just a natural ending.
