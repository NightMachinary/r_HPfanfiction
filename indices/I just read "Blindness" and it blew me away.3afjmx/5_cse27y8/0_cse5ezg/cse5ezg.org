At the moment the fic has 94 000 words. The author structured it in 4 parts, three of which have been released. She also posted an updating schedule for the fourth part on her profile page. If everything goes according to plan, she'll publish another long - and I mean long, like 25k-75k long - chapter each month and the Epilogue in September. It looks to me like the author is really seeing this trough.
