Yeah, I just fell in love with it. I read it all night last night instead of sleeping. I'm probably going to do another reading at a slower pace the next few days.

I wish the books could have had the time to develop the friendships, politics and relationships in a realistic deliberate manner. It makes it so much easier to love the characters and understand their motivations.
