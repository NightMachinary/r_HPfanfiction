I haven't personally read any memorable stories like that however I did find 3 communities which might have some stuff:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Potter-Impaired/40890/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Handicapped-Harry/32134/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Challenges-of-a-Different-Sort/1755/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]
