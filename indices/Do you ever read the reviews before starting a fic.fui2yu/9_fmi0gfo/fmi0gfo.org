I read on my phone, and with the fanfiction app the way it is I struggle not to have a peak at the reviews before reading. It's good to get a feel for the book, but sometimes I'll catch a spoiler. Or I'll find out nothing because one of this shit tier reviewers who responds to EVERY chapter as though they are in a private conversation with the Author has clogged the review tab with a hundred shitty 'reviews'.
