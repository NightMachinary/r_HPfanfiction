I have a fic in both ff.net and ao3. I don't really get much reviews in general, but:

In ff.net the reviews are similar to what you describe as a sign of being a bad fic.

While in Ao3 the reviews are about what happened in the chapter and engaging enough for me to answer to them and talk a little about the characters or events.

Is my fic good or bad?
