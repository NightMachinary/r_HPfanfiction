I don't seek out the reviews. If I'm on the ffn app when I'm pulling up a fic for the first time I'll end up looking at the most recent comments just because they are right there in your face. If I'm reading on AO3 I often start to look at comments a couple of chapters in just to see what other people are thinking of the story so far.
