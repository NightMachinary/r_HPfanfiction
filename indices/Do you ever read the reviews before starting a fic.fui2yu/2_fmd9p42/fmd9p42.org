I read the last (current) page of reviews/comments, and then I skip to the middle of the pack when the last chapter released.

The first one is to check the grammar/spelling/plot/etc, and the second one is to see if the ending was good or the fic was still good. Too many times have I read a fic and the ending was crap.

THEN! I check the last chapter to see if it is legitimately the final chapter, or the author abandoned the fic and marked it as complete.

FFNet really needs to add an "Abandoned" tag for status.
