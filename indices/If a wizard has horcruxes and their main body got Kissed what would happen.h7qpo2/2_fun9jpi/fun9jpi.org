Well, a soul that's been broken up to make horcruxes would be badly defiled.\\
What happens when you eat deteriorated, rotten food? You get sick.

So...\\
Possibility 1: A dementor gets sick from eating Voldemort's soul, and promptly regurgitates the contents of their stomach; a massive cloud of memory-stuff and a few partially-digested souls is vomited everywhere, with anyone caught in the blast developing multiple-personality disorder as absorbed memories and soul-bits struggle for attention.

Possibility 2: It gets the dementor sick, causing its body to deteriorate from soul-sickness. It survives up until being exposed to a Patronus, at which point instead of being able to flee, the dementor completely disintegrates, its rotting remains infesting the soil and giving rise to a horrible new breed of dark weeds.

Possibility 3: Voldemort's soul has been transformed into some parasitic form; like how his diary drained Ginny, his main soul starts to suck the 'life' out of the dementor that ate it.\\
Over the course of a few weeks, the dementor that took Voldemort's soul grows weaker and weaker, until finally it disintegrates, and the thought-soulless Voldemort rises again, having taken a dementor's life-force for his own and grown all the more terrible for it.
