That piece of soul and body would be dead, but his soul could be extracted a horcrux and could be reborn into a new body correct? Hes just got that much less of a full soul. The soul in this case would only retain memories (how can a soul have memories) from the point it was created right? Think the diary only knowing what riddle knew. The spells just allowed the soul piece to communicate which would mean it had some sort of ability to retain memories.
