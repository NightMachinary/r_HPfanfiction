I would say it's very likely that she asked for his address - as a 12 year old I kept a meticulous notebook with all my friends' addresses and phone numbers in, and still have some memorised now (what useless information to retain). Hermione didn't have any friends before Hogwarts, and I think she (like Harry) probably would have been worried about losing those friendships over the long summer break and been eager to keep in touch. In fact, it kind of bothers me that /Harry/ didn't think to ask for her and Ron's addresses/phone numbers.

She definitely had /access/ to an owl because her letters to Harry were among those Dobby had intercepted in the beginning of CoS. Either her parents had bought one so they could easily keep in contact with her while she was at school, or they took trips to Diagon Alley to use the Owl Postal Service there.

But I think it's quite likely that Harry might have suggested that they stick to Owl Post, considering the Dursleys' reactions to him receiving letters in PS. I think even a muggle letter arriving through the letterbox with Harry's name on it would have raised questions/caused an argument. Although that could be an interesting plot point if you're looking to write something about this!
