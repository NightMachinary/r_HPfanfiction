So this made me think, What is the likelihood that Hermione had his full address? It might be weird for us Muggles, but the only letter we actually see addressed is the school one and it does have his full address on it. How possible is it that they exchanged addresses at some point offscreen so they could write?

Or is it a moot point because Hermione didn't have her own Owl?
