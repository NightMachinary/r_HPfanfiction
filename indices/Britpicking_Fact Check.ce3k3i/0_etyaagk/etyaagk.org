So we used to get The Phone Book from BT (British Telecoms) through the post each year which would list the phone numbers and addresses of people in your area (I lived in a rural area and think it was a county-wide one, cities may have had their own ones; I imagine the Dursley's would be in a Surry-wide one). Hermione might have been able to get hold of a Surrey copy from her local library in London.

​

There was also Directory Enquiries, which could be reached by calling 192. But I think you needed someone's full address to get their phone number.

​

Plus I suspect the Dursley's would have been ex-directory to avoid being contacted by any pesky double glazing salesmen or /undesirables/. Perhaps nothing a resourceful young witch like Hermione couldn't have worked her way around though?
