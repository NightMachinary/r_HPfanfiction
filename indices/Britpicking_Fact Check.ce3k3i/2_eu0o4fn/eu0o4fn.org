Other posters have mentioned the phone book. It was the sort of thing that was done as routine back then that today would be slammed as a gross invasion of privacy or something.

Basically it was an alphabetical list of everyone living in a certain area along with the first line and postcode of their address. You could apply to have your number made ex-directory, which stopped it being listed, but there was a small charge so only people like doctors did it so they couldn't be contacted at home by impatient patients.

There was also a version for local businesses called Yellow Pages, because it was printed on yellow paper. That still gets sent round sometimes, but is mainly now done at yell.co.uk instead.

Telephone directories - including out-of-area ones - were always available at local libraries, so if someone wanted to find Harry and knew he lived in Little Whinging, they'd just have to go to the town library, spend 30s flipping through the directory to find Dursley, V and then head to the address.
