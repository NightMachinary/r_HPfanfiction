Here are some more fanfics I like:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] by MarauderLover7

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

Sequel in progress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679830/1/A-Twist-of-Fate][A Twist of Fate]] by Emcee Frodis

#+begin_quote
  For Want of a Nail AU: After the fall of the Potters, Hagrid gives Harry to Sirius in order to protect him. Believing him a traitor, the Order pursues him and he must stay one step ahead to protect himself and his Godson.

In progress, rarely updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story]] by cosette-aimee

#+begin_quote
  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

In progress, rarely updated (actually, could be abandoned by now).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4674115/1/The-Promise][The Promise]] by ZairaAlbereo

#+begin_quote
  Eight years ago Sirius Black made a promise. Now he is in Azkaban, trying to hold on to the remains of his sanity. But then something happens to Harry and Sirius wakes up. Two scarred souls - or three? What does it take for them to heal?
#+end_quote

Sequel abandoned (so we won't get an epilogue).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen

#+begin_quote
  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
#+end_quote

Complete, sequel is expected.

Sirius is one of the main characters here but he won't appear often until the second half of the story.
