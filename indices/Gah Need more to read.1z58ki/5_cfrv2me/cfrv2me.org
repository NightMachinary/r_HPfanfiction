A general recommendation:

Sign up to the Dark Lord Potter Forums. They've been an active community for years where people post, beta, and link to their favorite stories. A lot of the best fics got a jump-start there, and I've found a few new ones that are very good also.

The section where authors submit new fics for crowd-sourced betas are also good, since they provide a rating system for users to vote on how good they think a fic is (1-5 stars).

It's great, and I'm just as hooked to it as [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]].
