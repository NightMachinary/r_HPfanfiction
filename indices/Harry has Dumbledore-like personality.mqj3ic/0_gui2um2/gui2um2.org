The scene in the graveyard:

Voldy: "... Avada Kedavra!"

Harry after calmly stepping aside from the curse, "So, you are Voldemort is it? You look better now than 3 years ago mate but are you feeling alright? you look a bit pale, it must be years since you ate anything, poor chap!".

Voldy: "Draw your wand Potter! ... Crucio!", only for the spell to miss his target as Harry bends down to pick up his fallen mokeskin pouch and take out a platter of treacle-tart from it to show Voldy.

Harry: "Here you go, mate! my emergency stash for when I get kidnapped and have nothing to snack on, have a bite and I guarantee you it will add some color to those cheeks. Get something into that stomach of yours and you will calm right down."

Basically, Harry thinks Voldy is Hangry.
