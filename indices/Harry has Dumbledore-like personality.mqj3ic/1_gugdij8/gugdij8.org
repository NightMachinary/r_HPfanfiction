He has this personality in Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay by Saphroneth. I will admit that I haven't been keeping up with this fic, but I'm still following it and it recently went over 100 chapters. linkffn(13230340)

I also really like his personality in The Price is Right by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel IP), in which his adventures in his first year of Hogwarts are delightfully surreal and he just goes with the flow. linkffn(9894129) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2337458][or on AO3]].
