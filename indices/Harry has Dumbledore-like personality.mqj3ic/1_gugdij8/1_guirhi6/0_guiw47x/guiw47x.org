I've seen it described as a "slice of life" fic, which I guess is a fancy literary term for "no real plot, just plot devices." Does it get better? Like I said, I haven't been keeping up with it so I really can't say. It's on my "reread when it's done" list, which is why I'm still subscribed.

I did like the bits in the early years, with him trying to figure out how to get around his physical challenges, such as the broom classes, and getting lost while flying to town (because navigation is A Thing) so they make a plan to send letters with Hedwig so he can follow her back for if it happens again. And I absolutely adored the mentions of the twins: "Fred and Possibly Fred," "he decided to call them both George that day," etc. (It was actually a bit disappointing when he learned to tell them apart because I really liked that." And them all getting their animagus forms, and learning to work with them ("throwing" Ron the squirrel during battle, for example) was pretty cool.

The most recent chapter says there's only an epilogue left, so it's at least coming to some sort of resolution (or at least to an end).
