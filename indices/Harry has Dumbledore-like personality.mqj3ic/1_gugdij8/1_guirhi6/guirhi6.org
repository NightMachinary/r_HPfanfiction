There's nothing going on in Dragon, no conflict, nothing - they just go to Hogwarts. At first I thought its just a canon rehash but Harry is a Dragon, but no, there's a bit more to it, but not much. New students, Harry is a bit smarter, there's some questions on racism/speciesism but it doesn't go anywhere, raised in year 1 and forgotten until year 5, dragons. But there's no excitement, no action, just a normal school but magic and Harry is a Dragon. Most excitement was year 5, we got, as one might expect, Umbridge, and I thought now the fun will start, but no. She's just a joke. As author puts it themselves - it's hard to do anything bad when you got no special powers and all your coworkers hate you.

tl;dr - I'm disappointed, does it get better or is it just "they go to school"? Even Voldemort is a fucking joke, and he's a main bad guy.
