Well, there's linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah). In it, Harry is semi-permanently stuck in his animagus form, and definitely feels less comfortable being human. Please be aware, it is for all intents and purposes an incomplete story even though it is marked as complete (the last chapter is an extended synopsis of what would have been included in the story).
