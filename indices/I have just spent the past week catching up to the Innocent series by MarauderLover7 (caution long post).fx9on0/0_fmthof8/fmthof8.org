- OK, deep dive into magic ... linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure), I am not sure whether I like it that much, it seems like too much Malfoy apologists, but author's views on magic and magical world are truly magical. Probably, not so much hidden gem.

- In your favourite authors list you have not mentioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]]. That would be very serious error. Start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and you will have enough reading for the whole quarantine however long it is. (also on FFnet and SIYE)

- I don't know how much hidden gem is linkffn(Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here), but it is for me one of two candidates for the best fanfiction story ever. Period. Very much not funny though.

- And couple of stories which are IMHO truly hidden gems with just little readership, but worthy of every character they use:

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] ... next-generation story, the main heroine is Holly, daughter of Dudley Dursley, but it is anything like any other Dudley-has-a-with-as-daughter story you have read before.

2. linkao3(Petunia's Letter by mzzbee) and its sequels. I think it is completely unique pairing and it is very much adult story (not that there would be that much smut, but because it is very grown-up story where prominently stands infidelity, forgiveness and similar stuff; if you are looking for the battle scenes, sorry, that is not that story).

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie by Amaru_Katari]] ... OK, I can understand why this is not so popular: it deals with suicide in very very open manner. If you have any issues which can be triggered, you should seriously stay away from this. The author was himself (or herself, not sure) working through a suicide in her family, and it is very obvious. Otherwise, very much worthy of reading for its honesty.

4. OK, linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) is another not that much hidden gem, but if you haven't read it, you should.

5. And two more light-hearted: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1464478][SIYE Apparition Challenge (2016-1)]] ... you just want to read it, even if you don't know about this deep longing of your hear.

6. And linkffn(3124159) ... penguins!
