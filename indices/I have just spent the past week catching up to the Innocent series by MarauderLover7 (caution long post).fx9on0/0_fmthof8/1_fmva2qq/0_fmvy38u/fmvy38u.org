- Northumbrian ... I always believed that it is one of the most famous fanfic authors. Period. His stories are really good and his style, I would call it magicians' realism (NOT magical realism, which is crap), is really really good, and something I would like to write like myself.

- You skipped over Puzzle, and don't skip over it in your reading. It is really good piece of writing.

- Victoria Potter is more “all your friends are trying to kill you” trope, but the storyline is not what matters to me that much in this case (and I have my huge doubts about it, but it has not finished yet, so it is hard to judge), but the universe author developed. Including special [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSN6uKdap435i9IJY2w2STNon9zBfbTHb0nQSJUYqMU/edit?usp=sharing][fashion]], special magic, everything. Really great in that aspect, at least.

- Petunia's Letter. Yes, the cheating is more complicated. And, I am a Protestant Christian, so I am strongly in the “no cheating on your spouse” camp, but this is not trying to be apologetic. She does something wrong, she knows it is wrong, and she is not trying to excuse herself. As I said, it is really reading for adults, who manage to deal with complicated moral situations. True art starts where it describes even the ugly and painful parts of life.

- Appartation challenge. Yes, it is pure crack, but lovely and really funny.
