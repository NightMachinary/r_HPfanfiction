To begin with, THANK YOU for introducing me to Northumbrian. See, this is exactly the kind of thing I meant when I talked about hidden gems. I only read the first couple lines of Tales of the Battle and I already know I am going to love it. And I had no idea that such a talented author existed!

I have heard of Victoria Potter before, but I was never inclined to read it. Mostly because Slytherin Harry fics so often tend to go down the bashing route, or even worse, become straight-up pureblood supremacy apologia, and it leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. But, since you mention it takes a deep dive into magic, I want to at least try it out.

Holly at Hogwarts... YES!YES!YES! I really love Dudley has a witch as a daughter stories, and because you say this is unlike any other, I am super excited to see where it leads. Plus, from what I can tell from the beginning, it seems to be pretty well-written, and it is a full series? Why does it have so little readership?

Petunia's Letter. Hmm. Interesting premise and the fic is short and sweet. I confess, I am /not/ fond of the idea of Arthur Weasley cheating, which is what the tags are suggesting, but the idea is intriguing, and the story seems well-written, so I will give it the old college try.

Gryffindor Tie. Yeeeah. I have already read this story. Several times over, as a matter of fact. And I remember the first time I read it and wished it had continued, and then realized the author was writing this to cope with the suicide of her/his uncle and then felt like an asshole for wishing that. I don't want to go back to this one until I am at another low point in my life.

Grow Young with Me. *Facepalms*. I...had caught up with this one months ago, then forgotten about it while waiting for updates. Thank you for reminding me.

SIYE Apparition challenge. This one is going to be utter crack, isn't it? Just what I need more of in my life currently! Thank you for this rec!

And finally, Just a Random Tuesday. One of my oldest and all-time favourites. Written back when FFnet itself was still young, and I had barely started to discover the HP series itself. I have already read it, of course, several times. It just warms my heart to see people still remember this and appreciate it, and recommend it to others. So thank you.
