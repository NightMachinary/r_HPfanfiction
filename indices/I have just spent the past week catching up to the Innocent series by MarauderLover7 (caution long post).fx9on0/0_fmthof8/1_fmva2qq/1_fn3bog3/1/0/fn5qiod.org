And this one is a bit tangentially related ... linkao3(19475812) ... Dudley has a magical child, but it is expected, given his wife is a witch. There are couple of one-shots playing with this pairing (some of them are good; I told you, I read really a lot of Dursley-related stories), but this one is the only one where it gets some significant development. I am not 100 % certain with the result (see my comments on the story), but it is certainly worthy of reading.
