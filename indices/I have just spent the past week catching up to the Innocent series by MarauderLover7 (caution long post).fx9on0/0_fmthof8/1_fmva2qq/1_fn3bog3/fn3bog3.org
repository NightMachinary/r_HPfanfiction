  Holly at Hogwarts... YES!YES!YES! I really love Dudley has a witch as a daughter stories, and because you say this is unlike any other, I am super excited to see where it leads.

Just some comments on Dudley-has-a-witch stories.

Most of them are absolutely horrible. After the initial obvious panick attack scene (“Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! She got the same letter as Harry! What will my parents say, what will my wife say?”) and emergency visit from Harry, perhaps with some more scenes of “Dudley discovers beauty of the magical world”, they completely run out of steam, and they are either unfinished, or you wish they were unfinished, because there is no content there.

Aside from Holly I know only about few exceptions (I am very much fanatic on the conversion type of stories about Petunia, so I went through many many Dursley-related stories):

- linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) ... this is story is rather brief, but very good, its follow-up is /slightly/ too much Snape apology to my taste, but it is still very much worthy of reading, because it has its own independent story.

- [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] and its (unfortunately unfinished) sequel are rather strange in terms it is no-apology PG-13 afternoon TV series of high-school drama from Hogwarts. Troubles with boyfriends (not of the main protagonist), exams, Quidditch and so on. If you like (as I do) Kipling's “Stalky & Co.” or if you followed American afternoon TV (as I haven't), then you may enjoy it.
