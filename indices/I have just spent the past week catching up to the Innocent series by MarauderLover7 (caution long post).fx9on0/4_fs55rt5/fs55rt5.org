It doesn't hit /all/ of your points, but linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) covers a lot of them. It has really good redemption arcs for Draco and Snape (particularly Snape, who is as bitter and twisted as ever, Harry just out-stubborns him). Harry moves in with Sirius about halfway through after Voldemort tricks the Dursleys into kicking Harry out. Harry delves into some interesting experimental potions (naturally), although Snape remains the master and has a pretty cool part in the final battle. First and foremost, though, it's packed full of dry humour and one-liners.
