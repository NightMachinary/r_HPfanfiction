I'll probably get downvoted bc I already recommended it a thousand times, but check out Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

Many are put-off by the main pairing and while I was aware of the fic, I generally hit the back button myself for years, especially seeing the length and the fact that at the time it was unfinished. But this is unjustified.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

It is a great "who-dun-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems.

It checks several of your boxes, especially family bonding, Ron is an Auror and actually good at his job, Bill and Fleur make an appearance and there is stuff going on with the Malfoys that I don't intend to spoil just yet.
