I just checked this out, and, despite the rather... /unorthodox/ main pairing, the very first paragraphs, with the descriptions of Harry's spell-working, were enough to hook me. I can already tell I am really going to like this story, probably even despite the main pairing. Thank you so much for the reco!!
