It auto-tags due to the fact you used the word smut. Happens with my boilerplate disclaimers all the time. If you want to turn it off, you go to the little 'comments share save hide' bar thing on the post, there should be a little option that says 'nsfw'. If you click that, then 'yes' when that comes up, it should de-tag as NSFW.
