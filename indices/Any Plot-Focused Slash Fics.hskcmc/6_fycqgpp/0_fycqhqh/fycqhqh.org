  Severus Snape has a change of heart. In an attempt to keep Potter alive, he tells the Dark Lord all about Dumbledore's plans for Potter and the war. Once Voldemort realizes that Harry Potter is his horcrux, his plans change drastically. So does Draco Malfoy's assignment for the school year. Harry's sixth year starts going very differently. Snape is now on a mission to discover why Harry was so ignorant of the Wizarding World. Harry is going to need to learn pureblood politics if he's going to keep up with everything. Draco Malfoy needs to find a way to convince Harry to forgive him. Voldemort finds himself visiting Harry Potter in his dreams. Everyone is realizing that no one is quite what they thought. And through it all, there's a mystery. What is Ancient Magic? Why is it so powerful and so hard to control? And why did Professor Dumbledore go out of his way to make it illegal?

  “The only reason any of this is happening at all is because of you. You seek me out. Again and again and again. You bring me back. This isn't my party at all. It's yours.”

  There was no denying the tension in Harry now and relishing the achievement, Tom pressed even closer, invading Harry's personal space, nearly making him flatten against the window.

  “So tell me, Harry, why do you keep inviting me to play?” Or, in other words, being dead means jack shit.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable. "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.”At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts an undercover mission to assist in his search for the Hallows. Only, the young wizard finds himself involved in far more dangerous matters than he could have ever imagined.
