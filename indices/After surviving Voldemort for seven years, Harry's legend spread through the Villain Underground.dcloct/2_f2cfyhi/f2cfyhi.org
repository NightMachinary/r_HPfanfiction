Harry had absolutely /had it/ with the odd muggles that tried to ambush him. Honestly, this midget on a tricycle was the worst. He had woken up chained to a /loo/ of all things. There was a hacksaw nearby, and apparently the only way to escape was to saw off his arm. He scoffed and used a wandless unlocking charm. As if he'd never been kidnapped before. He rolled his eyes. A muggle telly was on the other side of the decrepit bathroom, and it showed the idiot in the mask that tried to kidnap him.

"That's not how the game works!" The man yelled. Harry smirked. He apparated into the room where the man was sitting. Another quick spell saw the man bound.

He had Hermione look into urban legends after a nearly disastrous camping trip ended with them being chased by a wanker with a machete, and she had found a few interesting things. A search on the internet, a marvelous muggle invention, and judicious use of his inheritance had seen him the owner of a puzzle box. It was meant to punish evildoers, and after that idiot in a ghost costume had terrified them at Albus' first birthday, he had decided to fight fire with fire as it will.Sure enough, the contents of his pockets were nearby. He grabbed his wand, and summoned the mokeskin pouch. He reached into the pouch and summoned the puzzle box. It floated in midair. Its presence seemed to make the shadows lengthen, and the lights dim.

"Tell me, do you want to play a game?" Harry asked his captor, With a wave of his wand, and an ominous click, the spell designed to solve the lament configuration activated. It wouldn't be the first time he summoned the powers contained within, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. As the creatures contained within the box appeared and dragged the muggle off to its macabre doom, Harry fought back a shiver of cold pleasure, and he gave a grin that was all sharp teeth. These killers needed to die after all. For the greater good of his family.
