"I don't understand..." Ghostface stared in dismay at the cooling corpse of the Wizarding World's Chosen One lying facedown in the grass of the Burrow's yard. For once, the expression on his mask matched his true face perfectly. "Who could have done this? Who finally got him?!"

There was a horrible grinding noise as Leatherface's chainsaw finally ran out of gas. The crowd of killers and monsters shifted uneasily. Jason Vorhees scratched his head with his machete. A few peels of dead skin fell off the Look-See into the pattern of a skull - Final Destination's Death had been eager for a crack at what this universe's Death hadn't been able to kill. Nosferatu and Amanda Young exchanged worried glances.

"Wait..." said Damien Thorn, slowly. "What day is it?"

"Thursday," said Patrick Bateman, checking out his reflection in one of the Mayflower mirrors he'd brought along. The reflection winked and smile back.

"No, you idiots," snarled the Leprechaun, who was very sensitive about passing holidays unnoticed. "It's the third Thursday in November! And that means-"

"Sorry about gobblin' your kill, cluckolds," came a smug voice from inside the Burrow, where the last of the Weasleys had been dispatched by their own Thanksgiving dinner. Turkie, the demonic turkey animated by an ancient Native American shaman, strutted into view. "At least now we know who's got the good stuff-ing, huh?"

But even the killer turkey's legendary bravado quailed at the rage expressed in the visages of the most deadly killers in the multiverse.

"You know, it's not my usual fare," said Hannibal Lecter thoughtfully, "but I think I could adapt one of my recipes for... the other white meat."

Chuckles, growls, and giggles of appreciation and anticipation were heard as the crowd closed in on the unfortunate bird.

The end...?
