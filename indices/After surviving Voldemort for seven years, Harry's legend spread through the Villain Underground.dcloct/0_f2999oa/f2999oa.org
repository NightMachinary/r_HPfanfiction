Harry woke up with yawn, sleep not being as restful as he'd have hoped. He'd had a weird dream last night, a burned man with claws that wore a sweater even Molly would blanche at, had tried to kill him. It seemed rather random, having no idea what could've prompted his subconscious to summon such a bizarre dream assailant. Still, he wasn't a 5th year anymore and his occlumency skills let him metaphorically bitchslap the errant dream. Harry had left the strange being locked in a classroom listening to Prof. Binns's lecture on the 4th Goblin Rebelllion before he'd finally settled to a restful sleep.

As Harry came downstairs he noticed Lily playing with that horrid doll. Apparently, the animation charms on some poor kid's toy was acting up. The blasted thing had come at him with a knife of all things. Stunning the malfunctioning toy, he'd brought it home with the intention of giving it to Hagrid, his pets were always needing new toys. Shuddering, Harry thought briefly of Norbert's teddy bear. Kneeling down to the little girl, Harry reached out for the doll, "Now Lily, that's not yours. That's Uncle Hagrids."

Lily clutched the doll tightly in a hug, "No! My Uncle Ron!"

Harry blinked. Now that it was pointed out, the doll did have a certain resemblance to Ron. Maybe she could keep it. "Well... we'll see."

Lily squealed taking this for a yes and ran off with the doll. Harry noticed the doll over Lily's shoulder, if he didn't know any better he'd say there was an expression of panic on the thing's face.
