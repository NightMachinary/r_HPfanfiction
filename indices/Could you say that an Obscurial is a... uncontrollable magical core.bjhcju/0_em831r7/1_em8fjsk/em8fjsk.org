I honestly wouldn't be surprised if magical cores became a thing in canon as Credence is more discussed in the Grindelwald series. It honestly feels like we're almost splitting hairs on if a "magical core" exists but they talk about how wizards become an obscurial by suppressing their magic due to a traumatic event.
