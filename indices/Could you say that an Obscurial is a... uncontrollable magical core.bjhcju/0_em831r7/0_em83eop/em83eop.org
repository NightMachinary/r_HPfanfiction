Don't worry, I was made very aware that magical cores weren't canon the second I found this sub.

Also, does that mean in normal wizards and witches, magic exists within them like â€˜calmer' version of an Obcurial, or is it something else entirely? I wonder if there is a fic out there that looked into this.
