From what I understand it's when a person truly fears their magic, represses I guess. My take on it is that non obscurials accept their magic as part of themselves naturally because even though they don't understand it consciously, on some level subconsciously they know it's them. Obscurials don't accept their magic, fear it to an extent that their conscious and subconscious fear wars with the natural acceptance of their magic. Accidental magic is more raw than wand magic and seems to be more based on strong emotions, self preservation is a big one. As time goes on and a kid gets older their wants and fears and other emotions aren't as basic and strong as they were when they were younger so magic settles but obscurials happen when there's that constant terror of what you are or what's in you.The magic sort of forms a consciousness of its own to protect itself but it's very taxing on a kid. I suppose you could say obscurials are more chaotic but like I said I think it's more that an obscurial has no real control.
