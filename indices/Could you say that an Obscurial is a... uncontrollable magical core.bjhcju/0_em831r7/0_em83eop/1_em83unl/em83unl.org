Id imagine the Obscurial as being a volatile version of the core. Like, the witch/wizard tries so hard to repress his magic that magic actually obeys his command, but can never accomplish it because its impossible. This creates a conflict and just makes the core very unstable, eventually to the point where it cant keep itself together anymore and just lashes out.
