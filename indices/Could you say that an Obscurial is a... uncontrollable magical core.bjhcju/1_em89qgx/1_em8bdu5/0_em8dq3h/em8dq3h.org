  According to that same cannon though, the Obscurial is born out of the repressed magic, turning the magic into that being.

A child supressing their own magic is the condition under which the obscurus creature comes into being. At no point is it stated that the obscurus is "made of" that child's magic, and as stated above, it's clear at several points that the obscurus is distinct from its host's magic.

Another example of the obscurus being distinct from its host's magic is Newt having in captivity an obscurus of a dead obscurial.
