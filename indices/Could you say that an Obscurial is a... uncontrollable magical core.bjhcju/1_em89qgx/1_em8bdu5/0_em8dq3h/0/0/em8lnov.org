It's clear enough if you pay attention.

*ONE:* An obscurus is a "dark force" that the child develops, not the obscurial's magic:

#+begin_quote
  NEWT: I met one in Sudan three months ago. There used to be amore of them but they still exist. Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by Muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus.

  TINA: It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark force that bursts out and - and attacks and then vanishes...
#+end_quote

*TWO:* An obscurus is parasitical, i.e. it latches onto the obscurial rather than being the same thing as the obscurial:

#+begin_quote
  GRAVES: So it's useless without the host?

  NEWT: Useless? Useless? That is a parasitical magical force which killed a child. What on earth would you want to use it for?
#+end_quote

*THREE:* The obscurus is a creature within Credence which takes over his body. It is not the same entity as Credence:

#+begin_quote
  GRAVES: You can control it, Credence.

  CREDENCE: But I don't think I want to, Mr Graves.

  /The Obscurus moves horribly beneath CREDENCE'S skin. An awful inhuman growl comes out of his mouth, from which something dark begins to bloom./

  /The force finally takes over CREDENCE, his whole body exploding into a dark mass which hurtles forward out of the window, narrowly missing GRAVES./
#+end_quote

*FOUR:* An obscurial with unusually powerful magic can use that magic to survive and control the obscurus.

#+begin_quote
  TINA: He's not a child.

  NEWT: I know - but I saw him - his power must be so strong - he's somehow managed to survive. It's incredible.
#+end_quote

If an obscurial having strong magic allows them to overpower the obscurus, then the obscurial's magic /must be/ separate from the obscurus. Otherwise that obscurus would possess that same strength.
