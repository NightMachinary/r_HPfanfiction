People frequently seem to forget that the obscurus is considered a magical creature. Yes, it's a parasitic upon a wizard (the obscurial) and its existence is generated under certain conditions rather than it being born biologically (similar to Dementors, boggarts, poltergeists, etc). Nonetheless it is a distinct entity from the Obscurial which hosts it.

Credence's obscurus is not his magic. It is a magical being which is parasitic upon his magic. Indeed, the strength of Credence's magic is given as the reason why he is able to control/overpower his obscurus, which /can only/ make sense if his magic is distinct from the obscurus.
