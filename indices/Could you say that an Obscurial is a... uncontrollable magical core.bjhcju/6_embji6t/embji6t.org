No such thing! Seriously, magical-cores get kind of old, especially since canon does not say anything about them existing -.-

It's more like a character's magic reacting to bad treatment and self-repression (and a retcon, because frankly if that was in the cards early on then Dumbledore can be glad that Harry didn't turn into one, which makes his comment about "...ten dark and difficult years..." more damning and should IMHO lead to Dumbledore truly getting punished!) by getting malevolent and lashing out (it's like a pressure-cooker with too much pressure it explodes violently!)
