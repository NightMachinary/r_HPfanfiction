Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the "magical core model" of magic, due to my personal preference for vague and mystical magic models over science-like ones.

In the Harry Potter universe, many magical creatures are manifestations of certain emotions. Boggarts are manifestations of fear, Dementors of depression and despair, Poltergeists of mischief. In a similar vein, I think, the Obscurus can be viewed as the magical manifestation of trauma.
