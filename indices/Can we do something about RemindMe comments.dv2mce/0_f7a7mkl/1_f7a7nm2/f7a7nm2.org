I will be messaging you on [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-11-13%2001:34:32%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time][*2019-11-13 01:34:32 UTC*]] to remind you of [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dv2mce/can_we_do_something_about_remindme_comments/f7a7mkl/][*this link*]]

[[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FHPfanfiction%2Fcomments%2Fdv2mce%2Fcan_we_do_something_about_remindme_comments%2Ff7a7mkl%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202019-11-13%2001%3A34%3A32%20UTC][*CLICK THIS LINK*]] to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
