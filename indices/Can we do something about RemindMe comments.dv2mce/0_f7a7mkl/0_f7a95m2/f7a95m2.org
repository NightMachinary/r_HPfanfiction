That would be a good solution to multiple 'remind me' comments in a thread, but to be honest I'm fed up with even single 'remind me's.

Often times I get excited to see new comments have been posted in a thread that interests me, only to click the link and find that it's just more worthless spam. It's especially painful in request threads where the OP isn't lucky enough to get any responses except the spam. I imagine it must feel even worse for the OP, getting their hopes up for a fill of their request, but then they see the person didn't even attempt to address the topic.
