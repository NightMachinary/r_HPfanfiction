Harry's time spent with the twins is off screen. They were in the quidditch team together for years. They trained 3 or 4 times a week? That's a lot of time even if you aren't talking the whole time. In some ways the Quidditch team is Harry's closest bunch because they're the first people to recognise him for his skills rather than his name. Combine that all with Harry's tendency to feel guilty for every action made by Voldemort and his followers before Harry stopped him and I could see the authors not being too far off.
