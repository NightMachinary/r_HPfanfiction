Does DH contain that much of those two? I know the earlier books contained a fair amount, but you'd assume at some point Harry would get over his self-centeredness; he didn't cause the war. Almost every person who died chose to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. Hell, Harry himself walked to his death willingly. That, at the very least, should cure him of most of his misplaced guilt.
