I honestly don't remember, I haven't read books 4-7 in years. I think he was completely numb when he found out people died? I can't remember much about Fred's death besides Percy just turning good again.

I think the fact that he walks to his death shows that he has a ton of self sacrifice in him. I also don't think it would be... idk feasible to show much grief in DH, Fred dies in a small skirmish just before the Battle of Hogwarts (if I'm not misremebering), kill the daidem & cup, Snape dies, Snape memories, Harry walk to his death, then the final battle, and the 19 year timeskip. There wasn't much time to process anything "on screen".
