Assuming canon levels of self sacrifice/guilt from Harry it makes for Harry to be pretty broken up about Fred & the other deaths at the Battle of Hogwarts, considering he already has problems with people (in his view) dying for him (parents, Sirius, Dumbledore). Fred's death (and Lupin/Tonks) would probably be the worst for him considering he personally knows the people that will be most affected by this, the Weasleys and Teddy.

On the "Harry has more people and things to grieve", I think Harry's problem wouldn't necessarily be grieving Fred, it would be more feeling guilt that he died. That being said I do think they were closer than you described, Fred and George were also part of Harry's Quidditch team for 5(ish) years, and they gave him the Marauders Map.
