Yeah there's no doubt that the Weasleys got off lightly. I mean some families were almost completely wiped out.

Survivor's guilt is an interesting idea I hadn't thought about! My thoughts centered more towards Molly being inconsolable (loss of a child, reminder of the loss of her brothers). It's a well accepted fact that if the mother is miserable, the whole family suffers - so not only do the Weasley children have to deal with Fred's loss, but they also have to handle Molly's grief.
