As for Harry, he got a glimpse of afterlife and it looked pretty good. Dumbledore also mentioned death was preferable to a loveless life. Harry was even offered the option to go to heaven with Dumbledore.

However, he turned it down so he could finish his job and get back to his friends.

I'm not sure he would feel all that bad for those good people who had died.
