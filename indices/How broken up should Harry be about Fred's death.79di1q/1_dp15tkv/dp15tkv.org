Call me callous or insensitive, but I think the Weasleys got off way too lightly considering many families with far less involvement were decimated or destroyed. It could have been way worse for them. In fact, I would be perfectly happy to trade a couple more Weasleys for Remus or Tonks.

The Weasleys probably knew that themselves and might actually suffer survivors' guilt to a certain degree. Of course, they should still be very upset about Fred and would go for some serious retributions after their hard won victory. George, however, was the one I see truly torn up over Fred. Perhaps his trouble was the main reason Ron gave up his auror career and moved into his shop.
