the carriage held. this might not be sad per se, I'm always trying to stay away from sad, but this one fic was very depressing. it also had humor though. and it's not about Lily. basically just Snape going through things by himself. Dumbles and Mcgone will also turn their back from him etc. very depressing to me and it has two endings, if you want to get the more depressing one. It is a very good fic too methinks.

also this time loop. getting the hang of thursdays. also have two endings and the happy one is the last chapter so you could just not read it. I wish I didn't read the sad one.
