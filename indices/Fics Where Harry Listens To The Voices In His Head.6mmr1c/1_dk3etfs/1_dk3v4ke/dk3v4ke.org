They aren't really voices in his head like he has schizophrenia, but Rowling writes Harry's own self-doubt like a voice that questions his thoughts and motives in his head. Kinda like a negative conscience. I can't think of a specific example but from memory it happens a fair amount in the fifth book (?).
