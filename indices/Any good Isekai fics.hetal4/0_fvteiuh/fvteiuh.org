Isekai tensei is pretty much your standard self Insert premise. Honestly can't say any stand out as stellar.

On the transportation side, you are basically looking for 'hp universe summons help'. Usually the victim comes from HP AU or a crossover, but sometimes it is someone from "a world without magic"

Honestly this is a lot less common in HP fanfiction than other fandoms. Likely because it is easy to integrate someone with modern life experiences into the setting as a muggle.
