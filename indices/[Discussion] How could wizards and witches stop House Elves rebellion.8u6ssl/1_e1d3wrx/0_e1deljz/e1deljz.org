That has potential, actually. When several violent incidents caused by freed elves prompts the Ministry to order them to be exterminated (or at least culled), a full-on rebellion in Magical Britain ensues.

Will the poor elves be cut down? Will they escape to another country? Will they rally and successfully depose the Ministry, installing an Elfengamot in its place?
