  Malfoy didn't even have his wand out, you cant say that Dobby would have won if Malfoy did

Incorrect. Malfoy both gets his wand out and the text directly says Malfoy realized he couldn't win despite having it (emphasis added):

  But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and /pulled out his wand/, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  /Lucius Malfoy had no choice/. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
