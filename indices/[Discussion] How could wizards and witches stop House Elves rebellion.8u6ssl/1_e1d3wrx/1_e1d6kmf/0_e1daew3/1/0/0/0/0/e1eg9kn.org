  I am not, I am saying its no feat that can be used to talk about general fighting ability of wizards compared to house-elves.

What I'm saying is that it shows wizards are not the obvious victory here. Malfoy either didn't think he could win (how the text presents it) or he didn't think he could win fast.

  Remember how the Hermione literally mentions that Voldemort wouldn't even consider house-elves as something he had to install defenses against.

And if Voldemort isn't why would any random wizard? More to the point, there's no suggestion wizards even know how to do it.

  We have no reason to assume that its a matter of ability, its literally about nobody having a reason to block house-elves

But Voldemort did have a reason, he intended for Kreacher to die there.

  The average wizards is going to have a Sneakoscope at home to inform them of intruders so they wouldn't be asleep.

When have we ever seen the average wizard with a Sneakoscope? We haven't.
