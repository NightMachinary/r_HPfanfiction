  Why are you treating a rebellion as a duel? That's not how they work. Subterfuge, surprises and such win the day.
#+end_quote

I am not, I am saying its no feat that can be used to talk about general fighting ability of wizards compared to house-elves.

#+begin_quote
  Hm, remember how elves can even get through Voldemort's defenses?
#+end_quote

Remember how the Hermione literally mentions that Voldemort wouldn't even consider house-elves as something he had to install defenses against.

  If he didn't block them (if they can even be blocked) then no random wizard is going to know how to do it.
#+end_quote

We have no reason to assume that its a matter of ability, its literally about nobody having a reason to block house-elves. In a open rebellion of course wizards would use defenses that include them.

  Short of a Fidelius, the average wizard is going to be offed in their sleep if the aim is to kill wizards.
#+end_quote

The average wizards is going to have a Sneakoscope at home to inform them of intruders so they wouldn't be asleep.
