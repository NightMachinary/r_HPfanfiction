Depends. Are the House Elves committed to winning? Well then it's very hard. They have powerful wandless magic and can steal wands. Any dwelling that isn't warded with, say, a Fidelius (or otherwise extensive defenses like Number 12 pre-OoTP) can be Apparated into by elves; even in DH Dobby could get into Malfoy Manor. Most powerful pureblood families will already be put out without having elves waiting on them hand and foot, whereas elves already take care of themselves.

Elves have never seemed to have an issue Apparating, no mention of splinching, so mobility seems to be in their favor in general since according to Arthur many or most adult wizards don't bother with Apparition. This allows for some fun, messy business such as intentionally splinching wizards combatants. Good luck casting with your arms left behind.

That's the worst case scenario anyway, assuming the elves have the will to do so (because otherwise calling it a rebellion would be a bit silly).
