House elves do not stand a chance. There is really no reason to suspect that you can't stop house elves apparating. If you couldn't people would be using house elves that way. If they were stronger than wizards magically people would be using them to attack others.

You could for instance have Kreacher just pop into the ministery or her home and pop out with Umbridge.

The only case of a house elf beating a wizard and doing any entering a home is Dobby. Dobby has been the Malfoy elf that is probably why he could enter the property without problem. He knew how the wards work.

Lucius was surprised by the attack of Dobby and than realised that he should not be attacking people in Dumbledores school.

This explanation fits far better into the books.
