  Magic allows them to make muggle money rather easily - repair some stuff, for example. And muggle money can be exchanged for galleons.

Except they aren't technically permitted to do that. Statute of Secrecy and all that, not to mention that the generic Reparo is pretty limited.

  Further, you can enlarge and duplicate food, repair your own stuff, and create water on demand. So, you pay less than muggles.

  So, why would anyone be poor?

It's like people never recall that not everyone is as skilled as our protagonists or has +a walking library+ Hermione on their side. The average wizard cannot in fact do all of those things, especially Aguamenti which happens to be a NEWT-level spell only taught (in Magical Britain at least) to people with firmly above-average grades in Charms. In other words, a good half of the magical population if not more don't know how to create water on demand, especially considering that being in a NEWT-class is not a guarantee of passing that class.
