People tend to scoff at the whole "Ancient and Noble Houses" trope, but to my mind things tend to make more sense if Magical Britain actually /has/ an aristocracy for a reason, and that the Hogwarts-Durmstrang-Beauxbatons triad is the magical equivalent of the Ivy League, and only accepts people who are /super/ talented at magic, or at the very least above average in their capacity to cast it.
