As far as the magical triad goes, I get what you're saying, but I tend to think of the magical schools in a bit of a different light.

I would see those three as very Ivy League in the way you are saying, but very traditional magic. Sure, there are breakthroughs, particularly when entrepreneurs get involved, but overall pretty traditional.

I imagine, due to the populations and intermingling of cultures, that Ilvermorny & Castelobruxo would be more innovative, more likely to mingle different theories and types of spells and magic together.

Then Uagadou & Mahoutokoro really have their own style and traditions that aren't always easily integrated in bits and parcels, so largely end up in their own very strong systems, but little used by the others.

Hence, they'd all be very magically strong, but all in different ways.

Much like you see in higher education in the U.S. today, the Ivies still have a lot of the prestige, connections, etc. However, many students (particularly in the sciences) opt for the MIT & Caltech (Ilvermorny/Castelobruxo, in my mind) options.

Alas, just a theory, but one of the best parts about fic is the differing opinions/ideas.
