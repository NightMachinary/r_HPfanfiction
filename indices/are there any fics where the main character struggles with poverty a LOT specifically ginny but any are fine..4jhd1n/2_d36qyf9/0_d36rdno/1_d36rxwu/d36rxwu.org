You might have trouble getting good housing, but you could stay dry with the impervius charm, and transfigure stale food into edible food, and use warming charms to keep from shivering. Transportation would be a snap using apparation. It would not a good life, but it would be far superior to the life of a similarly poor muggle. Of course, if you're bad at magic, you wouldn't be able to do the food transfigurations, your impervius charms would leak, and the wind would whistle through your warming charms and steal away your comfort.

The big disadvantages of being a poor wizard (with decent skills) would be in getting health care (potions are expensive) and education (we know Hogwarts costs money.)
