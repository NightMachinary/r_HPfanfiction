If Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, Weasleys would be really struggling financially.

*Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect*, linkffn(9065880), contains lots of this theme. Ginny especially was suffering a lot in this story because the Weasleys couldn't even afford to buy her a decent wand. Harry only showed up at Hogwarts after year 6 and things quickly turned around.
