I haven't finished the story yet, but I think from the sounds of it, I disagree with the decision Mr and Mrs Weasley made. A wand is very important, so I'd be making sure the kids had a decent a one as possible, and letting the books take second place. I'd also be complaining about having to buy so many books that aren't even textbooks, and telling the kids they'd have to share. How many were there? Seven? Ridiculous. I'd be buying two sets and telling the five kids to share - only two of them would be in class at the same time, the twins. Surely the books don't change very much, Ginny must be able to inherit some books from the oldest five, at least. Ron managed with Charlie's old wand well enough, and even Neville must've gotten by with his dad's - you can't tell me they couldn't find something.
