Because Harry did give Weasleys some favors from time to time, such as Ginny's textbooks in year 2.

Harry's presence at Weasleys also gave them a certain level of political clout, I guess. In this story for example, Arthur was blamed for the petrifications caused by the Diary and sacked from the Ministry, which made their finances far more precarious as a result.

They couldn't even afford a suitable wand for Ginny, and she thought she was a near squib. Ginny was bullied, humiliated, and ridiculed throughout her first 5 years at Hogwarts, until Harry finally arrived in his year 7 and immediately mobilized the other three houses against the bullying Slytherins. [[/spoiler][At the end of story, Voldemort attempted to storm the Castle with upper year Slytherins as inside help, the other three houses retaliated brutally and killed every Slytherin student]]
