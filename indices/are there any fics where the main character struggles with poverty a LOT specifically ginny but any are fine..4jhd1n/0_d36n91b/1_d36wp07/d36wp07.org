In terms of Lupin, I'd like to see him trying to weave around werewolf laws while living this poor lifestyle. He should be probably be treated as sub human as canon suggests werewolves usually are. Difficulty in walking in public areas such as Diagon Alley, preferring to be in Knockturn Alley, presumably the dark rich families take advantage of the poor and give them oddjobs such as murder,theft,espionage etc. Because he's poor Lupin has difficulty getting a regular dose of Wolfsbane potion (maybe fucks with his sanity?) Maybe a lack of love life too. Money + Status is important for females in the wizarding world me thinks.
