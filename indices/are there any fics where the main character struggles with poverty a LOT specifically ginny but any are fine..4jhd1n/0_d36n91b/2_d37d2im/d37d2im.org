I don't think food is too big a deal. Remember the Weasley's survive off of Mr Weasley's paycheck and still have plenty of food on the table for everyone, including Harry. They are even able to feed the Order when they come around.

As far as we know healthcare and school is paid for via the taxes. This makes logistical sense as they are things that everyone has to have acces to if you want to keep the society hidden. Ex. People with donkey ears are pretty damn obvious.

I think the biggest problem is material goods. One thing to take notice of is they probably cost a lot more than muggle stuff. They don't have the same type of mass production as muggles as far as we know.

If you write something with kids in it then remember that for kids then material goods means a lot. Kids often believe that people who have more things are inherently "better" because they have what they want. It's more complicated than that, but you get the idea...

Enchanted items are very expensive. If you write a story where they have something that is enchanted then have your protagonist consider selling it. If it is an heirloom or something which their friends gave them then that can really tear them apart, knowing that it could make everything easier but that the item means a lot to them.

In terms of Lupin you should remember that people don't know he is a werewolf before Snape tells everyone at the end of book 3. He probably comes up with other excuses to why he isn't come into work around the time of the full moon, but it ends up with him being laid off anyway.
