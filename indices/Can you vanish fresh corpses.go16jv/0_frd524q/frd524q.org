You could probably, in theory, vanish a living person. Small mammals like kittens however, are as we learn in ootp, very challenging to vanish. So humans would probably be even more challenging.

This difficulty rating probably also applies to corpses, because in GoF Barty does not vanish the corpse of his father, but instead turns it into a bone and buries the bone. Would not vanishing it be superior and leave even less evidence? So perhaps it was beyond his skill level.

Not really sure where the ripping out someone's heart and beheading came from, but it's possible that smaller parts of a human would be easier to vanish, just like smaller mammals are easier to vanish.
