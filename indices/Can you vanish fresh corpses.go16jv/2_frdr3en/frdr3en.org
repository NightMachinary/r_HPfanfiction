One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that humans have souls; it might not be a matter of complexity, but that it's flat-out impossible to Vanish (or do certain other basic magic to) something with a human soul.

(The HPverse doesn't say anything about animal souls - maybe they don't have souls the way humans do, or maybe there's an Elder Scrolls-like distinction between sapient and subsapient souls.)
