I wonder if there have been experiments to that end. We know that the Vanishing Cabinet is based on the Vanishing charm, but it would make for a great fic-hook if someone created a way to reconstitiute vanished objects and beings.

You'd get a lot of garbage, a lot of dead bodies, but very rarely, you might get people who disappeared during cabinet transference, who never apparated after disapparating, whose portkey broke mid-transit.

Or for crossovers, perhaps another device, like the Stargate, or a Star Trek transporter, is advanced enough to catch the stray magical pattern of the protagonist as it drifts through the interdimensional medium, rematerializing them in that universe.

Would definitely be a better crossover hook than just the Veil /again/.
