  He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.

Harry just about manages to vanish an iguana and he's an E-level Transfiguration student. We also know that the difficulty of vanishing increases with complexity.

Therefore while I imagine that it is magically possible to vanish a human being, I doubt it's within the capability of even a normal O-level student. You probably need to be a master of the art to manage it.
