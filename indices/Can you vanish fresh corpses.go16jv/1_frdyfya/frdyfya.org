While I see [[/u/blast_ended_sqrt][u/blast_ended_sqrt]] point that Crouch jr was insane, I think it's more interesting to take canon at face value in terms of the limitations that magic has. It is entirely in line with a world where certain potions only work for people who are completely human & where souls exist (as again pointed out by [[/u/blast_ended_sqrt][u/blast_ended_sqrt]]), to have magic that in principle should work on what's really just meat on the bone but which does not. Thus, I hold that Crouch jr transfigured his father because it was the best available option. Hence, vanishing corpses is not something I think the "rules" allow for.
