I was thinking of a fic (can't remember have too many) where Tonks and Sirius' mom got into a screaming match. Sirius' mother would call her a blood traitor and Tonks would cal her a hag. That stunned Sirius' mother silent for a few seconds and she called Tonks something else and it went back and forth until Remus or Sirius closed the curtains. You could tell Tonks was having a blast. I was thinking the same thing along the lines of Malfoy calling Hermione a mudblood and Hermione having a verbal response back that would stun him and such. I like cosin-shagger and ink pots and such. Something that would make them think a bit but be hilarious to those around them.
