The fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] has some slurs for Purebloods. The story is set in a topsy-turvy AU in which muggleborns hold political power while the old Pureblood families are repressed. The Purebloods are called "Old-Bloods" (a politically correct term equivalent to 'muggleborn' in canon). The derogatory version is "old fusty" or just "fusty".
