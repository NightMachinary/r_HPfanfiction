isn't this story time travel too according to op? Kinda weird still, but it sounds like Harry is and adult, and Lucius thinks he's Voldemort(and therefore and adult in a child's body, which makes it weird but not as weird as it could be). Haven't read it, so don't know what age Harry's body is when the pairing happens anyway.
