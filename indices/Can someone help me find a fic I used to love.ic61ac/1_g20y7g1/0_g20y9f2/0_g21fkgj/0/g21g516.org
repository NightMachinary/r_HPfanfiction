Believe that is simply the character bracket implying that they are the main characters of that fic. I very much doubt that Harry would get with Lucius for a few reasons; A, he has watched his friends and family die over a long period of time and probably saw Lucius murder a few of them and; B, Lucius is married. Although the author might have gone a redemption arc for Lucius where Narcissa is the main reason behind Lucius committing those crimes and murders and joining the DE and Harry helps him get a divorce then they end up together.
