Definetely 'If you've a ready mind' - I know this reddit tends to hate on Draco a lot, and if he was a real living person I could see why, but I liked him in the books, then fell in love with Maya's characterization of him, and that fanfic was a great introduction to how changing a character's circumstances could change the whole story. Plus, loved how more pronounced poking fun at Harry's inability to recognize people was, and how when he tried his best to do it anyway to impress Draco, the guy got offended instead xD
