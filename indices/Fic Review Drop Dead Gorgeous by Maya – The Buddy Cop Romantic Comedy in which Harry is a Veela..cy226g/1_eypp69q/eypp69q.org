This review was great and really well reasoned. I read this story a while back, and it fell into the middle-land of fics I've read, where I enjoyed it but likely would have forgotten all about it given a bit more time. I think I will dig it out for a re-read now though, as your review was really compelling. I'm excited to see what you think about Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution. I've tried it twice and couldn't get past the first few chapters either time. Maybe it gets better?
