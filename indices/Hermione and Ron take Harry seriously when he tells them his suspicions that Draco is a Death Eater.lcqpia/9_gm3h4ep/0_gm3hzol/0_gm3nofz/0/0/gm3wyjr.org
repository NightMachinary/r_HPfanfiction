Dying I remember, but is it cannon the thing about sexual assault being part of the DE's MO? Yeah, I know that in real life there is plenty of that going around, even more so in times of war, but with polyjuice, transfiguration and that daydream candy it just seems kind of redundant in HP even discounting JKR's tendency of ignoring the existence of sex in the books (which, fair enough, it is not everyone's cup of tea and if she doesn't feel comfortable writing it than no big deal).

Edit: in fact I think the closest thing to sexual assault happening in cannon was Umbridge with the centaurs, and even that was mostly just implied from some of the myths about centaurs.
