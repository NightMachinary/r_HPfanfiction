Yeah, alright, this /is/ terrible and definitely sexual harassment. Though it probably wouldn't be recognized as such in the nineties -then again my frame of reference for this assessment is only from what was considered appropriate in movies of the period I've watch (which are mostly placed in North American) so if anyone was living or was friends with someone living in Britain at the period please correct me.
