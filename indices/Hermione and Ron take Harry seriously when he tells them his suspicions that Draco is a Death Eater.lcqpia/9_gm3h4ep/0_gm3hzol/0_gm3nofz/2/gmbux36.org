I can't think of any part of the books where Hermione actually gave people the benefit of the doubt. The examples you gave with Snape and Dumbledore are not her giving the benefit of the doubt. Hermione had an almost obsessive respect for authority figures. Supporting Kreature I believe was obvious given the fact that she created S.P.E.W.

As far as the lack of evidence Harry followed Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes a store known for selling dark products where he saw the owner look scared after Malfoy showed his arm. That is enough evidence to at least investigate. Which is what Harry wanted he wasn't asking them to go to the Aurors or Dumbledore right then.
