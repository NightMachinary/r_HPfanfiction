It's a Veil of Death/Deathly Hallows scenario. Harry was spouting conspiracy theorist bullshit, so she /overcorrected/ and absolutely refused to entertain him. It's a well-documented mistake she makes. Her almost dying in the ministry last year probably compounded the need for denial on her end.

I agree that she probably should have entertained Harry more than she actually did in the book, but it's still not as out of character as everyone is claiming as it is. There's a lot of precedent for how she acted in HBP.

Edit: Anyway, let's just agree to disagree.
