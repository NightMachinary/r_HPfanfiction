It wasn't "conspiracy bullshit theories". "Hey, you know that neighbour's kid? Who has been shouting racists slurs at people since he was elven? Who has lied to the police to get the pet of that PoC killed? Who has bullied PoC whenever he could? Who wished that PoC died when there was a killer going after them? Whose dad was arrested for trying to murder PoC? He's acting suspicious this year" is not a "conspiracy theory". It's a damning amount of evidence. Hell, if this were a criminal investigation, Draco would've spent more time at the cop's than at Hogwarts because he is so obviously among the main suspects for joining the KKK.
