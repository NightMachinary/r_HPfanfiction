Malfoy being a bigot is circumstantial evidence. Not all racists are in the KKK. Not all anti semites were part of the Nazis. Malfoy's bigotry doesn't automatically mean membership in the Death Eaters. And that's a big enough accusation to warrant actual proof - proof that Harry could not provide.

Besides the lack of proof, you are also discounting one of Hermione's greatest characteristics: her ability to give the benefit of the doubt. She is the person who kept believing that Snape was a good guy until he killed Dumbledore. She was the one who reassured Harry that Dumbledore loved him despite reading Skeeter's book. She advocated for Kreacher despite the fact that he got Sirius killed. Hermione's belief in the goodness of people is legendary.

Malfoy is a cowardly 16-year-old. He's a bully but nothing more, at least as far as Hermione was concerned. Harry was levying huge claims with no evidence to back it up, and up until said evidence turns up, Hermione will give him the benefit of the doubt. Coupled with Harry's last gut instinct getting Sirius killed, it makes perfect sense to me that she refused to follow him.
