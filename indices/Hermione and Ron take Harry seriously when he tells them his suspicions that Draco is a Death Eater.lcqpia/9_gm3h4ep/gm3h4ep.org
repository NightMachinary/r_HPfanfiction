I think the disbelief was pretty fair, especially on Hermione's end. Harry didn't have any solid evidence to back his claim except his gut, and the last time Hermione and Ron blindly followed Harry on his gut, Sirius ended up dead and both of them had to spend weeks recovering in the hospital wing. She's the type to not make the same mistake twice, and so when she asked for proof and Harry couldn't provide, it was pretty fair for her not to follow.

Ron, on the other hand, was completely out of character. Ron has never turned away from an adventure - especially not on something as dumb as lack of proof. Ron followed Harry whenever he asked because that's the kind of friend he is. Combined with the fact that it was Malfoy of all people that Harry was tracking, and Ron should have readily jumped on the mission the first time Harry asked.
