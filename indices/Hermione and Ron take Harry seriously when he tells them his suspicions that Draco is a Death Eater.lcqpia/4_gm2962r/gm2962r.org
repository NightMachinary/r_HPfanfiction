Shit really guys, after all the shite we have been through, knowing Voldemort is back and that old Lucy a death eater was AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MISTERIES WHEN SIRIUS WAS MURDERED!, You really think his brown nosing son would do everything possible to serve the dark lord. Especially if it offers the potential to do me harm?

Hermione: well Harry when you put it that way it's hard not to see there being a possibility.

Harry: Look I'm just saying let's find out what he's doing, if he's doing anything, we can prevent it, and if he's doing nothing all we did was waste some time. He's been acting odd lately, and not that Malfoy isn't a braggart but his father is a death eater, most of his close relatives are death eaters, for all we know voldemort could be holed up at malfoy manor right now.

Voldemort's non existent nose tickled and caused him to sneeze. "I don't know how, but I know Potter is involved in this..." -my lord? Said Malfoy Sr. "Silence fool, Crucio!"
