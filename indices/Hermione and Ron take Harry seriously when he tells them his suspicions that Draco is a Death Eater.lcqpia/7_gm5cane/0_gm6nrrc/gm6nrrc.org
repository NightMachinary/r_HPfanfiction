Because in all of their years at Hogwarts, they found reasons to blame Snape. So if they believed that it was Draco, their minds would jump to Snape pulling the strings while ignoring everything else. And by jumping to Snape, if they bring anything up to Dumbledore, it risks the discovery of Snape's double agent status. If they don't, they'll be forced to fight on two fronts, as they'll expect a lot of Slytherins to be allies of the Death Eaters.

Doesn't help that Rowling couldn't figure out how to continue the plot without throwing off characterizations
