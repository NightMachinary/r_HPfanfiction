Harry: I think Draco's a Death Eater

Hermione: No, there's no evidence.

Harry: Remember when he screamed blood slurs in a crowded hallway? How he hoped that he could help the heir murder people as a 12 year old?

Harry: The guy who takes pride in harassing us? The son of one of Voldemort's most favored, the one who lived in the same building as Voldemort for over a year? We are talking about the same Malfoy, right? The pointy racist one?

Hermione: Yes, that Malfoy. He's not a Death Eater.

Harry: HE'S PANICKING ABOUT NOT COMPLETING HIS TASK AND IS SPENDING TONS OF TIME WITH POLYJUICED BODYGUARDS IN A ROOM THAT CAN GIVE YOU ANYTHING? DOES ANYTHING STRIKE YOU AS ODD ABOUT THIS?

Ron and Hermione: Kumbaya...
