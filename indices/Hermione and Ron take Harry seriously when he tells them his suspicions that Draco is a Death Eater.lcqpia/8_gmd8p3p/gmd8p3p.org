One day, I'll rewrite this as prose.

--------------

/[In the Great Hall, Harry and Hermione are eating breakfast.]/

*Hermione:* /[slams down her utensils]/ Fine! I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, but the Cruciatus crosses the line. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* Um... OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practising nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

*Harry:* I guess that's as good a solution as any.

--------------

/[Late June of 1997, Hogwarts Express, after Dumbledore's funeral.]/

*Harry:* Hermione, is it just me, or have we forgotten something important?

*Hermione:* Well, it can't be that importan... bugger.

--------------

/[Spring 1998, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Ron:* I am a man of many tale... What.

*Hermione:* /[with a sigh]/ It's a long story of procrastination. Just leave him there for now.â€‹

--------------

/[Later the same day, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Harry:* Open! Open!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Ron:* Yeah, you are, mate.

*Harry:* I guess Parseltongue was from Voldemort as well...

--------------

/[Even later...]/

*Ron:* Hshsshssshss! Shshshs! Hsshhh!

*Hermione:* Come on, Ron! I know you can do it!

*Ron:* Hsssshshshshs! Hshshhhs! Shsshsh!

*Hermione:* Don't give up!

*Ron:* My hongue hurh.

*Hermione:* I guess it was a one-in-a-million fluke...

*Ron:* Why dih you even puh him ih here?

*Hermione:* Yes, Harry, why did we put him in there? We still don't know if he was even planning anything!

*Harry:* Hey, you're the one who came up with the plan! I just wanted you to help me investigate!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

*Ron:* Honh ahgue oeh him. Mahfoy ih a phat.

*Harry:* That he is, mate.

*Hermione:* Very well... That Draught /was/ exceedingly good, if I may say so myself. It should last another decade, at least. Plenty of time to find a Parselmouth.

*Harry:* Yeah, no rush.

/[Exeunt.]/
