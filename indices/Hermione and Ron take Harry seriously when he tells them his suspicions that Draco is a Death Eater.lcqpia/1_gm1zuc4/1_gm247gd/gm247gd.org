It made no sense for them to not at the very least suspect Draco of being one, considering that he hadn't exactly been all that subtle about his views on Muggleborns over the years.

For me, it was the first big indicator that Rowling was willing to trash characterization in favour of the plot; and in book 6 the plot required, for some reason, for Harry's suspicions to be ignored, despite years of behaviour on the part of Draco Malfoy indicating that he was a true believer in the Pureblood Supremacy ideology espoused by Voldemort's followers.
