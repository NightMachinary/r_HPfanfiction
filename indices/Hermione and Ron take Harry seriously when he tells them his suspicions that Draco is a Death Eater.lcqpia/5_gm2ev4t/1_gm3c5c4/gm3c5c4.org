Well... in all fairness... in the first two books Harry had no idea he was dealing with Voldemort until the final confrontation (PS: he thought he was thwarting Snape from stealing the stone, CoS: he was trying to rescue Ginny from a Basilisk) while in the last two books he knows what he's up against and knows that only Dumbledore can stand a chance against Voldemort.
