They do believe him later on when there's more evidence: Crabbe and Goyle taking Polyjuice and the House Elves seeing Draco go into the RoR. To me a lot of the skepticism, particularly Hermoine, reads like playing Devil's Advocate.

What's weird (and crying out for a fix-it) is how passive everyone, including Harry is. He tries for ninety minutes to break into the Room, gets interrupted by Tonks and then seems to forget about it. The explanation for why he can't wait for Draco to emerge or follow him about is: he might miss class!

Rather inverts the fanon trope that Dumbledore placed Harry with the Dursleys to make him more tractable. First and Second Year Harry is a devious little shit who happily lies to his teachers; Sixth and Seventh Year Harry lets Dumbledore lead him around by the nose.
