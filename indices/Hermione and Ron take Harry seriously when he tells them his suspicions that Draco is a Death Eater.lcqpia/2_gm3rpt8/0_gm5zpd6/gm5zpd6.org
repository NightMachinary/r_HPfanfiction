I know it's a bit besides the main point, but I really appreciate this Hermione's rant against Harry. I've only ever come across one fic where Harry tries to justify and rationalize the bad decisions and negligent attitude^{\}1]) on his part that led to Sirius's death, but Hermione taking Harry to task is nevertheless still cathartic to read.

^{\}1]) Not a defense of Snape's horrible treatment of Harry regarding the occlumency lessons.
