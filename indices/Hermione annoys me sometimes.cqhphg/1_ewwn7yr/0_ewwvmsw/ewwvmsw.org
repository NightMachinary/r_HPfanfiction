Sounds like Hermione deliberately annoying the authority figure to me.

Oh, wait.

  "Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf---"

  "That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger," said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all."

  Hermione went very red, put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears.

  "KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. "DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointing at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.

  Hermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, "Very well---Miss Granger?"

  "Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform," said Hermione, "which gives you a split-second advantage."

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.
