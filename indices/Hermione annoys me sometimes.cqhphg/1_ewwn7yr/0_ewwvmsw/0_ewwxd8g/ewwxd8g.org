  Snape righted himself, scowling.

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes," said Harry stiffly.

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.
