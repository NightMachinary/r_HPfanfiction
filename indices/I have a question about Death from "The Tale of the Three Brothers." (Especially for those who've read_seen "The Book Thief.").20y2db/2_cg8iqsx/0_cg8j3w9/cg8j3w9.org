Thank you for your response, but please refrain from using crude and abrasive language with me when it is not necessary to get your point across. That's just juvenile.

To my knowledge, J.K. Rowling never said whether Death is real or not in the Harry Potter universe. Just because his existence isn't confirmed doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't real.

Lack of evidence is not proof of absence.

Cheers. xx
