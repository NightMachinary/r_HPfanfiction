  After all, the Deathly Hallows are real in the Harry Potter universe...so what about Death?

The existence of "Death" as a real person, a Grim Reaper if you will, is not canon.

We know the three hallows are real and we know they were first wielded by the Peverell brothers, anything else about their origin is shit Beedle made up hundred of years later to sell a children's book.
