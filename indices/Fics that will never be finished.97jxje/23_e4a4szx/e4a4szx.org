I'm gonna throw out a couple that might be a bit controversial...\\
"Those Gilded Chains we Wear"- KuraiBites ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear]])\\
"Every Other Midnight"- Kathryn's NomDePlume ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3998455/1/Every-Other-Midnight]])\\
I know the content isn't everybody's cup of tea, hell it wasn't mine to begin with, but no matter how touchy the subject matter I can't help but appreciate the quality of the writing, story lines and character development, neither is perfect but the pros outweigh the cons by far.
