It's because the characters feel real. James isn't a creepy stalker with no interests outside thinking about Lily and talking constantly about how utterly amazing she is because she cast 'Wingardium Leviosa'. Lily was not a perfect Mary Sue 'prettiest, most talented, most intelligent, most gifted, most amazing person at Hogwarts in two hundred years to come' which you regularly get in fanfiction, her friends were actually nice to read about too. Lily is also not Hermione with red hair and green eyes. Snape is the crappy person he should actually be.

Sometimes, I forget that Donna Shacklebolt is nothing more than an OC and that no Adam McKinnon was mentioned in canon. Peter is actually a Marauder and Sirius isn't defined by being stupid and flirty, literally the only given attributes to him in a regular Jily fanfiction (one of which goes directly against what was stated in canon). I mean, it's the only fic I tolerate which has Marlene Mckinnon and Alice Longbottom being Lily's friends.

I have my issues with it because not even Lily fit in with her canon persona (for example, reforming her friendship with Snape, something I personally don't see her doing at all). But it's really well done, with a unique writing style and correct grammar as well as great OCs. It's a shame that it's abandoned but the author does have a completed fic and a funny parody of your regular Jily fanfiction.
