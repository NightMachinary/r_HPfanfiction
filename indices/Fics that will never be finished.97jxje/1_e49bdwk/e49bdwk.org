I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]], which has the premise of the Dursleys just up and leaving shortly before OotP, without telling Harry. It then follows him spending his summer in Diagon Alley, trying to convince everyone (including himself) that he's fine, really. I really think it's worth a read if you like character-focused stuff, even though it hasn't been updated in almost eight years.
