Linkffn(Give Me Wings by Enjaye) is REALLY good, but unfortunately it only has the one chapter and it was posted back in 2002, the same year when the author seemingly quit. I'd pay for someone to rewrite it, though.

Linkffn(A Song of the Old World) is similar to the above in the sense that it only has the one chapter, but it's even BETTER imo with lots of worldbuilding already. Sadly, the author disappeared from the internet, which is why it's never going to be updated again. It's on my to-do list to adapt/continue it, though.

Linkffn(4190925) hasn't been updated in several years, so I doubt it's ever going to be finished.

Linkffn(9524552) is a hilarious story that only has the one chapter. The author is kinda known for writing and dropping fics, so it's never going to be finished most likely.

And linkffn(Blood and Chocolate by Lady Lemon Drop) will probably never be finished, which is really a shame. It's quite good, but they haven't updated any of their stories in years, including this one.
