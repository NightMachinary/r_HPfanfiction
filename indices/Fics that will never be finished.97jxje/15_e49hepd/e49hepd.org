This thread is pure torture.

My contributions are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5137164/1/Double-Time-Trouble][Double Time Trouble]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7450800/1/Preventing-the-Future][Preventing the Future]]

Both are OP Hermione time travel stories. Both are angsty, feature Hermione, and may I remind you: Over Powered. So, so, deliciously easy OP. If you like your hero's to have every advantage, read these. Yeah, sometimes they get hurt, but the baddies are never really a challenge.

Double time trouble: Crackfic, Dark? Hermione (its been a while since I read it) times 3. That's right, 3 of her. All slightly different. The opening chapter should explain most everything.

TL;DR There's 3 Hermiones

Preventing the future is my favorite because, while filled with descriptions of OP magic, surroundings, and items, the descriptions and pranks pulled are unique (not your typical “they turned him pink!” hurr hurr hurr). It's set in the marauders era and Hermione heavily fraternizes with all four + Lily. She's even nice to Pettigrew.

TL;DR She's the chosen one.
