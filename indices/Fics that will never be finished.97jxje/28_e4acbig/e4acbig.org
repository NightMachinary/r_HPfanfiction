I'm going to start with linkffn(Tenebrae Vincunt) and linkffn(The Dark in Peace) both by [[/u/TE7]] partly because I know it'll annoy him but mainly because I really do want to find out what happens - especially in the latter.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Hogwarts U) has a nice idea where Hogwarts is a university rather than a school, which may just be an easy way of having lots of sex right from the get-go but could also be a really original story.

Lastly I'll include linkffn(We Found Wonderland by scarecrowing). It's not very far along but I love the idea and it was the first story I beta'd (from ch. 6) so it's always going to have a spot in my heart.

This thread has made me realise just how much utter crap there is in my alerts list. I'm definitely going to have to go through and clear it out at some point...
