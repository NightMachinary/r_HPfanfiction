I've read far too many so prepare yourself.

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by mizuni-sama)

linkffn(The Legacy by StorytellerSPW)

Out of the Night by RainingInk

linkffn(Self Reflection by Blandge) for the premise alone.

linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom)

linkffn(Death Before Dishonour) has the best characterization of Daphne as well as Harry and his friends acting like kids; terrified of the looming war.

linkffn(To Be Queen) is just flat out strange but is a different take on Harems. Weird, but unique and isn't for everyone but it is something.

Linkffn(An Unfound Door by joe6991)

linkffn(Ouroboros by Voice of the Nephilim) is a torture fic but it is psychologically thrilling. Author of The Unforgiving Minute.

linkffn(Ashes by obsessmuch) has a very interesting premise.

linkffn(The Unbreakable Vow by Ash Darklighter)

linkffn(Sighs of the Neglected Flower)

linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix makoyi)

linkffn(Only Enemies by leave this world) is solid. Love the way the Harry and Bella interact.

linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) has a very well done Tom.
