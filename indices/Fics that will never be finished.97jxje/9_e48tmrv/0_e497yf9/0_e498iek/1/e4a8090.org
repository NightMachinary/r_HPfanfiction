Yes! Harry was perfect. Voldemort, perfect! Any scene with those two in it was magic. I loved how the story porrtrayed Harry's "growth of the hero" type of thing completely naturally, how he stumbles into greatness.

Really though it's the beginning, with Snape being a monumental dick, that made me love the story haha still my fave opening to any fanfiction I've read.
