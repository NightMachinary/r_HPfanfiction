Oh boy, lemme first brace myself for possible tears.

linkffn(4080247) - A part of me dies every time I remember Lost Time is abandoned.

linkffn(Contemplating Clouds) - Hands down my favorite Harry/Luna in the fandom. Also dead.

linkffn(The Skitterleap) - There goes my fav sweeping AU. At least it does have a complete arc, with buildup and climax, I guess. /Sniff/.

linkffn(Für Das Größere Wohl) - Started reading this one, thinking that it was crack. Well, it was awesome while it lasted.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I) - At least maybe Taure will rewrite this as his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7cq26e/whats_the_fic_youd_like_to_write_but_lack_the/dprvn0b][Air Ship Alchemist fic]], yeah? Yeah, probably not, but a man can hope.

linkffn(Error of Soul) - The only H/Hr fic that gave me hope for my ex-OTP. Needless to say, that ship sank for me.

linkffn(The One He Feared) - Probably would sacrifice my left nut to see this one continued. Maybe the other nut as well to see it complete.

Now I'm sad.

*Not adding Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness or A Long Journey Home here, cuz fuck you, I'm not accepting the possibility that they're dead too.
