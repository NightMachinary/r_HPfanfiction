Not technically dead, but on hiatus since 2015 due to severe health problems: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is worth reading even though incomplete.

The author maintains a very good balance of foreknowledge vs the butterfly effect. Harry's greater experience and power comes at the cost of PTSD from watching everyone and everything he loved destroyed over a 13 year war, usually brutally and often right in front of him. His need for secrecy, meanwhile, puts distance between him and the Headmaster. And something seems to be working against his ability to make changes, restoring something like the original timeline but often darker and more violent.
