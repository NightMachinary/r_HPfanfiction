Because while the fic is mildly entertaining, you have to realize it has so many holes, inconsistencies, and doesn't seem to have had a clear direction, that I honestly can't even conceive of a finished version of this fic that makes any sense at all.

Hate to say this, but sometimes its better to leave sleeping dogs abandoned.
