My favorites:\\
Linkffn(The One He Feared): the best Harry gets someone elses memories stories, also the best Dumbledore in the fandom.

Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): one of the most original variation of the time-travel trope I have encountered.

Linkffn(Ectomancer): dang if I didn't get a kick out of all the spirit world stuff.

Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): the most canon-like Harry in Slytherin out there, and while the author says he will return, its been four years.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): the relationship between Harry and Tom is the most amiable yet enjoyable I have come across.

Linkffn(Forging the Sword): I have yet to find a fic that so captures the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione as this fic does.

Linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality): one of the better quidditch stories and one of the better H/D fics out there. Ditto for Duality.

The Alexandra Quick Series cut out after 4 books. Left a fair amount unsaid too.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): one of the oldest fics in my favorites, the fic just concluded two of its three major acts, but the world-building was such a resounding jolt to the system in comparison to all the other post-2007 fics. Highly recommend for the characters in particular.
