It's dangerous to use the Order, just because of the need for absolute secrecy. Like [[/u/Background-Chapter80]] said, most of the order was being watched (confirmed when Harry looks through Umbridge's files in the Ministry heist) and some were susceptible (Mundungus Fletcher for one).

The key to the Horcrux hunt was that under no circumstances was Voldemort to realize that 1) Someone knew that he had made horcruxes (even his inner circle don't know) and 2) that Harry is after them. The moment he realizes, it's game over. Now, he's probably going to keep some of them on his person (like he does with Nagini), and there isn't a single canon character that has the skill and power to take it away from him.

It's paramount that the jig not be given up, and it's lucky (read: plot designed) that Voldemort only realizes they're under threat when Harry has gotten all but the diadem and the snake. If the Order start helping, and Voldemort sees lots of people asking into/looking into things about him (it's a lot harder to hide 20 people doing something than just 3 people) he'll put those pieces together pretty quick
