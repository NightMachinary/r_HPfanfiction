If you haven't read Alexandra Quick yet, that's a popular world building not romance focused one. I feel like I have tried to start it a few times and need to go back to it. It's a really impressive sounding world.

Someone just left me a very generous comment about my worldbuilding this week AND my fic is not romance, so I am going to throw it in, too. It's not finished. It's a thriller. Explores the years - and the world - between the wars, along with a bunch of canon adjacent magic. If you're looking for a fic that spends a lot of time with the characters in Hogwarts classes and pranking the school left and right . . . this is not that.
