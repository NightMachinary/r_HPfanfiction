  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead - or worse - until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a certain dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a jokester metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.
