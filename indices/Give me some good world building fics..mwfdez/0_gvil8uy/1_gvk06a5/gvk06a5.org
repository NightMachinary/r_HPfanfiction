I agree with the recommendation; it expands and explains a lot of the principles around mind magic, potion brewing, the differences between light and dark magic (and between pure-blood vs muggle-born magic), and many other points. Plus a really original plot.

Your bot invocation is a little odd, though; "Rigel Black" doesn't appear in the titles anywhere, even though they're often referred to as the Rigel Black Chronicles.
