If you mean the download link, it doesn't work (since Fanficiton.net started using Cloudflare in December.) If a fic is older than that and had previously been requested on [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/]], a bot link may still work as it will be in the achieve. If it doesn't your best bet is to check manually at [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive]]. For example, Back to the Beginning brings up three fics and the last one is the one you want. Clicking on the title gives you a hover text, which lets you select either EPUB or MOBI.
