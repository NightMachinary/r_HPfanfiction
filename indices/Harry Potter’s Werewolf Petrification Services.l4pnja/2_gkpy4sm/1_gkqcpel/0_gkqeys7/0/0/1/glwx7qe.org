I think it's implied a number don't survive. I remember reading on Pottermore (I think) about a boy bitten in his youth like Remus, with a loving family who tried to help him, who ended up committing suicide because of his lycanthropy. Some families will eject them and I don't imagine they fare well on their own.

Fenrir possibly circled back and collected some of those he turned to help form his little army. Excuse me, pack.
