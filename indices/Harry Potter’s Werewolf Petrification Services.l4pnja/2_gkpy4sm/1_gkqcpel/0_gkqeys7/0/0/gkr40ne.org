We don't know how /many/ children Greyback bit. I would think that it's reasonable to assume the majority end up joining a pack though, whether it's his or another.

Werewolves are heavily discriminated against in Wizarding society for the most part, I could definitely see that over the years the children Greyback bites become bitter and jaded due to their continued rejection from society, and ultimately end up joining a pack because they feel they have no choice if they want to survive or have even a modicum of happiness.
