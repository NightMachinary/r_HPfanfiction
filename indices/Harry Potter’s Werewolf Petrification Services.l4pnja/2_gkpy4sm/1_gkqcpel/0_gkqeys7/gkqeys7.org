Yeah, why isn't a group of extremely discriminated people living in extreme porverty with no magical education (if you were bitten since young/in the middle of schooling) apperate half-way around the globe (the moon is up for most of the night and some part of the day) every month to avoid the transformation? It's not like they are heavily discriminated against in civilized society or that the most convenient method of controlling their curse is an expensive consumable and require high expertise in a given field OR that a cage and an unbreakable charm is more accessible and reliable just with the tradeoff of pain?

Why any werewolf would choose to not avoid the full moon is a mystery to me

Edit: Sorry about this whole thing, I didn't mean to go on a rant. I was tired and people handwaving away other people's problems (werewolves in this specific circumstance) just really rubbed me the wrong way

It's fun to debate here in fictional terms about the creative solutions to fictional dilemmas but if you remove the "fiction" it just kinda hit close to home. That's probably what prompted this comment. Sorry for the attitude, it wasn't warranted
