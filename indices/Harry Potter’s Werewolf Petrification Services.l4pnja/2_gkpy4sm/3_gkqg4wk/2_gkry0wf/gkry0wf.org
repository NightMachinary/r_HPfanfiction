My headcanon is that the globetrotting trick works, but it can't be overdone. Basically, I figure that the wolf is dormant most of the time, but near the full moon, it starts to slightly leak into the main persona. It can be suppressed simply enough with a bit of willpower if you know what is happening. However, suppressing the transformation like this doesn't make the wolf turn dormant as it should. As a result, over time, it forces itself upon your personality even more, and if you continue to suppress the transformation, eventually you become a case that is sort of an inverted Wolfsbane: a wolf in human shape, until you allow the transformation to occur normally. This also causes the Wolfsbane to fail until things are back to normal.
