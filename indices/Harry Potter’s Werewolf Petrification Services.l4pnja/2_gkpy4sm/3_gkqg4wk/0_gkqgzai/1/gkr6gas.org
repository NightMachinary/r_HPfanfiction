It could be like my migraines, where there's a sort of mounting "pressure" that makes delayed migraines (or delayed transformations, in a werewolf's case) more severe when they finally do happen.

Since the full moon comes out during the day, but traditional werewolf lore and fic usually doesn't have werewolves transforming till nightfall, it may be that delayed transformation = greater sensitivity, so that somebody who transforms every month will only do so at night, when the moon is bright and unobscured, while someone who keeps the transformation at bay for months will eventually transform at the top of the lunar cycle, even at noon, and that the experience will be much more severe.
