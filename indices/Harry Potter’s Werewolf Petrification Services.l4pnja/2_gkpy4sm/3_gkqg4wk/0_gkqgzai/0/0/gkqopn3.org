  What would happen if some werewolf found himself on the moon?
#+end_quote

Probably die in seconds due to the complete lack of an atmosphere on the moon.

  Or if they went to a different world with a different moon?
#+end_quote

Presuming that the planet in question has an atmosphere, and that it's of a kind capable of sustaining terrestrial life, that's a good question. It might depend on what it is about the full moon that triggers a werewolf's transformation, if there's some special magical aspect of our sun and/or moon that causes the reflected light seen during a full moon to induce said transformation, or if it's more biomagical in nature.

  Or a world with many moons?
#+end_quote

See my above responce, but with the note that multiple moons could possibly either amplify or counteract the transformation, depending on a whole slew of factors I couldn't even begin to guess at.
