It's pretty likely that the original werewolf curse was created by some dark wizard a few millenia ago trying to get a self-increasing army of mind controlled warriors. It's unlikely that an ancient dark wizard would have considered space travel when developing the curse. So there's a good chance it'd glitch out, fail or cause some weird effect. Or it might not do anything at all.
