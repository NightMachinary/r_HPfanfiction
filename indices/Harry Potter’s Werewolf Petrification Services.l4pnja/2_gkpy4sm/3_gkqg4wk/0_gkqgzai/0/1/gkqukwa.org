Depends on how it works. But we know from the source material that a werewolf will not transform if it's a full moon on the other side of the world.

Now, I could see some sort of issue where a werewolf needs the magic to 'flux' periodically or its body has issues, but not some weird magical 'you must do that or else magic will punish you' sort of thing.

That just reads similarly to a bad GM in an RPG who punishes players for not following the railroad.
