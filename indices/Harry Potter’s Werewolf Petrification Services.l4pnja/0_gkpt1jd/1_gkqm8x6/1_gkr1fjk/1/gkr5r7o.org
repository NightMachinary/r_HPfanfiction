I'd say the pregnancy is terminated, though the pregnancy may not even /start/ because, every time you take Polyjuice, you're essentially reverting to the donor's physical condition at the time that their material was taken, and conception generally takes more than a couple hours to occur.

Alternately, ignore all that and just realize that you've got a great premise for an Mpreg story.
