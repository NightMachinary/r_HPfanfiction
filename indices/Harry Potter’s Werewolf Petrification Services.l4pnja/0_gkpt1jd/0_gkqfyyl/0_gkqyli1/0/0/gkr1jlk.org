Werewolves are magically resilient and the “wolf” seems to take over the mind of the host. Since the imperious can be thrown off I'd question if the wolf could do it. Otherwise I'd have expected Voldemort to control werewolves a lot. Also, if the werewolf takes wolfbane, does it then become more susceptible to the imperious?
