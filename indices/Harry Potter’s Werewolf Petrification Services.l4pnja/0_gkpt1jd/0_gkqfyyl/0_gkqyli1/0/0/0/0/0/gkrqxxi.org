If you can find and hit then with a spell in the night, plus a single bite would have the person cursed for life, even without magic resistance there are plenty of reasons to fear them during their time of the month, even more so in cases like Remus where the surrounding people actually like him and are thus not willing to use lethal force.

Plus the thing about books having success is not just due to the stakes at risk, it is generally more about how good the author is at telling the story, especially with people so willing to compromise on the truth like Lockhart, if you know how to make a one-on-one glorified fist-fight done right it will probably be leagues above a dry-read about a battle that was decisive to end a war.
