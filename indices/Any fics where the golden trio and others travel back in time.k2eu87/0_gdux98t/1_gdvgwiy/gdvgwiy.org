I've got plenty of recs!

#+begin_quote
  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.
#+end_quote

Quite possibly one of the best time travel fics that I've ever read. Harry gets sent back to the Founders' time due to the /Priori Incantantem/ in the graveyard. He is promptly found and healed by Salazar Slytherin, who invites him to Hogwarts as one of his snakes. Eventually, they manage their way back to only a few days or weeks after the graveyard incident.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old.

  The past, naturally, rapidly goes quite off the rails.
#+end_quote

A pretty damn hysterical fic, if I do say so myself. Its updates are slow but the chapters written are worth it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8660149][Who'd Suspect a Hufflepuff?]]

#+begin_quote
  After losing the war Hermione and Harry are left as two of the last alive. In a desperate bid for their survival they travel back in time to kill Tom Riddle before he makes his first horcrux. Using cunning and intelligence learned from their time at war they work to save the world before it has even begun to fall. Lucky for them, everyone overlooks the Hufflepuffs.
#+end_quote

It's a 10k word one-shot. One of the best forties fics I've read that doesn't include Harry/Tom. It vaguely features Lordships, blood magic, and a cheerfully annoying Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1127441][Step Back in Time series]]

It's a series where an old, wizened, Master of Death Harry Potter steps through a time rip to right after the events on Halloween 1981. He basically raises himself and later gets into a relationship with snarky Potions Master Severus Snape. Harry's pretty badass in this and it rehashes some of the books, but quite vaguely since it's featured around the older Harry and not his son "Ry."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20944511/chapters/49796081][Forsaken]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry was forsaken his whole life, nothing ever stayed the same and if it did it endangered or hurt Harry in some way shape or form. This revolves in all things, and his pass with fortune ends when after he finally destroys Voldemort, a Death Eater decides to murder him. Death is unhappy with Harry being his master, but acknowledges Harry never had a chance of anything but a horrible life. Granting Harry with his full amount of power with no compulsions, Death sets him up to go to Hogwarts in 1940s where he can truly discover who he is.
#+end_quote

Features a Master of Death Harry Potter who's dropped into the 1940s during Grindelwald's reign, gay and insane side characters, the personification of Death, sadistic teenage Tom Riddle, and manipulative Dumbledore. It's pretty much a crackfic that doesn't seem to be going anywhere but I love it all the same. The author's a cool person who's letting me write my own version of the fic, so that's a plus.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144601][Grounding Magic series]]

Literally, /the best/, world-building and personification of Harry that I've seen to date. It features wizarding culture, Paganism, rituals, liberal use of wandless magic and runes, Parseltongue, and prankster Harry. I recommend reading every part of the series, even the extras, because the author's worldbuilding and characterizations are the best things in the world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4877764/chapters/11183125][Lord of Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can harry prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP
#+end_quote

Basically, Harry gets thrown back in time as a teenager where he pretends he knows nothing about the wizarding world and gets himself in Slytherin with Tom Riddle. Dumbledore's a manipulative old coot in this and Harry's got quite the grasp on magic and a shit ton of sadism built up, but I love it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]]

#+begin_quote
  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

  At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.

  (cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
#+end_quote

I can't tell you how many times I've cried myself laughing like a hyena-fox hybrid. Not necessarily time travel, but Tom and Harry eventually get reborn into their original life and they fuck around with people, mainly Dumbledore.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428/chapters/34983008][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]]

#+begin_quote
  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.

  Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move /on/ or go /back/ he does something else entirely.

  And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.

  Because that makes sense.

  (No. No it doesn't.)

  But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
#+end_quote

Er... I don't quite remember much about this fic but all I know is that its narrative is brilliant and hilarious at times.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10404927/chapters/22976058][Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light]]

#+begin_quote
  After the final battle Harry learns some unsettling truths about himself and those who he trusts the most. Forced to come to terms with the revelations, Harry decides to get even with those who've wronged him and embrace who he his by going back to when it all started.
#+end_quote

Basically, Harry puts Humpty Dumpty back together again. Or, rather, he puts his insane soulmate back together again after travelling back in time.

#+begin_quote
  How do you heal them faster? Get sent back in time and correct things. Some chars are OOC.
#+end_quote

The Golden and Silver Trio, along with George, get sent back to first-year right after the final battle. They promptly begin to save everyone and kill Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds himself making a decision to give it all up just to change what has happened. What he doeesn't realize is that he gets a chance to set it right.
#+end_quote

It's pretty damn grim and gory but a good read. There's also an unfinished sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets: First]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one.
#+end_quote

The first instalment of a three-part unfinished series. I'd recommend reading it anyway considering the fact that the third part features the best political side of Slytherin that I've ever seen. Harry systematically dominates them all and it's /beautiful/. I've cackled more than once to myself.

*I could recommend a lot more but I don't really fancy scrolling through fifty pages of my AO3 history.*
