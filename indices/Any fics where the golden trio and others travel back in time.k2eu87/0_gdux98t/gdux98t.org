Okay, so I don't know about a group of time travelers that big, but maybe [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1342282]] (Series Draco Does It All Again, it's still updating) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1733899]] Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards (Again, still updating).

If you have ur own recomendations, please let me know, I also enjoy time travel-fics. <3

Draco does it all again: Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. Step one: befriend Potter. Step two: ? Step three: save the world.

Harry potter and the ticket backards: When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.
