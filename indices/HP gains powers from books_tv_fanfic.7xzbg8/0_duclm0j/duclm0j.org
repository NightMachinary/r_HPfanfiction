"Harry reads fanfiction" probably exists in some form. I think I even read some forgettable ones, but they were basically parodies / mocking fanfic tropes, not Harry getting any sort of inspiration from them.

For Harry learning fictional magic, there's linkffn(10681251). It's honestly not my thing at all, but it sounds what you're looking for.
