If the fic is aimed at children/very YA then sure, no problem. Standards need to be lowered to the demographic. If it's attempting to simultaneously treat itself seriously with mature themes and realistic issues while simultaneously having a quarter of the population inherently evil then yes, I would have a serious issue with it.
