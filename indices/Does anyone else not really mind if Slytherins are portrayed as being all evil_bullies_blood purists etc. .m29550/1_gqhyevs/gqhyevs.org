I mean they are surely not all bullies and blood purists. Being ambitious and cunning isn't evil. But it also depends on which school years we are talking about. I'd expect more blood purists running around during the rise of Voldemort than in peacetime. And according to canon, it was /Slytherin/ that was mainly harbouring future Death Eaters. (Or already made Death Eaters. Regulus Black was marked when he was 16). I'd also expect Malfoy and his croonies to act like bullies because they are. But I'd rather not see all being evil.
