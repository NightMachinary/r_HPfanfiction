I don't really care much either but I would assume that throughout the years not all of them were like that. We mostly see them as such because the generation in the series are all children of the Death Eaters. However I do expect that most of them were, if not bigots, at least biased against Muggleborns since Slytherin didn't trust Muggleborns but I don't think that they mind half-bloods or people that are known to have some confirmed magical origin.
