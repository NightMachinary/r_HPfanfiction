The Hogwart's Houses, while a ‘fictional book's house system', are also based on Hippocrates' four temperaments theory: Sanguine - Adventurous, carefree, high risk tolerance (Gryffindor). Phlegmatic - Loyal seekers of close interpersonal relationships, empaths, mediators (Hufflepuff). Choleric - Independent, career oriented, decisive, ambitious (Slytherin). Melancholic- analytical, deep thinkers, intelligent, often introverted (Ravenclaw).

Montessori teachers often use this system to better understand their students' individual needs - an example would be some children love to share their toys, others would rather keep their special items to themselves - neither of these behaviours are ‘wrong' and it certainly doesn't mean the child who refuses to share is “bad”.

It works well for children but as we get older our personalities develop and we are influenced by our experiences and environments so of course it isn't a perfect system but there's lots of recent theories out there about the different types of personalities and you'll find most have a basis in this original theory. The Myers-Briggs personality theory is a good example that most people have heard of - I think there are 16 personalities represented in that theory.

What I find really interesting is how this often correlates with Harry Potter Stans and their /chosen/ Hogwart's houses (anyone relying on a quiz to tell them which house they belong in isn't a real fan) - I see a lot of millennials who were previously one house now identify as a mixture, things like ‘Ravenclaw' and ‘Gryffinpuff'.

I have four children and it just so happens each one correlates with a different temperament. As a Montessori teacher myself it fascinates me how they can all be so different and it's really interesting for me to watch them go through life dealing with things in completely different ways.

My point was Slytherin's shouldn't be portrayed as inherently evil villains. They aren't. The films did a disservice to the books by making the four houses represent Courage, Intelligence, Evilness and... I don't know, Stupidity? It was lazy.
