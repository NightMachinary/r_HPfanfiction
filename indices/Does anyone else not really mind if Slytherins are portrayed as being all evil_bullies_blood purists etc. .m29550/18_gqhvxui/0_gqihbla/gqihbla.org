I know I'm about to fall into the "reddit judging everyone's life based off of one post" stupidity hole, but please tell me you're just exaggerating and you don't unironically classify your children's personalities based off a fictional books house system.

Next, why you would use real children in the real world personalities, who got their houses off a quiz online as an example of how fictional people in a fictional book are not all evil kinda baffles me. Whats the logic?
