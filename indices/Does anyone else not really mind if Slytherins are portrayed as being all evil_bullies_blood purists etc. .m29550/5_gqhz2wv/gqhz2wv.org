I think it's quite realistic that a group as close as a house develops a group identity, and while not everyone is actively evil, I doubt that too many resist the social pressure to conform, and will, over the course of 7 years, adopt the bigotry prominent exponents of the house show. I actually hate it when Slytherins are whitewashed and portrayed as poor victims who, for some weird reasons, never get around to correct their image by reining in Draco and the other bigots.
