Oh, okay. In that case, we still disagree. There are many different ways a character can be "evil" (perhaps better, unlikeable or unpleasant), and there are even different ways to be a bully. Going that way isn't one dimensional.

You have to invert your perspective: Slytherin isn't just another representative sample of the population from which follows diversity, none of the Houses are. Rather, you start with the assumption of homogeneity, so it's like if you collected all bullies from you local school and put them into one room together. The result would be fascinating, I'm sure.
