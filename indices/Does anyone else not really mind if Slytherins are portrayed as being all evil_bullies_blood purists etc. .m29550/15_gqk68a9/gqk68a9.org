I think it's very realistic. I've posted this half a dozen times, but it isn't any less true for it:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and ruthlessness (euphemistically called "cunning") and self-aggrandisement (i.e., "ambition") over other things.
2. Teach them that these traits are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be racist /in his own time/, which was /a thousand years ago/.
4. Appoint heads of house who alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers (Slughorn) and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries (Snape).
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

How many people /won't/ become brutes, arrogant twits, con artists, sycophants, and/or sociopaths as a result?
