Yes. Of which Peter, for instance, should have been in Slytherin, because he showed no Gryffindor traits. Which is to say, instead of using those characters as examples of diversity, I'd flip the argument around, start from a point of homogeneity, and declare them miss-sorted Slytherins.

The fundamental issue is that the Houses *do fall* along lines which people would describe as "good" and "evil". Or in less sensational terms, it is a divide over what is morally desirable, e.g. selfishness vs. altruism. You can't get around the issue that Slytherins are, for instance, selfish or cheats /because those very traits are considered good within their House per its definition/.

In other words, the diversity that certainly exists in the population is split and grouped using a clever combination of nature and nurture (people in Slytherin may be predisposed to such character traits, and then grow up being encouraged to develop them), such that within the House, little diversity is left.

If this is not what you want (and I can agree it might get tiring at some point), you fundamentally need to remodel how Houses work. But then, that is what FF is for :)
