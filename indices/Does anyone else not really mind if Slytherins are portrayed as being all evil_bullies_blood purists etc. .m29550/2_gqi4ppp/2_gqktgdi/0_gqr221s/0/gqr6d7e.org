Well, I'm not sure which lists you mean, so I can't comment on them.

Part of this, at any rate, is a problem of show vs. tell. The prototypical Slytherins are Pansy and Draco, and Pansy's scene demanding to hand over Harry in DH is the most Slytherin moment in the series: She is attempting to save her own hide by selling out Harry.

But consider also how the Slytherin Quidditch Team plays, or Voldemort's world view of reducing everything to power or the lack of it. Pottermore appears to be a bit fluffed up, possibly to make it appear a bit more welcoming, and so is the Hat's take. But even so, it's all there: Cunning turns into knowing how to take advantage of people and situations, Ambition turns into desire for power, Resourcefulness turns into lacking any sort of limits in pursuing the goal, ...

You can run down the list, and all of those are nicer phrasings of what we see, just like the Hat's "Slytherins use any means to achieve their ends" is a nicer way of putting my "cheats".

This isn't really bashing, it's simply a description of what we see. And IMO, that is okay. I'm fine with a house full of people ranging from "screw you, I got mine" to Voldemort MK.II. As I said, it's interesting.
