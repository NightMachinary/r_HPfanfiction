The only reason I dislike it is because it has a similar logic to the very prejudice we like to hate Slytherins for. Why should every eleven-year-old kid who sorts to Slytherin be presumed to be evil? Doesn't that follow the same type of black and white thinking that we condemn bigots for? I would prefer to see them portrayed as a realistic group of people. That means that they are diverse. Any time we infer a list of standard traits from one feature, we're treading a dangerous line. Slytherins should be no more homogenous than Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw. After all, those houses gave us the juxtapositions of Peter and Hermione, Cedric and Zacharias, and Luna and Gilderoy Lockhart. Of course, writers should write what they want, but I worry when we let ourselves fall into patterns of stereotypical thinking.

I'll step down from my soapbox now.
