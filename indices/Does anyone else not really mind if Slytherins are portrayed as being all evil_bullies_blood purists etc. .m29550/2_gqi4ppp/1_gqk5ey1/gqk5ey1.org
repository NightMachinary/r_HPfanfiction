Slytherins are known for hating people for the circumstances of their birth.

Anti-Slytherin prejudice is literally about the content of their character.

As for why an 11-year-old kid would be presumed to be evil? Well, "evil" is a strong word, but we at least know that the kid is more prone to deceitfulness (a.k.a. "cunning") and selfishness (a.k.a. "ambition") than average. (Of course, then, their house will bring out the worst in them, and they /will/ end up evil with a few exceptions.)
