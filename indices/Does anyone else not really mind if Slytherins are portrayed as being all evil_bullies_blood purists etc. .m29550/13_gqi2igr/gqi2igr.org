I think that the key trait for Slytherin is that they desire and value power. It is more realistic to me that 11 year olds would interpret power is being bullies and that's why they get sorted there.

The Slytherins that we know mostly get in because they have been taught that the power they have as purebloods is the most important thing. Whether they are any good at wielding that power is up for interpretation.

It is very rare for someone like Tom to exist to begin with much less be an 11 year old with so much ambition and cunning. It wouldn't make sense for a full quarter of wizards to compare to him.
