Slytherin House during Voldemort's time was absolutely dominated by blood purists, but that was likely the result of the Sorting Hat dumping every blood purist there, even though their personality was not suited at all. For example Crabbe and Goyle had none of the ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness a true Slytherin needs. From the Books, it seems that Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode also barely qualify.
