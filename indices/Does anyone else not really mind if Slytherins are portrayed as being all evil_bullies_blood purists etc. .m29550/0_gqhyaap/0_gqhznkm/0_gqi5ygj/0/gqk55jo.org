  Well cruelty and disregard for human life doesn't really equal cunningness and ambition.

Disregard for human life in pursuit of own advancement is just an extreme of Slytherin-style ambition. (Disregard for human life in pursuit of the greater good is the analogous moral failing for a Gryffindor.)

Cruelty is exercise of power to cause unnecessary suffering. Someone personally ambitious---who seeks power over others---may well be gratified by such an exercise of power.
