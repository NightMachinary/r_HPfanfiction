I'm not sure about Hermione and Neville but I think Crabbe and Goyle only ended up attaching themselves to certain people and betraying at certain times because of other reasons rather than actual calculations and cunningness. At this point I'm not that sure of anything regarding these characters though because I don't remember specific things from the series very well anymore. I still believe the blood purist sorting situation makes sense though.
