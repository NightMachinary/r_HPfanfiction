Well, I think it's less about ability than about values. Hermione was the perfect Ravenclaw, but she wanted to change the world (whether the world wanted it or not), so she went to Gryffindor. Neville wasn't brave, but he wanted to be, and so he went as well.

I can't psychoanalyse Crabbe and Goyle nearly as well, but consider that for all their lack of intelligence, they knew exactly to whom to attach themselves to make the best of their situation, and also when to stab him in the back when he faltered.
