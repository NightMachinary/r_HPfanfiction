Well cruelty and disregard for human life doesn't really equal cunningness and ambition. I think that it makes sense the stereotypes were perpetuated by the hat just putting the blood purists in slytherin because the students are allowed to ask what house they want to go to and im assuming that many of the blood purist families are like the Malfoys, they see all houses other than slytherin as inferior, so the kids of those families would ask to be sorted into slytherin.
