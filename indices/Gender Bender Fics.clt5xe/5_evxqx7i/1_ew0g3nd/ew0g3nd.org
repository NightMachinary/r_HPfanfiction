I am really confused about “To Reach Without”: first of all, I am not into slash (and even less femslash), so I gave up on reading it after some time, but what I read had a lot of potential (ignoring unnecessary high-level of angst from the change itself): AU story with a well-developed indepent plot, Susan Bones written as a real character (not just reflection of her aunt), but still within just the reasonable distance from canon.
