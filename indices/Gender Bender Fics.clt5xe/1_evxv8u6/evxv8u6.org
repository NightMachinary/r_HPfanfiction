So, judging by how you worded the request I'm taking it that you're NOT looking for fem!Harry who was born a girl and identifies as a girl throughout... otherwise I would have gone for some shameless self-promotion and mentioned my fic, Holly Potter and the Witching World.

Fics where the change happens during the story, though... the one that first comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10073299/6/Harry-Potter-And-The-Unexpected-Second-Life][Harry Potter And The Unexpected Second Life]], where there's an assassination attempt on Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts, using a potion known as "the Widowmaker" because it's lethal to males by not females...and so, to save their lives they have to spend some time as girls while the potion is in their systems. Unlike most "becoming female" fics, there's a big emphasis on secrecy, with cover stories invented as to where Harry and Ron went and who these two new girls are.

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11395728/1/The-Many-Faces-of-Har-er-Adira-Potter][The Many Faces of Har---er, Adira Potter]]... okay, I'm not SURE you'd count this one. Harry has multiple personalities, some of which are female, and since there's magic and all, his body turns female when a female personality is in charge... and the "main" Harry eventually comes out as trans and takes the name "Adira"... I did think it was a pretty good story.

Oh, and there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11396276/1/The-Chosen-One-Has-Knockers][The Chosen One Has Knockers]], which is a lot more traditional in that Harry just gets cursed to becoming a girl in an AU sixth year. It pretty quickly turns into cracky lesbian smut, but it's kind of fun and refreshingly lacking in angst.
