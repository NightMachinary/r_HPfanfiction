Mentor Snape: linkffn(The Best Revenge; To Shape and Change)

I'd advise you not to use the / symbol to connect their names as it means a romantic and/or sexual pairing (it's even where the term "slash" comes from). Maybe just say "Harry and Snape" (on AO3 they even use the & between character names to denote platonic relationships).
