Yeah but it's not really the Bellatrix we know if she's still only 11 years old. She's missing like 75% of her memories, experience, and personality. She's basically a blank slate like any OC character.

Meanwhile, transporting her to the future causes a huge pain in the ass trying to rewrite history without fundamentally changing things.

In my mind you're better off creating a new Bella-like character to replace the one in your story, and the timelines line up reasonably well for something like a Bella's daughter.

Don't get me wrong, you could make it work with Bella coming forward in time. It is just going to seem insanely contrived... which it is... but that might be fine.
