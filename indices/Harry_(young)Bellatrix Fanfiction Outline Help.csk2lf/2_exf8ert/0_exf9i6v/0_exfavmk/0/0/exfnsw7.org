Some more considerations:

- The Ministry under Barty Crouch should be more effective against Death Eaters, but also more tyrannical. I can't imagine him and Dumbledore having a good relationship. At least Fudge was listening to Dumbledore at beginning.
- Barty Jr, without being led by a fanatic Bellatrix, might be a lot more subtle and could become a dangerous deep spy at his other's side after Voldemort's fall in 1981.
- Lucius Malfoy would have far less influence at Crouch's Ministry than in canon. In fact, Barty Jr would hate his guts for betraying Voldemort. There is a good chance a Crouch dominated Ministry searched Malfoy Manor competently and send Lucius to Azkaban. The Diary could end up either in Barty Jr's hand or at DoM. Under this scenario, Draco would not be that arrogant, entitled, and spoilt brat. Narcissa, seeking refuge, might reconcile with Andromeda. Draco and Dora could become pseudo siblings then.
- A 11 years old Bellatrix reappearing would definitely seek out her two sisters for help, and she would certainly get it.
- Longbottoms should have significant influence in the Ministry. Neville should be a lot more confident and entitled. He would be the Gryffindor golden boy, and might be jealous of Harry splitting his fame.
- Would a powerful and influential Barty Crouch tolerate Dumbledore's sole control of Harry Potter? Would Longbottoms have a say in Harry's upbringing, as so many other fanfics allude to? You need to make a decision here.
