Well, then you have to completely redevelop the whole Longbottoms/Lestranges story arc.

More plot implications:

- The location of Hufflepuff's Cup
- Neville's personality if he's raised by his own parents
- The balance of power between the two sides if the Longbottoms weren't incapacitated
- Barty Jr's fate if he didn't go after the Longbottoms
- Barty Crouch Sr would be Minister if his son was not outed as a Death Eater
- Bellatrix's reactions to Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks

See, you have a complete AU to deal with here. If you still try to rehash canon, your fic will utterly break my suspension of disbelief.
