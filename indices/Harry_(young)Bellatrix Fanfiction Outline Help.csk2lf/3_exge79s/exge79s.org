Wow I am really under prepared for this story. Before I give you an answer on Harry's relation to the longbottoms, could you explain why you believe they might gain custody or have positions in the ministry? As for Dumbledore, while I do believe Crouch would want more control over Harry he wouldn't get it as Dumbledore would probably inform him about the protection charm Lily's sister keeps active to stop Crouch from adopting Harry or something. And since Harry has little reason to be in the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts (and firing Dumbledore seemingly out of no where would hurt his reputation) Filch can't get to Harry in the school year either.

I really appreciate all the help you're giving, ig your not too busy I'd love it if you could help me write a new outline! When I get to writing the story I would be sure to credit you for sll of your help and link it so you can read it too!
