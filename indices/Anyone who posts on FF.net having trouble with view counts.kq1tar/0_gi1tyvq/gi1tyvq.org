I tended not to worry much about things like that, but when FFN began splitting up stories to insert ads (Why? they have vertical banner-space down each side!), I migrated all my stories across to AO3. The view count is far less (for now) but the ability to reply to individual reviews can be useful.

Much as I hate to say it, FFN does seem to be sliding downhill in terms of support.
