Hm... I mean, a chapter should be as long as it needs to be to cover what the author wants to tell. I usually don't like overly long chapters because, in my experience, they often lack structure and the author ends up including many unimportant scenes or overexplaining things. It is often a sign that the author can't distinguish between important and unimportant details/scenes. That said, there are also authors who do a good job of it and keep their readers interested. Basically, it comes down to how well written your story is. If you think the opening chapter needs to be 12k long, then that's the way it is. If it is a good story, I doubt readers would jump ship because of it.
