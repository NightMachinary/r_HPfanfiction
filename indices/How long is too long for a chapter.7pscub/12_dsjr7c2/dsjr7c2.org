It depends. The first chapter should be longer to help catch readers interest, 4.5-8k words. After that, I would aim for 3500-6500 words. This is because you want chapters to be easily digestable for a reader, but at the same time long enough that they feel satisfying. A 10k long chapter might be great for someone already invested in the story, but keep in mind it's really hard to stop in the middle of a chapter due to the medium. If it's too hard to pick your story back up after a break, people are likely just to drop it.
