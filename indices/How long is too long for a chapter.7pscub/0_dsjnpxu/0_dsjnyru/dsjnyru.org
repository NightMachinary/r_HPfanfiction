Alright thank you.

I find it different now, you see I used to start a fic with just an idea or inspiration and write my chapters at the spur of the moment with no planning to it whatsoever.

But I haven't written a fanfic in over a decade, so I really pplanned this one out (It covers books 3-7). And I find now that it's planned and I have certain parts I want in said chapter in bulletin points they are much longer. Like before when I was writing i'd write 3-5k words, now they are all over 10k with it planned.

I was just worried so thanks!
