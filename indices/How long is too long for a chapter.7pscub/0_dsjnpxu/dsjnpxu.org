I think people prefer longer chapters over short ones. Don't worry about it. 4 out of 11 of my chapters are about 20k words long and I haven't got any complaints. The opposite, in fact. Apparently longer chapters help immersion.

Which makes sense for fanfiction. In a normal book, you have the entire book in your hands so of course you can get immersed in it. But a fanfiction that's just updated with 3k words? Eh. I'll read that while I'm taking a shit.

I'm Still Here has chapters that are 40k words long. Those I found a bit too long, as I sometimes lost my place and scrolling through 40k words was a pain in the ass, especially if I wanted to get to the very bottom for whatever reason.
