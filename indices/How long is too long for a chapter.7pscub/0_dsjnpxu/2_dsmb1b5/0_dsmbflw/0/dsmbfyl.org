[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/][*/Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8816781/Autumn-Souls][/Autumn Souls/]]

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.
