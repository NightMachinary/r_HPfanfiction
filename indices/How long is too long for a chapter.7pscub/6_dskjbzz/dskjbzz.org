My rule for chapters is advance main plot incrementally, complete tertiary c subplot(an incident that is introduced and resolved in that chapter), and intro/advance/complete b plot(a multi-chapter subplot)[e.g., harry has top cow's darkness ability. Incremental advance, he practices a spell. B plot, he studies leather types for an auror satchel, c plot, he introduces Bingo to the school]. If i can do all that in 3000 words, fine. If it takes me 150,000 words, that's okay too.

But, take in account the other chapters you've written. Try to be consistent in size. Take in account how much you're writing about. Is this chapter too much plot-wise or word count? Can it be changed to multiple chapters without issue?
