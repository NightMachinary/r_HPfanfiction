I tend to look for the overall lengh of the fic but I prefer shorter chapters (3k to 5k is my ideal). In my experience, long chapters are usual in fics that drag a lot (explains in detail every minute of the main character live or tells the exact same event from two different perspectives without being neccesary).

Actually, if the fic is on-going and it only has one or two chapters and I see that are 10k long, I tend to pass on the fic. Why? No really sure...
