I've got a few chapters that have gone over 10k words. I think as long as you're keeping the action focused and not trying to cover too much for the sake of word count, it should be fine. I find that with the serial nature of fan fiction (posting chapters as they're completed), that longer chapters tend to be more satisfying to readers--they feel adequately rewarded for the wait. I know some fics I've followed have updated with like a 4k word chapter and I'm like, "Is that all??"
