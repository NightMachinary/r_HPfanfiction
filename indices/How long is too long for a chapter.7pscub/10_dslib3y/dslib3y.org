Personally I'll say this: Too long chapters can be a pain to scroll through, in case you stopped reading and then wanted to find the place where you were, so with multi-chapter stories it's better not to go overboard (do try to aim for 10k words per chapter or less, as that is the equivalent of 20--30 pages depending on the print). With one-shots, however, people generally go into them all at once, so going above 10k words is perfectly fine ... for as long as you don't go to really high values where it's obviously that the story should have been split into chapters, like that one above 100k story I saw one time that was all in one chapter and did not play nice with the browser because seriously.
