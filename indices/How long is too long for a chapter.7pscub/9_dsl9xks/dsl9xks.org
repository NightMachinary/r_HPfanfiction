I like chapters around 20K words. Chapters that are longer make the fic feel like it is dragging. Shorter chapters break the story up too much and cause a distraction. One of the criteria I look at before I read a story is the size of the chapters. I've found that fics with shorter chapters are more prone to be bad fics. So if i see a fic that has 60K words and 30 chapters i'm not going to read it. That's just me though, others might like the shorter chapters.
