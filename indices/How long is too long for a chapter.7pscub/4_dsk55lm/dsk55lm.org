Anything over 10k is pushing it, especially if you're using scene breaks. Reading fatigue is a thing, and there's is a psychological difference between reading 2 5k chapters or 1 10k chapter, even though the only difference is presentation. Also keep in mind that canon chapter lengths are for the most part under 5k, except for book 5 which average like 6.5k for some reason
