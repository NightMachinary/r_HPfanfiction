[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13224282][Powerful Magical Artifact]] by Kathryn518/Plums. Gen. Only one brilliant chapter, but I wish there was more.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1823242][A Nick in Time]] and sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1823704][Growing Pains]] by Tira Nog. Snape/Harry friendship (both de-aged) in the first one, romance in the second. Ron and Hermione act as foster parents while they're de-aged.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/627632][A Change in Perspective]] by Roozette. Drarry. De-aged Harry is unsure about Ron at first because of his brashness.

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1663][Finding a Family and a Home]] by Hestia. Also on FFN as separate stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4360923][Finding a Family]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4486541][Finding a Home]]. Gen, mentor!Snape. In this one, Ron even injures Snape and threatens to do worse, to protect Harry from what he thinks is physical abuse.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7876387][Death Eater Takes a Holiday]] by Lee Lee Potter. Snarry, and a long one at that.
