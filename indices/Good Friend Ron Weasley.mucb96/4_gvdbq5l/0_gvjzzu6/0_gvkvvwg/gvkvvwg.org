There are a few that I have saved, but that one's really the best. I liked these:

- A Change in Perspective by Roozette. Mentor Snape, H/D linkao3(627632)
- Kid by EvansEntranced. Gen. linkffn(6218557)
- Six, Revisited by Warviben. Mentor Snape. linkffn(8707789)
- Redefining Life series by Oliver Snape: The Definition of Home, The Definition of Family, and The Photo Album. Mentor Snape. linkffn(5878880; 6030400; 6273177). Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][on AO3]].

If you don't mind Snarry, there's one I enjoyed that's a de-aged Snape for a change: [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2715][The Living Years]] by Dementor Delta. This is the Walking the Plank link because it's members-only on AO3.
