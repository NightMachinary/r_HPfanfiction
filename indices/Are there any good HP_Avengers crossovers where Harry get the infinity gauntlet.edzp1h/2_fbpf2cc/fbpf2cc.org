I know a fic that was written in 2012 I think so before the most recent movies came out but Harry deals with the Infinity Stones and Thanos. It's a slashfic but I could link it if you are interested. It's one of my fav Avengers/Harry crossovers and really well written with a unique storyline and Harry is pretty badass.
