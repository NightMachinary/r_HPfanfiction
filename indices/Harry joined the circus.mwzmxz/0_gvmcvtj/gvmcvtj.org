I'm kind of confused. Everyone is saying it's complete but it shows only 5/83 chapters. The author also says in their note that it's complete, but there are 83 chapters so it'll take a while to upload them all. Is there somewhere to actually get all 83 chapters or did the author somehow wrap it up in 5 chapters?

It sounds like an awesome story idea, but it hurts my heart when I get pulled into an abandoned story. I don't want to get into this only to be sad about it later. ðŸ˜… So, is it complete or is it just complete in theory but not uploaded?
