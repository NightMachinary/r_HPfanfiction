It is an older story that used to be called “Gypsy Caravan.” The author renamed it and reuploaded it. For some reason it's in 5 chapters now instead of 83 individual ones on AO3, but if you look at the chapter titles, you'll see that the first AO3 chapter contains chapters 1-20 (or something like that), the second contains 20-40, etc etc. So all 83 of them are there, in the five AO3 “chapters.” I haven't read it since it was revised and reuploaded, because I saved the old version and read that instead, but I assume this strange structure has something to do with the revision.
