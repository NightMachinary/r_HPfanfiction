edit2: Not as good as I remember it and with some grammatical errors, but still the best one in that category I've ever found.

edit: I believe this is it, [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10792840/1][Mirror by theresnomeaning]]. It was removed from ffnet, scrolled through first chapter and I'm 90% sure that's it.

Uh, you made me remember this pretty good fic (at least story-wise) where both Lily and James were Death Eaters, some Unbreakable Vow with Voldemort was involved. Some stuff I remember: BWL Neville, James and Lily in Azkaban, Lily breaking out when Harry went to Hogwarts, Harry raised in orphanage. Seems bad on paper, but it was well thought-out and put together and made for pretty interesting (though unfinished) read.

Now I really, really want to reread it, pretty sure it was linked on this sub at least once in the past. Off searching I go.
