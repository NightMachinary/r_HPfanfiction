By 2010, most of the people who grew up on Harry Potter were old enough to write well. In 2007, many of these people were angsty teens, which characterizes much of the fanfiction written during that time.

The difference you've noticed between 2010 versus 2014 is probably due to the fact that there are fewer people writing and thus fewer good fics. After you've already made up your mind confirmation bias takes over. The overall quality probably hasn't changed much or even increased since 2013.

Examples, three of the highest quality fics ever written were published after 2014: Linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin; Grow Young with me by Taliesin19; The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)
