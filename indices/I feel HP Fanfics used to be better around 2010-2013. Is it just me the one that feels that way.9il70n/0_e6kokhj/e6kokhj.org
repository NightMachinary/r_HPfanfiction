I have been reading HP fanfiction for about 15 years now and I think that itself is the main problem. For me as well as for others. I have read it all and if there is another fic that did this or that a little better I probably have read it as well. I am overly critical, because I have found and read exactly what I like, but cannot seem to quit. Most of the ideas bore me nowadays, simply because I have read another better fic with them before and the truly unique ideas out there usually stay in a oneshot or never make it past the prompt.

I do not think the authors became worse, I just became more whiney.
