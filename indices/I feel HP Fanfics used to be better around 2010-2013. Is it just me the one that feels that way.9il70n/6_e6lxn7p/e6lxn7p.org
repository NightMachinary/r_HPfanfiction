I can compare this view to how I think most anime series produced from 2006-2010 were the best ever in history. Right now though, I can't stand watching just any anime anymore. The story has to be either unique or really well-written (as in no glaring plotholes) for me to get into them. It could just be fatigue from seeing stories get rehashed through time.

Of course, younger anime fans will scoff at my view and say the newer series are better. Older fans will of course say the older ones were better.

Anyway all I want to say is that age and life experiences plays a role, in the appreciation of a story, whether anime or fanfic.
