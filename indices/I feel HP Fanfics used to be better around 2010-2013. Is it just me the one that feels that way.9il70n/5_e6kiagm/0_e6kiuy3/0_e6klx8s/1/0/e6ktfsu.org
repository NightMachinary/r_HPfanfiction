You can bet on that. For example, Summer of Change is one of the most iconic Harry/Tonks stories. And while it definitely influenced my own writing, I never got through the whole thing because its concepts have been done to death by now (OP Harry, Training montages). You can cut 100k words from the story and end up improving its writing quality.
