I'd like to add that back then, I, for one, wasn't even aware of fanfiction, let alone writing it (okay, well I might have started reading it towards the end of that period), whereas now, you've got so many teens and pre-teens being all angsty and romantic, writing terrible porn and pumping out bad, horrible terrible ideas by the dozen. This all means that there's an overwhelming number of poor works, which makes it rather hard to find the good eggs. This was longer than I meant it to be.
