I been in the Harry Potter fandom since the very beginning but I only started reading fics in 2007. I don't know if it is nostalgia, maybe. I feel like in the earlier days fics were not very well written, then they improved and now while the qualitity is good the characterization is off. As if it is a very good story, but not a Harry Potter one. As in people had forgotten what is canon. IDK how to explain it.

Edit: I don't mean like canon couples, since we can ship whatever we want and fanfiction is a place where we can explore AUs, What if and so on. I mean like characters tend to be OoC now.
