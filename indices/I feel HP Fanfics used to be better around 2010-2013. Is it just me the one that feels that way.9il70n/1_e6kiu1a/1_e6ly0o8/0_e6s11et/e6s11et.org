I've noticed too that my judgement of the authors abilities changed a lot. There were a lot of grammar and spelling issues, not to mention plot holes and characterization problems, in some of my favorites that I read ages ago and didn't notice or care. When I re read them, it was like “why did I read this in the first place?” Definitely as I've grown as a writer myself, it's become hard to read some of the stuff I used to like.
