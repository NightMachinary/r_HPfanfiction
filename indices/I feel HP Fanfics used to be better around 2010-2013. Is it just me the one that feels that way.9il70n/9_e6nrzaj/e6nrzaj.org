I personally don't think it's better I think it was a compounding of a few factora

More Fanfiction coming out at the same time, when there were dozens of fics being updated a day it was simple to find new stories to read and lose yourself in. I started reading in like 2010, it seemed like every few months there was a new epic that stuck with me, now I'm waiting months on end to find the 'next one'

Less fear of building off each other, many stories of the time use the same ideas and game plans on basic ideas aka Azkaban Harry stories. But many did radically different things which lead to more writers joining on and making new threat Ideas and on and on til the idea became stale but writers weren't afraid to go 'that's cool this is how I would do it'

As I've become older I'm done with much of the slice of life, fluff and now I want high octane action fics. As our horizons become for focused the more we can see what is quality and what isn't
