I started reading fanfiction probably around 2008/9 when I was in middle school (and boy were some of my reading choices strange). I'd have to agree that the best fiction was written then. It took me a while to get to the really good, more serious fics, but because I'd read so many stupid ones I appreciated it more. I have read some good ones that are recent, but the truly legendary ones were all written between 2010 and 2013. The vast majority that I re-read and would recommend are all from that time period.
