No, I like fics that are finished after 2015 way better, for example [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(10677106;11858167).

As the fandom gets older, it should be expected that writers themselves improve.
