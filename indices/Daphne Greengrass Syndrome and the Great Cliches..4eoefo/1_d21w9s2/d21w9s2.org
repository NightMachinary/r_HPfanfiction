- Weasley bashing

- Canon events must happen regardless of changes in characters and other circumstances

- Voldemort always gets resurrected in the graveyard

- Wormtail always stuns Harry, regardless how powerful or smart he gets

- Heroes who defeated Voldemort willingly subject themselves to a marriage law

- Next-gen time travel cliche: broken time turner -> surprise meeting -> lots of laughs and tears -> some pranks with marauders -> adult version arrives -> obliviates people in the past -> return home
