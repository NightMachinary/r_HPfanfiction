Seeing as all the common cliches have been stated, I'm gonna go for one that doesn't get complained about enough. When a fic pairs off most of the characters, a lot of the time, assuming Ron doesn't get paired with Hermione, he'll instead get paired off with Lavender.

Of all the fucking characters to pair Ron off with, you pick the character that he already tried out and couldn't stand a moment with after a week. Literally any other character would be a better choice and you go with her. I don't see anyone shipping Hermione with Cormac, it's like another piece of hypocrisy from the HP Fanfiction community.
