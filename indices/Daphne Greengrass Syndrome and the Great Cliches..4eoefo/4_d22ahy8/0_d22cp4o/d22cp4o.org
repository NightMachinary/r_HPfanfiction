Oh my god, the "boys are afraid of the girls, no matter how strong the boys are" trope is so terrible. And it's directly lifted from anime. I can't stand seeing Harry quivering in fear of upsetting Hermione just because she'll hex him or something, and the same for the Marauders and Lily. I know it's supposed to be funny, but it's not. It just makes the characters look pathetic anywhere outside of Chinese cartoons. And it inadvertently paints the girls as dumb bullies who can't stand hearing an opinion they don't like without resorting to violence.
