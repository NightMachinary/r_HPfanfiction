cliche questions asking about cliche tropes?

The trope I most hate is the Extremely Evil Character. Could be Dumbledore, could be Molly, could be Snape. Doesn't matter, it's still an indication of laziness or utterly horrible characterization. I despise reading about a complete caricature of a character when I have better things I could be doing.
