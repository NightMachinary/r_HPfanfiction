Honestly, I feel that Daphne Greengrass is used as a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn][OCStandIn]] far more than an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar][AuthorAvatar]] and to be fair, she really doesn't have much (or any really) characterization in canon so its not like people can just use a canon personality.
