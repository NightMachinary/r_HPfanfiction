I want to say that the movies are responsible for this, because it's literally written in black-and-whte that Harry is plenty independent. He talks back to pretty much everyone who wants a go, and he's up for a fight even when he's outclassed (which, in terms of sheer number, actually isn't often at all). All of this hand-holding rubbish - especially in H/Hr Abused!"Indy!"Harry fics - has been done to death.
