- Harry suddenly decides to be a super-genius.
- Ridiculously evil/incompetent characters. If they were so obviously evil/prone to failure, SOMEONE would have noticed by now!
- Bashing of any kind. (Usually involves the above.)
- Anything that even HINTS of self-insertion. I'm definitely way over-sensitized to this to the point where OCs in general will get the stink-eye.
- Mpreg. I'm not particularly interested in reading m/m fanfics anyway, but mpreg is just... too much. It expects way more willing suspension of disbelief than I'm willing to give.

There's plenty more, but these are the most irritating ones I can think of. Finding Scryer ([[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]) has helped me avoid some of these, but not all of them.
