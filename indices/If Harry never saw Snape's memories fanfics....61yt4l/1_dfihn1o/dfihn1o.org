Adding on to this request, I read a story at some point where Harry never found out via Snape's memories the work that he did spying for Dumbledore. He killed Snape in cold blood due to his percieved betrayal, and only Harry's significant other (I believe it was Daphne Greengrass) found out about this. She then buried this information as finding it out would destroy Harry.

Anybody else remember this?
