There's a lot of discussion over the premise of the story, my question is where do you want to end up? Do you have an ending in mind? What is the time period you want to cover in your story? A lot of stories I've read have very strong starts but fizzle out as the story continues because the author doesn't have any idea of what their ending is. Another advantage to knowing your ending at the start is that you can build up to it over the course of the whole story, rather than having to make something up on the fly at the end.
