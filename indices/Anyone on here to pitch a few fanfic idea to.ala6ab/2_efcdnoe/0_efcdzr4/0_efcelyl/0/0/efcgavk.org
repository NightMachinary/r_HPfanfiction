But that sounds more like side plots than the actual story. You have the sauce, but you need some meat to it because character centric stories with 11 year olds are doomed to either disregard their age and therefore fail their objective or be very simple and therefore rather boring.

If you want to use the canon plot, you have to think about what changes and what not. This will be the core of your story. This needs to be fleshed out.
