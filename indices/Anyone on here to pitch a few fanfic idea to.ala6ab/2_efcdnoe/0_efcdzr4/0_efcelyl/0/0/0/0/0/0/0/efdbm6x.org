I wasn't asking for slice-of-life of 11-year-old-Harry at Hogwarts. I was asking for slice-of-life of 11-year-old-God-Harry at Hogwarts. OP, funny, fluffy slice-of-life can be immensely fun; stories like /Core Threads/ and /Fantastic Elves/ are at their strongest when Harry is just being wholesomely, preposterously wonderful without villains and plot contrivances to bog him down, and that's the sort of spirit I'd like to see here.

I dunno. Sometimes I like to read about delightful wish-fulfillment characters being delightful. (I think this shows very clearly in my story.) I would, for example, like the /Fantastic Beasts/ films much more if they just consisted of Newt traveling the world and finding his creatures and being awkwardly friendly with his pal Jacob, without any flashy warry Grindelwald stuff.

Not everyone has that affinity, it's a matter of tastes. But that's how I feel about it.
