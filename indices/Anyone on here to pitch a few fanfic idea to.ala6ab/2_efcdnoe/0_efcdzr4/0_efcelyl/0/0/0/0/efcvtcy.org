Slice of Life with a completely overpowered protagonist? I mean, I write in that genre and it just seems odd to have an extremely gimmicky character, give him a special, unique tool and then go on and write about friendships and the like. And 11-year-olds in slice of life is bound to be rather boring. I mean, have you recently listened to some kids in that age, what they talk about and so on (eg by having the misfortune of being in a bus when school is out)? That is not the level of dialogue you would be interested in. Unless of course, you consider "Your mom is a fat whore!" the pinnacle of humour.
