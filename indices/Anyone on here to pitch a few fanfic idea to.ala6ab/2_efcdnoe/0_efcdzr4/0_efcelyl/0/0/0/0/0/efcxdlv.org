It's a given that /Harry Potter/ fanfictions /don't/ sound like 11-year-olds. Heck, the /canon/ 11-year-olds don't sound like 11-year-olds. It's part of the genre, rather like how Mickey Mouse isn't mouse-shaped and mouse-brained so that some interesting stories can be told with him as the protagonist.
