/Core Threads/ also used a pretty dark first chapter to set up what is otherwise one of the most brilliantly angst-free stories I've ever come across. It's far from unheard of.

Heck, Roald Dahl made a dang /career/ out of introducing his child protagonists in terrible circumstances and then having the rest of the book be fun and whimsical.
