Alright my first idea which i plan on calling Obscure Magiks is a story where Harry becomes super in touch with the magical world after almost becoming an obscurial while be8ng abused as a kid. This leads to him being unsurpassed as a wandless magician being near telekenetic from a young age. A few scenes i have planned is when he walks into Ollivanders to buy his first wand when it gets handed to him sparks come shooting out of the end but not because it chose him but because he shorted out the core. So Ollivander has to go to a very ancient part of the store to get a staff which is what Harry ends up using.
