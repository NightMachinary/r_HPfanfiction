  He wouldn't look Harry in the eye because he was worried about possession

Well, yeah? Possession which would lead to Harry attacking Dumbledore. Harry nearly does attack Dumbledore. Dumbledore's fear was that Voldemort would use Harry to spy on Dumbledore and to attack Dumbledore in hopes that Dumbledore would kill Harry.

No he didn't. It stopped being a concern after the possession, because then Voldemort wanted nothing to do with Harry's mind.

Either way, Dumbledore would not teach Harry anything personally.
