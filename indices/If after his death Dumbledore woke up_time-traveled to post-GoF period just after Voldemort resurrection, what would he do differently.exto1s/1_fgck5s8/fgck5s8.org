Destroy the ring and locket quickly. Avoid Harry. Let things play out. Have Arthur or whoever kill the snake when it comes in December. Make sure he isn't ousted from the school. Find the rest of the horcruxes.

When Harry tries to go after Sirius, maybe polyjuice into Harry and have his Order polyjuice into Harry's friends. Bring Harry along but leave him under his invisibility cloak until the right moment.

Death Eaters get completely obliterated, let Voldemort come. Let Harry take a killing curse to the face, then kill Voldemort.
