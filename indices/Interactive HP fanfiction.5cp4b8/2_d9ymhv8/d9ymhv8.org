What kind of "interactive" do you mean?

- Quest: readers can influence story as it's written by voting on the choices? The only one I know is Matou Shinji series I often recommend, but there probably are many more. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]]

- Choose your own adventure: the complete story features multiple choices and the reader skips to approbate chapter. I've found quite a few [[http://www.hpcyoa.com/][1]], [[http://chooseyourstory.com/story/hogwarts-student][2]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Harry+Potter&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Choose+Your+Own+Adventure][3...]]

So yes, it was done.
