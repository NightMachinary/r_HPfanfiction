Writers do sometimes give their readers a choice at the end of their chapters as a sort of challenge to themselves, but the choice isn't usually huge. Usually, it's something small, like:

#+begin_quote
  "I've gotta eliminate Lockhart from his job at Hogwarts by embarrassing him. How should I do it?"
#+end_quote

Something like that doesn't really change much in terms of the overall plot, but it does allow the readers to suggest a fun little scene while giving the writer a little challenge. I've never seen it done on a bigger scale than that, and it sounds really hard to do.

Good luck if you do plan on making one yourself though.
