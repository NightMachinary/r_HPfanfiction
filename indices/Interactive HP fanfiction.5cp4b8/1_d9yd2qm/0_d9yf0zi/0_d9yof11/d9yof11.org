  you're pretty much assured it's not relevant in the long run.

Isn't that the point though? To give yourself a tiny bit of challenge while not giving up creative control? Maybe I'm looking at it just from a writer's perspective, so I might be wrong.

  Maybe with your scenario it's not a big deal, but I've seen some zingers. I don't think it's much the same, since even Choice of Games requires forethought and planning for every eventuality.

Not always though. Writers have specific events, character moments, plot points, dialogues, and subplots planned out, but planning out every single bit and piece at the beginning is practically impossible. ESPECIALLY when done as a hobby. Having a reader fuel a muse can be really helpful. I'm sure that every writer has been inspired by a review at some point or the other.

  Also, with this, now the readers know they don't even have the story written at least a chapter in advance, which I'd recommend to any author.

I don't know where you got that from. Most authors(that I know) who do this always ask these type of questions /at least/ 3 chapters in advance. Asking it the chapter before just seems masochistic.

I overall disagreed with you, but maybe that's just me. Your opinion seems to be shared by many others, and there is probably a very good reason behind that.
