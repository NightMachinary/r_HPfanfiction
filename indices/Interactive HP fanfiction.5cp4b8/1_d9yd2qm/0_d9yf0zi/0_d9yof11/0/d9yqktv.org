Hmm, you're right about my advance chapter comment - it was a baseless assumption. Wouldn't asking for suggestions three chapters advance be spoiling, though? Also, I think there are a few different reasons why someone might share my viewpoint.

People who normally read novels rather than fanfiction might feel unnerved by the flippant disregard for that author/reader disconnect. On the other hand, avid fanfiction readers are likely disillusioned by the many abandoned fics they've experienced and feel that any lapse in control constitutes a one-way ticket to unresolved tension.

I do see where you're coming from! Fanfiction is a very useful tool for improvement in all aspects of writing, as you're presumably getting intuitive critique if the right reader happens upon your work. I believe my own viewpoint stems from the fact that I myself an anal retentive author when I actually deign to write. I'm probably not suited to writing fanfic. C'est la vie. :'D
