These always make me uncomfortable, if only because it indicates that the author hasn't planned the exact impact it'll have on the story - because of this, you're pretty much assured it's not relevant in the long run.

Maybe with your scenario it's not a big deal, but I've seen some zingers. I don't think it's much the same, since even Choice of Games requires forethought and planning for every eventuality.

Also, with this, now the readers know they don't even have the story written at least a chapter in advance, which I'd recommend to any author. Less stress in the long run when it comes to a stable posting schedule.

(edit) On second thought, though, some authors might have a proclivity for improv. Everyone writes differently. I just can't imagine it!
