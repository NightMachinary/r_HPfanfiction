  Does nurture beat nature? Can a wizard become a necromancer? Can a muggleborn become a Paladin? Harry and Dudley are about to find out. Warning card games, war, and adult content later. Read only if you are over 18 . Good Dursleys This story isn't dead but i'm not going to work on it for a while.
