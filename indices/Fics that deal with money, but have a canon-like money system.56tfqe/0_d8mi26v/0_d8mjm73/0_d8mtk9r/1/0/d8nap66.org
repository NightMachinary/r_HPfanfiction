No. You are being reported because there's enough of your threads that people see you as a common poster, and when they assume you are a troll rather than check they may or may not report you. You are not being reported for reading a lot of stories, but for the fact that there is a lot of threads created by you.

Which is the very thing [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]] pointed out, and I really shouldn't have to point /that/ out.
