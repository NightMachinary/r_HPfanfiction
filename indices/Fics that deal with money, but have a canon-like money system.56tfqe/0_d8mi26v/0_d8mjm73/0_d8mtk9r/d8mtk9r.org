They're all requests for stories, at a rate that most would not be able to post assuming they actually read those stories.

That makes people think that you must not be reading the stories. Combine it with the always added length requirement and people are getting tired of it to the point where it's easier to assume it to be a troll.

And it does not help that some people probably don't like you and are feeling vindictive.
