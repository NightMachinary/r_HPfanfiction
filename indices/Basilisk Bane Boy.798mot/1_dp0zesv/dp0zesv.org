Boy are you right about this. That stuff was positively heroic and one of the better reasons why I'm able to swallow stories where Harry just absolutely curbstomps things. J.K. herself has made Harry potter do legitimately legendary things so why not fanfic? Unless it's just badly done, you know what i mean. "I hAZ THE POWER OF 1000 magical cores also elemaental showdow magic whoosh there went the plot". Yeah.
