I know exactly what you mean, I wish the same.

I actually have a story planned out where exactly this happens. Before year 3, when Harry's idling in Diagon Alley, he meets Newt, they start talking, and Newt starts bragging about all the dangerous creatures he's met - and then Harry mentions casually that he met some Acrumantula and slew a basilisk. It goes from there.

I'll probably not even really start it within the next two months (Busy with another story, and while I had a shitty first chapter written, I'd rather forget that)
