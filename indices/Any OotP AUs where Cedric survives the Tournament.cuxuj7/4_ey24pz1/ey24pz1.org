linkao3(Stay Alive For Now by nunchikoi)

I'm currently reading that, it's pretty good but it's a WIP (last update was this month) and I think it's still summer after 4th year there. Basically, Cedric somehow survives, witnesses some of Harry and Voldemort's duel and then decides to back him up on it, so they both are regarded as liars in Prophet. It's Harry/Cedric.
