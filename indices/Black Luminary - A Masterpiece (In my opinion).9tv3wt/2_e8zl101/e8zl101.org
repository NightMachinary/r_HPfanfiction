I really gave this my best shot, but stopped following a couple months ago or something. It does have a lot going on, but for some reason, I'm just not invested in it. The tone feels off, and the fic just feels like such a downer, and the characterization feels too different, contributing to a weird, generic YA vibe rather than anything unique. I found it boring the way that the shadowhunters tv show was boring.

I've read some real downers like Saving Connor, but those had a relentless pace. This just leaves threads to be picked up much much later, and I didn't have the patience for it.
