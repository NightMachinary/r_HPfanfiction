While I agree that it‘s well written, has an interesting setting and is quite enjoyable, I have one problem with the fic that causes some sort of annoyed frustration whenever it comes up. I'm simply going to call it “Harry and female characters”.

I can't believe I'm the only one feeling pretty exasperated about this. The early issues Harry had with females in general (thank god those are mostly over by now) feel like some weird adaption of an anime-premise and came up way too often to count as somewhat cringy comic relief. And even now I usually scroll over a paragraph or two when it comes to Daphne obsessing too much or using her /special ways/ to get what she wants, preferably sleeping in the same bed with Harry. /wink wink nudge nudge/ much. And of course Harry is this weird mix between gentleman, sheep and (pretending to be?) clueless that means nothing will get sorted out anytime soon.

Maybe it's just me overreacting to a pet peeve, but that's the one aspect of the writing that I really don't think is well done in any way. It's really annoying, because it prevents me from enjoying the actual story as much as it deserves.
