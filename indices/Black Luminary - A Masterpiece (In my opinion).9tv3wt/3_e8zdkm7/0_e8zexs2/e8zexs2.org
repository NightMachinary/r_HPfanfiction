While it can be viewed that way, it's exactly what a 13 yo would do to get what she wants. While in the beginning it was quite annoying, it hasn't come up much as of late.

He has a serious crush on his teacher but doesn't know how to deal with it because he doesn't trust her enough, from my interpretation. Regarding the teacher though, the beginning of book 3 from her PoV is contraditory to the rest of her character throughout the series. It's almost obvious she's Grindelwald's granddaughter, but from the early two volumes it seems she has some attachment to harry (not romantic, I don't think. Perhaps if he was her age) and that he is her only option as mentioned in the dementor trial chapter. However, at the start of B3 she says she is just using him for fun and that there are other options, making her seem like a little bitch.
