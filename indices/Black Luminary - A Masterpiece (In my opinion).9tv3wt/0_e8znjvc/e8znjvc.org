I can't get into this story,even after reading about three quarters of it. To my mind, the story keeps changing direction and the characters change personalities for no obvious reason.

The start is fine. It's unusual but it drew me in nicely.

Then he's at school and suddenly has a fear of women. Then he sets lethifolds on his teacher. Then he's over his problems and... Oh just other stuff.

Things happen then get retconned into the story later. There doesn't seem to be any direction, and the characters are unlikeable.

It's very well-written but frankly not very enjoyable.
