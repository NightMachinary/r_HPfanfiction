I agree it's well written technically, but it has problems.

- There is a lot of noise. Useless noise at that. Like a third of the story could be cut with no consequence.

- The plot is convoluted. This ties into the previous point, the writing is just missing clarity. The author almost seems to write in tangents. All of the plot points should have been forshadowed better, because the reader goes through a lot of detail of dubious quality and the important stuff falls through the cracks.

- Most of the characters are unlikeable and annoying. Case in point, Daphne's pov for the last couple of chapters was like nails on chalkboard. I do think he nailed the voice of a vapid teenage girl (in that you want to clobber her) but I couldn't sympathize with her at all, even though I'm supposed to (dead dad & all). I won't even get into Harry inadvertently killing 250.000 people and not giving much of a shit.

- This one is subjective, but the things I want to read about are just not expanded upon. I.e how the ministry situation, the foreign aurors, Voldemort, Harry's magic, Hogwarts politics. A lot of "mysteries" the author introduced were kinda put in the fridge and forgotten. It's been 400k words (that's 4-5 novels, lol) and a lot of plot points should have been explained by now, unless he author intends to reach like a million.

So yeah, in summary, this story really had the potential to be great but it stays firmly in the simply "good" category because of poor structure.
