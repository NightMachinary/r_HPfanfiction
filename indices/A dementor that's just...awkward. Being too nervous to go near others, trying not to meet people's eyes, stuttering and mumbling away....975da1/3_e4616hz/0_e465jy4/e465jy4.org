Misclicks, I guess. Whoever they are tried to upvote it, but their mouse slipped a little way, and they weren't paying enough attention to notice the difference.

After all, if it were a deliberate downvote, whoever it was would have come in to post some advice on how to make the post better, like suggesting information to include or recommending a more appropriate subreddit. Since there's none of that here yet, obviously it was a misclick, or a slipped finger.
