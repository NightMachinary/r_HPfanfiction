It had been maybe ten minutes after the Hogwarts Express had left Kings Cross Station, when the temperature suddenly began to drop.\\
"Brrr..." Ron shivered and cuddled up next to Harry, "What happened to the air conditioning?"\\
Hermione shuddered from the cold, before she reached up for her trunk, pulling it down and starting to look for her winter cloak.\\
"Do you have a spare, Hermione? 'Professor R. J. Lupin' looks cold." Harry noted. Their new professor was indeed shivering in his sleep.\\
Hermione opened her mouth to answer, but was interrupted as the door to their compartment slowly slid open.

It was a cloaked figure. A tall, cloaked figure, whose head was almost touching the ceiling. Its cloak was a dark dusty grey and ragged on the edges, as though it had been worn for millennia. Its face couldn't be seen, the folds of the cloak's hood hiding the figure's facial features.

Slowly, the hood of the cloaked figure turned from left to right, as though it were looking around the compartment.\\
When it was pointed at Harry, it stopped. Then, silently, the figure in the cloak started to reach a hand out towards Harry.

It was horrifying; the slow moving, shivering hand, and the arm attached to it, looked like it had been long dead, putrefied and slimy and grey. And it was holding a letter for Harry.\\
Repulsed and shivering, not just from the cold anymore, Harry nonetheless took the letter, unfolding it...

"W-w-what's it s-say?" Ron asked, his teeth chattering as he glanced back and forth between Harry and the unfamiliar cloaked creature.\\
Harry blinked in confusion, "It's...his name is-s M-m-m-m-m-"\\
Hermione waved her wand about, blasting Harry with a spray of warm air, warming the compartment a little. R.J. Lupin stopped shivering as much.\\
Harry sighed with a bit of relief, "-so yeah, his name is...Moe? And he's here to guard me because of Sirius Black? But, um," he glanced at the letter again, reading as though he was quoting something, "But it's okay if we don't want him to."\\
They all turned and looked at 'Moe', who by the looks of their cloak, was fidgeting nervously with his dead-like fingers and trying not to look at any of the four in the compartment.\\
After several seconds, Hermione, the Gryffindor, spoke, "Well, I guess I'm alright with it..." she said uncertainly.\\
Ron, also a Gryffindor, nodded, "A bit creepy, but if he's here to keep Sirius Black away, I guess we can deal with that."\\
Harry thought about it, before he scooted a little closer to the compartment window (which, despite Hermione's hot-air charm, was still developing icicles), patting the seat next to him for Moe the mysterious cloaked figure to sit down in.\\
"Maybe he knows why it's so cold? Maybe Black put a freezing spell on the train." Ron joked.\\
'Moe' hunched his shoulders a bit, as though embarrassed, before gingerly coming into the compartment and sitting down next to Harry.

A couple of hours into the train ride later, Remus John Lupin finally awoke to a very strange sight.\\
While he was sleeping, someone had draped a thick blanket over him. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were all in the same compartment as him, and were rugged up in their thick winter cloaks, snacking on hot chocolate and Jelly Salamanders (guaranteed to warm your insides).\\
The reason why they were rugged up was obvious; it was so cold inside the compartment that it was practically snowing, frost had completely covered the windows, and every breath anyone in the compartment exhaled was accompanied by mist.

But perhaps the strangest thing was that a Dementor(!) was huddled up next to Harry Potter, head nearly touching the overhead compartments, its hood turned away, its shoulders bunched up, and legs of its cloak crossed in a way that suggested it was highly nervous and shy. And Ron was trying to coax it to try one of the Jelly Salamanders.
