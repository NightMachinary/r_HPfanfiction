This is a bit of an odd fic. It does something I have never seen before it and haven't seen since it. It fulfills the requirements of what you asked for, but it is not focused on what happens after Harry's death, rather his death is where it ends. It is a bit of a weird one, but in my opinion it is fairly good.
