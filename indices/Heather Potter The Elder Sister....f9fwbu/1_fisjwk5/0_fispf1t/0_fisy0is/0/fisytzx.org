It happens irl, but having it in fic is really unnecessary, I agree. Also, it doesn't seem to fit, since OP mentioned the Dursleys. I feel like sleepy suburbia with an abusive family that hates bad rumours isn't really the sort of environment that encourages hard drinking, maxxing cards, and screwing guys at a young age (and where would you get cards to max at Hogwarts? irresponsibly running your vault out of gold is hardly a Slytherin move...).
