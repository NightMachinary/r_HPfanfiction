You mentioned her running the school and overpowering Dumbledore at 12, and then in the same paragraph, the "everyone wants her/wants to be her" bit. This is also mentioned before the 1994 tournament, so one can assume that everyone's supposed to be jealous of her and wanting to screw her before the tourney, aka when she's really very young still.
