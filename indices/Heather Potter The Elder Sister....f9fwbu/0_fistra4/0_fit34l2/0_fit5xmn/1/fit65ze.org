It was just an example. I've not actually written her, so it's kind of a stretch to call her a Mary Sue just because she's in an advantageous position.

E.g. the character she's based off "ran her school" and was a conniving, heartless wretch who was poisoned and murdered after threatening the maim character. You wouldn't exactly call her a Mary Sue, would you?
