"enoby is not a Marie sue, she haz problemz, she's a satanitz! She's deprezzed for God's sake!" People calling her a bitch isn't enough to keep her from being a Mary Sue. You said in a different post that the idea is a reference to an 80's comedy though, so fair enough, though. Mary Sues can honestly be great in comedies, like in that one fic where Harry is raised by Itachi Uchiha from Naruto.
