Ron sighed deeply as he sat down in his house kitchen.

''you went to see him again didnt you'' hermione asked concerned.

"Nothing has changed'' ron sighed deeper tears forming in his eyes ''I just wish for a moment I would see harry, our harry, not this unstable version of him''.

''I Wish you would stop going to see him ron, it destroys you inside everytime'' hermione replied

''its our harry, I cant betray him like that, he needs me'' ron snapped with a hint of anger and agression.

Hermione pulled ron into a hug 'its not a betrayal, its been five years since we managed to get him into saint mungo's and he is not improving, I wish we noticed earlier, he was acting strange in our fifth year I assumed it was because of cedric and figured he would need some time to heal, but then sirius died at the ministry and he just slowly got worse and worse'' hermione looked at Ron '' the last time I went to see him was shortly after hugo was born, he was so disgusted with hugo and convinced you where drugging me with a love potion, it hurt me ron, it hurt me so badly to see harry looking at hugo with such hate and disgust''.

''you never told me that, you just said it was too tough and you could not go anymore'' ron replied. "I was so mad at you for that, I am sorry''

hermione smiled '' your passion is why I am so in love with you stupid and I kept it from you, I am not sure why I guess it was because you where so busy with your auror work and I felt you did not need the extra stress''. ''I almost wish harry would have died against voldemort, it would be kinder then this.'' hermione continued.

''he recovered for a few years after we defeated voldemort, I was so happy my friend was back, he married my sister had a few kids, we where aurors together solving crime, it was so great' ron smiled softly

''I hope one day he will recover again, so James,lilly and albus get to actually meet their father''
