The explanation for how all of this occurs: Harry somehow reads one of the more outlandishly badly written and trope-heavy "everyone and the kitchen sink betrays Harry" fanfics; think a cracky version of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]] / [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473842/1/A-Sensational-Story][A Sensational Story]] where instead of the canon books it's said unspecified tropey fanfic, and Harry's the one who finds it and possibly in an earlier year, I'm thinking 2nd (cause people are freaking out about him) or 4th (cause he's already being betrayed) for extra zaniness (not to mention younger can mean more gullible, plus he should get the fic before it starts so it reads like a prophecy).

Whether anyone else ever reads said fanfic can go either way.
