You know, I never understood all this anger at the Weasleys, I mean sure, you can write a Harry that simply does not fall in love with Ginny(I normally prefer it that way), or whose personality just doesn't click with Ron and Hermione for several reasons.

It doesn't mean they must become mortal enemies. Heck, he could even be friends, you know.

I also laugh a lot when Dumbledore and Molly are just dosing everyone and their mothers with a multitude of potions for any reasons, I then normally close the fic or if it has some interesting premise or concept, just skim over those parts.

Don't want the Weasleys on your fic? Just don't put them in, it would be interesting how Harry evolves without that positive environment.
