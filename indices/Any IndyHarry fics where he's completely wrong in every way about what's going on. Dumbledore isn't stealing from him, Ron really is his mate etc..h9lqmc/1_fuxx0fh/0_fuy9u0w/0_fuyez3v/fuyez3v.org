Oh it happens. Usually as follows:

Goblin inheritance test reveals the usual Black-Potter-Peverell. Also turns out that James was somehow descended from Gryffindor, Harry is "Lord Slytherin by conquest", Lily is either a) descended from a squib line of Ravenclaw or was b) Stolen By Muggles as a baby and was the missing Ravenclaw heir. Then they throw in Hufflepuff for some reason or another. Upon arrival at school, Harry is proclaimed Lord Hogwarts by the Hat who refuses to Sort him. He gets his own suite of rooms as he technically owns the school. He fires Dumbledore. Etc.
