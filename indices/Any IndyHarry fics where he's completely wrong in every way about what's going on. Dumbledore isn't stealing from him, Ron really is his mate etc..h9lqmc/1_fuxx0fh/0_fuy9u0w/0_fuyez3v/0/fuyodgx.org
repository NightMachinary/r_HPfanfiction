I think most indy!Harry fics I've read has Lily descended from Slytherin (usually having her green eyes be a giveaway). This is basically one of very few things in indy!Harry fics I actually like the idea of (allthough I wouldn't regard the eyes as a giveaway, more the whole Parseltongue thing -- her eyes may be pretty for all I know, but they're just regular eyes).
