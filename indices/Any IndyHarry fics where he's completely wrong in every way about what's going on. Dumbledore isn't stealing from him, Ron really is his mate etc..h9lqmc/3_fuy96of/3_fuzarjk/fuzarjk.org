I always understood the "Ice Queen" persona(at least the good fics mostly do it that way) as a defense mechanism, she's either emotionally stunted, or is afraid being too emotive would make her vulnerable(for some reason).

I can totally see it happening, heck I've seen it in real life.

Daphne is never said to be a Death Eater, nor are her parents, at least as far as I've read.

I will never understand people disputing the canon personality of a character who's only mentioned once in the books, basically an OC.

  That shit's fishier then the fics where Voldemort is suddenly a nice guy.

Only way I read those is when the author rewrites canon in such a way that Voldemort is basically an OC and a lots of things are changing so it's not The People vs KKK and it becomes something like the "Progressives" vs "Traditionalists" where both sides are full of bias and the conflict is ideological instead of one side wanting to practice genocide.
