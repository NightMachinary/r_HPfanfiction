What gets me is that usually, at the very start of indie fics, when Harry is basically still canon!Harry, she's pretty much outright insulting towards everyone, but he just randomly looks past it. Like she's typically so outright rude that nobody would even want to talk to her. Like okay let's say Harry just got betrayed by everyone. Still bitter over that. Doesn't want to get burned again. Why would he ever get involved with a person that's more toxic then the average League of Legends player?
