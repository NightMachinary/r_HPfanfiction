For me, there are two sorts of HP/DG fics I approve of: ones that are full on AU with Daphne being a genuinely nice girl, no ice queen, no Mary Sue-esque 'dark, mysterious past', no bitching every time Harry does something. Or ones where she's a death earer, and so is Harry, and she has an excuse for being rude. I mean, death eaters probably aren't the nicest bunch.
