  full on AU with Daphne being a genuinely nice girl, no ice queen, no Mary Sue-esque 'dark, mysterious past', no bitching every time Harry does something

...is this really an "AU" though? Daphne Greengrass is just a name used once or twice in three series, we never actually see her or her character. She could be Mary Poppins or she could be Erzabet Bathory, all portrayals are equally valid.
