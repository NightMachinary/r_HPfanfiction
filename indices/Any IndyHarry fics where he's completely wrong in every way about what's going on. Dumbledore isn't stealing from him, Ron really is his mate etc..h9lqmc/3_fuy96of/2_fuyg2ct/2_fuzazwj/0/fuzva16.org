No no it's a post Deathly hallows information confirmed and expanded by JK on pottermore years ago I think . Go to Astoria greengrass on the Potter wiki or on pottermore and you can read that. I remember clearly that it was being stated there. She was raised as a blood purist, saw the horror of the war and decided it was bullshit, married Draco and decided to raise their son Scorpio with a philosophy of tolerance, to the displeasure of Narcissa et Lucius who didn't really like her. She died relatively early due to a blood curse that she inherited from an ancestor, living Draco to raise Scorpio alone. That's all the information we have on her. Not a word about Daphne though.
