Even more so when it is one hundred percent confirmed that canonically, the Greengrass are Sympathiser of Voldemort and the blood purist, even if they are not death eater. Astoria Greengrass is said to have been raised believing that pureblood are superior and only changed her mind after having seen the ravages of the war caused by the cause. I don't see what would justify Daphne being any different from her family , especially since she was close with Parkinson.

Hell that would be so much more interesting than the bullshit we get about them being « grey » or shit, it just feels like such a cope out. I really want to read a fanfic where Daphne is a blood purist but Harry manage to change her for the better, developing a romantic relationship along the way.
