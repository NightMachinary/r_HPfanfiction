You see I understand the dilemma, but even though I am not sure, I seem to remember that JK Rowling expanded on this part of the narrative before Cursed Child was a thing, which would make it just bizarre to dismiss it. But I am not so sure on the timeline though. But of all the thing to come out of CC this is relatively fine, and even if I was wrong i am ok with this canon expansion on the Greengrass and Astoria.

Thanks for the rec, I will check it out.
