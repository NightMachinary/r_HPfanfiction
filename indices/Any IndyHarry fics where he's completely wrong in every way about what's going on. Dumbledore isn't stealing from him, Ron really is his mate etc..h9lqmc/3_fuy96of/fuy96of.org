You forgot one cliche that I would personally love to see more then the others:

"Harry, mate, she's literally a death eater." Said Ron, freaking out over his best friend suddenly losing his mind over a girl that he didn't even know the name of until this year.

"SHUT UP, DAPHNE LOVES ME!" Screamed Harry, frothing at the mouth from love potion overdose.

"Mate, she literally spends half the time insulting you and the rest abusing muggleborns..."

"YOUR SISTER WANTS TO LOVE POTION ME AND KILL ME ON OUR WEDDING DAY!" Harry growled

"Whatever, I give up."

Three months later, the dowager lady Daphne Potter hands the entirety of the Potter Estate over to Lord Voldemort.

Because seriously, out of all the independant!Harry cliches, she's the one I have the most trouble believing. Especially since the fandom favourite is the "ice queen" persona, which, in this case, just means she constantly acts like a bitch until she suddenly, abruptly doesn't. Like a total personality transfer out of nowhere. That shit's fishier then the fics where Voldemort is suddenly a nice guy.
