Wow, people really get mad at badly written fics, jeez, man, it's just people making wish fulfillment, it makes me laugh too sometimes, but I just close the fic.

Betrayal fics are a thing because people don't want to put the work in for emotional drift or other, more realistic events that make people drift apart. So they make the character's friends betray them so they can get revenge.

Or people just don't like the characters and want to make them bad.
