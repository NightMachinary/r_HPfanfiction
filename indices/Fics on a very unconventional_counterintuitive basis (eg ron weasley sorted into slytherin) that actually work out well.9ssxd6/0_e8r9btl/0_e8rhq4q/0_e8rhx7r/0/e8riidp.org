There's this really promising fic that's just started that's about Ron as an Auror with a some good relationship development with Hermione in which Death Eaters return and old secrets from the First War and the Prewett family emerge. Good pacing so far, and I'm impressed with the set up but there are some sex scenes. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13085565/1/The-Ancient-and-Most-Noble-House-of-Prewett]])
