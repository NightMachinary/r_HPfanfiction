Maybe it's also BDSM. Studying hurts so good, and Hermione is literally chained to her desk until she finishes /all six inches./

...I'll be in my bunk.

-edit: BookHarry goes from a paperback to a hardcover; she teases his pages, /marking her place/ with a coy finger, then using a nice thick bookmark; and, of course, she always finishes a book once she starts.

I might have to write this...hmm. Reporting back soonish if I do.

-the risque double-edit: Already 2k words in. Looking like a hot little one-shot. I'll be posting it on AO3, as this is less crackfic and more actually erotic book-on-lady (and vice versa) action.

You heard me right. Seventh Year return to Hogwarts after the war, so all books and people are of age and consenting. Just go with it, okay? I'll post a link to it on this sub (though not this thread) when it's done. Current working title, /No Greater Lover of Books/.

I don't normally say this, but: don't like sexy crack-fics? Don't read. I just finished writing a book climaxing, and it only gets weirder from there.
