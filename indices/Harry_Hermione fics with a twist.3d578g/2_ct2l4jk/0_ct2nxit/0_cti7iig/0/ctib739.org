The first chapter (3435 words) of a two chapter story called /No Greater Lover of Books/ is done. Just a little delayed by life in getting the second chapter done and everything cleaned up before posting. It's part crack, part erotica, part I-can't-believe-I-wrote-this.

I will be posting it soonish, with an announcement in [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Sorry it's slow, but I swore not to post partially finished works and won't break that for this story. Glad you're...excited? I think people looking forward to this won't be disappointed.
