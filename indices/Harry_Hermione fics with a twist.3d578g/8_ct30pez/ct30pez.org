linkffn(Patron by Starfox5): due to a mix of a Life Debt and the rather oppressive law in this AU, Harry is Hermione's "Patron" --- someone appointed to "guide" her into the wizarding world.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]], where, due to an interaction with a protective Charm Hermione had put on Harry, it is her name that comes out of the Goblet. Could be edited for length, and the ending is weak, but it's a unique view of how someone like Hermione --- not as athletic or fearless as Harry, but more disciplined and better at magic --- would handle the tasks. Also features a rare dynamic where Hermione is the action protagonist and Harry is the sidekick.

  Harry is pissed off from having to save everyone and everything all the time and decides to leave the wizarding world together with Hermione

I think that this sort of premise tends to strip away an important aspect of Hermione's personality --- her drive to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not.
