Yeah, it these stories that I don't really like, it is just weird. I always like it where it is either the Harry Potter Characters in the Star Wars world scare and confuse or the star wars universe in Harry Potter's world. I like the stories when they feel natural. That is why I enjoyed Stars Crossed and Potter in time because it feels more natural.
