God, I wish I knew how my brain worked so I could trick it into coming up with a snippet/fic for this, especially as I'm running into writer's block for my own fic and this is the kind of silly writing that tends to fix it.

Unfortunately, I got nothing - but I'm leaving this comment in case the story juices start flowing again and I come up with something.
