(2/2)

He already had the robes, so he could cross that off the list. Although... maybe he should get some extra? They did say he need three.

He put thoughts of robes aside when he reached the correct door, and rang the doorbell. Harry had realised there was only one person he could ask about all the other stuff. Mrs Figg had many friends who had sticks he now realised were wands after all.

The woman screamed when she opened the door, so Harry quickly said, “I don't want to play hide and seek today Mrs Figg.” She stopped screaming, but became even paler than she already was. He saw her hand shaking against the door-handle. “I just got a letter from Hogwarts and I though you might be able to tell me where I can get a wand?”

-

“So you... are Harry Potter?” Harry smiled brightly at the use of his surname. Mrs Figg flinched.

“Yes! That is my name.”

Mrs Figg had needed a long time to calm down when she woke up on the couch, Harry standing over her. He'd brought her inside after she fainted, worrying all the while if he should do something to wake her up. What did you do with people who fainted? Were you supposed to shake them? Kiss them? He'd read a story like that once.

She'd woken up by herself before he could decide which to try, and promptly started screaming again. But now she sat on her couch with one of her hissing cats in her lap, and was finally listening to him.

“And you thought you should ask me where you could buy a wand?”

“Well yes. I couldn't really ask my aunt, she can't see me, you see.”

“Ah yes.” She swallowed. “Of course. That would be inconvenient.” The hand she used to pet her cat still shook slightly, but she seemed calmer now. “If it's alright with you, I'll call the headmaster. He'd be... delighted to realise you were... alive and well.”

“Well I'm pretty sure I'm a ghost. But I am definitely well.”

“A ghost,” she said faintly, “Of course. Let me go call him then.”

-

“I'm so glad to see you well, my boy.” Headmaster Dumbledore had replaced Mrs Figg on the couch. Mrs Figg was in the kitchen, maybe making tea. He was old, with a very long white beard and bright blue eyes behind halfmoon glasses. He also tasted very very sour.

“When you disappeared from your aunt's home so soon after you were left there, we feared the worst.” He looked sombre, eyes downcast, lips twisted into a frown. But when Harry tried a little taste again he was still sour. Horrible.

“But I never left my aunt's house,” he said, voice perhaps revealing a little of his disappointment at the man's taste.

“Yes, I can see that now, but at the time we were looking for a little boy, not---”

“A little ghost?”

“Ghost, my boy?”

Harry sat straight, explaining his theory with confidence. “I am invisible and I float.”

The man smiled. “That is true, but I'm afraid you aren't a ghost exactly.”

“How do you know?”

“I've met many a ghost in my long life. Ghosts are transparent, you look quite solid to me.” He shook his head. “No, you, my boy, are a dementor.”

The sound of something breaking came from the kitchen. He wondered if Mrs Figg was alright, she'd been back there a long time. But that wasn't important.

“Is a dementor a kind of ghost?”

The headmaster patted his beard in thought. “Not exactly. The ministry classifies ghosts as spirits, while dementors are classified as non-beings.” He frowned. “But I think some people fit non-beings into the spirit classification as well. I'd have to do some research to be certain.”

A silence fell as both contemplated their various thoughts. Harry's mind was stuck on one particular word. “What does non-being mean? I am, so how can I not be.”

“Ah.” Dumbledore's hand stilled on his beard. “I'm finding myself more out of my depth with every question you ask, Harry. To be honest I've never heard of a human becoming a dementor before. You are quite unique in your circumstance.”

“Are dementors allowed at Hogwarts?”

Dumbledore coughed. “Not traditionally no.” His lips twisted into a smile. “But I'm sure we can figure something out.”
