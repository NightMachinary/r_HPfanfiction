I've mentioned it before, but I don't think /The Lie I've Lived/ by jbern has held up very well.

It's a neat premise, and there are several things I like a lot about it, but when I reread it I end up getting bored sometime around the Yule Ball.

Maybe it's because GoF AU has been done to death, and everyone needs to write their own take on the three tasks instead of just changing it completely, but I think the story gets sort of boring after the first half.
