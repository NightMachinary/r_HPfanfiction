We as readers are told that he became a combination of Harry and James. I'm not sure how far exactly you got (or where exactly it's even mentioned) but there are some conversations with Sirius where he asks things like, "So should I just call you James?" and 'Harry' doesn't really have an answer.

It's a super neat premise, and the first dozen or so chapters are really engrossing, but I think it failed to leave the atmosphere so to speak.
