Honestly, I disliked it at first too, but I think its unique enough to give a shot. Sure gof au is done a lot. But this fic is very unique. It deals with things I've never even heard of outside of the story. For example, a lot of the early part is hj (harry/james) dealing with his identity now that he has all of the memories of James, which I haven't ever seen. And then, it doesn't follow stations of the canon tasks. So its fairly unique amongst gof au. I get the bad memory thing. But Its worth a read.
