The one where [[/spoiler][Remus slept with Lily while James was away? Then Remus dies randomly at the very end because the author obviously didn't feel like dealing with the situation he created?]]

Yeah as a huge Remus fan I wasn't too keen on it either. Really the entire ending is just one wet fart in my opinion.
