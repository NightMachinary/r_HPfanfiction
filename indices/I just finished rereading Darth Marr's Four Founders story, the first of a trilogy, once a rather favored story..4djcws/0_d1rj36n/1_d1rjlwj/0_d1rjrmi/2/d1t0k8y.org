There was pretty clearly closure on the Remus front no? HJ accepts that he isn't really James and so forgives Remus. Or at least says it was in the past. It;s just ya know Remus dies. God forbid though that the author made a character complex and different than most of the fandom where the good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad.
