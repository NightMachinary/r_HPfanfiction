I agree that at some points that the fic goes a bit /too/ far to explain Snape's most ridiculous behavior and I definitely agree with the fact that Snape and Lily would have only spoke in class after the Mudblood-incident. However, I don't think that these minor issues detract the fic so they're honestly not that big of a deal IMHO
