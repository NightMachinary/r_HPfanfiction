I had 2 minor nitpicks with this fic: 6-7th year interactions between Severus and Lily portray them as remaining somewhat decent acquaintances (even if their close friendship was mostly destroyed after the OWL incident), while my headcanon has them only talk when absolutely necessary in canon during this time, and the very jarring way Severus' questioning of Harry in his first Potions lesson is explained (the fic doesn't try to justify his behaviour, but Severus' own reasoning of the ordeal is something I found to be outright bizarre).

Otherwise, I really liked the fic. I especially like how it portrays parts of his life that basically no other fic does -- Severus' life before Hogwarts /in detail/ (some fics speed through 1969-1971 giving some backstory to the Sev&Lily friendship, but very little beyond that -- his home life in depth, years before 1969, etc), and his life at Hogwarts during 1981-1991, including some extra plots that could plausibly be canon-compilant while remaining interesting to read.
