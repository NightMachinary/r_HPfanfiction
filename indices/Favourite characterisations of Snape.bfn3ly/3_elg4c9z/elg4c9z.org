I have a hard time with straight Severitus stories, if they don't deal thoroughly with the fact that the canonical Snape character was truly quite disgusting figure (a teacher which achieves to be a boggart of his student?). There has to be so persuasive conversion story, otherwise it feels silly. However, exactly a good conversion/repentence story could be a foundation of a good fanfic, but I am still looking for one.

Having said that, there are some stories which are better than others, where Snape is taken at least favorably:

- linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) --- focus is on Harmony story with rather quite nice characterizations of Grangers, George & Fred, and quite interesting pair (not a romantic one, just friends) of professors McGonagall & Snape
- linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) --- fem!Harry (one those on-seventeenth-birthday-Harry-gets-another-gift-he-didnt-expected), rather nice story, too much explicit sex (including horrible magic-causes-wizards-to-be-oversexed trope), and BDSM (not presented) done by the Snape & Hermione pair. One of those stories which are actually harmed by too much porn elements. But Snape is rather well done. Even better portrait of Snape is adjacent one-shot linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao).
- Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel --- it has been linkffn(9931566), but it is gone now; you can get links to the alternate sources in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][my review]]. I would really like to like it, but ... see the review.
