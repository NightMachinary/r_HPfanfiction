[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15208766/chapters/35274458][Masterpiece - Severus Young]] Severus, page summary: Silent Severus is the ultimate shiny black box that Sirius and James cannot resist opening. He's too strange. He's too different. He's too powerful. When they plan the worst prank they can imagine, they pay a price for opening Pandora's Box. Snape has to fight his way through kidnapping, abuse, and attempted murder, in order to discover who he is and the purpose behind his powerful magic. Darkness and love battle outside of human understanding. Dumbledore and the staff must turn a blind eye to the hidden battle he is fighting against James Potter, or risk the loss of the wizarding world as they know it.
