It was a really good read. Except for the stupid way magic works there, making the SI physically weak and the author not realizing how this makes her useless in fights forever

Also, it's a perfect example of a story with 'too many OC' syndrome

Other than that I would say the story is actually fantastic. Though I did drop it because the OC's were annoying me in the worst ways
