There was a long (100k+ words) incomplete story I read like a decade ago, where Harry saves a little girl from experimentation and they learn about yet another little girl that is kept captive somewhere in Russia (I think) and they set out to rescue her. Harry is around 11-12 and the girls around 10. It was very well written and full of tension, gore and action. The girls had super-creepy powers (like telekinesis, biokinesis, tentacles, psychic manipulation etc) but they were loyal to Harry (and he to them). Harry had his vanilla magic but he had learned to wield it quite fearsomely. After the second girl was rescued they went to France and found sanctuary with Apolline Delacour. The story was abandoned at that point.

Unfortunately I don't remember the title or author, if anyone has any clue pls provide.
