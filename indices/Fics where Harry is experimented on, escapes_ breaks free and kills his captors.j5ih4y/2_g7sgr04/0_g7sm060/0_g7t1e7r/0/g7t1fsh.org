#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter had been an unwanted freak in the Dursley home, so when an opportunity arises for them to be rid of him, is it any wonder they jump on it? Harry finds himself trapped and experimented on like a lab rat by those that wield the strange power he's come to suppress. When he finally escapes, he carries with him a secret that must be kept so, lest he find himself shown as the freak he had always been told he was.[Updates every 2 weeks!]
