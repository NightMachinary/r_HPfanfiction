Yeah, no, you can totally enjoy it, but if you wanna talk shit about a pairing that /doesn't/ put the protagonist with a wizard nazi on the grounds that it's "too het," or whatever, then you shouldn't be surprised when I talk shit about your preferred ship on the grounds that the canon character of Draco Malfoy is an utterly contemptible human being.

*edit: also, "it could be worse" is a poor defense of "it's really bad as is."
