I was looking through my old comments and found this thread again.

Seriously though, /why is that?/ I can NEVER find a well-written wlw/femslash story, Harry/Slytherin!Girl stories read like self-inserts, and harmony always sounds cringe to me, like "oh they met when they were five and the Grangers adopted Harry and for some reason this translated to them being /in love/ at frigging five years old, instead of a sibling-like feeling or something". Any non-drarry slash pairings I've tried my hand at were either one-shots or Harry/Adult!Man, and the idea of Tomarry/Snarry, which were fine to read when I was, like, /13/, now at 30 sounds so /horribly pedophilic/ I'm not even going to get into it.

I mean, what else is left? I've started watching Killing Eve as an alternative to Drarry.
