The fact that most fanfics author chose to use the same representation doesn't change the fact that Daphne does not have any "true" representation.

It's not like with Harry or Hermione where people will complain that said character would never do "Insert_action_there". With Daphne, you can make her anything from a air head with a heart of gold to a bloodthirsty Death Eater, and people will just say "sure I guess".
