It would have certain plot value, Gryffindor/Slytherin(Romeo/Juliet), Rich Girl / 'Poor' guy that's actually Rich, Knowledgeable of the World Girl/Guy that's ignorant.

The possibility for conflict and drama without the author forcing it is there too.

The fact she's a blank slate so you can write her any way you want(even if the fandom has already 'formed' a character) also helps immensely.

Even her appearance is up to debate, you can have her be like Astoria OR just make it up, I prefer blonde because I am used to it, but some people just make her look like Ashara Dayne for some reason, like they do with Bellatrix(I am trying to think of anyone with natural purple eyes in canon and I can't recall anyone)
