The first really good fics that used her decided to have her as a cold slytherin whose family came from a more neutral stance instead of being Dark like the Malfoys and Blacks or Light like the Weasleys (usually used to justify independent Harry with a slytherin pairing). People followed their lead and then flanderized it past that into the Ice Queen trope it is today

Source: I remember reading every Harry/Daphne fic i could get my hands on when the pairing/character started to gain steam because I'm a sucker for a good guy/bad girl pairing
