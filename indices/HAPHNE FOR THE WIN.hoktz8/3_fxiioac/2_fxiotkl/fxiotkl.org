Many fanfics are pairing-driven. People wanted a pairing that would push Harry out of his comfort zone and add some new dynamics, force him to take a fresh perspective on things. And to do this you can pair Harry with a Slytherin.

And then when it comes to picking said Slytherin girl, there are only two of them that don't have negative pre-existing characterizations that you would have to explain away or change before moving on with things. With Pansy Parkinson, you would have to break her away from Draco and explain away her being a bully, first. The less said about Millicent Bullstrode's canon presentation, the better. So you're left with Daphne Greengrass and Tracy Davis, and between the two, Daphne sounds like more of a pureblood, which supports the narrative of pushing Harry out of his established comfort zone better.

Basically, you can write a rather interesting fanfic if you pair Harry with a Slytherin, and despite her lack of canon characterization, (or perhaps, because of it,) Daphne is the best choice.
