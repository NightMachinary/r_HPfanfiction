I mean that's like 80-90% of all fan fiction lmao. It's how I got my user name. In high school I was in a writing class and everyone had their favorite fan fiction. Most were anime esque and poorly written as I wasn't afraid to say so. Hence everyone knew “joe hates fan fiction”.

Now a days I don't despise the animesque moments. Manic pixie girl with magic purple eyes who is the most perfect pretty girl ever despite being slightly damaged is still something I dislike in fiction. I most commonly see it with Daphne and Bellatrix (particularly purple eyes) but honestly I've seen it with all pairings.
