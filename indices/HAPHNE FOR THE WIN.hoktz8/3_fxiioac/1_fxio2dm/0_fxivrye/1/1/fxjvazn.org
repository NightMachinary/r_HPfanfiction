Eh, I don't care much for it, I know some people use it to describe either Bellatrix or Daphne(or even Tonks 'true' form) so I just picture them as that artwork of Ashara Dayne, some times I think the author is just going for an exotic look.

I don't see the need, young Helena Bohan Carter is beautiful too for Bellatrix and Daphne could just be blue eyed.

  Honestly I'd love to see a long fic with a Daphne of average attractiveness bonding with Harry over their mutual awkwardness. Like Ice Cream but more slow burn.

I am trying to find a fic I once read, where Daphne's family business was farming and while attractive she was more natural and less supermodel.

I think the only character canonically who could have such eyes is Tonks by using her abilities.
