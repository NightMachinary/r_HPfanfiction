Purple eyes is one of the most ridiculous fannon inventions. Like I actually enjoy Haphne but if you say she has purple eyes I'm done. If any character does honestly. Such an anime characteristic.

Honestly I'd love to see a long fic with a Daphne of average attractiveness bonding with Harry over their mutual awkwardness. Like Ice Cream but more slow burn.
