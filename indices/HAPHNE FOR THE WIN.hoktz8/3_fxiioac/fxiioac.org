Can anyone explain the development of Daphne's fanon character to me? I haven't read a lot of fics, even though I have read the books themselves a few dozen times. I know Daphne has a well developed fanon character (somehow) but I'd love if someone can tell me how it came to be, and what that character typically is :)
