I agree, I think malfoys redemption arc started in his final years in hogwarts and ended when he had his son

Malfoy for most of the books was just the evil prick from the snake house where zuko had redeeming traits early on we spent alot of season 2 in zuko's head If Zuko was redeemed in season 2 it wouldnt have been as meaningful Zuko in season 3 had everything he thought he wanted but decided to turn away from that to train the avatar

Malfoy does not have the screen time for that arc
