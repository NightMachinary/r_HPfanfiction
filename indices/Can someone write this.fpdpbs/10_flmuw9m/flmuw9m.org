One thing I'd really love to see is similar to this, I've seen it in Drarry fics before, but I'd like to see it in a platonic one-- what would have happened in the bathroom scene if Harry chose not to fight Draco, but give him sympathy, seeing that he was basically having a fcking panic attack. I've only ever seen it in slash.

I love any kinds of proper Draco redemption though.
