Lol! Right before reading your comment, I was debating clicking on one of the recs when I had the thought, "Eh, a Golden Trio horcrux hunt? That's going to be a lot of Ron. If they keep canon enough that he stomps out abandoning his friends I'll just get irritated. Not sure if it's worth it what with everything else." The timing of my thoughts and reading your comment made me chuckle.
