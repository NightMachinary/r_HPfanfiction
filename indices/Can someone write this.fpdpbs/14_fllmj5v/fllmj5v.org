Honestly, I find this unlikely. He's an arrogant bigot (and no it's not because of his family, he spent 9 months at Hogwarts surrounded by an environment that frowns upon outright racism) who only turned away from the side of the Death Eaters because he didn't have to stomach to kill and be tortured by the Dark Lord. A far better character would have been Crabbe or Goyle. Plus it'd put another spin on them other than "stupid strong boy".
