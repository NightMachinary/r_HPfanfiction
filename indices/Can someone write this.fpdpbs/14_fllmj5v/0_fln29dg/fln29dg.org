I love the stories where CrabbenGoyle are more than stupid strong boys, even if it's just one of them. I recently read a fic where Harry (not sure if he was the main character or secondary) referred to them as one name because you never see one without the other and "are you sure they aren't one person? I'm not convinced." It was a mentor!Snape fic, probably a time travel because I'm in one of those kicks, and when I saw that I hoped for CrabbenGoyle character development. I was disappointed in that sense but it was a well written story. Another they were super loving and caring to animals, but still very little face time. Do you have any recs for them? I'm writing a fic and recently had an idea where they would fit in beautifully, and I can't wait to get to my notes to jot it down.
