  for someone who grew up privileged and misguided as Draco
#+end_quote

lol The spoiled brat was "misguided". I'm sure he had a big fluffy, soft heart while using racial slurs, trying to get Buckbeak executed, imperiusing Rosmerta, committing attempted murder on Ron, Katie and Dumbledore and joining a terrorist organisation. I seriously do not understand why so many people want to "redeem" Draco. He grew up in a rich, loving family. His father being abusive is purely fiction stemming from the movies. He */chose/* to be evil. He wasn't forced, coerced, misguided, etc.

I want to see a fic where Draco attacks Harry (or one of his friends) and Harry warns him this is his last chance. So when Draco attacks a second time Harry mops the floor with him and stomps his guts out.
