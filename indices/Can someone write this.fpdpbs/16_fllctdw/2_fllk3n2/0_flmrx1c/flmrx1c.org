Oh, please. He had all the choices in the world. The same choices people like Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black had. (Oh, and Regulus too, somehow I always forget him.) Draco just lacked the strength and will to act.

Edit: Or did Draco lack a true friend? It just got me thinking- Andromeda had the love and support of her husband, Sirius had James who literally took him in from the street and even Regulus had Kreacher. But Draco only has Dumb and Dumber. I suppose if Astoria Greengrass played a larger part in Draco's school years steering him away from the Death Eaters he could have redeemed himself.
