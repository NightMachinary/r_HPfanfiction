The friend thing is probably a big factor, but honestly "he had all the choice in the world" yea so does everyone and most people aren't working to topple evil dictatorships or getting degrees in medicine or law in order to eradicate aids or stop deforestation or whatever.. ppl aren't usually hero's, that's kinda what makes hero's hero's you know.

Also I kinda like research about how the holocaust (or other horrible shit) could have happened and the general consensus is that people are easy to brainwash and usually do what they're told.

+it probably didn't occur to Draco that his world few might be flawed until he saw first hand what Voldemort was, people don't normally go around thinking they're evil or wrong
