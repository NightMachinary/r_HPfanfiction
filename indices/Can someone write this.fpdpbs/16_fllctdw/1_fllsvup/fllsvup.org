Young minds are impressionable, yes, he definitely had his own free will, yes he chose certain actions.

But, he never killed a living, innocent person like his father had done, that is where he stems out differently. Redeeming him is popular because of the fact that he has at least one quality that can be expanded on, it's not like they're trying to redeem Lucius.

Lucius has killed, Snape has killed, Draco is 16 (or at least, he was), a 16 year old can still be swayed, can still change, but changing a 40-50 year old man? No.

You have to look at things from a psychological point of view, what you can change, what caused him to do the things he did, it's never just “they're evil”, no one is born a monster, they are crafted, and since he was brought up in a family where multiple people believed the things that he was taught, he was surrounded by bad influences.

There is so much you can do with their character arc, so many things that you can change, so many things that you can put in place that can make him change!

That is why I love writing him, the fascination of his character draws me to him, because there are so many possibilities!
