I actually read a fic that had this basic theme but I can't remember the name of it and unfortunately it was unfinished... but the author managed to keep Malfoy as the asshole he is while writing a realistic type redemption theme during the Horcrux hunt with the trio. It didn't have any slash and it was only posted on FFN. If anyone's interested I'll try and find it. It stuck out to me because the characters really stayed true to how they are in the books and didn't fall into cliche-type fanon stuff.
