There is a fic called 'Temptation on the Warfront' by alizarincrims0n

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594]]

“Draco Malfoy is forced into hiding with the Golden Trio and dragged into their search for horcruxes. What ensues is a journey of redemption, unexpected friendships and an unwanted, turbulent romance with Harry Potter. Warnings for swearing, sexual content, and dark themes.”

It's slash though, but I wholeheartedly recommend it because it's absolutely wonderful.
