There's an excellent fic that makes Draco a central character:

"Draco Malfoy has a mission to complete, and no one can help him. Spending nights stuck on Prefect duty with Hermione Granger only adds to his problems. Doesn't it? Or is it possible that their unlikely relationship could alter the course of the Second Wizarding War -- if the Boy Who Made All the Wrong Choices can get this one thing right?"

Few of the OP's suggestions actually happen, but this fic essentially follows the process of Draco becoming quasi-part of the Golden Trio while adhering to many aspects of canon. One of my all-time favorite fics, I adore it!
