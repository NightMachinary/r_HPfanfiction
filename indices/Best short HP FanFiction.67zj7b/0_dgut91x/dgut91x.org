I'd like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel's]] ALL medium length (~30k) fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is hilarious take on 'read the books' trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), has Hermione sending her memories and powers back to her 2 years self, or 42 days before Halloween 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also several heart-breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][HIs Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530), is AU Year 6. A more assertive Harry bullied the Answers from Dumbledore in one 'private lesson' instead of the entire year. Things went much better afterwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), has the UK government taking a more concerned approach to what went on in magical Britain. Chapters 5 and 6 are especially good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), has Dumbledore taking the aftermath of CoS a little more seriously. Enjoy the subsequent fallout!

Other noteworthy medium length fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10516162/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Metamorph][Harry Potter and the Metamorph]], linkffn(10516162), has 40k words, pairs Harry with Tonks, and is very entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): Grangers were not what they appeared to be, and Hermione was 'the power he knows not'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450), has Harry organizing a mass exodus to fight a tyrannical marriage law.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717), is a great Hermione time travel to Marauder Era, but from James Potter's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), has a powerful Harry/Ginny beating up Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), has 40k words, and is one of my top H/Hr fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), has a romantic Trio Harry/Hermione/Theo Nott. It's just brilliant and my favorite among medium length fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]], linkffn(7186430), has 40k words, and features Harry/fem!Voldemort.
