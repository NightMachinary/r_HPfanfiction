linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other by Stargon1) is a fairly humorous one-shot.

linkao3(A History of Magic by PrinceEdwin) is a short-ish (8 chapters, 40k words) Snarry -- imo, one of the only good Snarry fics out there

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpoint) is hands-down one of the best short fics I've read.

Hopefully some of these are new to you!
