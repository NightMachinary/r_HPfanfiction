Upon a second perusual, I found you a couple more to try:

linkffn(In Care Of by Fang's Fawn) -- read this a while go; liked it enough to favorite it

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) -- slow updates, but fabulously written! for some reason the bot didn't want to upload the link, but the fic should pop up if you google search it

linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake) -- closer to the 50k mark, not sure if that's too long for you or not. It's a WIP with regular-ish updates, and a really interesting AU

linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) -- because what sort of writer would I be without promoting my own work :) it's a Slytherin!Hermione fic, and it can also be found on ao3 if you prefer to read there
