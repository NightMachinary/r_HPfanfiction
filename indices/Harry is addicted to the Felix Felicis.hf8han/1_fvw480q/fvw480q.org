I cannot for the life of me find the fic, despite having read it a few days ago - but there's a time travel fic where Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville are thrown into the past. They go on a rescue mission to retrieve Luna and Neville from a castle with death eaters in and Harry is off his rocker due to the addiction.

I've added the spoiler in case it jolts anyone else's minds. I think it's likely to be on ffn because I can't see it in my Ao3 history. It's a WIP and possibly abandoned.
