I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12704985/1/They-re-Hiding-Inside-Me][They're Hiding Inside Me]] for a great Marauder's fic that has a few moments of very sweet wolfstar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789035/1/The-Age-of-Lies][The Age of Lies]] is by the same author, and is about the fallout between Sirius and Remus when their relationship ends and they both begin to suspect the other is a spy. Has a sweet ending.
