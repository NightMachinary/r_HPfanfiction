If Harry thought that Professor Snape had disliked him a few minutes ago, he knew that he was truly hated the moment he pulled his cauldron from under the desk and set it down to brew. Dark eyes glittered from behind the greasy curtains of his hair like a dangerous beast glaring out of a cave, and the hiss made even Draco Malfoy wince and try to shrink himself smaller, as Snape stalked forward and loomed over Harry. A vein was twitching at Snape's forehead, and then the next word was scarily quiet.\\
"Potter."\\
"Sir?"\\
Harry knew that tone. It was the quiet that wasn't solved by mere shouting and a rough trip to the cupboard. He began to feel actually afraid. The classroom was so quiet, he could have heard a pin drop. Snape was absolutely still, other than his lips silently shaping the numbers one to ten, and his white-knuckled hand carefully pointing his wand, in jerky movements, down to the floor.\\
"I see that the Potter fortune was not diminished by your father's death, Potter," Snape said, in an almost pleasant tone. "How gratifying for you. And you have decided, in your infinite wisdom, to buy a solid gold cauldron and to attempt to brew a Cure for Boils Potion in it."\\
Harry swallowed. Perhaps this wouldn't be too bad. They had rules at school, didn't they? There would be shouting, Harry would lose points, but that all seemed inconsequential compared to the look Snape had given, and the way his hand had seemed to fight to point away from Harry's throat.\\
Snape turned away and moved back to the front. "Those of you who wish to hold onto your skin, move two desks away from Potter. Not you, Longbottom. We might as well kill two birds with one stone. Since you've spent so much, brought such a wonderful cauldron to show off to us all, let's see how skilled this progidy... this wonder of a wizard is, shall we?" He was looking at the Slytherins and gestured Crabbe a little further away.\\
Ron looked petrified, but he stayed close by.\\
"On your head be it," said Snape, his voice oily. "We have too many Weasleys in the school anyway."\\
Draco snickered. Harry noticed he had moved so far to the front that he was almost behind Professor Snape's desk, but Snape didn' seem to mind.\\
"You can borrow my cauldron," Ron said, pushing his rather battered-looking cauldron forward.\\
"Oh no, Weasley," said Snape. "Potter wants to show us what he can do, and we will let him." He smiled a horrible smile that didn't fit his face at all and slashed his wand at a point behind his back, so viciously that everyone ducked.\\
"The instructions are on the board," said Snape. "You have an hour left."
