Maybe the gold cauldrons are needed because it evenly distributes the gold over time, whereas dropping the coins in would have it settle down at the bottom and probably leave little clumps of gold at the bottom that wouldn't dissolve in time. Or even a single coin would be too much gold for a potion, and it only shaves off enough gold from the cauldron to equal the same amount as half a teaspoon.
