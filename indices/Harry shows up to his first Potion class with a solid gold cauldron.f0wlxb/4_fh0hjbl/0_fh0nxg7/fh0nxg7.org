If that were the case,it'd probably be easier to use a regular cauldron and drop in a couple of gold coins.

I'd suggest it's the opposite - some exotic potions in their partially-made state are so viciously caustic they dissolve right through the metal of regular cauldron. Only gold has the chemical (or magical) properties to resist this attack. As the potion is completed, it's properties change and it becomes safe to drink.

As gold cauldrons are never mentioned again (even Malfoy doesn't own one), it's possible they're specialist equipment that's only occasionally needed by highly experienced, professional potioneers doing very advanced work.
