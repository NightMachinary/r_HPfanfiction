I like to imagine that Gold Cauldrons are only used for making specific potions. Like Felix Felicis. That may be where the potion gets its gold tint from. It dissolves layers of the cauldron as it brews, incorporating it into the potion over time. Of course this would lead to the need for replacement cauldrons, but that could be a side note of the whole Cauldron Bottom Thickness thing that Percy was going on about in the 4th book. Maybe normally Gold Cauldrons are purposely made rather thick to allow more usage, but cauldron crafters purposely make them thin so you can probably get like 4 or 5 uses out of it before you gotta get a new one
