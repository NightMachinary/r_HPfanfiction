“Mr Potter. Our new class.... idiot. Tell me, Mr Potter,” drawled Snape with a flick of his greasy hair, “what would you get if you brewed wormwood and asphodel in a golden cauldron?”

Harry shook his head meekly. “I don't know, sir.”

Snape sneered. "And if you were to mix ash wood and doxy eggs?”

Again, Harry didn't know.

“I think Hermione has the answer, Professor.”

“Well, Mr Potter," said Snape, ignoring Hermione bouncing in her seat with her hand raised, "If you had any sense and did not rely on your wealth and celebrity, you would know that a golden cauldron is used primarily as decoration, for the less cultured wizards who can't cook porridge let alone a potion."

Harry glanced to Malfoy whose smug face dropped slightly, though he sniggered to Pansy Parkinson next to him.

Harry nudged his cauldron away and offered it to Ron who stowed it away in his bag eagerly, as Hermione scolded him under her breath that he hadn't properly read the school requirements list.
