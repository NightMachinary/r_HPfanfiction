... It would make sense that the Unspeakables would be put in charge of guarding the Ministry's Magical Intelligence assets, but that only those 'with a pure heart' or special dispensation from the DOM head could access the controls of the system. Since the Death Eaters are too busy reforming to even attempt to breach the security system, they elect to manipulate a pure-hearted soul into breaching security for them. And it just so happens that Voldemort has a direct link into just such a soul's mind...

ED: Note that 'pure heart' is a generic idiom. You can replace it with virtually anything related to Harry (like a back door built in by the wardmaster-a Potter-that would allow family members to force the security system into maintenance mode) and it could still work. Also note that magical Intelligence can refer to anything from details of the country's various spies, a Nationwide Ministry Wards For Dummies grimoire collection, actual magical weapons that can level mountains with a simple word, fucking Excalibur-anything even vaguely related to the term 'important Ministry assets-handle with care, do not drop the box' will do, the more powerful/dangerous, the better.
