There are just way too many better plot devices than the overused prophecy thing.

For example, Voldemort needed magical children born at the end of July for some kind of ritual. Snape could have given him the idea in the first place, only later to realize what he had done.

Or the Potters could have gotten some important stuff that could pose serious threat to Voldemort (such as render its owner certain immunity against Voldemort). Voldemort attacked, the Potters were cornered, James gave it to Lily, but Lily injected the item into Harry's blood stream. Later, Voldemort bypassed part of that protection by using Harry's blood in his resurrection. But taking Harry's blood also turned Voldemort's horcrux in Harry vulnerable.

Because HP is a fantasy series, the options are virtually limitless.
