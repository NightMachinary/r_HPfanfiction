Or change the wording of the prophecy to better suit your story. Or have Harry find out that the prophecy was falsified. Or misinterpreted. Or easy to circumvent. Or if you really want to so no prophecy, have Harry's parents do something that really makes the Dark Lord want to kill them. Maybe Harry wasn't the target at all, killing him was an efficient way to wipe out the Potter line. Or maybe it's the Potter line itself, that the family is somehow in the way of the Dark Lord's plans. Without knowing where the story is going, it's hard to know what actions will get you there. Lol.
