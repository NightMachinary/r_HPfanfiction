Without the prophecy, setting up Harry vs. the Villain might be driven by the main characters. So Harry or one of his friends decides to make Voldemort's defeat a personal goal for various reasons. Killing a main character off could provide impetus but that could get angsty (Forging the Sword does it right, Tears of a Veela not so much IMO).

Actually, now that I think of it, there's very little reason for a bunch of kids/teens to target the Dark Lord. It's suicidal for even the average person. So extreme circumstances aren't necessary but they're the easy way out. Prophecy, noble birth, magical power, mental unbalances, etc. Most stories give their main character a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage to force the conflict.

Or you could ignore Voldemort and have a fun magical school adventure in the vein of the first three books. That might actually be more interesting. Voldemort is a clich√©d villain that forces the end result of the story to pass through at least some form of horrible war (not to mention an inevitable Horcrux hunt). For example, Prisoner of Azkaban was an amazing book, and it had very little mention of Riddle.

With regards to why Voldemort targeted Harry on Halloween 1981: it doesn't have to have a special reason. Voldemort was a pretty bad dude; maybe he just killed the Potters because it was fun, not because of a prophecy. Or maybe Voldemort needed a bunch of babies for a crazy dark ritual.
