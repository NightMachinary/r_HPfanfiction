There are tons of alternatives to prophecy that can be used to much the same effect.

Terry Pratchett's theory of narrative causality can be easily used as a substitute-where a boy survives a direct attack by an evil wizard, then he's virtually guaranteed to become the hero that slays said evil wizard.

Hell, it'd also more than adequately explain the /laissez-faire/ approach adopted by the greater wizarding world-only one-in-a-million chances of success are guaranteed to work when a Story comes into effect, therefore any help lent in the hero's quest would negatively impact the chances of said hero saving the day. In order to guarantee success, the heroes have to discover the truth and fight by themselves.

Dumbledore is bound by the demands of the narrative here-he has to fit the all-wise and knowing mentor to as great a degree as he possibly can to guarantee that he remains within the narrative. Though bound by it, his position will be an influential one in the story, a position he can use to manipulate the outcomes for the better.

Similarly, the entire wizarding community has an inkling that this stereotype exists and know what roles they have to play. It explains why Malfoy senior acts like an idiot-he has to in order to not end up converted to the light side, a move virtually guaranteed to kill him & his family when the Dark Lord inevitably returns. It also helps explain Draco's actions in book six too-the reluctant villain, after all, features heavily in such stories and is also virtually guaranteed to survive all confrontations right up until the end. The fugitive, on the other hand, would have no choice but to team up with the hero and die heroically battling against his father at the end, thereby banishing any doubts as to his final alignment.

Snape as the repentant spymaster for the light is a good example of this.

Hermione and Ron fit well into the plucky side-kick roles, which again keeps them alive throughout the drama.

Being trapped in Hogwarts in year seven, Neville's idea to found La Resistance sees all but a handful of background characters (who die screaming horribly whilst being tortured by Nazi-lite sadists-a necessary sacrifice for a La Resistance story group) survive until the Hero's return.

See, they have lived through such events before-unbeatable Dark Lords with a penchant for mass murder are pretty common in the magical world. So, when you have a large subsection of the population of ultra-powerful causality breakers all wish that the Hero would come forth and save them all, what do you get?

A Hero that will come forth and save them all.

The Price is that a Hero comes with a story attached. No story, no mysterious & painful past, no Hero and the Dark Lord of the day wins by default.

This is not something muggleborns or half-bloods with minor ties to the wizarding world are ever told, mostly since most of them would either dismiss it as rubbish or find a way to hack themselves into the role they desire-if they aren't central to how the Story itself unfolds.

Which is what Tom Riddle (probably) tried to do-become a Hero and get the keys to the realm-and failed spectacularly.

Only the purebloods know of this happening in their world. They attempt to mask it by upholding divination as something other than complete bullshit, but it's there when you scratch the surface.

And so, in the face of a Hero coming to be, they assume the roles they want and hope that this is the Bulfinch's mythology kind of heroic adventure rather than the Robert E Howard kind of hero that'll save them in their Darkest Hour Of Need.

Harry Potter and co are, of course, completely clueless as to this. The only one that could possibly know and would be close enough to tell them would be Ron-if his parents ever deemed him to be old enough/intelligent enough to know and not tell the Hero and his bushy-haired sounding board/2IC/sister-possibly-upgradable-to-main-love-interest figure BEFORE the end of the Story because, if Harry knew, it would be a disaster.
