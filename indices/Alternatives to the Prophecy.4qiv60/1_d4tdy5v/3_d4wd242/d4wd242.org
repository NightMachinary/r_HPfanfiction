Without the prophecy, there's no reason for Voldemort to offer to spare Lily, so her protection wouldn't have worked on Harry. Which either means Harry dies, or he doesn't want to kill Harry at all. Either way, Voldemort is still around and kicking, and the story is fundamentally altered.

Sure, you could invent a new reason for Voldemort to want to kill Harry and spare Lily. But it'd be a tough sell, and you certainly couldn't get there just by removing it.
