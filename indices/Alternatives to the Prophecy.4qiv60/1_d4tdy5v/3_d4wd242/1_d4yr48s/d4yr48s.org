Unless Lily's very existence is a key propaganda tool in Death Eater recruitment; the know-it-all mudblood social climber that seduced the heir of a pureblood house, conspired to ensnare the heir of House Black with fake sympathy & false promises, pissed all over her friendship with one of the most promising Prince members to be born in generations over a minor quibble and then joined a group dedicated to eradicating those brave enough to stand up for the traditions and legacy of Magical Britain.

About the only other HP character I know of that would qualify as premium-grade Death Eater propaganda fodder to that degree would be Hermione Granger.
