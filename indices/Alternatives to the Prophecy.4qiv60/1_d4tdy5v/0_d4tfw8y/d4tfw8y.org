But the DoM not happening would have fallout. Sirius wouldn't die, for one, which gives you the chance to write a whole new storyline with him (there's really only so long you can expect him to continue living in Grimmauld Place without saying fuck it and leaving or going completely off the reservation and/or killing himself) and his being alive is going to give him chance to influence Harry's opinions and actions. Voldemort's return isn't going to become public knowledge, so all the shit from 5th Year is going to continue and the battle against Voldemort will be harder. The escaped Death Eaters are still running loose, able to cause havoc.

Voldemort would still want Dumbledore dead, but without Lucius getting arrested at the MoM, Voldemort isn't likely to task Draco with the murder, which means there's not going the be the Hogwarts battle at the end of 6th Year. If things go down differently with Dumbledore's death, that could have repercussions for the events of 7th Year--or even 6th, if the new assassin kills him sooner than Draco+Snape managed too. If Snape doesn't do the kill, how does that change his place as Voldemort's favourite? Would he still end up headmaster?

Also without that battle, Bill Weasley doesn't get semi-werewolfed, Fleur doesn't give a heartfelt declaration of love in front of Tonks and Lupin, so they might not get together (and that relationship might be affected by Sirius being alive and his approval, especially if you happen to ship SB/RL as well as RL/NT) and then Teddy might not exist.

If there's no prophecy, then Harry isn't the Chosen One, he's just a kid who wants vengeance, and Dumbledore might be less compelled to teach him about Riddle's past because he doesn't want to put this task on the shoulders of a kid. Harry might also feel less pressure to be the one to defeat Voldemort--he'd still want him dead, but he might feel more willing to leave it to the adults (at least until he realises they're useless, if you write it that way). What happens if Dumbledore dies without telling anyone about the Horcruxes, or if he tells someone other than Harry?

There's probably more than I'm not thinking off, but basically it's not possible to remove an event like the DoM and expect things to still fallout exactly as they did in canon.
