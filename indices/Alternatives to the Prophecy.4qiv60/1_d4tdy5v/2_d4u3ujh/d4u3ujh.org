DoM could still happen. Voldemort would just be after some artifact, classified research, or sensitive intelligence info that could only be retrieved by either Harry or the dark lord.

Voldemort would originally go after the Potters for similar reasons, such as using the two children born at the end of July for a ritual. Maybe Snape gave him that idea in the first place, and became horrified later on. Then after his defeat, he became obsessed with defeating Harry.
