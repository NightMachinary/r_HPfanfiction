I mean, sure, if you want to make up random contrived plot devices so all the same stuff happens, go right ahead. Like, seriously, classified research or sensitive intelligence that can only be retrieved by Harry or Voldemort? lol.

Voldemort can perfectly reasonably go after the Potters without the prophecy. They are enemy combatants that had defied him multiple times and gotten away with it. That's enough of a reason for a Dark Lord to go after them - several order families had already been wiped out by that point, so it's not unreasonable to think he would go after the Potters as well.
