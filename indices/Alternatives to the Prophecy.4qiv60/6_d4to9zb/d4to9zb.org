Voldemort is quite egotistical. It would not be a far stretch to have him targeting Harry solely because Harry defeated him once as a baby. (The reason Voldemort went after the Potters in the first place could easily just be because they were strong enemies.) It would be interesting to read a Voldemort that doesn't need to kill Harry and doesn't fear him/prophesied death... he just wants to destroy him for simple revenge.
