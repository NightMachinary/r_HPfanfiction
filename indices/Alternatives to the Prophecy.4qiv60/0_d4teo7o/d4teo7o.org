An alternative to the prophesy might be that Harry is actually a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, through his mothers line. This mirrors Riddle in a nice way.

It is established in cannon that Voldemort wishes to be unique, he rejects the common name Tom etc etc. So when he finds out a mudblood (Lily Evens) is also a descendant and with child, he moves to destroy her and make sure that he is the only living heir, after all he is immortal, so Salazar's line will exist forever.

As to why Dumbledore didn't tell an eleven year old that he was the only one who had a chance at defeating a wizard so powerful that others still feared to speak his name, a dark wizard who had killed 'some of best wizards and witches of the age, a dark wizard who would always seek Harry's destruction, a dark wizard who cheated death itself...

You tell an eleven year old all that! What kind of sociopath would put that kind of pressure on a child?

Voldemort targets Harry in OotP because he is the child of prophecy, to which Voldemort has been a victim. He also suspects that Dumbledore and Harry have a closer relationship and tries to posses Harry while in Dumblefore's presence to tempt Albus into killing Harry in the hopes that Voldemort would die too. Remember when Riddle possesses Harry at the Ministry? "Kill me now, Dumbledore".

Voldemort's main goal in OotP is to hear and understand the prophecy, toying with Potter and Albus is a fun, twisted side project for him.
