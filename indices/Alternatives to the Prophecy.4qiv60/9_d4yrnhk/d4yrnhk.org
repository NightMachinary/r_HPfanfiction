The Minsitry of Magic think tanks have children go over their plans looking for flaws so obvious everyone missed them. This has caused more than one cunning plan from the Forces of Evil to fail. Voldemort set out to ensure that only his followers' children would be available to go over said plans, allowing him direct insight into the Ministry's actions. The Potters were his first stop.
