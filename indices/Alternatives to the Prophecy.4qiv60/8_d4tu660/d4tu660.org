If you ignore canon past GoF, you don't just need a different reason for Voldemort going after the Potters. You need a different way of Voldemort gaining immortality, or a reason for why he'd lay low for 13 years if his body wasn't destroyed. Horcruxes, the prophecy and the Hallows are three major driving factors from which the story originates. If you throw them all out, that's one hell of an AU you're creating.
