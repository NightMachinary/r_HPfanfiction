I'm reading Prince of the dark kingdom right now and it's nice, but my god it's full of spelling mistakes, words missing and whatever. It's infuriating. Like Diagon alley written Daigon alley, Durmstrang written Durmstang. Etc... It seems like the author never did a re read. It would really benefit an update.
