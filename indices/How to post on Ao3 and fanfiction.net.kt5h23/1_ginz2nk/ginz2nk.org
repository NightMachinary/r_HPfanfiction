You need to wait till AO3 sends you an email with an invite I think.

Ffnet is annoying to post on. It's a two step process, which I find really frustrating, and you need to be careful to make sure there isn't any formatting on your text as it always fucks up and turns out unreadable

as the other commenter said it's probably best to search for a tutorial, because there are a few good ones

Good luck posting!
