I would recommend not spamming the sub. You're not likely to get more responses, and the mods are quite likely to get irritated with you and remove your posts anyway.

Have you looked up tutorials on how to post to either site? Both, I believe, have instructions on how it works available somewhere.

For example:

FFNet - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10057482/1/How-to-Publish-a-Story]]

AO3 - [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-posting-a-work-on-ao3?language_id=en]]

Also, it takes time for things to be processed, so you're not going to be instantly on the list. Give it a day or two and then try again.
