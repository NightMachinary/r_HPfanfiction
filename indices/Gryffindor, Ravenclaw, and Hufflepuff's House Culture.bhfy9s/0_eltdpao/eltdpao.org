linkffn(The Ravenclaw Chronicles by ivorynightfall) has a Ravenclaw!Hermione and portrays Ravenclaw as a site of constant academic competition, with students forming study groups and being very selective and strategic about whom they let in, to make sure everyone pulls their own weight.

​

One bit of my headcanon Ravenclaw culture I would like to see in a fic is something along the lines of Hermione being sorted there, acting not very differently from early canon. Then, about a week or two into the year, one of her roommates asks for her opinion about some fashion decision. That sort of thing happens more than once, to the point of Hermione being a bit puzzled by it.

It turns out that in Ravenclaw culture, Hermione-grade academic success puts one at the top of the pecking order, and asking someone for advice is a way of showing respect and deference.

​

I can also imagine Ravenclaws trying to out-know-it-all each other.
