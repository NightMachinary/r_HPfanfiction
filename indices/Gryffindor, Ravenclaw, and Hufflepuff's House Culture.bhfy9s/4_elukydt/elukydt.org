- Harry potter in the claw of the raven. linkao3(10889381) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/338101][Full series here]]\\

This goes into greater depth about the study culture in Ravenclaw, such as how the tower's own library works (while being a student there, you can create a copy of one of your more unique books and place it on the shelves for everyone to read). Trigger Warning: good goblins, Lord Harry, pure-blood culture, bow and scrape oh my. In other news, Flitwick is a BAMF.

Note: There are a lot of things that the community dislikes in the previous fic, but it's well written and an enjoyable fluffy-time read nonetheless.

- The Eagle's Nest. linkao3(33410025)\\

An 8th year dramione fic, everyone gets resorted. Explores the idea that founders other than just Slytherin left secret rooms: we see Ravenclaw's and Hufflepuff's. Ravenclaw also has a tradition about leaving behind a book in their massive library when they graduate. Heavy on Alchemy. I have some mixed feelings about this fic personally.

- The Best Revenge. linkffn(4912291)

Hufflepuff culture. Mentoring, 'Council of the Sett', talent shows... It takes quite a while to actually get to school though. There's a bit about Ravenclaw in there as well, primarily hazing. This is a two part story, the second being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5843959/1/The-Best-Revenge-Time-of-the-Basilisk][here]] - I'm a /huge/ fan of the way she resolved the Chamber of Secrets storyline.
