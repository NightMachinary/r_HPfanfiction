linkffn(The Tinkerer) has some stuff for Hufflepuff that maybe counts; it's been a minute since I read it. Though what I'm thinking of is mostly peripheral, I thought it was pretty neat and enriched the story. Incomplete and likely abandoned, but an entertaining read nonetheless.

(Also, I can personally recall all the example fics you cited, so it's probably time for me to step away from fic for a bit. ðŸ˜‚ Maybe after the next Pureblood Pretense update.)
