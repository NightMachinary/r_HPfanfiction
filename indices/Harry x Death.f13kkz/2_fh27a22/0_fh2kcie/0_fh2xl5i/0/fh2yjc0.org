Tags doesnt say anything about death beeing male. Story is tagged as m/m but that could just be the wolfstar pairing. Nothing else indicates maledeath, snape apologist, or the wierd early story hints that gives the vibe that Harry wants to turn voldemort into tom riddle, because tom was charismatic? That said the story is very well written, and if i was into slash im sure i would love the story. Just too much fluff-slash for my tastes
