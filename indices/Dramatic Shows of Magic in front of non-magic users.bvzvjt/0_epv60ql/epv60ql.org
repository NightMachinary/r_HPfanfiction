Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

Harry is driving home with Vernon when he's confronted by a resurrected /Ringmort/, Crouch Jr, several Death Eaters and an army of Inferi. Harry destroys them all by unleashing Fiendfyre and then rips apart the souls of Ringmort and Crouch Jr. Chapters 13 & 14, I think.
