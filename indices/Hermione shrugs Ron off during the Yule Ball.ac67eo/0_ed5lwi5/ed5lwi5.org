I'm writing a fic (sadly none of it is published - yet!) where both Hermione and Ron have the hots for Fleur, and when Ron's puzzled over the whole 'going to the ball with Krum' thing ("what are you doing coming to the ball with him? didn't you tell us you were gay? he's spying on Harry for sure!"), she reminds him of this fact, thus deescalating the argument pretty much instantly.
