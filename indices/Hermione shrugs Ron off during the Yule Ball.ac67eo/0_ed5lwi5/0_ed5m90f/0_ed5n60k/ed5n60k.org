She panicked and said yes as a knee jerk reaction when he asked her (she's kind of a closeted baby gay in fourth year, but gets a girlfriend in fifth year). Immediately afterwards, there's an exchange with Ginny, which goes something like this:

/[...]/

/With determined steps, she strode up to Gryffindor tower, and spotting Ginny, she grabbed her without stopping, and dragged her into her room./

/Ginny, I need your help. - she said as she shut the door/

/I'm not going to the ball with you, Hermione - Ginny said with a raised eyebrow./

/Hermione shook her head to dismiss the notion and laughed nervously - It's not that. Someone asked me. And I said yes./

/Well, that's wonderful! Good for you, do I know her?/

/It's Viktor Krum./

/He's not a girl, last time I checked - Ginny deadpanned/

/Hermione shot her a nasty look./

/Okay, okay. So it's Viktor Krum. Oh, the boys will have a fit! I bet Ron would have gone with him, if he'd asked./

/But what do I do?/

/Well, you just go to the ball and not kiss him. Make it clear you just want to have a fun evening and be friends. He's only here for a couple of months anyway. And he's a celebrity. He'll probably roll with it. Did he want to go to Hogsmeade with you before that, or something?/

/Well, no./

/There you have it./

/Well, when you put it like that... okay./
