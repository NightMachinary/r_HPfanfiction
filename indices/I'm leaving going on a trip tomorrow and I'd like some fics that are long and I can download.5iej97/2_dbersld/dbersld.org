The Broken Victory by Kate Lynn This is about a young Tom Riddles life and what turned him into the evil wizard that we all know. Very well done and amazing. I hate first person fanfics. I loved this one!

Camera do by MillieJoan This is a SS/HG fic. Snape has to teach Hermione to Occlude in the hopes Harry will actually pick it up this time when she teaches him. Mostly canon. My fav fic of this pairing (virtually zero fluff except a couple wayyyy later and they are brief)
