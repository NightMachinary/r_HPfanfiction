Use [[http://ficsave.xyz]] or the Fanfiction.net Android App to save any fanfic. Pocket works otherwise.

Let me just list non-HP fics first that are clever like Worm:

- Anything on [[/r/rational]]
- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] - God is real, the universe machine is breaking, and you use God's many names to invoke magic. Many names have copyright protection. Ongoing.
- linkfp(2961893) - [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] - Use Ficsave.xyz here. Zorian lives in a highly detailed magic world, and when an attack happens at the end of his third year of school, he realizes he's in a time loop. Ongoing.
- [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/summary/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] - (I'm not caught up, so my terminology might be off) This is more medieval, and few people have magic -- it's more of a superhero thing. The "Superheros" are those who are named. Those who are named have power, but Catherine is offered a villain name, even though she wants to do good. Problem is, the line between the two is blurrier than you think. Ongoing

Download all of them, cause summaries are bad. With lists like these, you don't realize how good every single one of them is, considering how much I read.

That's especially true with HP fics.

- linkffn(11574569) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]]\\
  Just finished book 2 and is going on hiatus. It seems cliched, but its comedy is fantastic and it uses the tropes to create a powerful, but not overpowered Harry who actually faces challenges that could very potentially fuck him over. On Hiatus/Ongoing.
- [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - There is an ebook on the site.\\
  Petunia married someone else and so Harry is a scientist. The story is a bit rough for the first 5 chapters, being somewhat cliched, but it gets a lot better. It's definitely AU. It sets out to solve all plot points in the first year, but it simplifies things. Magic works a bit differently (impermanent transfiguration, Horcruxes) and Sirius Black is actually guilty (If he wasn't, this would have been much more interesting). This is the best Quirrelmort. Thematically it's a lot different than HP in general. HP preaches an acceptance of death, while this is firmly against death and loves life. Tropes are largely justified, and it has the coolest mock-battles. From [[/r/rational]]. Complete.
- linkffn(3401052) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]\\
  Makes up for the lack of Sirius in HPMOR. The Veil is actually a portal to an AU that was frozen and Harry falls through it a couple months after he reactivates it. He goes to a world where AU!Sirius and AU!Harry are dead and Voldemort is a low-level terrorist, curtailed by a mysterious black figure, known as "That Fucker". The one and only pair of Lords, the Lords Black, cause chaos in the new world connecting with the people who wear their friends' faces. Take down Voldemort, deal with James Potter, steal from death eaters, spice up everyone's lives, and fuck witches (somehow making their lives better at the same time). A Masterpiece of fiction. Complete.
- linkffn(10070079; 11463030) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]]\\
  Make Hermione a Math Genius instead of Rule Follower and let the sparks fly! Centered around Hermione, it mirrors the plot of the original books while going hardcore into spell crafting. Thus, it's not a tragedy. There's still lots of tension while Hermione solves all of Harry's problems (Basilisk-proof glasses anyone?). The author has another complete/ongoing fic but this one is much better. Complete and Ongoing.
- linkffn(10937871) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]\\
  The Killing Curse caused Harry to go blind instead, so Harry can't go to Hogwarts. With no Harry, the worst happens: Hermione drops out, Ginny dies, everyone loses hope. Harry's curse is also a gift, he has Mage Sight and uses it to compensate. He gains an unparalleled level of skill with magic as he meets Hermione at his disability school, defeats Voldemort (minor issue that), revolutionizes magic civil rights (house elves, werewolves, and even vampires!), and unravels the secrets of the deathly hallows. Ongoing.
- linkffn(9036071) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]]\\
  This is /the/ fic about muggles fighting wizards. Harry is dumped by the Dursleys and is found by a small group trying to find more about Wizards. With a tattoo of Steel Wings turned magical, Mr. Steel introduces Harry to a book about Blood Magic he found so Harry can defend the group once he gets reintroduced to the Wizarding World. Harry, who might not be considered Human anymore, must hide his secrets as the war between muggles and wizards reaches a tipping point and the Statute breaks as he searches for a peaceful solution. On Hiatus until Blindness finishes.

FIRST: Download every one. I have */many, many/* more recommendations, so I haven't even listed all of my favorite favorites. Even if you think you won't like it, try it. I have many more, but it's ass to remember them all. Go to my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Egreen0photon][favorites]] to see all I've read.

SECOND: PM me if you want more fics. I used to think crossovers are shit, but there are a few well written ones (LoTR, Star Wars, Dresden Files). I love those crossovers, and I know nearly nothing about LoTR and Star Wars, and nothing about Dresden. Tell me if you want them.

THIRD: All I've listed are ones that are complete or ongoing. Those on hiatus I firmly believe will come off hiatus. There are many good ones that I believe will stay on hiatus, but who knows. Ask me if you want them, or read my Favorites.

FOURTH: On my profile, click updated. The ones that have been updated in the last month are highly likely going to update again, but I have little hope beyond August. I am afraid of fics like "The All New Adventures of Hermione Granger in ... the Chance of a Lifetime" not updating again, which is one reason why I didn't list it earlier. Fantastic time travel without rehashing original plot.

FIFTH: Nearly everything recently updated on that list is worth reading. Fics further down might not have such high quality.

TL;DR: *Download every fic I mentioned, because they're all awesome. Ask me for more if you want. I have fantastic crossovers, too. Everything on my favorite's that updated within the last few months are worth reading. Use Ficsave.xyz*

That took way too much time. Good luck!

--------------

Edit: Just writing names if those don't look interesting, although I do suggest you try them:

Within the Last Month or So (AKA yay still updating):\\
The Shadow of Angmar, Innocent Series, Harry Potter and the Game, Champion, Trolling the Toad, The Reclamation of Black Magic, Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly, The Art of Self-Fashioning, Accidental Animagus/Animagus at War, Barefoot, The Havoc Side of the Force, Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux, Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance, Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation.

Within the Last Couple of Months (AKA update update update update come on!):\\
Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous, Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, Reign of the Serpent, Core Threads, The All New..., The Evil Overlord List, Parsel, Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/The Handbook of Elf Psychology (Complete), Harry Potter and the Metamorph (Complete), The Amplitude Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond, Back to the Beginning, Potter vs Paradox.

Last Year or Earlier (Probably not going to update): The Sum of Their Parts (Complete), Harry Potter and the Wastelands/Heartlands of Time (Complete), 0800-Rent-A-Hero, Backward with Purpose (Complete unfinished epilogue), Revenge of the Wizard (Complete), The Hogwarts Strike Team, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, Harry Potter and the Children of Change, One Hundred and Sixty Nine (Complete), Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Harry Mewter (complete), Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is (Complete), George Weasley and the Computational Error (Complete), Hail Odysseus (Complete), The One He Feared, Harry Potter and the Witch Queen, Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar (Complete), Prince of the Dark Kingdom, One Misfired Spell Later (Complete), Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina (Complete), Delenda Est (Complete), Error of Soul, The Well Groomed Mind, Ectomancer, The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig (Complete kinda), Xerosis (Complete), The Weapon Revised! (Complete), Lord of Caer Azkaban (Complete), Alexandra Quick (4 Book Complete, Not sure if more, doesn't have anything to do with HP but in HP universe), Wit of the Raven, Oh God Not Again! (Complete), Luna's Hubby (Complete), Mastermind Hunting (Complete), Dangerverse Series (Complete).

I would recommend you read anything under complete. There are MANY good ones that aren't completed, but it's mostly just sad that they aren't (Prince of the Dark Kingdom is over 1M) and many of them have good ideas (With of the Raven, Ectomancer, Error of Soul, The One He Feared, etc. so all of them).

NOTE: I skimmed my favorites list and definitely missed a few. There are definitely more great ones. You can probably tell based on the title if it's a crossover. On that note: The Denarian Renegade and its sequels wasn't in the list! See, I'm missing some. Oh well.
