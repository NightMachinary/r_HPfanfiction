No ETA on it as I'm just working on it occasionally in my free time, which is a lot less these days. But I think there really needs to be a better tool for finding and recommending fics. Wikis are terrible for this kind of thing, fics are scattered on various sites across the web and the search tools provided on even the big sites like FFN and AO3 are kinda deficient in my opinion.
