Yeah, as vast as A03 seems to be, it's really hard to find the kind of fics you want. Every time I try to search for something, it involves something I don't particularly like -- like slash, for example, and searching "no slash" usually only brings up a lot less results, at least in my experience. It's a pretty good database for quality work, but yeah. I like the tags well enogh, but some people just make up tags instead of using existing ones, which complicates things.

And I am not going to lie, I don't understand the whol "chose not to use warnings," and then in the tags, they'll have "explicit," "slash," or "extreme violence." Not that there's anything wrong with this, but just as an example.
