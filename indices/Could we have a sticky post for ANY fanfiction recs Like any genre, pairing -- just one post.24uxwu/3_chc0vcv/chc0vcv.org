I don't see the need. There are plenty of sites out there than have recommendation lists. TV Tropes and the HPFF wiki are two examples that are already linked to in the sidebar. Fanfiction C2s (communities) are another example.

If we have an official thread where recommendations are supposed to be placed, then a) Theres no easy way to see if there are new recommendations available. b) people will be less likely to add recommendations in normal posts because they're supposed to go in the recommendation thread.

Really, I don't actually see a problem in having the same author or story being recommended multiple times. If you don't know what story to start from an author, then ask that question. Having active discussions is much better than having a thread that's going to go mostly static after the first set of recommendations are added.
