I actually like seeing the requests for fics. Sometimes they're interesting and I get something new to read. Sometimes it's fun when you know the exact fic they're talking about and you can help them. Maybe the mods could do that thing where you can filter a sub by tabs like in [[/r/wheredidthesodago]].
