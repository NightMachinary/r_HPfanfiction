Will you post a link in this subreddit to the finished product of Not From Others when it's released?

Do you have or try to get permission from authors to record their works?

I think doing the top 5 fics from this list would be great :) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/]]

I would love to help out again from a voice or technical side of things, I want to get more involved in fandom stuff again but don't have anymore plot bunnies running around at the moment to write.
