To be honest, I think it's a great idea. My friend is blind and we can't afford a lot of fancy software or readers that don't sound robotic, so I read fanfics to her a lot but I have a bit of an impediment that gets annoying. It'd be nice to just enjoy time with her while she listens to somebody else. haha
