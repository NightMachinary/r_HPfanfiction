The VoiceDream app is also available for Android devices. In my experience, the British Ivona voices (it comes with default voices, but you can buy dozens more from third-party vendors inside the app - different languages, different accents, etc.) are the least robotic. They are so good, it's easy to forget they aren't real!

VD also has tools to grab web pages and have them read back, which you might find useful.
