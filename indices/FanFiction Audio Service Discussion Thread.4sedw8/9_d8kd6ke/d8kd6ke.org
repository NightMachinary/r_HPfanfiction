I'd love to listen to some of these, if not all! I'm not blind or with any sort of disability than prevents me from reading, (other than my eyes hurting...), but I think there's some unique experiance to be had from listening to your favourite stories. I'm also thinking that I really dont mind having the chapters just 'read', as in with no variation for characters' voices. But you're doing this which is all hte more amazing. Though if this does drain your energy and resources then please think about my idea; you potentially get a lot more fics done this way. But please update me on how everythings going for you all.
