The problem is that some authors tag everything that was even vaguely mentioned. As a result, the same fics pop up again and again no matter what you are searching for. In many cases, it can be difficult to search for a particular fandom at all because half the fics tagged with it are massive crossovers that are primarily a different fandom and barely mention the one I'm looking for. I much prefer the way that FFN makes you pick the one or two fandoms and short list of main characters.

I should note that I am usually sorting by kudos or favorites rather than anything else. It means that there are some fics that inevitably end up on the top of my search no matter what I am looking for because they had moderate success in a major fandom and now drown out everything else.
