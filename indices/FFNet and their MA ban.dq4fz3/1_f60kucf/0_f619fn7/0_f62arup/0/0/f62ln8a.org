Ah. I use filters to avoid the fics that pop up over and over, and I filter out crossovers cuz I'm usually not into them. If I'm finding myself annoyed by a specific fic, I just pick a tag on the fic that keeps popping up and add it to the "exclude" list on the filter options.

I guess I just don't have the same issues. Maybe it's because I'm usually searching for specific scenarios instead of pairings.

I can't stand FFnet's lack of search options. I feel like I have to wade through acres of crap to find a story that interests me, usually because I have to actually click on the fic and read through a bit to find out if it's actually what I'm looking for.
