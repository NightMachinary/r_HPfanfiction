Prior to filtering becoming a feature I would do it manually by adding my own filter to the URL, but I'm probably a slightly weird person for doing that. I also like applying more sorting to find something I want since I don't have as much time to read fic as I used to, so it cuts down on my search time.

But yeah, it might just be because we're just looking for different things. If I want to read Vampire Harry, I can click on the tag for it, whereas FFnet will give me a million stories that just mention a vampire. Characters would almost certainly be messier simply because of the flexibility in tagging.

Another issue I have with FFnet is that they really borked some of the formatting on older fics during one of their updates, and they never fixed it. (It's why you sometimes come across fics that are a wall of text, or find one that's completely underlined. I'm not sure when that update happened, but there are fics that I read in 2006 that were fine, and now their formatting is screwed.)

Separating major and minor tags would be awesome. I tend to only tag major things, so I wouldn't even have to re-tag my fics all that much.
