I mostly read crossovers, so filtering them out doesn't work for me. Maybe I've just got to get better at excluding stuff. For a while, that wasn't an option and I haven't fully explored what it can do. I'm also usually searching for settings or particular characters, not pairings or scenarios.

That is exactly what I feel about AO3. Part of that might be a difference in what type of fics get posted, but on FFN I can select a fandom and a character and I know that both will be major aspects of anything that comes up. The same isn't true of AO3 and it requires more sorting to get what I want.

I think it could be solved if AO3 separated major tags from minor tags. If there was a limit of major tags for a story, you could search for them when you are interested in something that forms a central aspect to the story while still being able to search minor tags for anything that even mentions the aspect you are looking for.
