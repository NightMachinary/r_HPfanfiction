What is the problem with the tags? I've been using Ao3 since the beginning and I love the tags for searching.

I'm not trying to be a smartass or anything; I've just never heard that criticism before and I'm genuinely wondering what it's about.

I do have my settings on keeping tags hidden and then I unhide tags when the summary interests me, so maybe whatever it is has just has never bothered me...
