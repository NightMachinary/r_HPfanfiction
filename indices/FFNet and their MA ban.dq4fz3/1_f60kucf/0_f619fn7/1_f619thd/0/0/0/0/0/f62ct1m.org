Ah. I tend to take note of where a ship is tagged in the list of tags since it shows in order of how the author tagged it. If it's pretty far down, it's generally not a prominent ship.

And authors tend to get yelled at/scolded for not tagging ships, so I don't blame them for tagging minor ships.

I guess I just don't often run into that problem, not really sure why. I think maybe I'm usually looking for a fic using additional tags, not ship tags.

Edit: my pro-tip is that you can also avoid tags, so you can look for the ship you want and also filter out the "big" ships, which may net you better, more relevant results.

(I'm just really in love with Ao3's search and filter, sorry, haha. I love spending 2 minutes looking for a fic to read rather than the 20+ I spend on FFnet.)
