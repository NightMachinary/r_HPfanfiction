'Choose not to warn' just means you're choosing not to use the main set of archive warnings.

The only other thing you /have/ to tag is the fandom.

Ships, characters, and the long custom tags some people like are completely optional. The posting form shows a red asterisk on the few things you /must/ fill in. The rest of it you can scroll past if you want.
