If you're new to AO3 tagging just tag: fandom, main ship (if any; romantic ships have '/', non-romantic '&', ex. Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy is romantic while Harry&Draco might be friendship or rivalry - just shown in-depth), main characters, archive warnings (use 'chose not to use archive warnings' if you can't be bothered). That's it. Don't overdo it. Better to undertag than overtag.

If you want to go further you can tag general genre/mood (like 'angst', 'crack', 'psychological horror'), any fandom tropes and specifics of your AU ('enemies to lovers', 'high school AU', 'time travel'), more specific warnings (excessive violence/torture would probably warrant a mention, so does explicit porn).

Tags are a bit hard to get used to at first, but they are amazingly useful. The better your tags, the easier it will be for readers to find you.
