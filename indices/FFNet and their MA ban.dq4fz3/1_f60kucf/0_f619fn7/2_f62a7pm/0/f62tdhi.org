I don't have a problem with AO3's tagging system, I have a problem with the authors who game it.

  The better your tags, the easier it will be for readers to find you.

This would be ideal, but it's not true. At least, not anymore. Very early on someone thought to themselves, “Hey, I could probably get more viewership if I just tag every minor detail,” and then everyone else had to do the same thing to catch up, and then some people, feeling the need to be unique and catch your eye thought, “Hey, what if I made a bunch of really long, crack-esque tags to make searchers laugh,” and then everyone else had to do the same thing, again, to catch up.

I would agree that some of the best fics on AO3 are probably from authors who are confident enough to not feel the need to arbitrarily grab as many search results as possible, but that does come with the drawback of not being /nearly/ as noticeable.

A simple solution would be to limit the number of tags a story can have or, at least, the ability to filter out by tag count. Once a punishment, passive or not, is introduced, you'll start to see the tags recede.
