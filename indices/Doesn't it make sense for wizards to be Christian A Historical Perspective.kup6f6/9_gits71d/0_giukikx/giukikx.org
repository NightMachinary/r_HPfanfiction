Are we talking the modern Neo-Pagan movement or the old school polytheistic pantheons? Or are you referencing the druids? The differences are fairly stark after all.

Neo-Paganism didn't really start until the mid 20th century, though it has its roots in 19th century romanticism, and so tends to focus on the more idealized aspects and ignore the unpleasant (like the frequent, regularly scheduled human sacrifice.) It, as a movement, tends to bear little resemblance to the ancient, now-extinct religions that it seeks to revive. It is a catch-all term for a massive amount of vastly different subsects, some based on ancient Graeco-Roman, Norse, or Egyptian beliefs, others more shamanistic or tribal, etc. Paganism, etymologically speaking, was originally a pejorative term used by early Roman Christians to describe /all/ polytheistic religions, such as the Hellenistic, Nordic, and Hindu pantheons. Thus there was no uniform pagan religion even then.

Now if you are referencing the druids, who somehow have wonderful press among neo-pagans, they made the Death Eaters look like the kindest, most charitable people to ever live. The druids practiced human sacrifice, cannibalism, and bestiality, among other things. They were absolutely brutal savages, so that was just a regular Tuesday for them. (Side note: The name "Tuesday" is derived from the Germanic war god, Tiu, so while the Romans called it "dies Martis" in honor of Mars, the anglicized version substitutes the Germanic name. Similarly, Wednesday was derived from Woden, the Germanic equivalent of the Norse Odin.) For some reason, people today love to whitewash them as these peaceful tribes in tune with nature, etc etc etc. The historical records show otherwise. Once again, I suspect 19th century romanticism is to blame.

My point in all this rambling, beyond simply the fact I love history more than I loved my ex-wife (obviously), is that I don't think pagan beliefs fit the Wizarding World as a whole, though I'm sure there are individuals and groups that hold various faiths. I suspect most of the more pagan-minded individuals are likely muggleborns raised in families with "alternative" views who saw having a young witch or wizard in the family as proof and justification of their beliefs.
