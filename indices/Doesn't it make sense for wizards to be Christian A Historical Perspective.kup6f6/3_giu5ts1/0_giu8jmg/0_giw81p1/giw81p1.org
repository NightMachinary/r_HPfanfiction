I feel though that this is rooted in the assumption that to be atheist (or at least agnostic) is the 'default' state. Why would religion just be a pretence? A lot of these replies are quite condescending in that they suggest that religion is merely a way of explaining away what you don't understand and therefore obsolete with magic. Disclaimer: I am agnostic by apathy. Religion isn't just a collection of stories, it is an understanding of the world and your place in it, and I don't see why magicals would change their belief system without similar changes to life and culture that we have gone through over the last hundred or so years.

You are correct in that magical society is derived from ours, both in terms of pre SoS integration and how in canon it is stated how rare it is to have no 'muggle blood' in the family even just a few generations back. The question should not be 'why would wizards be Christian?', but 'what happened that meant they are not visibly Christian any more?'
