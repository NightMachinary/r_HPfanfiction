But what if most if not all those who educated the Muggle peasants about the miracles of God were the same people who used their magic to heal wounds and cure diseases? In the history of my story wizards themselves believed that their powers came from God. This idea was forgotten during the centuries of isolation when there no longer was any need to repeat any religious justifications to Muggles. Harry Potter books tell very little about the religion of the wizarding world (certainly a good choice from Rowling), but apparently magic gives no clear insight to the deepest mysteries of existence. Since that seems to be the case, why wouldn't medieval and early modern wizards have believed in Christianity, when it generally was the accepted explanation of things? Usually people believe in things people around them believe in, unless they have a reason not to believe.

In wouldn't care much about what the Bible says. In the olden days extremely few people could read, and (even if the Bible in this expanded Harry Potter universe was identical to ours) wizard-priests would surely have skipped the parts that would have undermined their credibility in their sermons.
