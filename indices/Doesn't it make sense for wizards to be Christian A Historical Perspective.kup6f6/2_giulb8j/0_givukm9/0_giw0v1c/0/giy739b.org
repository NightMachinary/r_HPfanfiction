HP magic system bear similarity to magic from the bible, and if I remember correctly, this was on purpose.

Also, magic would have to develop just like everything else. Long ago, the miracles of the bible might have been difficult to pull of with magic, like parting the red sea. And there's still the rising from the dead bit that Wizards don't think is commonly possible.

Your point about about magic not answering every existential question is definitely good, since that is part of the reason people believe religion.
