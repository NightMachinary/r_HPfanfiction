The biggest reason you wouldn't fake miracles is that, in a pre-Statute world, people /know/ that magic exists, and even in the post-Statute world it's understood that there's a difference between magic and miracles, among those who believe in both. Heck, the Bible itself discusses this, and includes stories of people who had to distinguish genuine miracles from clever trickery or regular old magic.

Our ancestors were cannier than we often give them credit for. They aren't going to believe that some dingus is a miracle-working saint when Jen Yonderbridge who lives just past the old bridge can do the same thing.
