I wrote the following some time ago on this subreddit. Fits perfectly for this thread as well:

Many fanfiction writers seem to think that wizardry and Christianity are somehow contradicting one another. Harry Potter canon suggests otherwise. There are at least three examples: 1) wizards celebrate Christian holidays such as Easter, Hallowe'en and Christmas; 2) one of the Hogwarts ghosts was a friar; and 3) the common wizard ethics (that of Dumbledore) seem to be identical with Protestant Christian ethics.

In my story this religion thing is explained as follows. Wizards, especially pure-blood supremacists, considered magic a divine force and believed they were descended from angels or Christ himself. They used magic to convince Muggles of their superiority and ruled over Muggles as kings, priests and aristocrats. The Catholic church was not against wizards at all, because all popes, cardinals and bishops were wizards. (Well, of course they were against some wizard individuals who questioned their right to rule.)

Sometime in the 16th century some wizards began to propagate that Muggles should have the right to rule themselves. By this time most wizards were immensely rich and ruling over Muggles was not of much benefit to them anymore. The isolationist philosophy won, and the wizarding world decided to go into hiding. It caused a stagnation, and every now and then Dark Lords tried to restore the old ways. Napol√©on Bonaparte was one of them.

(If you don't like this history, please explain why wizards wouldn't have used religion for their own benefit. It's easy to fake miracles with magic. It's the rational and obvious thing to do.)

There is, of course, the question of witch-hunts. Some writers use it as the reason why wizards are not Christians. However, I consider it extremely unlikely that many actual witches and wizards would have been killed, and equally unlikely that the rest of the wizarding world would have cared. Since wizards are capable of Disapparating and Confunding and Obliviating Muggles, how would any competent adult wizard get caught and killed by them? And even if they did, why would some pure-blood aristocrats have cared? They seem to care so little about their fellow wizards that they're willing to kill them by themselves. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would have got angry if Muggles had killed Mundungus Fletcher? In conclusion, almost all people killed in witch-hunts were Muggles, and most wizards did never even know Muggles were trying to kill them.
