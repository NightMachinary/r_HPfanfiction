I don't know the details, but I'm pretty sure that the specifics of what the Bible actually means when it says some of that stuff is a matter of debate.

But regardless if what the Bible actually means, the more important point is that it was written in a world without magic. In our world, anyone claiming to do witchcraft is either delusional, trying to con you, or possibly consorting with devils. Either way, it makes sense for the Bible to tell people to avoid them.

But in the Harry Potter world, where magic is real, it makes sense for the Bible to be different. It's hard to say exactly how it would be different, but my guess is that references to magic being evil would probably say that dark magic is evil instead.

Also, remember that the Fat Friar exists, so clearly magic and Christianity did get along at some point.
