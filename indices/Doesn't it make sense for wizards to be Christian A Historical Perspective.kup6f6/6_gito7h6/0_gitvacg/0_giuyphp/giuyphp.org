I believe the reason why magic was considered sinful was people would try to shape the world as a god or appear as a god, both of which are pretty offensive. Think of the Tower of Babel. Also, if one got powers, where the hell are the powers from? If God "gave powers", it's not witchcraft.

Most debate about the Bible revolves around a) literal or figurative, b) contextual or absolute, and c) translation. You're right that there is debate about point a. I believe it was quite literal in the forbidding of witchcraft.

Imo, Rowling did not consider the ramifications of having a Friar as a ghost. ðŸ’€ It's fiction, so religions may be different. It's probably best to just think of Christianity in the HP world as different from Christianity in ours.
