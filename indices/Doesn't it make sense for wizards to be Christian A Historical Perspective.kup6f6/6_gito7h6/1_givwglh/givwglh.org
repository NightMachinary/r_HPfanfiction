/Some denominations of/ Christianity consider magic to be sinful. Others, like some forms of Judaism, consider magic to just be a thing that exists, like anything else. Prohibitions against witchcraft often define witchcraft as malevolent magic, or particular kinds of magic (eg divination, or even divination specifically by speaking to the dead), or as any kind of illusion that does not actually effect the change it appears to make (for example, many scholars took pains to explain how werewolves didn't actually change shape, but rather suffered a delusion in which they /believed/ they changed shape, because only God can actually change the flesh).

Hilariously, the Catholic Church spent most of the witch hunt era arguing that witches didn't exist and anybody who tried to burn one was just a murderer (explicit laws against witch-hunting go back to at least AD 643).
