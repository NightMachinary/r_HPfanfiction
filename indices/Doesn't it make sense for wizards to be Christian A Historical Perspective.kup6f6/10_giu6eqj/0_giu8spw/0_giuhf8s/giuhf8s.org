There is a significant amount of debate among Christian circles as to the exact translation of that line. Many believe it is a mistranslation of "poisoner", thus "Thou shalt not suffer a poisoner to live." Which is quite in line with the issues of that time period. Then there are others who believe it refers not to practitioners of magic in general, but specifically those who wield it against other people in malicious ways.

Magic itself is not forbidden by the Bible (in older translations that is), and there were Jewish magicians referenced in the Old Testament. What /was/ forbidden were magics that tried to play God. Divination by outside sources, Summoning, and Necromancy being the primary three.

To elaborate further on the Divination aspect, knowledge of the future should only come from God, so attempting to seek it via outside sources is both blasphemous and dangerous, as you cannot be certain that the omens and signs perceived are not sent by malevolent entities.

Summoning is fairly obvious I should think. Demons are inherently malevolent, evil entities in Christian teachings. They are the legion of Fallen Angels who followed Lucifer in making war against God and the armies of Heaven. Demons are also the only beings that would be willing to answer the call of a summoner.

Necromancy is generally seen as the worst of the bunch, though it has nothing to do with reanimation, undead hordes, or skeletal overlords. It is communing with the spirits of the dead, calling to them in the underworld and summoning them forth to answer questions. This contravention of the natural order is both horrifyingly obscene, and incredibly dangerous for the same reason that summoning is. You're not really going to call up your dead loved one. You're going to call up a demon who looks like them, or even the Devil himself, who will at best try to lead you to your own death (sound familiar?), and at worst attempt to possess you.

Now, as far as the Wizarding World goes, we know they both believe in, and can /prove/ the existence of the human soul. As far as Divination goes, they can use the age old trick of justifying it by saying they only use safe and holy methods. Maybe their crystal balls are blessed and washed in holy water? Summoning? We never see demons or even anything that can truly be described /as/ summoning in the books, only conjured or transfigured creatures, both of which are simply magical constructs. The only example of traditional Necromancy we see is the Resurrection Stone, which always seems to end in suicide for the users.

For the record, I do headcanon most of the Western Wizarding World as being predominantly Christian, though probably not particularly devout. They believe in God and treat their religious views as a fairly private part of their life. I expect a smattering of other religions, namely the major ones like Judaism, Islam, and variants of Buddhism and Hinduism. Hogwarts definitely has at least one chapel somewhere, probably several, but likely no official services for /any/ religion. Voldemort is definitely atheist, but more along the lines of Laveyan Satanism, where he believes (more literally than most) in becoming a god unto himself. The more fanatical Death Eaters are cut from the same cloth as the Manson family, where they believe that he is the second coming of the Messiah.
