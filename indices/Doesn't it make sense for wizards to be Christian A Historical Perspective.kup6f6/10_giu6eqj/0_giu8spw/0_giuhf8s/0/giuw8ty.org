But why would the magical world belive in a god whose miracles are part of their school curriculum (other than Lazarus)? Water to wine? Yeah, definitely standard transfiguration. Oil lasting longer? A bit of either transfiguration or conjuring it. Alternatively magical fire. Healing the sick? They can mend bones in seconds and regrow them overnight, so no biggie either.
