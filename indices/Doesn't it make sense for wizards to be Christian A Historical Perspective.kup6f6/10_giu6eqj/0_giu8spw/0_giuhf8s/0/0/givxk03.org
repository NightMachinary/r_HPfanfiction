The miracles generally weren't the sole proof, the way we think of them today. For example, Moses turned a stick to a snake, but so did the Pharaoh's magicians.

Jesus wasn't regarded by his followers as the Messiah simply because he could turn water into wine. That transmutation stuff was a sign, but so was “being a very smart thirteen-year-old,” and nobody's arguing that Hermione is the Messiah (well, not /many/ people, anyway).
