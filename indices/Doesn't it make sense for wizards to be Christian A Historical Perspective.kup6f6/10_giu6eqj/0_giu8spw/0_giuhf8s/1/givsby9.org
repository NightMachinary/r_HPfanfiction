I have still my suspicion that Flitwick is a lay Methodist preacher, and of course McGonagall is a daughter of Presbyterian minister. And I am afraid sermons of The Fat Friar are as boring as classes of Professor Binns, although he may be excellent in one-to-one pastoral conversation (who has the similar amount of experience?).
