I thought this was an excellent point to make. I'm not very good at more modern history myself so I thought this was a nice addition to the point I was getting at.

The point you make about you the magical world's magic being similar to the magic in the Bible is one that I haven't considered. It certainly would go a long way to convince people that magic comes from god.

I know somewhere it is mentioned the flame freezing charm made the flames feel ticklish instead of hurting. I think there was a point about a witch that continuously kept going to the stake because of liking the feeling of ticklish flames (that might be fandom though so don't quote me).
