I think the most important thing to consider is that just because later Christians tried to burn witches at the stake, it doesn't preclude magical individuals from being Christians. Religions try to kill their followers surprisingly often, for minor differences in practice. Many witches who actually admitted to practicing witchcraft in the 17th century were Christian.*

They also might be more likely to believe the claims of Christians, as their magic bears many similarities to the magic of the Bible. The idea that a god gave them their abilities probably wouldn't be that odd.

That's all I've got. Everything else you've got seems accurate. But I focus more on modern history, so, I might not be that useful.

*There were practicing witches during the period, they weren't all false accusations. Whether those witches actually used magical abilities is a different story. There was a reason the belief was so widespread. I wish I could name some names, but I don't have any off the top of my head.
