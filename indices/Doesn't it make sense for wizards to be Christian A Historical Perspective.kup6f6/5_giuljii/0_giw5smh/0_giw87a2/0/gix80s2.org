Yeah the people doing the witch burnings were Christians, but then so was everybody (barring a few tiny minorities), I don't think the actions of a handful would cause them to reject their beliefs. The thing is that as far as I can tell witch burnings were pretty much historically irrelevant. I can see wizards seizing on it several hundred years later as an easy explanation for actions, hence Harry writing an essay about it.

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period#14th_century][Wikipedia]] about 40-60k people were executed for witchcraft in Europe over a period of several hundred years. Of these the vast majority were probably muggles who were heretics, strangers, disliked or just unlucky. Even if a witch or wizard was caught, we are explicitly told that it was treated more as a joke than anything else.

This is in contrast to the hundreds of millions who died in the same area over the same period from waves of plagues, famines and constant wars, many religiously driven. It makes far more sense to me that this was the driving factor in why witches and wizards hid themselves away.

I can perfectly imagine them wanting to reject religion, or at least the way they had been previously following it, as a rejection of the 'muggle' way of life, especially given the staggering amount of conflict and genocides it was being used to justify in Europe at the time, but I feel this needs to be explained, not just assumed.
