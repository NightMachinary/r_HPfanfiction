A few tiny groups made up the entire Catholic Inquisition. Right. That's accurate.

You'll have to name those countries where persecuting witches was illegal. I don't recall any, but it's possible.

Salem was just one witch craze. You yourself said that witch trials killed 40k-60k. The Salem trials killed 19. You're missing a couple. Remember countries other than America exist.r

>Also just because they don't wish to support particular parishes or denominations which are hunting them does not mean they give up the religion entirely, you just create your own sect, this happens constantly.

This is accurate, I like it.
