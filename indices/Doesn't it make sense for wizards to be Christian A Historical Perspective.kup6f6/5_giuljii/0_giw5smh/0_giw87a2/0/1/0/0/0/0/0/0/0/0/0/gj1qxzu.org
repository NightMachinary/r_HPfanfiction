I'm not really sure where you're getting the wizards being more advanced and educated than muggles from. Is it anywhere specific?

The fact that they had the sort of reach to create the ICW is understandable, as wizarding transport and communication were miles faster than muggles. It's not really evidence either way towards Christian wizards. Muggles at the time had already started developing colonies around the world.

Mainstream Christianity hating them is important. If we're starting from Jewish communities up through the origins of Christianity, there was an already present anti-magic thing going on. But especially in Jewish sects, this tended to be go against God sort of magic. Magic was present in Jewish religions, from the start, with Moses and the Egyptians. It was magic that didn't come from God that was the issue. Consorting with the devil for power sort of stuff. Mostly focusing on necromancy, because that's for God only. It doesn't entirely preclude any magic, just nonsanctioned magic.

It's just as likely that wizards followed the religion, believing God to be the source of their magical abilities, and muggles started to fear black magic. By the time the catholic church rolled around, they recognized white magic as not that harmful. Black magic was what you got from consorting with the devil.
