That witches were hated was pretty mainstream. Also, as I said - if you can do a decent replacement act for god's miracles, that tends to make you sceptical. Plus, with pretty much all British wizards and witches getting a superb education, they're unlikely to blindly accept religious dogmas.

All in all, I don't see the majority of them staying religious.
