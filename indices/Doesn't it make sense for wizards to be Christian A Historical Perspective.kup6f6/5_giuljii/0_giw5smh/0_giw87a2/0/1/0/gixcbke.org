It wasn't the religion's mainstream though, that is my point, it is few tiny groups. Also much of it had nothing to do with actual magic. In fact, persecuting witches was I think technically illegal in many Christian countries for much of this period. The Salem Witch Trials only killed about a couple of dozen people and is famous because everyone found it so horrifying. Also just because they don't wish to support particular parishes or denominations which are hunting them does not mean they give up the religion entirely, you just create your own sect, this happens constantly.
