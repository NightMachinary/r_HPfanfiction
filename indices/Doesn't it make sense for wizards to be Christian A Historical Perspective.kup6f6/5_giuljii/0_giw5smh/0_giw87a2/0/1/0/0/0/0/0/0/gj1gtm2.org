From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Attendance][Wiki]]: The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Some 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year.

The UK really isn't religious any more.
