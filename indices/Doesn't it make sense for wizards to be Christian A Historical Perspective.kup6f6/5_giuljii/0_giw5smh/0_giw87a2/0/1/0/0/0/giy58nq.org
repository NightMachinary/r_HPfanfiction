In the Bible, many of God's miracles are called by man. Moses, Jesus, etc. It's very possible that for wizards, this answered the question of where magic came from.

>Plus, with pretty much all British wizards and witches getting a superb education, they're unlikely to blindly accept religious dogmas.

Christianity has been around for a very long time. We have a half-decent education system in the western world which focuses on the sciences, and we still have a christian majority in the population. Hogwarts teaches magic, which you said could replicate miracles. That means that the more important piece of defeating the dogma would be disproving god and the Jesus stories, rather than disproving things like miracles being possible. That leaves wizards with just as much to disprove as muggles.
