But where did magic come from? Wouldn't Wizards want to know where their magic came from just as much as muggles want to know why the weather happens. The fact that Christians persecuted witches is irrelevant to whether they were Christians. Religion doesn't work that way. When a two religious groups have a difference of opinion, they tend to split off. By the point where Christian would be persecuting witches, they would have actual centuries of being Christians to maintain their beliefs. That's why we have so many versions of Christianity.
