Well, there's the whole "burn the witch" movement - that sort of thing tends to drive away people who qualify as "witch" no matter whether or not they are actually in danger; few sane people want to associate with a movement that hates them. Then there's the fact that most of the miracles mentioned in the bible are stuff you can easily re-enact with your wand - a god simply isn't very impressive if you can do most of what they can do. So, the muggles might have shed their religion quicker, but the wizards had a headstart.
