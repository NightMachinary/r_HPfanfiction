I agree that Christianity had and has a massive influence on European wizards (and witches). However, I do not think the wizards would be Christian.

Denominations, branches, sects, etc. debate whether or not other groups are heretic enough to not be valid fellow adherents to religion. For example, many Protestant denominations (and, if iirc, the Catholic church) do not recognize Mormons as Christians. They see them as worshipping a different god. A more drastic example is Christianity and Islam. I've heard a few Muslims say that Christianity was kinda "continued" or "upgraded" by Islam. Whether or not that's the case for Islam doctrine, from a Christian's view, the Christian god and the Muslim god are different.

While some wizards certainly can believe that Jesus is the son of the only god, that Jesus died for our sins, and that those who believe that Jesus is such will enter heaven, they will have to edit quite a bit, possibly to the point of having a different religion.

Now, it is certainly fun to think about. Personally, I loved the Harry Dresden fics because of the world expansion.

I wonder:

How do they worship? What other religions are prominent? What about the Protestant Reformation?

The most interesting part is how would religion play a role in blood purity. I read about this poet who is often seen as a feminist writer. She definitely pushed for women's right in a major way. However, she did not go to the fullest extent (from what I could tell), and she supported slavery. She was raised Roman Catholic, so I'm pretty sure she believed that "all men (as in humans) are spiritually equal" and "worldly rank doesn't mean shit." There probably was a great deal of racism and ignorance, but it is still intriguing. Would blood purists have championed their doctrine through justification in their holy text? Would Voldemort have crafted his image as the return of the Messiah? Would they have appeased people with the "We're all equal. It's just your physical body (aka. blood)."?
