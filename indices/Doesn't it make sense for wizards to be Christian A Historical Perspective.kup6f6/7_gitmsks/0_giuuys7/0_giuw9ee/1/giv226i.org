Food is an inconsistency. You can't transfigure food, but you can transfigure stuff into animals and duplicating something is also possible (so cast that spell on a can of food for example).

Also, the summoning charm is a thing. So worst case, all you need to perform that miracle is a bit of criminal energy.

Lazarus is the oddity, I'll give you that. But Easter, ghosts are certainly known and poltergeists are able to interact with the world, so that's definitely not miraculous for someone who knows magic. Nevermind Horcruxes and the Ritual Voldemort used at the graveyard. Certainly an impressive feat og magic, but not divine.
