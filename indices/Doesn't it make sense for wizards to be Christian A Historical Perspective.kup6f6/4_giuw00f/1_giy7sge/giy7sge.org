There are a couple possibilities, one is that magic was harder to use in those days, due to a lack of proper wand-lore, so those acts were significantly harder. The other is that to wizards they weren't about the acts, but what they accomplished, feeding the hungry, healing the sick, doing good kind of acts. So for them it was about where magic came from, and how one should act.
