One thing I've actually considered is the other way around - Quite a few of the Biblical miracles could have been done by wizardkind readily. Turning water into wine (which a variant of is attempted by an 11-year-old Seamus - he fails not because it's impossible, but because he lacks the actual skill), multiplying food (it can't be created from nothing, but making /more/ from a start is noted as one of the exceptions), healing people without any method Muggles recognize...\\
Then, things start getting a little more muddy with certain "miracles" that might have been natural phenomena, like the Ten Plagues, being attributed to the same "divine" force, and over time the story would most likely get exaggerated and twisted to tell of the wizard in question doing things that magic /can't/ do, or at least not as easily.

If there was always a certain degree of separation, which seems somewhat likely, it's entirely possible that a lot of religions started from Muggles seeing the things a wizard can do, and thinking "that person must be a god or something".\\
At that point, if the "real" story survives among wizardkind (which it probably would), it doesn't make much sense for wizards to actually practice those religions that started that way. It'd be a bit like being in a cargo cult, when you're the person handing out the goods to impoverished civilizations.

Then again, the Fat Friar exists and the Christian holidays are observed (to a degree at least. Christmas trees and gift-giving aren't actually a Christian idea - though contrary to popular belief it didn't start due to any company in particular) - so presumably, /some/ form of the Abrahamic religion exists among magical folk.\\
It probably wouldn't be one-on-one with Christianity, or at least not follow the same exact lore (maybe it's a "this is where magic came from", or a celebration of a few virtuous historical wizards minus the "god" part), but it'd bear enough similarities that for example holidays are easily transposed.

The only part I can't quite reconcile purely within canon is that this would /undoubtedly/ come up in History of Magic or Muggle Studies - but it's never stated. I could, from the outside, justify that as J.K. Rowling not wanting to alienate a significant portion of potential readers any more than she already was doing (or just forgetting to elaborate, as she has on multiple occasions).
