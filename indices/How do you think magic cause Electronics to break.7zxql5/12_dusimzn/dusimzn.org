I personally believe that magic is mostly powered by mass belief by, you know, magicals. To the point where, in an area that is absurdly saturated by magic, if the vast majority of magicals present /don't/ believe something works, then it doesn't. So at first it was a 'haha is that some weird box thing that's supposed to hold bajillions of words? I call bull' and then it became 'oh yea electronics don't work at Hogwarts'

Which makes circumventing it a moot point because if muggle studies ever actually explained how they worked, Ravenclaws would test methods of getting them to work inside the wards and make a list of 'well this doesnt work' before anyone else even thought about it, resulting in a reinforcement of unexplainable phenomena.

unless they managed to cast some sort of notice-me-not on something, aiming it not at Wizards or Muggles, but the ambient magic in general?
