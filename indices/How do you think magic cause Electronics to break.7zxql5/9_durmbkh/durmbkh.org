Just say lots of magic in a relatively small area causes an EMP-like effect. Magic in moderate quantities doesn't break electronics. Any amount of magic alone doesn't break electronics (Mr. Wealey uses it at the Dursley residence, Fudge uses some in the Prime Minister's office, wards that surround the Dursley home, etc.); Hermione says in GoF that it's the amount of magic at Hogwarts that ruins the electronics.
