  magine this scenario: Hogwarts is an ancient castle with no electrical wiring. A muggleborn tries to bring their newfangled radio to school with them. Obviously there's nowhere to plug it in and if it has a battery it runs out fairly soon. The wizards see that it doesn't work and don't know why (the 11-year old muggleborn certainly can't explain it) and their best explanation is that it doesn't work because its a muggle thing in a magic place.

You forgot that Hogwarts is in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by mountains. Even in the muggle parts of that area radio reception is piss-poor.
