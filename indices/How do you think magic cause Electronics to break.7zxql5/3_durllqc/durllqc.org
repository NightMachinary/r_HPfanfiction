I prefer to explain it as wizards just fundamentally misunderstanding how electronics work combined with their propensity to solve and explain everything in the context of magic.

Imagine this scenario: Hogwarts is an ancient castle with no electrical wiring. A muggleborn tries to bring their newfangled radio to school with them. Obviously there's nowhere to plug it in and if it has a battery it runs out fairly soon. The wizards see that it doesn't work and don't know why (the 11-year old muggleborn certainly can't explain it) and their best explanation is that it doesn't work because its a muggle thing in a magic place. They then tell all new muggleborn (such as Hermione, our source of this factoid) that muggle stuff doesn't work at Hogwarts and to not bother bringing it.

OP also raises a good point that electronics are generally very sensitive devices and casting certain kinds of magic at them could easily cause a malfunction due to direct damage or changing material properties of delicate components. Imagine what an enlarging charm would do to anything with a microchip in it. Increasing the scale of the chip would mess with the electrical resistance, signal timing, heat dissipation, etc., likely causing it to fail. On the other hand, a levitation charm cast at it probably wouldn't cause those problems since that doesn't change the properties of the object but rather the forces acting on it. So, some types of magic probably play nicer with electronics than other sorts rather than magic in general necessarily being a cause for problems.

As far as I know, and somebody please correct me if I'm mistaken, we don't actually see a muggle gadget spontaneously stop working simply due to being exposed to magic or Hogwarts without other compounding circumstances. All we have to go on is Hermione briefly quoting wizarding texts on the subject.
