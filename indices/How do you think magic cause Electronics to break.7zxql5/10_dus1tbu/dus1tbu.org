It makes me wonder, isn't the Ministry of Magic right under London where there is large a population of muggles who use electronics? Especially since it is a city that is run by technology. I recall that the Ministry is deep below, but it doesn't change the fact that a huge amount of magic runs below while a huge supply of electricity is running above it. There is bound to be some kind of fluxes of magic in certain areas considering magic's unpredictability. This is just a curious thought I wanted to put out there.
