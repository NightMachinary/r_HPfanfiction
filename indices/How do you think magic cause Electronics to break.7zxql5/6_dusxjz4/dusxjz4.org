I like how you think.

It's a matter of precision. Magic messes with something that works based on precise consistent and minute laws, because by nature magic is an imprecise manifestation of will.

Looking at it bare-bones. What magic is, is the human mind and the human desires manifesting themselves directly into the world. Or almost directly (with wands and incantations being the medium). What magic does is blur the line between the mind and the world, but in doing so it takes away some of the "consistency" of the world. The world becomes a less definite thing. More alive, but less detailed moment to moment.

Electronics are the quintessential example of rigorous study of a strict, consistent, definite world. A world in which there are rules, that are absolute, and in which there is no uncertainty as to what is and what isn't. That little 20 nanometer transistor thingy? Yeah there's a million of them an all work in perfect harmony to make the screen do the movie you're watching (or something like that). That's pretty damn precise and requires a high level of stability of the way the world is.

Now obviously you try and mix those to and the best answer you're doing to get as to what happens it "it will just not work".
