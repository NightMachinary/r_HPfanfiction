My preferred explanation is that magic basically 'softens' reality most of the the time it doesn't matter as magic basically fudges the details, but thing like microchips are delicate and thus prone to failure.

Personally I think wizards should have significantly more magi-tech than canon, but I doubt electronics would be a priority. If Wizards did have computers they would either operate very differently than muggle ones, or be based on old mechanical or clockwork designs I think.
