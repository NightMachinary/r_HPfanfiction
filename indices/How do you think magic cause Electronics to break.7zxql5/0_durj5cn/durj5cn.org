It doesn't. Mr Weasley repared an electric fireplace with magic in GoF. It's only Hogwarts which is such a magical place that it prevents electronics from working.

I am generally wary of "how" questions when it comes to magic. This is essentially a request to explain one thing in terms of other, more basic things in some kind of mechanistic relationship. Not only do I think that magic is unlikely to be fully systematic, it's also worth noting that you can't ask such questions forever. Some things are just basic - the fundamental set-up of the way the world works. I am especially wary of the instinct to explain magic in terms of non-magical things, as if magic reduces down to non-magical causes, rather than being separate from the natural order.

The fact that magic is supernatural, rather than natural, seems to me to be an example of a fundamental fact about what magic /is/. It is, in fact, part of the whole definition of magic - were magic a part of the natural order, it would by definition cease to be supernatural.

It is therefore no surprise nor oddity that highly supernatural places have a tendency to override the natural order of the world. It's simply magic being true to its nature. /All/ magic overrides the natural order, so a place that has managed to acquire an inherent magical quality would do the same.

As for why electronics specifically, I am not sure that this is actually the case. Recall that the Ford Anglia also malfunctioned at Hogwarts, and even gained some form of sapience. That's a mechanical rather than electronic object. Rather than electronics, I think the set of objects that are incompatible with highly magical areas is simply those which are extremely "Muggle-ish" in nature - objects which represent Muggle faith in the natural order and the rejection of the supernatural, the products of industry and science.

If the concept of "Muggleness" seems too subjective to you, then you haven't been paying attention to the HP magic system. The Fidelius takes as its object a "secret". What's the difference between a secret and information more generally? That's largely a subjective, social thing. Filtch can see Hogwarts but Muggles can't, even though both have no magic. The only difference is that they occupy different social categories. The human concept of food is a part of the fundamental rules of Transfiguration. A job title can be the object of a curse. All these things point towards human-created concepts being considered by magic to be just as real as physical things.

Note that none of the above prevents wizards from creating objects of similar function and appearance to Muggle objects, but which are magical in nature - wizarding wireless, magical cameras, etc.

As for getting around it, I don't know why you'd want to. It'd rather ruin the charm and aesthetic of the wizarding world. Any wizard that tried should be sent to Azkaban :p
