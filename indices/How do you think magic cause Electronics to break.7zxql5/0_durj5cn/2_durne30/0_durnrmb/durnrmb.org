Not cores, but definitely that Muggleness comes in degrees and is a property that is magically recognisable. Certainly this is how magical people talk about Muggles, e.g. McGonagall calls the Dursleys the biggest Muggles ever. How "Muggleish" you are is also connected to your ability to perceive (or not perceive) magic. Stan Shunpike mentions that Muggles don't see the Knight bus simply because they are insufficiently observant, and Quiddtich Through the Ages describes how Muggles have a kind of power of magical ignorance whereby they explain away even magic which they see performed in front of them. Another example is that pigs are considered difficult to transfigure because of how un-magical they are.
