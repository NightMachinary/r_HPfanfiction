AHAAAA! Computers work because they make sense. Nonmagicals see a pattern in nature, study it, replicate it, utilize it. Magic works because it doesn't make sense. It's not SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE. THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE ARE SO BAMBOOZLED BY EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, THAT THEY JUST STOP WORKING.
