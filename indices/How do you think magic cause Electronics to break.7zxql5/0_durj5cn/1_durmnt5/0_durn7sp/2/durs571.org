Notice that Hermione is not speaking from her own experience. She is quoting a piece of wizarding propaganda.

Her examples also some rather difficult to use pieces of equipment (we are talking 80s or even earlier computers here, not iPhones). What bet that whatever wizard tried them out had no clue in the first place how these items were supposed to act in the first place?
