You're pushing this too far from what is even implied. Hermione was pushing back specifically against electronic devices, not those which are examples of "the triumph of scientific modernity" because any manufactured object after the Industrial Revolution could fall under that umbrella term.

Harry suggested Skeeter used electronic bugs to eavesdrop and Hermione said such things cannot work near Hogwarts. Machines using electricity aren't just "one item" there, its the main feature linking them and that which was relevant to Harry's suggestion, those were the "substitutes for magic" Hermione was referencing. There's nothing to this idea that anything else is affected, much less some ill-defined idea as what you're suggesting, I think. Otherwise any watches made after the Industrial Revolution wouldn't work there (even mechanical ones) for no apparent reason other than the hazy designation that they are "modern".
