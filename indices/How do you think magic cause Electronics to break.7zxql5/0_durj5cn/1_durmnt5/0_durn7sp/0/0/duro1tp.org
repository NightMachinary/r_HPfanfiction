I'm not saying that all mechanical objects fail at Hogwarts. Indeed that was what the concept of Muggleness is intended to avoid. Only those mechanical objects which are associated with modernity and the triumph of scientific modes of thinking would be non-functional. Watches and other pre-industrial or artisan products would not be within that group.

From the fact that "electricity" is just one item on a list of things which do not function seems to imply that the list of non-functioning objects extends beyond electrical objects. Admittedly the other examples in the list are also electrical in nature, but the list is explicitly non-exhaustive, and intended merely as examples of "substitutes for magic".

(Also, on a tangent, I find it interesting that Hermione has, by year 4, already integrated sufficiently into wizarding culture that she considers technology a substitute for magic rather than something of inherent worth. Just another example of how completely she embraces the magical world and abandons the Muggle one.)
