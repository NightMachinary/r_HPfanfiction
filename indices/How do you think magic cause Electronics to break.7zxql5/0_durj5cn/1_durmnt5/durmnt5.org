The Ford was breaking before they got to Hogwarts, so I'd be more inclined to think that its behavior was as a result of being to overused by its occupants before it crashed into the Willow than anything to do with Hogwarts. And certainly nothing to do with some notion of "Muggleness" of objects. Especially since the object in question had already had numerous enchantments applied to it, making it decidedly /un/Muggle at the time it seemed to gain sentience (assuming it didn't have it beforehand).
