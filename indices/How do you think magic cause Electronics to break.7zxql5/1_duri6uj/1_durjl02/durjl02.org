Do we know that the effect "bleeds out"? I think it might be within the realm of what's possible with the canon magic that when you're in Diagon Alley, bam, electronics don't work, and if you so much as step a centimeter out of it, they work again. Personally, I think it's the Muggle-Repelling Charms that do it.
