Mr. Weasley used magic at Privet Drive and the electronics in the house didn't all fry, the same with Fudge at the Prime Minister's office (and perhaps Harry using the patronus in Little Whinging, or just the wards that surround the Dursley home). From what Hermione said in GoF, it's the fact that there's so much magic around Hogwarts that breaks electronics that come near it, not the fact that magic is there.
