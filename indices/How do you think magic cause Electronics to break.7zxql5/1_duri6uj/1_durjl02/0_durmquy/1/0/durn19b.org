My guess is it has more to do with how many wards are there and/or how much magic has been used at the place. A school where magic is taught and has been for a thousand years seems like exactly the kind of place where magic would fill the air in abundance.

As for why, well, I would just assume lots of magic can cause an EMP or EMP-like effect. Might screw up the logic gates on circuits or something by making the electricity not flow properly.
