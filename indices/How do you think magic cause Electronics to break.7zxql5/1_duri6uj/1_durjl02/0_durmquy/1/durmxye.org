True --- certainly, doing magic near a computer wouldn't bust it --- but how magical does a place need to be? I mean, I'd be surprised if an iPhone worked in the Death Room. Anyway, whether or not one needs a big quantity of it, the question of /why/ magic causes electronics to fail (which was OP's original query) remains open.
