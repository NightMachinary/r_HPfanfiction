I subscribe to the headcanon that magic is somewhat sentient and whimsy. On that note I once wrote a bit of fanon that I now use when electronics are concerned.

Magic gets jealous.

Muggles aren't "her" people, wizards are. When muggles use electronics thats fine, but wizards ought to use /her powers/. Which is also why magical places, like Hogwarts or (in my headcanon) also Diagon Alley, the Ministry,... break electronics. On the other side magic also provides the wizards with magical opportunities to make what electronics would provide. Radio? Have the Wireless. Instant communication? Well, you know what, we gonna top that, we'll have instant communication /plus/ transportation. eMail? Owls are superb. Deal with it.

I also think that it's quite impossible for wizards to overcome it, at least if you want the actual electrons doing the work. Or in an example: You can enchant an iPhone to work like one, but the moment you do, you fry it. What ends up on the display is magics jealous answer, aka. Siri becoming sentient and being her snarky self, all the time, changing texts, calls, and sending the porn you browse to your mother.

Why I subscribe to that? Because I find it funny and it's just something I could see being a thing with HP magic.
