Depends on if Viktor Krum is featuring in the story - if he is, it's double the usual amount. :D

Tbf, misspelling her name is probably the most realistic thing this fandom does. Pretty sure anyone with an atypical name or name spelling can attest to that. You're never going to find 'Hermione' on a novelty name fridge magnet.

My favourite name misspelling is still Luscious Malfoy, though. Makes him sound like the Garnier Hair Care Model and Glam Metal Frontman he absolutely secretly is. :D
