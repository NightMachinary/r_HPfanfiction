Sometimes when I read a fic with a plot I've read before... a lot of times, I keep a mental checklist of obligatory tropes that typically comes with the package, and just for fun, I try to check off which ones this particular version of the premise uses. No offense to the author; hell, sometimes I want something simple and predictable.

Peggy Sue!Snape (particularly LESS ones) and post-war SSHG are probably the premises I've read the most which tends to fall into patterns, especially the former (at least the latter, by virtue of forcing the main characters away from canon stations, tend to have a bit more originality to them on average).
