There was never any claim in cannon that there were not other schools in the magical world and specifically in magical Europe. In fact, the number of originally known schools increased from 7 to 11 at one point as JK Rowling talked of others. It is generally assumed that the schools we know of, are effectively the biggest, best, most prestigious, and/or longest established places of magical learning.

So taking that into account, and knowing that there is likely some home schooling along with other smaller schools, the assumption is that if you choose to attend one of the "11" (7 locations known) "better" schools that are named, you likely have to learn the language spoken at the school. For Beauxbatons that is french. For Hogwarts its English.

And then we have to realize that with magic, the simple fact is that it was likely MUCH easier to learn a language, and the only reason many did not is simply because there was no need, or they felt themselves "above" doing so. Plus we are viewing from the point of view of an "English" wizarding world/school story, and as English is considered the global language in the muggle world, its also likely the same in the magical world. Hence, it is less likely for native English speakers to learn other languages, then for non-native English speakers to learn English. So we don't really see language learning outside Runes.

Also, you can't compare the "culture" of the wizarding world from the lense of the way it works in the muggle world. Keep that in mind. While there may be many "nationalities" within the wizarding world, its likely culture is much more merged than in the muggle world.
