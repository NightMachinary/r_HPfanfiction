Actually I'm French, and I agree that sometimes we can be a bit too proud of ourselves when it comes to our culture.. Seeing your response, I'm curious if you had a bad experience with some French people or if it's just how other countries sees us?

And I totally agree with the rest of what you said, first because French is a pain to learn (yes even for native speakers) especially if you start learning at eleven for the muggleborns, and also because I can't believe that there is such a disconnect between the wizarding and magical communities of a country that they wouldn't even speak the same language, even purebloods.

At the very least Latin could make sense if it was only Italy, Spain and France, but since a lot of germanic country are also suppose to attend I can't see how that would work.

And even then the cultural difference between Spain, Italy and France, while smaller, is still very significative (see above, I'm french and possibly a bit too proud of my own culture)
