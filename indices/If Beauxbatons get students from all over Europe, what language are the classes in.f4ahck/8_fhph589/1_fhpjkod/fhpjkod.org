Actually that's a great way of working around it!

And obviously even in Great Britain you shouldn't pay too much attention to the details to the world - building or it starts to fall apart. I read a post on this sub trying to make sense of the wizarding population numbers, the percentage of wizard etc.. and clearly maths isn't Rowling strongest point. Right now I'm more in a "gonna close my eyes and pretend it makes actual sense" team.

The thing that was always the least convincing to me is the no formal education/home schooling before eleven part.. On one hand it would explain why the wizard are clearly behind technology wise, on the other hand realistically with this system a significant part of the students would start Hogwarts barely knowing how to read and write..
