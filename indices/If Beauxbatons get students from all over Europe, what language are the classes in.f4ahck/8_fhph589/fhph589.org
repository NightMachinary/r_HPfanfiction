The worldbuilding (and scale) inside of Britain is... inconsistent at best (and not making too much sense). Outside of it? It's barely present.

That's most obvious with the schools - Beauxbatons and Durmstrang for all of Europe, entire continents with one school, etc. Personally I would just wipe the slate clean of them myself and rebuild it up with some ... better choices there.

However, to keep it as canon-adjacent as possible, I would put a clarification that Beauxbatons/Durmstrang/Hogwarts are simply the /best/ three schools in Europe. It's just that the magical societies on the Continent are presumably a bit more unified than the British, and so the elites in Spain or Portugal might choose to send their students to Beauxbatons to be schooled in French instead of the local school.

That's not my preference, obviously - but I'm also the type that'd throw in another half dozen schools or more into Britain :P
