Whenever you find inconsistencies in any kind of fiction, always remember this: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt][A wizard did it.]] Which is especially true in this case (though it may have been a witch instead or maybe a group of magicals).

And maybe they have translation charms or even translation wards that don't need to be re-cast several times per day?
