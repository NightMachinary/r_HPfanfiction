So this answer is based from my headcanon that goes slightly against canon. But, basically, in my headcanon, Beauxb√¢tons accept students from France, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Wallonia, Italy, Switzerland (Italian and French part), and all the micro states going along. I think that they would have classes separated along linguistic lines (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, maybe Catalan and Basque) and maybe at N.E.W.T. level (the French one, that is) they could start meddling the classes because maybe the school offers language classes as well. That latter point would be logic considering the position of the school.

I think they would do that because it pretty much is canon that there is no existing translating spell as seen with Fudge who struggled to speak with the Bulgarian Minister for Magic in GoF. Hope it helps you!
