Right, you'd have to explore when the wizarding society was in a position where such a language would be useful. My thought is the Roman empire, connecting all these disparate wizarding societies that hadn't known each other existed priorly. If apparition came about around the same time (maybe as a military innovation by Roman war-mages) that'd help explain it too.

Thus, wizenglot would be heavily Latin-influenced, but maybe with magical components like parseltongue has. Hence spells being in what sounds like pseudo-Latin, perhaps.

If it's a magical conlang, it could be enchanted to be easily learned by wizards, but impossible for muggles (motivated by superiority and wanting to keep arcane secrets, not by the Statute since that didn't exist until recently). That would make muggleborn integration easier, if the language teaches itself to them.
