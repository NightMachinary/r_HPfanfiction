Oh I didn't understand it like that, because esperanto was created recently (on the human existence scale). In this case it would make much more sense! It asks the question of whether magical travel always existed or was discovered/invented at some point, but it's an interesting theory.

Though muggle born integration would be ten times harder/impossible since in this case most wizard wouldn't speak muggle language.
