Crouch Sr claimed to be able to speak /over 200 languages/ fluently, and the 'muggle' world record for a polyglot is (I think) 58. Which is still /really/ impressive!

But I think that's more evidence that you're right, there has to be some kind of magic that allows someone to learn a language faster.

(Or Crouch Sr is a liar. There's lots of canon evidence for that, too.)
