Just a generation before us at residential schools Deaf children were required to go to and oralism ruled classrooms and kids weren't allowed to sigb.

Our generation (I'm guessing you're slightly bear my age I'm 31) Total Communication TC had become the accepted edicatfinal system for children. This included sign systems like Signing Exaxt English SEE2, Seeing Essential English 2, use a mix of made up signs and signs from ASL, BSL, Auslan, etc The idea was to teach DHH children to read English but they finally learned any system based off English wasn't working for children born or very early are profoundly Deaf and recieve no help from HAs, because unless they were signed to in a real language they hadn't been exposed to a full language let alone acquiring a new one in a weird forced way. In the US the average Deaf adult reads at a 3rd grade level, failed by both oralism and to a lesser extent made up fake sign systems made by hearing individuals.

That led to the new model emerging, bicultural/bilingual education. The idea is to teach ASL, BSL etc. as a first language L1 Hearing childrens language development comes from the minute they're born hearing language spoken around them, then babbling then using simple words. This can happen to DHH kids who develop by seeing sign language used by adults around them. Then their L1 is used to teach all their subject throughout school. English is introduced as a second language L2. The higher and more advanced the grasp of their L1 the better their L2 will be.

Most DHH children are born to hearing parents. But there's been a huge change in early years programs in the US, UK, Canada to encourage sign language use even if the parents also use hearing aids or implants. I have both and it's a mistake to assume it gives me perfect hearing. I have to be facing people directly to speak with them using sound clues, body language, context and very minor lip reading. If there's too much background noise, no dice. There are more and more bi/bi day schools and the bi/bi method is becoming adopted by special ed teachers in mainstreamed public schools.

I know theres a strong tradition of oralism in the UK. The disgusting Mary Hare School should be shut down. But on the ground level change is starting.

Sorry for the long answer to your question, many DHH children with HAs and who can speak will also use Pigin at the very lease a mix of English and their native sign language especially to communicate with DHH friends. They may not be advanced and rely solely on ASL, BSL, Auslan, etc. but they have a basic grasp. I'm in that latter category, I have profound loss in one year severe in the other, have a bone anchored hearing aid BAHA implant and use two behind the ear BTE hearing aids., having use signed English in schools, I was able to succeed because I have residual hearing with my HAs. English is my L1 and it's hard going from SE to ASL in my case, I feel disconnected from the Deaf community because of that and it's not by choice. Sometimes I wish I was 10-15 years younger to be able to attend one of these amazing new programs.

Do you use BSL professionally or personally? Or was your class just to learn. I studied Deaf ea and would really like to go to grad school at Gallaudet but my ASL needs to be way better since all the classes are taught in sign. So I'm just curious like that :)

Thanks for such a great response!
