Do you use BSL professionally or personally?

I used to live in another area where I used sign far more, but here is more challenging despite having a bigger Deaf community - it's harder to get into I guess. I do use it in a professional context as a carer for a person who is Deaf and has LD (unaided) but it's a fairly basic level.

I think it does depend on the area though as the last area I lived in, where I signed more, the Head Teacher of the Deaf (who was in my class when I was trying to brush up again) had held her role for 13 years despite it being a legal minimum and openly coasted as she didn't see any point in learning. A VERY oralist area.

Where I live now, deaf kids are taught sign along which is basically makaton imo. There are only a handful of BSL using children in the entire city.

I would say there was brief swing towards BSL but it was before CIs became particularly good. Scotland has brought out an act trying to get parents fair information, but it's not really taken off. England is increasing in oralism again, except in very specific areas.

I went to a school with a base so we had SSE in class with CSWs (mine was a CODA) but we were taught Deaf culture and BSL and had a 'culture' officer who was Deaf. There were 26 deaf children in my school, with myself as the only one who wasn't severe/profoundly deaf. Against all advice I went to mainstream for secondary because the school I was advised to go to had trouble with knife crime. It was much harder. I know I'm not 'meant' to sign and not 'really' deaf but my word is BSL/SSE easier.

Some of my friends went to Mary Hare. Reportedly they are a bit more flexible on signing out of class these days, but I agree their head is an absolute disgrace of a person.

I'm 24 and the change in Mary Hare seems to have come somewhere between there and someone who is 22 or so.
