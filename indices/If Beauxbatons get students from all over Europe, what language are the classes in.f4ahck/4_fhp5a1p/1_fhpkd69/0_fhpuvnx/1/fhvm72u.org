JKR's take is that wizards just don't develop muggle illnesses and disabilities which begs the question of why some characters have glasses.

Proportionately, very few deaf children use sign language in the UK. Especially if they don't have Deaf parents - there's not the funding to teach it and a very strong oralist push. Two of my BSL teachers - both profoundly Deaf - weren't allowed to use any sign at all until their parents caved and sent them to Deaf schools for secondary. (So, they didn't learn to sign until they were 11.)

If we assume Gryffindor is about average for pupils then we're looking at 280 pupils per year, so chances are that they've not got any pupils with any level of deafness and given there's more mild deafness than profound, we can probably assume that where it does come up the children can coast. Or if lucky get someone to show them a charm/object to function as a hearing aid.

My guess would be that they turf them out like squibs, but I'd like to think there were special spells to convert it speech into thoughts or the like.

I'm an oddball in that I have a moderate loss and was taught and educated with sign as well as English and I can't begin to tell you how much my adult audiologists HATE it because I 'don't need it'.
