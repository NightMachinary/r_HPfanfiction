That's a really interesting point about accidental magic. 95% I think it close to deaf or HoH children are born to hearing parents who aren't familiar with Deaf culture. More and more hearing parents are educating themselves about Deaf culture, new bilingual bicultural (the new method of Deaf ed teach ASL as a Native language L1. DHH children cant acquire English naturally because they cant hear it and they miss the cutoff to learn a full complete language which is a main reason the average Deaf adult reads at a grade 3 level.

I think if there was a case of accidental magic by a child to "fix" his hearing it would be a child whose parents get SUPER upset about finding out their child is DHH. Like end of the world, sadly it still happens If their parents were outwardly devastated and angry their accidental magic would feed off those powerful emotions and might "fix" what's making mum and dad so upset.
