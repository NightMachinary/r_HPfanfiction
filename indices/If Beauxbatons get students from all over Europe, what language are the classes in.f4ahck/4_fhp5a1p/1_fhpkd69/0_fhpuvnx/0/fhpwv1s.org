Yes 11 is incredibly late to change your whole communicating system and for many trying a magical fix could do more harm than good. Ivm not sure how the wizarding world would react to this, but seeing how squib are treated I fear it would be far from ideal.

Also, it made me think could muggle born children accidentally "fix" themselves with accidental magic and I'm not sure about my thought on that matter. What would be your opinion on this ?
