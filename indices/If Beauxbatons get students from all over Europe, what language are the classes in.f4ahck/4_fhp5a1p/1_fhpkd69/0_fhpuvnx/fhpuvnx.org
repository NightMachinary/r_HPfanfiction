I'm HoH (hard of hearing) and did speech therapy but I also have a BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) and wear two behind the ear hearing aids as well. So I always wonder about the DHH in relation to the magical world.

I would think most purebloods who has a child with hearing loss would use a spell to make it go away, aka "fix" them.

But what about muggleborn? By 11 many would have hearing aids and communicating in their local sign language. Thet might be offered the spell but many students might have developed a Deaf identity by then and don't see their hearing loss as a disability just that they belong to a different culture.

I know it's a small population but it's got to exist.
