Europe as a wholes culture can pretty much be split into id say a (heavily rough please remember) six 'cultural zones'. You have the eastern Europeans, the southern countries (france, italy, Switzerland, Spain) the North west (germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands, Czech Republic, etc), Scandinavia and that small area around Greece, Croatia ect. So I would say at minimum six European schools. Do remember these zones are incredibly tough.
