Alternate line of thinking - Britain fancies itself as superior to the rest of the world (I bring you Brexit), so the 'best' schools mentioned are the ones BRITAIN sees as best. In line with that, the Middle East is pretty much ignored over here.

This also helps explain why Hogwarts is the best school/best three in Europe and yet also has so many incompetent teachers.
