My headcanon is following (and largely discards JKR's ideas):

- Hogwarts-style centralized institutions aren't the only possible model (and Hogwarts themselves are modeled after English boarding school, so even there's a lot of room for local flavor), in fact I'd say they account for a relatively small proportion of wizarding students worldwide. Those that have long continuous traditions are rare outside of Europe and Americas, and even the European institutions have continuous tradition that dates back to middle ages at most.

- Outside of those geographical and temporal constraints they are either defunct, largely diminished in status compared to their heyday, or simply historically and culturally weren't a thing to begin with and any schools in those areas are recent developments. The influence of Muggle world on the wizarding one is IMO far larger than either side cares to admit, and only post-Statute wizarding community is truly "safe" from any large state upheavals.

Per area and historical period:

- Mediterranean in the antique and classical era? For Greece and Levant (incl. their colonies) I'm going with the time-and-period accurate "philosophical school" model. One founder, no more than two or three assistants, at most 20 students, school usually dissolved due to founder's death or split into several lesser ones due to disagreements etc.. Romans and Carthaginians might have had a smaller scale institutions, but those didn't outlive their respective empires by much.

- Middle East + North Africa - Might have had actual wizarding institutions dating back to ancient Babylon, Persia and Egypt, plus if we're staying with the culture, a new one would be established in Andalucía for a total of perhaps 4. Generally defunct for various reasons (Reconquista, Mongols, religious fundamentalism etc), any current day institutions are descendants in name only.

- Europe - apprenticeship model continues (although the percentage declines rapidly), plus I'd say that until about 14th-15th century a lot of the older and more established universities (Salamanca, Bologna..) had legit magic faculties, the English universities and Sorbonne being the exemptions there. Total number of schools would be perhaps seven major plus some minor, all founded from 11th to 18th centuries (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are merely the oldest, being founded to compensate for lack of other viable formalized education), all having particular areas - Hogwarts is obvious, Beauxbatons accepted students from Spain, Portugal and Italy after the Muggle university faculties closed down, Durmstrang is located either in Transylvania or somewhere in the Baltic states, plus there would be one in Scandinavia, european Russia, one of the German speaking countries and last would cover the other spot not taken by Durmstrang.

- Americas - apprenticeships, schools only took off after European colonization (and at least originally were founded by colonists, for colonists). Two in US/Canada (one on each coast), one in Brazil, one in Mexico (Yucatán?), one on the west coast of South America (either Peru or Chile). Smaller institutions may exist in the Caribbean and southeast South America (somewhere in the vicinity of La Plata)

- Japan has one large school that dates back to Meiji era, plus a number of smaller traditional schools (handful of teachers, no more than 20-30 students, modeled roughly on martial arts dojos), and the even more traditional apprenticeship model is still going strong

- India - any pan-Indian institution would be a British created one (again - mostly for the Brits), and either defunct or languishing on the verge of dissolution since Indian independence, but there is a myriad of smaller, regional ones, instructing in local languages

- China - eh. No ideas tbh, but likely some combination of apprenticeships, last vestiges of Imperial-era instututions and new ones of varying ages.

- Sub-saharan Africa - would be a combination of colonial-era schools (with French or English as language of instruction) that are past their prime and apprenticeships, some areas might have had independent schools (Ethiopia..).
