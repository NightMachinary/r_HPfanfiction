Because Rowling doesn't know nothing about how the word works. North Africa and the Middle East and Iran are more likely to have schools than having a random school in middle of Africa. I could buy that China doesn't have school because of the CCP(Chinese Communist Party) or India because of the British. But where go the wizards from Canada, Australia,New Zealand,South Africa to school. I why they don't go to Hogwarts.
