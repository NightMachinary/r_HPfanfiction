We don't know if the head of state are made aware outside of England. Different countries can work differently, especially with political turmoil like the cultural revolution I wouldn't be surprised if the wizards of China decided to stay aput for a while. Worst case scenario Mao would be obliviated the second the wizarding government learns what's going on.

And I don't see how tracking down muggleborn would result in the wizarding school closing. You're reaching a lot here.
