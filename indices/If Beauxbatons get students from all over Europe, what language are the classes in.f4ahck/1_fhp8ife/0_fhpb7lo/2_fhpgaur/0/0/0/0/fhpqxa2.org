That's actually a really intriguing premise. Do you know of any fics with despotic muggle regimes setting up their own wizarding societies to keep themselves in power and compete with the 'official' ICW-sanctioned wizarding society?

I'd love to see a realistic exploration of North Korea and wizards.
