Yeah, you'd probably have multiple MENA schools - if keeping at the same density as Europe (3), I'd guess one in Egypt, one in Iraq, and one in Iran, personally.

Then you'd need probably 1-3 more in Africa - I'd lean towards Ethiopia and Mali myself, as they could add some 'ancient magical history' to add to the world. But in any case there'd almost certainly have to be a ton of less prestigious schools all around
