  Rowling never says there are only 11 schools.

Yes I know, it even says so in the Goblet of Fire: the TWT was between the three /largest/ European schools - not the only three. That doesn't change the fact that the location of the listed schools is ridiculous, however, and the lack of an "old, prestigious school" somewhere in the Middle East at the very /minimum/ is absurd.
