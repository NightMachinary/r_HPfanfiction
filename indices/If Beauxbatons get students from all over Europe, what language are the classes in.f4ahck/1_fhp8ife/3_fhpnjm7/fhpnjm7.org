Rowling never says there are /only/ 11 schools.

She says that there are 11 prestigious schools the ICW recognizes. This is probably more akin to ivy league schools than normal universities.

With the tiny amount of wizards in the world, several nations probably don't have wizards or not enough to run a big school.

Then you have Africa, with the most cultures and languages in the world... It makes sense there is only one western school. Most tribes probably teach their own.

India is probably the same as is Indonesia and any island nations.

And hell who knows if the Aztecs, incas or mayans even fell in the new world. Wizard populations could be farrrrr different.
