Yeah exactly! Basically I started out with the Beauxbatons question because I'm french and I was talking about a potential Beauxbatons fic with a friend, and while writing the post my mind went into a spiral of : but wait, the problem is so much worse with the others schools, and at this point the language barrier isn't even the main issue, even population wise it doesn't make sense, clearly Rowling didn't think this through.. And now my fic world-buikding is stuck thanks to this nonsense...
