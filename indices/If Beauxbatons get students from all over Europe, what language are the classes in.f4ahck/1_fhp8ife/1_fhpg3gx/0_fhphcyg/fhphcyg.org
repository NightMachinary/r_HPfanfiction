Yeah, Beauxbatons/French magical society in general is something I've thought about a good bit too (being French as well :) ) - and I think it's best to just use what's in canon as a guideline. Trying to make sense of it from canon would be... futile at best, IMO.

Plus, letting yourself make some sweeping changes can be much more interesting!
