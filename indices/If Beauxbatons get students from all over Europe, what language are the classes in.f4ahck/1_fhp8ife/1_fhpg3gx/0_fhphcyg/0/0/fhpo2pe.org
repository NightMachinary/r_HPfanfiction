Yep, I always went with 11 ivy league schools. Ones with long histories and impressive schooling.

There are other schools put there, they are just not as impressive, very specialized or just don't have the history yet to make the top 11.

Ive also liked the idea that there was a great school in iraq that was destroyed by the Mongols.
