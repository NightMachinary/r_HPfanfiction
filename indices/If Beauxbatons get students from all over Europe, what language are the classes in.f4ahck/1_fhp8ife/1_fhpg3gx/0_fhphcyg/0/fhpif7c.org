Good to see a fellow baguette lover on reddit haha

I was doing research on canon (and actually there is very little canon things about Beauxbatons), and that part really couldn't fit with my head canon of the school.

Someone above suggested that Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Dumstrang were just the three best schools in Europe instead of the only schools, which I think is a great way of working around it!
