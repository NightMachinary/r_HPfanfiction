I'm less concerned with Europe and more worried about Asia and Africa each hosting a single school. The Americas with two is also terrible (/whyyyy/ is the South American school in a Portuguese speaking country? Why?) But Asia/Africa? If you want to talk about culture shock and a billion languages crammed into one place then look no further!
