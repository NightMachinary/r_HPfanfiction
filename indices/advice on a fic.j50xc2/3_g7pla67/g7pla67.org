My first long Haphne fic that I read :D So a lot of nostalgia for me. I definitely liked it, even if there may be more likeable versions of Daphne out there, but I liked the arguments and banter between Harry and Daphne. The people who don't like Haphne at all would say don't read it but I think give it a try if you think the summary is interesting. There are definitely worse fics out there and you can stop reading if you see it's not your cup of tea
