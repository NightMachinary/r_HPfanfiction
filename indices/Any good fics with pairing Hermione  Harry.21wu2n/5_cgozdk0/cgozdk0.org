Its an oldie but the best harry Hermione fix around. The series is Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori summers. It is a trilogy. Honestly I think that fix is better than canon. You can find it on schnoogle

Edit: I figured I should include a summary, Harry works as a spy and when he is targeted he realize how important Hermione is to him. Its also rated R :P
