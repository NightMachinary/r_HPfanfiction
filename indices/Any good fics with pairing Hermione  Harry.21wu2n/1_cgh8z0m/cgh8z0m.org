Vox Corporis is incredible. It may seem like it takes a while for the actual romance to get going, but stick with it, it's worth it. Also, remember that it was written as the most "true" Harry/Hermione fic possible (author's words). Highly recommended, 10/10. About 360,000 words long, and it's fully complete.
