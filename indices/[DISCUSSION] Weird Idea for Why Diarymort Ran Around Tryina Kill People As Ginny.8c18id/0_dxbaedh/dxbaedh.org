You really get the sense that Diarymort is a sixteen year old psycho playing supervillain; a more mature version of Riddle wouldn't announce that he'd taken a hostage, especially if he needed to keep her in privacy to enact his re-embodiment. He also probably wouldn't have sent the Basilisk out to forage in the school so often.

Young Riddle would feel the urge to flex his muscles & exert his powers, just to reassure himself that he was mega-mage; defiant, unstoppable, and mustache-twirlingly nasty.
