Well, it did say that every time Ginny poured her feelings into her notebook, it got more of a hold over her soul. So because of the large blanks in her memory and waking up covered in rooster blood, she got more stressed and afraid and put that into the diary in a feedback loop. So it certainly helped.

I still say that the whole possession thing in the books was on account of Voldemort's prodigious natural skill with legilimency. When he was young he wouldn't be capable of it, but as a horcrux it could definitely allow him to act as a parasite. Then again it could be a function of the Horcruxes themselves. An unattached piece of soul is an unnatural thing, and so it instinctively tries to reattach itself to a soul in whatever way it can.
