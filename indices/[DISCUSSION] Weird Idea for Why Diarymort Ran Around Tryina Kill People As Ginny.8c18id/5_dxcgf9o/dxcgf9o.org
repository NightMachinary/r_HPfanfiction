Each horcrux is influenced by the item it is created with: the ring with the resurection stone sill tries to get you to die, the diadem is intelligent enough to keep itself unseen and safe, the locket acts as a raving Gaunt,...\\
The diary seek to be a confident, to get you to "pour one's soul" into it. Unfortunately for it, it was the first horcrux and the sanest part of Tom RIddle, and Voldemort kept writting in it; over the years and Voldemort descent into insanity, the diary tried to give him good counsel but instead made Voldemort angrier and angrier, so he found a way to torture it, leading it to believe his goal in life was to purge Hogwarts from unworthy (read : muggleborn) students. Add to that a transfer of Ginny's infatuation for Harry, which the diary misunderstand (even alive and "sane", Tom RIddle did not really understand such feelings), and you get your recipe for mustache-twirling evil.
