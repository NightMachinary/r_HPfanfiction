My biggest problem with mpreg is that it completely kills the suspension of disbelief. I can believe in a lot of stupid shit, this is about /magic/ after all, but there are limits. I can buy cross-species mating, because that would explain Centaurs, and through Hagrid and Flitwick it's even canon. But mpreg is /literally/ unbelievable. /Tony Stark/ fits better in the HP universe than male pregnancy.

Also, when the plot points are about sexual practices that I don't ship that become a too large part of the story, then I lose interest. I'm not heavily into domination stuff, so any fic with Dom!Someone or Sub!Someone I just ignore. The more detailed your description is of non-mainstream stuff, the more likely it is to turn the majority of readers off. What's next, /Harry Potter and the Golden Showers of Professor Snape/? (Somewhere, someone just started to write a new HP fanfic.)

The fanfics are about the Harry Potter universe. If you want to introduce weird non-canon stuff it has to 1) actually fit in, and 2) be well written. Which usually means no slash, because most slash is just /very badly written/. Sirius/Remus usually works, Harry/Snape or Harry/Draco usually doesn't. /Friends/ have hot, steamy sex, enemies do not.

/Why/ is Harry a girl in your fic? Is there a /good reason/? If you just want to write hot, steamy sex with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]] then, honestly, Gay!Harry is much more believable than Fem!Harry. Even then, Ron/Draco is still more believable than Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco.

If you're a female writer who wants to write a self-insert fic with LeatherPants!Draco, write from the viewpoint of a Slytherin girl, because that's actually believable. If you just want to write hot, steamy sex, then perhaps you should do so [[http://www.literotica.com/stories/][somewhere else]].

Yes, I feel better now.
