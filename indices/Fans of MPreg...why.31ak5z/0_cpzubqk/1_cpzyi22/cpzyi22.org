Hey, there are good Fem!Harry fics out there. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long Journey Home]] is one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is another.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] has a well done teacher/student relationship between Harry and Ginny. They have nice hot sex on the teacher's desk, just like every good teacher/student story should.

The Firebird Trilogy is a pretty good Harem fic.

Forced marriages can be done well. /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ had a forced marriage going between Hermione and Crouch Jr.

Creature fics? Does werewolf!Harry count? There are quite a few of those.

All of these ideas can be done well. There is nothing inherently wrong about any of them. Mpreg on the other hand....
