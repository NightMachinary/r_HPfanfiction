Mine was an artistic statement of rough equivalence, not a condemnation.

I see mpreg fics as simply being from an AU 'verse where (some) men can do something...odd, not an author confused on "how is babby formed" being a massive pervert. More porn-sci-fi than perversion of nature.

It is no less valid (if slightly less "realistic") a fantasy than a teenage boy being magically "forced" to marry seven nubile young witches or a lust-crazed Veela, or /being/ a lust-crazed Veela, or a student having the magical soul-binding hots for a teacher (add Veela as required), etc.
