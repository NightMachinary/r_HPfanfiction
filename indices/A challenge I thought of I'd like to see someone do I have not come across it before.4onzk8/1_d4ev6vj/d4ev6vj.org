The best prompts are original (at the time) new ideas which can be made into a single sentence or statement, for example: "Severus Snape is Harry's father", "Harry Potter becomes Naruto's genie". What you have here is a bunch of unoriginal ideas put together into a 'plot' which tries to force writers onto narrow story lines.

I've never seen a 'Challenge' like this answered well. Most challengers ignore most of the points /anyway/. If you like a set of plot points like this, write it yourself.
