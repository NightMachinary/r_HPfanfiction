It's possible though. There's this thing which I can't remember the name of, like "super-impulses". Certain characteristics in animals are designed to evoke a certain reaction, but taken to their extremes. dilated pupils are attractive, or a certain hip-to waist ratio is arousing. You can basically exploit this part of the human psyche to get "supernatural" reactions by exaggerating these characteristics.

[[https://gfycat.com/ScaryWiltedCats][Just look at this shit]] for example, her face is almost supernaturally geared towards evoking a certain reaction, especially in combination with her expressions. Another (maybe slightly disturbing) example that comes to mind is this Valeria Lukyanova chick who does everything in her power to look like a barby, also an unnatural idealization of certain characteristics.

So, now the only challenge that remains is to find a girl that has Fleur's characteristics, i.e. long blonde hair, blue eyes and the kind of effortless beauty that makes you feel like all the other women are just doing something fundamentally wrong somehow.
