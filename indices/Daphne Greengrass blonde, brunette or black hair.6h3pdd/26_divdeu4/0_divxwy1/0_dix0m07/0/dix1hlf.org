Chill. The point of fanon is that if you want, she could be of Native American descent. My only canon based concern with that is actual nobles in our history weren't very welcoming of Native Americans. Why would their magical variants be any better? Though once again, fanon, make her a time travelling monkey in line for the British throne if you want, it doesn't matter.

Also, you're probably getting downvoted because you state it as fact that the hair is because of Native American descent. Like you said, we know nothing about her and this is reddit, either conform or be downvoted /s.
