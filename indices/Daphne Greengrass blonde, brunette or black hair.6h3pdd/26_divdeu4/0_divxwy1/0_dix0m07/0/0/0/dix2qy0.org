Fans be crazy. There are many places where standing out is not viable and fandoms tend to be one of those places. Especially HP fanfics, people read what they want, they like it and the characters get set personalities in their minds.

It happened to me, when I first got into fanfic, it was Harry and Hermione all the way and everything else was sacrilege but as I read more, I realised in the end, it's a story, people have different opinions and that going out of my comfort zone is awesome.

Let the downvotes flow, they are just fake internet points after all.
