That Snape is Draco's Gpdfather because it is interesting to read a relationship between the two.

That Sirius wears a leather jacket because I can see him being a bad boy that has the long hair and leather jacket and rides the motorbike.

Alice Longbottom being in the same year as Lily Evans. I love the idea of them being best friends and them having their children together. And I love the idea of Lily being Neville's Godmother and Alice being Harry's Godmother.

Fabian and Gideon Prewett being twins. It is never confirmed that they are twins. It is just assumed that they are. I like them being twins and after they died, Molly and Arthur had the twins and decided to name them after both.
