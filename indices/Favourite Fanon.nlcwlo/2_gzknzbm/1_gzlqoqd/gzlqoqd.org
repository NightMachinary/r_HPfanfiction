  Fabian and Gideon Prewett being twins. It is never confirmed that they are twins. It is just assumed that they are. I like them being twins and after they died, Molly and Arthur had the twins and decided to name them after both.

Okay fun fact about this the likelihood of giving birth to twins increases when the mother's side of the family has twins, so scientifically speaking this one is likely to be true.
