This times a hundred. If all you need for a magic spell or whatever is a piece of yourself, you can use whatever. That particular spell would likely work with anything that contains your DNA (which is likely why nails, hair, blood, whatever will work). If the ritual specifies something exacting, it's because folk have seen the results with random shit and saw that it didn't work, so they specify.
