My headcanon requires ritual sacrifices to be equal to what you receive. Thus, if you were using the one thousand dollars worth of steel(about two metric tonnes worth i believe) and used the philosopher's stone to transmute it to gold, you would get one thousand dollars worth of gold or less than an ounce.

So, sacrificing a kidney stone or gallstone or appendix would do nothing as that sacrifice is relatively worthless. A hand or a foot or an eye is worth so much more.
