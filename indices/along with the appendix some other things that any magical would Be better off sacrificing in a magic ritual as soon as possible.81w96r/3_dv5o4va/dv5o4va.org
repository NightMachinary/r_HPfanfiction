I think that most animals and magical creatures as long as they're not sapient, then, there's clear exceptions like unicorns, dementors, fenix, mostly because of rarity or danger. In context a creature that's ''too magical'' could boost or ruin a magic ritual, then again using parts for potions seem to work just fine as long as you know what you are doing.
