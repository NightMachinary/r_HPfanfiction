Doesn't look like much of a sacrifice if it's something they don't like. I've seen fic where harry sacrifices the marauders map, the cloak, his broom,etc . Or maybe sacrifice a sense, like taste or touch. The whole sacrifice thing is the more you gamble the bigger the effect, I guess that's where the babies and virgin sacrifices come from.
