A better way to put it would be following the letter or spirit of the law.

Like say a wizard is blinded in one eye(but there is a chance that one day magic might be able to fix his eye). They could sacrifice the eye and then go on to get a new eye like mad eye moody following the letter of the law or they could follow the spirit of the law were they sacrifice the concept of ever being able to see out of that eye again.

Both are valid sacrifices but one is worth more than the other
