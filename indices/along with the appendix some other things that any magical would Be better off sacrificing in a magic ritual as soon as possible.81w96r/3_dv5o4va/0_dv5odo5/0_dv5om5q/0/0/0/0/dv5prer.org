It mostly depends on context and the way magic reacts. If it's a ''mathematical magic'' then it could work as you say, something like FMA equivalence. Then if it's something like ''sentient magic'' using your bike example, it would be like selling the bike to yourself. If it isn't in some way truly important then it's not really a sacrifice, since you would be ''using'' not ''sacrificing''
