If you are getting ride of something you may as well get somethings out of it. A bit like when you want to get rid of that exercise bike you never use you could just throw it out but someone else might take the time to sell it and get somethings out of it.

Also with sacrifices I guess it would depend on if it was a physical or emotional sacrifice. You get more for the emotional sacrifices but some rituals probably only need the physical sacrifices.
