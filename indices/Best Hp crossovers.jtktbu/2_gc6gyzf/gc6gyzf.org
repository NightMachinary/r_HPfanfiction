Anything by mjimeyg. Especially "Harry Potter: Geth" and "Ah, Screw It!". But after I liked those I went and read the weirder crossovers. Harry Potter x Jurrassic Park? Sounds weird as fuck but was a fun read. Same as the Harry Potter x Rosario + Vampire crossover.

I also liked most of what Vimesenthusiast has done with Harry Potter.

None of the stories by either author needs you to know of the crossover universe in my opinion. I didn't know many of them and still had fun and understood everything.
