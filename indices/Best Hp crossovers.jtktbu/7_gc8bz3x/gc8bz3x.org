I recommend this a lot but this is one of my favourite crossovers linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930]]) avengers x hp with awesome world building with Loki and the reason he ended up like a â€˜bag of cats'

Then there is linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist]]) it's not an immersive crossover, there's just some great additions of monsters and curse elements from a game (which isn't mentioned on the first page, and I can't remember, sorry. However even though I haven't played the game, I think they did it really well, so it's worth mentioning.
