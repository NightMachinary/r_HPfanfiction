That just seems so unlikely. It make the mechanics of the game almost impossible. Two teams could run up the score in a 5 hour game, end with a score of 1020-1000, and pretty much knock the other two teams out of the running. It makes even less sense for a professional league. A point differential might make some sense but even that makes more sense as a tie breaker than the actual method for determining standings.
