Do you really think Rowling put any real thought into the sport at all to begin with? 90% of the action in the game is almost always rendered pointless by the actions of 1 person, who in cannon did nothing but hover above the game and watch.

its easier to just accept that she only created the sport as a plot device, and that in cannon it was quite terrible.
