It would seem so. The Lexicon is generally a reliable source, and this is what it says:

  Quidditch is always played in a series. Unless you're playing a pickup game in the apple orchard, every Quidditch match is part of a larger series of matches, and accumulated points are what count toward ultimate victory. The Quidditch Cup at Hogwarts goes to the team with the most total points, not the one who has won the most matches. The standings we see in the Daily Prophet for the British League (DP) list the teams in order of how many points they have in total, from Tutshill with 750 down to the lowly Cannons with only 230. Nowhere in the standings does it note how many matches each team won. Although we don't see evidence of it, there must be a similar system for the World Cup, which would imply that Bulgaria and Ireland were the top scorers in the world that year. Would it have been possible, then, for Bulgaria to have won the World Cup with Krum's capture of the Snitch, even though Ireland won the match? Apparently so.
