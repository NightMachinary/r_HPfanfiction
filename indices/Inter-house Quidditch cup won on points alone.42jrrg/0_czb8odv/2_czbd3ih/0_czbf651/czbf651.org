I could see rankings being counted towards the overall season. And then let's say the top 16 teams are invited to an elimination style tournament for the World Cup. During that tournament, it's win or be eliminated. I don't really follow sports, so I'm basing this on my knowledge of the NHL and how they have standings and that determines if they make the playoffs or not.

I think the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup is different than the World Cup or Quidditch league. It's more a round-robin type of setup where everyone plays everyone and there is no final match. I can see points being a better way to decide the winner, especially if two teams have the same amount of wins.
