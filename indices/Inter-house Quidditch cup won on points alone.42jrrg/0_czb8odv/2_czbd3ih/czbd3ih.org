  Although we don't see evidence of it, there must be a similar system for the World Cup, which would imply that Bulgaria and Ireland were the top scorers in the world that year. Would it have been possible, then, for Bulgaria to have won the World Cup with Krum's capture of the Snitch, even though Ireland won the match? Apparently so.

I don't really agree with this part actually. Just because league matches don't count victories as part of their rankings doesn't mean that a bracket tournament like the World Cup would do the same. Indeed, I am struggling to come up with an elimination system where that would work beyond simply getting rid of the bottom half of the tournament every round. But if that were how it worked, Rowling probably would have mentioned it in GoF at least in passing by saying something about how Bulgaria had to beat Ireland by at least 40 points to win or something like that, especially considering that she mentioned things like that for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.
