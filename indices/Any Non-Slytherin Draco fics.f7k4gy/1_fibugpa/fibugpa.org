Oh my gosh a non slytherin Draco? Le gasp! The shame! Can you even imagine it?! Draco being sorted in Hufflepuff and throwing a big fit. His dad coming to the school to say that the sorting hat got it wrong. Everyone in hufflepuff throwing him a welcoming party to make him feel better. Draco being slowly won over with food (lol apple pie? Drapple?) Draco becoming the biggest hufflepuff defender. Draco taking their quidditch team to the finals with top dog turned underdog storyline and learning the value of team work. Draco being told to do bad stuff for Voldemort like canon but when they wanted to turn him in before the big battle He defends Harry. Draco being on the good side during the battle and confronts his daddy issues.
