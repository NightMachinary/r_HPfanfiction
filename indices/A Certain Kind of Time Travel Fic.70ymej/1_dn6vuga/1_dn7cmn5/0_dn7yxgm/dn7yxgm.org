This one is really good. Just a heads up, it isn't completed yet. It's on hold until Shayalonnie finishes posting the edited and revised Debt of Time which is a must read if you haven't yet.

It's a Hermione time travel fic that starts at the end of HBP continues until Voldy is dead, she goes back to Marauders time and eventually returns to the present.
