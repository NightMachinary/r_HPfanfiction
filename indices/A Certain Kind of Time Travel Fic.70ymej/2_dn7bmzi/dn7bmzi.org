I really liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices]] by Aebbe. It is a next-gen time travel fic where Lily Luna goes back to Maurader time and meets her grandparents and Sirius. Then Sirius time travels forward. I don't want to give too much away but it is really well done - especially the time travel aspect. linkffn(5846417)

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/753415][Paradox series]] has a cool premise where adult Draco travels back in time into his 16 year old body and changes sides and eventually joins the trio for the Horcrux hunt. It eventually ends up Draco/Harry. linkao3(753415; 979182)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182][Cartographers Craft]] is a great DH - AU where 16 yr old sirius comes back somehow out of the marauders map. There is a lot to like about this fic - really great writing, interesting characters who are well-developed, a slow building and believable love story etc. It is my first (and maybe my only) sirius/harry fic and because there wasn't an age-gap between them, I really liked it. Also the search for the horcruxes was believable and interesting.
