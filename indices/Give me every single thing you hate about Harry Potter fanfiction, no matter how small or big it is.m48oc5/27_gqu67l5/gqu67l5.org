Another pet peeves thread? Alright.

The Hermione-wank and Ron-bashing are two big ones.

Canon rehashes that don't have any consequences in the long term, either to the plot or characters. Changes should build and evolve, not switch things around for a bit and end the same way.

The usual bad grammar/SPAG.
