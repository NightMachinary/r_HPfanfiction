Character bashing fics. This is my number one pet peeve that I do not like in fics. Usually authors don't like a specific character or a group of characters, and they write fics that depict them in a terrible light. I feel like a lot of character bashing fics are written by authors that don't really understand the character(s) in question, but just want to write a fic that depict these characters because they need 'antagonists' for their story.

If somebody doesn't like a character, then why write them into a fic? There's a lot of Weasley bashing fics out there that just make me shake my head because usually authors depict the Weasleys as being entirely evil when that is not what they were in canon.
