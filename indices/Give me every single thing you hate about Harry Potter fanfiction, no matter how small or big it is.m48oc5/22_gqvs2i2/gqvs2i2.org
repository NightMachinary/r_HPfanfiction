I'm a huge fan of Canon Divergence. So for me when something that's labeled Canon Divergence when they mean Alternative Universe.

Canon Divergence basically means if this one thing was different how would that impact the story. It means that everything before the What if? Is canon.

For me I'm happy with it just being Book Canon. Sure you can get creative with it. For example it's canon that Molly and Arthur married right after Hogwarts. Now we know because of the wiki when Bill was born 9 years after the fact. But because we don't know how old Molly and Arthur in book canon. I'm alright if an author wants to make the reason they got married quickly was due to a unplanned bun in the oven, then them being younger then canon.

What I can't stand is let's say you have a Ravenclaw Harry and he's smarter then canon Harry or just likes to read books. Ok awesome sure. Now if you have the same canon Hermione and you /don't/ have a scene where Harry makes an different impact on his first meeting with Hermione she then can't suddenly be a Slytherin. Canon Hermione is still then is destined to Gryffindor.

If the change doesn't do anything to impact or change the “fate” (because we know what's going to happen in the books) then the fate would still continue. Same thing can be applied to the past.

A What if Harry was Abused(you know more then he was in canon) fic you can't suddenly have the twins in Hufflepuff or muggle tech working or Snape being married. Because that /change/ the fanfic is proposing can't have an impact on past events to change them. If you have that then it's an called an AU.

All I'm asking for is for you to please properly label your fanfic.

I'll just step off this soapbox
