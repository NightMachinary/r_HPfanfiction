So primary sources regarding Celtic Mythology are really difficult to discern since its all rooted in oral tradition. For Gaelic (Scotland and Ireland) look to stuff like the Tain Bo Cuailnge and the Book of Invasions (This one was heavily christianised). For Welsh Mythology, have a look at the early sources of the Arthurian Legends and the Mabinogion. I would also recommend 'The Ancient Celts' by Barry Cunliffe. It discusses Iron Age Celts but many of the tenets of mythology (veneration of the number 3 and votive offerings to bodies of water) still survive(d).\\
All the information is just a google away.

The term for a non-malicious magic user i.e. Folk Healing and Divintation, is traditionally 'The Cunning Folk' or just Cunning folk.
