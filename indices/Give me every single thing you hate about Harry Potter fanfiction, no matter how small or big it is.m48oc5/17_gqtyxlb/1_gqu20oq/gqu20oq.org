Jesus Christ, ‘Wixen' I've never seen this used but it sounds terrible, and reminds me of the Godawful Wicca religion. I mean I have no problem with it but I'm pretty well versed in both Pan-Celtic mythology and Greco-Roman mythology, so I always get trapped by an author who establishes something that is very clearly an element of Celtic folklore and I think it might go somewhere interesting into actual Celtic ideas of Witchcraft but pulls the rug out by introducing strange bits of neopaganism that makes the author sound like an ‘edgy' teen goth.

If you want to get technical about it, despite what Harry Potter canon says, Witch is already a neutral term that just means a Malicious user of Magic.
