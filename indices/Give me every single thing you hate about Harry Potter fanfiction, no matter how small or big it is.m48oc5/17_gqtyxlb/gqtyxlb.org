The word "wixen." I understand the need for a gender-neutral word for witches and wizards, but "wixen" is just awful. And "magical" is a much better word that is already used in canon, and "magicals" is a reasonable extension of that.

Similarly, "no-maj," "mundane," and every other attempt to come up with a more politically correct word for muggles, especially when the characters go on to soapbox about how the word "muggle" is offensive and all of magical Brittain is racist for using it (except for indie!Harry's allies in the gray faction, of course). Every alternative they use always sounds more condescending and racist, or just makes not having magic sound like a disability.
