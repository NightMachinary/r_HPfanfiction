My original language does not use quotations marks for dialogue but I still use quotations if I'm writing in English. Because I mean... It's an easy rule to follow.

But even if I used the symbols from my mother tongue I don't think anyone would have trouble with it because they make perfect sense.

Sadly whenever I encounter a fic with different symbols is easy to tell they are not following the rules of another language and its really annoying because they lack consistency and an easy logical explanation.
