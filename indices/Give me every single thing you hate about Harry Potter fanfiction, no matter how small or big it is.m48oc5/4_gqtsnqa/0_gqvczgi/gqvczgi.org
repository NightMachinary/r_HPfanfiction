  I will not read something if the dialogue is written using something other than quotation marks (usually either ' or <<)

Hey, that's totally fine if those styles don't mesh with you, but I just wanted to let you know that [[https://jakubmarian.com/map-of-quotation-marks-in-european-languages/][a number of languages use alternate symbols]] (like '>> <<', ',, ''' etc) in place of English quotation marks, so things like that can be indicative of English not being the author's first language.
