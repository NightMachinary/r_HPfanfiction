I don't like bashing but also definitely think that writers should be able to criticize the grey characters. I don't like excessive idolization either. It's funny, but a lot of my least favorite examples actually come from Cursed Child. The characters will say "by Dumbledore" when a muggle would say "by God," and treating Dumbledore like a god was part of what led him astray when he was younger. I try to rationalize it by telling myself that wizards take the Lord's name much more seriously than muggles, which is why they almost always swear by historical figures instead of God, but I simply do not see Harry casually saying "by Dumbledore."

I don't like overlooking flaws either. After reading a bunch of fan fictions revolving around Draco, I was shocked when I reread the series and remembered what a complete prick he was. Like, he's a pathetic coward and bully. I even write fics centered around Draco because exploring a character's flaws is fun, but a lot of writers overlook the fact that he was awful and genuinely pathetic. The Slytherins suck. Protagonists don't have to be completely morally upstanding people, and the flaws need to be acknowledged. Draco's not a cool bad boy. He's a spoiled brat. Own it.

I will not read something if the dialogue is written using something other than quotation marks (usually either ' or <<) or if there are big spaces between paragraphs. It just really bothers me.

I don't like when authors get really personal or make commentary on the plots or characters in the notes. I want to forget the author is a person. I have to fight the urge to do this (and don't always succeed), so I completely understand the draw, but it makes me feel weird.

I don't like overpowered children or children knowing spells they would never know. I make this mistake too and think that writers should look up spells to see what year they would learn them if they're writing young characters. I want characters to have at most one or two special abilities, like maybe they're really good at Occlumency or learn the Patronus really young or can do Dumbledore-level magic like the fire whip, but not all of those.

I don't like uncontrollable wandless magic unless it's a metaphor for a mental disorder; if I use it, what I mean to communicate is that the character is bipolar without attaching the actual label. People being impressed by Harry accidentally making explosions because he's so strong is weird to me. Accidental magic is something you're supposed to learn to control as a child, so I view it as the equivalent of having a temper tantrum.

I don't like characters having as much information about the world as readers. I don't think Harry would tell the wizarding population absolutely everything about his life, but if he did, I want a writer to tell me that. I once saw a character reference Queenie from Fantastic Beasts and like maybe she's about to become infamous if she works for Grindelwald, but it was weird. I make this mistake in second generation a lot and tell myself that it's okay if it's coming from one of Harry's kids, but I don't really think it's okay. For example, I doubt a child would know about the half-blood prince or sectumsempra. Those things are really personal and wouldn't be necessary in any testimony. I don't think he'd tell people about the hallows. I am conflicted about how much I think the wizarding world would know about horcruxes.

As you can see, most of these are things that I have caught myself doing and tried to correct.
