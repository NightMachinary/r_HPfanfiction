True, there is no particular reason for a Wizarding Aristocracy to be a perfect mirror except for the 600 years of history or longer where the Wizards blended into wider society and the nobility, see Sir Nicolas de Mimsy-Porpington and Sir Cadogan, so we can assume that wizards have knighthoods. I think it would be much more interesting if Wizarding Nobility doesn't mirror the muggles but instead of Lord Bullshit, they have a completely different system with different titles
