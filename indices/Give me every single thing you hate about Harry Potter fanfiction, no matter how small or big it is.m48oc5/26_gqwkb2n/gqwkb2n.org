- May your gold flow blah blah blah

- Goblins literally offer aaaaaaall kinds of services to Harry because he remembered their names and was polite to them just this one time. And wished for their gold to flow like diarrhea.

- Authors forgetting that the goblins in canon are only bankers.

- Trunks that has a fucking mansion inside and has all the necessities

- Katana wielding Harry (fucking weeb)

- Swordsman Harry where he forgets that he can do magic and just works on hacking and slashing his enemies (would have been acceptable if it was like Gandalf in Return of the King where he uses both sword and magic to fight, he does not forget he is a wizard)

- Swordsman Harry where he is literally the only person in the story who can wield a sword. Enemies can't even defend themselves when Harry goes melee.

- Dark Slytherin Harry with a monarchy / heirarchy inside the house. God, that was the most bullshit fic I've ever read. 1st year Harry comes into Slytherin house and his housemates fall over their arses worshipping the ground he walked, referring to Harry as their King. I fucking hated it. I wish I could obliviate myself of that bullshit.

- Fics where Harry hates Wizarding society and glorifies muggles and their genius inventions

- Harry goes full muggle but remains in the Wizarding World (He uses guns! Cringe!)

- House Elf glorification (house elves can fucking teleport anywhere undetected and do some stupidly arcane magic unblockable by wizardkind)

- Harry refusing to be called Master or any respectful title by house elves. He wants just Harry. Just Harry.

- Harry learning House Elf magic

- Hermione worship (Harry leaves the thinking to Hermione, and Harry can't say any foul language)

- Luna Lovegood pretending to be a loony and is actually a superduper genius in secret

- Forced pairing bondages where Harry saves a girl, and that creates some bullshit bond that leads to Harry falling for the girl bonded with him

- Fics where Veelas are nothing but sex crazed nymphomaniacs

- Harry easily welcoming Remus Lupin to his life after being absent for 13 years (although this is canon, I still hate it when I read this in a fanfic)

- Harry and Hermione becomes girlfriend and boyfriend. Hermione's muggle father threatens Harry of some bullshit should he hurt Hermione's feelings, where Harry then becomes scared stiff going "yes, sir, I won't hurt your daughter blah blah blah". This shit is so cliche, isn't it? What I hate about this is a wizard is being terrified of a muggle.

- 12 or 11 year old perfect politician Harry

- Pussy fic authors who take offense at the term "muggle" so in their stories, people who use the word "muggle" are racists or bigots. God, I know there are touched people in the real world who get offended at anything and who get offended for others but feeling offended by a made-up word from a fictional story is just plain pathetic.
