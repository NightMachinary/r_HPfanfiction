Bunches of things but I suppose a big one that strikes me off hand would be nicknames/insult names. The nicknames would be things like Sirius/Remus calling Harry pup, cub, Prongslet, Prongs Jr etc. etc. etc. I always find those irritating beyond belief but as long as it's used as minimally as possible I can usually ignore it. What I can't ignore however are all the dipshit names for Dumbledore/Voldemort that for reasons I honestly can't comprehend authors still think are clever or funny such as Dumbledork/Dumb-as-a-door/Voldieshorts/The Dark Tosser etc. etc. etc. They sucked when whoever it was first wrote them and they still suck now. Even if I've been relatively enjoying a fic before that, the first time I see it used seriously in a fic I cringe so hard I have muscle cramps and auto x out.
