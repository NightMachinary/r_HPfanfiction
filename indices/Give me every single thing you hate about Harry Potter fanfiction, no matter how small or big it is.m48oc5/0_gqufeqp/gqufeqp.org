Ah yes, the instant close list. Here it is:

- Harry going on long rants about how horrible his life is to Dumbledore (all caps for extra effect ofc)

- Bashing

- May your enemies- no, shut up.

- Hermione wank

- Muggle wank

- OC wank

- Luna pulling some master-class act as her 'weirdness'

- 11-year-old slytherins seeing the twitch of a muscle in someone's face and making a sherlock holes-esque deduction from it

- Long-ass author notes explaining stuff i.e the setting of their fic or justification for a character's actions, etc. This should be a part of your actual story, broski.

- Harry is 7'1, built like a tank, has more magical power and knowledge than Merlin and the founders combined, but somehow things happen exactly as in canon.

- Glorifying Snape and Draco, those guys were assholes. Fuck 'em.

- Angst

- Best friend Neville (you've got potential.mp4)

- 600k words, 1st year complete

I'm sure there's more I haven't thought of, but yeah.
