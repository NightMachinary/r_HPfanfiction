The latter was just a joke because a lot of fics that add guns clearly have American gun culture in mind when it's completely different in the UK. Even if you watch US TV or games, it's just not the same here, and there's very little chance for people to avoid that fact. So if Harry has a Glock, an American probably wrote the fic.

I read one (which I dropped pretty quick) for example where somehow a nuclear weapon was involved and it was just bizarre that Harry kept talking about "the nukes"

And yeah, I mentioned other words/idioms/phrases Americans use by mistake in a different comment.

Also, wow... I've never come across a fic where the Dursleys were like that. Some that expanded on the canon stuff with more description, but never any that took it that far. I have no idea why people would do that, as I say the abuse was enough to kill him already, no need to make it worse again still.
