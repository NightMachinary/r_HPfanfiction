know the Dursleys were horrible to Harry, and I did not make light of it. Horrible abuse happens, and it's inexcusable. We, as adults, are supposed to protect children, not harm them.

Anyway, I'm talking about fics where Vernon and Dudley beat him with baseball bats, cut into hin with knives for the hell of it, and break every bone in his body.

These fics tend to be awful, and badly written trigger pieces. Often, the fic simply starts like that, with no build up, or anything. It's like author simply decided to have his relatives kill Harry.

Yes, I call it excessive, because it goes well beyond anything mentioned in canon. (NOT counting emotional abuse/neglect, which often has more lasting consequences). I drop fics like that immediately.

As to your other point. I don't understand what you're on about. Did I mention Americans anywhere in that point about guns? Explain, please.

And another point. You're supposedly from the UK, and as such, you should notice a difference in the way authors write. You know, phrases, idioms and the like. It should not be that hard to for an Englishman to spot an American. Especially when I, an Icelander can often spot them. I sometimes get the feeling writers are from the US. I check out their profile/bio on ffn. Lo and behold, they are from the US.

Now, they may not be American, but simply be writers who are influenced by American English via video games, movies, TV, and music. I can look past many things, but using words like "mom", instead of "mum", annoys me to no end. And I really don't think UK teens "go hang at the mall"...
