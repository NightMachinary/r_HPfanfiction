  Dursley abuse that should have killed Harry ten times over, before he even reaches Hogwarts. It's stupid and unpleasant.

Dude, they literally starved him as punishment, locked him up without a bathroom, and burned or hut him when he did stuff wrong.

The Dursleys were genuine pieces of shit, and I'm seriously surprised that they didn't kill him even in canon. He could have, would have, ended up with some serious medical problems as well as mental ones.

Abuse sucks, don't make light of it.

How do you know an American wrote a fic?
