Excessive Weasley bashing. Except Ron. I used to not mind it, but now it annoys me to no end. I know I'm being hypocritical, but I'm still annoyed Rowling had Ron and Hermione end up together, and I went my frustrations on poor Ronald.

Dursley abuse that should have killed Harry ten times over, before he even reaches Hogwarts. It's stupid and unpleasant.

Bad grammar, American English.

Making Snape into an overly sympathetic character. He surely had a hard life, but that is no excuse for bullying/mistreating children. He's a horrible teacher, and an awful person.

And guns. I HATE guns in Harry Potter.
