I really hate Ron bashing. Like yes we can highlight his bad traits, but why must people turn him into a drunk, belligerent, abusive cheating oaf? I also hate how much people hate on Dramione. I get that a huge chunk of it is brainless bad-boy golden-girl lust-driven tropes, but it seems like the most hated of all the pairings and people get so... passionate and rude about it??
