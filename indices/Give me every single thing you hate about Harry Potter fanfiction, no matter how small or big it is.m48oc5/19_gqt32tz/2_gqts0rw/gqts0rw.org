The bit about Ginny is also a huge pet peeve of mine. It's okay to date and have multiple partners, and it's not as if she was dating two boys at the same time. She dated a bit, realized what she wanted in a partner, matured a bit before her and Harry got together.

I tend to find that writers that depict Ginny this way are super young, and think that dating in school makes the girl a slut. It's pretty much the 'Not like other girls' trope...
