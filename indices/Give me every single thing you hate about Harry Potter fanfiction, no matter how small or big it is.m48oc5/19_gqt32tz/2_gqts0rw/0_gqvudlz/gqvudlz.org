Even if she was dating two boys and they all knew and were okay with everything, that doesn't make her "a slut".

Even if we accept slut shaming/labelling (and I don't), I think the only time it would apply is if Ginny literally just fucked every boy she saw.

And even then, my bigger concern would be if they're being safe than her morals or calling her a slut.
