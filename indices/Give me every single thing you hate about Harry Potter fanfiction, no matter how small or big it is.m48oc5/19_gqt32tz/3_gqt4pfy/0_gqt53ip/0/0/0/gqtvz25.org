Thanks, I'll look into it. From the 1st chapter though she just sounds like a mix of ruthless and outcast.

I've written Slytherins as being neutral in the War because they're scared of Voldemort and think discretion is the better part of valour, based on what I've read about how many people coped with living under regimes (e.g. WW2 occupied territories). The will to lay down one's life for one's principles is after all by far more extraordinary than commonplace.

So I'm interested in other portrayals in HP FF.
