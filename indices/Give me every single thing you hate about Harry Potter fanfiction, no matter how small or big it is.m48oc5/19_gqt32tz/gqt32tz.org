° I couldn't give less of a shit about Slytherins if I tried.

°Ginny being a slut because she dated two boys in three years

°Harry (and sometimes Gary Stu!Neville) being the only datable guy in the castle seemingly.

° The general attitude that the richer you are, the better of a person you are.

° Convoluted reasons for Harry to somehow meet Hermione before Hogwarts.

° Friendly goblins

° Daphne

° Every Ravenclaw bullying Luna, always led by Cho and Marietta (and sometimes Padma and/or Michael C.)

° 'It's not bashing, it's how they are in canon !'

° Comically over the top Dursley abuse. Like the ones where they eat Hedwig for Christmas dinner.

° Slytherins getting praised by the narrative for nothing

° Magical cores.

° Ron/Ginny/Molly/Hermione/Dumbledore bashing

° Using characters as your mouthpieces for your shipping/political opinions.

° Luna being a flawless goddess

° Greg, Vince and Millie

° "ZOMG Ginny looks just like your mom !"

° Dumbledore/Weasleys/whoever the author doesn't like getting enslaved for life in Gringotts life as punishment for being so EEEEVVVILLLEEEEE. Usually ends with a dragon shitting on them.

° First Year study club.

° Harry having an all-caps temper tantrum every other chapter, where he complains about how shit his life is, and then proceeds to insult everyone in the room, and then leaves without any repercussions.

° Twinspeak

°Wizengamot factions that literally have "light" or "dark" in their names

° Slytherin persecution complex

° Heckin 100 uwu holesumness
