So I don't exaggerate much (the only thing I exaggerated was the Dursleys' abuse on Harry and that's because I like angsty whumpy stuff) and the one event that is me "making crap up" is a plot point in my fic for things other than unneeded hate towards a character.

Harry doesn't hate anyone in my fic, though he does get annoyed at a few characters?

I don't really know how to explain. I don't exaggerate situations much, none of the characters do anything so out of character (like love potions) that would make the reader or Harry/any other character hate them unecessarily, I don't depict any chracters as horrible people (I only use their canon characteristics, such as Molly's overbearing and pushiness), no one just outright attacks Harry (or any other character) for no reason (I mean, other than Voldemort, but that's to be expected).

Does that explain?
