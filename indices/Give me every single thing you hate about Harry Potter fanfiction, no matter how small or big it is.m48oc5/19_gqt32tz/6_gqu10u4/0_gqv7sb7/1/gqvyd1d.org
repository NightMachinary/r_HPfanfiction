I'm sorry, but no.

Think of it this way. That scene is basically Sirius, discovering his best friend and his wife have been murdered, but his GODSON is alive, yeeting him onto Hagrid who is not LEGALLY allowed to perform any magic and has limited schooling in it anyway, while the wizarding world is technically still at war for a few more days at this point.

At a MINIMUM Sirius should have taken Harry to Dumbledore personally, because at least Sirius can magically defend himself.

Sirius prioritized revenge over the best living connection that he had to his best friend.

Sirius Black in a great character, I love him, but his actions are NOT excusable. Forgivable later down the line? Sure, but there is no excuse for his actions
