I think it's a fanon assumption that you can't Apparate with babies. I don't think it's ever specified, but I would assume that, just as you can Apparate with grownups and children, you can Apparate with babies. Why would they be any different?

What does it matter that Hagrid had Sirius' bike? It's HAGRID we're talking about, and he isn't allowed to use magic of any kind. He had his wand snapped, so he's defenceless as far as the ministry knows. Besides that, he hasn't had any real form of magical schooling, as he was kicked out in, what, 4th year? Death eaters would easily be able to overpower him whether he was by the house or in the air on the bike, as they've finished their schooling and don't have any qualms regarding using lethal means.

It was INCREDIBLY irresponsible of Sirius to go after Peter. He knew all of that, he knew that Harry was still in danger out in the open like that, as Voldemort could've had backup just around the corner. Besides that, many of the Death Eaters were still out and about, as evidenced by The Longbottom Attack which happened AFTER Voldemort had died. Any alive Death Eater could've gone after Harry after Sirius left. Sirius didn't even know where Hagrid was taking Harry, if anywhere.

So yeah, I can understand bashing Sirius' actions because of this, despite him obviously acting out of grief then.

His first priority should definitely have been Harry's safety at the time.
