Voldemort did not wage war against Britain alone.

The death eaters are all still out there, and Sirius decides REVENGE is more important than protecting his defenceless baby godson. Hagrid is of almost literally no value in a fight against death eaters, he cant defend himself from any significant magical assault.

Sirius is basically saying the moment he leaves that revenge is more important to him than ensure his godson remains alive during a war when more death eaters could appear at any moment.
