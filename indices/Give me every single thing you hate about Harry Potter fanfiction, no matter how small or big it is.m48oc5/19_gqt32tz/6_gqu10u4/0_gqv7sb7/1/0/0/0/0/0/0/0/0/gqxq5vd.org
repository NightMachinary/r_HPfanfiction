Oh yeah I know, I just don't agree on that decision. I don't think many people who've just seen their best friends' dead corpses and their godson who is still alive but in danger, would go “hmm, let me just leave my infant godson in the hands of a dude I distantly knew in school, who doesn't even have magic, to go hunt down and kill my former best friend for killing my other best friends.” It's just bad writing in my opinion
