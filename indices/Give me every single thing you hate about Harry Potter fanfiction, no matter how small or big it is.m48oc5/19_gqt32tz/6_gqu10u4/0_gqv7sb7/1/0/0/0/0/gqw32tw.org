You right Dumbledore isn't defenceless. But Dumbledore didn't show up at Godrics Hollow, Hagrid did.

But Hagrid cant aparate.

Meaning for the entire journey, Hagrid and Harry would be EXTREMELY vulnerable until they reach Dumbledore at hogwarts, instead of Sirius just taking him there himself as he should have. Would have taken him maybe 5 minutes to PERSONALLY ensure Harry's safety AND it would have been an action which would cast doubt of Sirius being the one to betray the Potters (because why would he personally ensure Harry's safety if he betrayed the potters in the first place?)
