I mean, I can't either, but from the point-of-view of an orphan whose only remaining family member that supposedly loves him didn't get out completely for him, but for revenge... Harry's definitely going to feel disenheartened by the fact that Sirius didn't want him, but Peter (amongst other things). There's also the mental illness that I'll be "bashing." Like, I'm not going to judge Sirius for having some serious PTSD and for being pissed and heartbroken after his best friend, his brother, and his brother's wife were killed. Harry definitely would've done something similar, Hell, he has done something similar, but Harry is still going to be on the fence for whether or not Sirius is someone he should completely trust. I'll be bringing up a whole "Who do you trust more, me or Dumbledore?" in my fic, for both Sirius AND Remus.

And yeah, Sirius should've at least told Hagrid what was up. I can get being blinded by rage and heartbreak, but still, he should've thought of his godson.
