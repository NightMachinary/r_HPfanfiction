I /do/ actually use canonical reasons/characteristics for */slight/* bashing.

Snape for mind-raping Harry and being a dick, the Dursleys because I may or may not be exaggerating Harry's abuse /slightly/, Dumbledore for being a cryptic son-of-a-bitch and for trying to control Harry and ignoring his abuse, Ron for fourth year, Hermione for events that will happen in third year that will make them loose friends in the end, Sirius for going after Pettigrew, and Molly for taking over Sirius's house and trying to mother Harry and for being overbearing.

I'd rather say dark, light, and neutral for different political views. But then there's Dark, Light, and Grey for "magic classification." Like a genetic way your magic swings or whatever. Like you're better at that type of magic over others. And Dark magic is just a different type of magic. Like how some people are better at Charms while others are better at Transfiguration. Some people are better at Dark magic, some Light, and then there's Grey magic which is strictly neither light nor dark but also both.

For my own headcanon (which I don't always use), when you join the Wizengamot (like when your parents step down) and you're inducted, you get to choose whether or not you're conservative, neutral, or liberal (is that the right word?). And you can change this at any time.

I used the magical core thing simply to explain my version of magic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lp4upg/just_posted_the_new_chapter_for_my_fic_hbi_hr_at/gobqyif/?context=3][Here]] is a link to a reply I made describing my version of magic. I thought it was interesting since it combines some of my own ideas and what I observed in canon (slightly).
