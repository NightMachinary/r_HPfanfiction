I love Ron's character. I still can't write him properly, but I love stories exploring Ron's friendship with Harry and Hermione. I once read a fanfic that was off to a great start, but then showed Ron as having a weak personality and character. All because the author saw reviews where the vast majority of her audience was saying how much they hated Ron.
