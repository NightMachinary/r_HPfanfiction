When Ron isn't presented as important as Hermione and Harry. When they are friends, somehow Harry and Hermione are constantly in each others thoughts and Ron (if he is mentioned) is a passing line. That's particularly a big one in most Time Travel fanfictions. It bothers me so freaking much. And don't even get me started when Ron is replaced completely.
