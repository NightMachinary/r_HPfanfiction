-Tense switching. Just write in past tense unless you are very confident you can do present tense well.

-Bashing. It's lazy. It usually takes a well flawed character and turns them into some kind of one dimensional villain. I'm fine with people exploring the darker sides of characters, but not if the result is flat boring characterization.

-Glorifying elitist pureblood culture with very problematic customs. Again, I love it if it's explored in an interesting way, but too many fics end up romanticising frankly abusive themes in the name of 'pureblood customs'.

-Explaining all your choices in Author's notes. Fit your justification into your story.
