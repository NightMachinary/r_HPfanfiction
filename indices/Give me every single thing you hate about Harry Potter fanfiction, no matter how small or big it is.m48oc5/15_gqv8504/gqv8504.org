Hmm... I'd have to say what frustrates me more than anything else is the lack of fics that truly dig deep into how fucked up and bigoted Wizarding Society, at least that of Britain, is towards more than just muggleborns, without making it the /entire/ plot. There's a good amount, I just wish there were more.

Oh, also people making 11-14 year olds horniness personified.
