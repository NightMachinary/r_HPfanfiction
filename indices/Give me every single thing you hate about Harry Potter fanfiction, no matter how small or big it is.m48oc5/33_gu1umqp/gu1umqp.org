God okay I hate so much I'm really fussy with fics

-superhero!Harry who has a bajillion different skills/traits/powers that apparently he was born with that service only for stale plots. Like no thank you, goodbye. I understand that some skills, yanno maybe Harry has a weak metamorphagus ability because both his parents carried that recessive gene. Or Harry has untapped legilimency ability, meaning that If he were to train, he'd be better at the skill than average. But making him a super overpowered main character? He's an 11 year old neglected, overwhelmed child. Shove right off

-snarry. Need I say more?

-goblins are crafty little bastards who most certainly dislike wizards at best, want to slaughter them in their sleep at worst. They would not offer all these bloody services. Especially not for free to a child who they could very easily exploit for gold.

-overly abused Harry. Maybe a bit contraversial, but this so would not have happened without social services being alerted. Harry was definitely neglected, without a doubt, and abused to an extent. He was probably touch starved, emotionally stunted and malnourished. He would not, however, be whipped with chains and bat's without either dying or being so severely injured teachers couldn't ignore it. I also just hate really badly written fanfics that have no idea what child abuse/neglect does to a child. Do some research, please.

-I also hate most ravenclaw! Harry fics. They just seem to thing Harry in Canon is thick as Scottish mud. Harry was an intelligent child, powerful in his own right. But he was, again, stunted by his upbringing and childhood trauma. Ravenclaw Harry fics piss me off. Yes, maybe he'd be more academically inclined, but he would not spend all day in a library because books. Man's would still be curious and adventurous
