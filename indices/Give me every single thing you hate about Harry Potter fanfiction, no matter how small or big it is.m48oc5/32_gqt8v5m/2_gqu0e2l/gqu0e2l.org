Somewhere in the range of 85% of my readers are American. I don't mind Britpicking as being gentle criticism, but frankly the people who demand it are irritating.

An author of a very well-known HP fic, upon coming across my story on a forum asking for writing help, said it wasn't even worth his time because I described the spring weather as 'crisp' in my opening sentence. THAT is what Britpickers are like.
