Maybe it's a British thing to be uptight about that. You're reading words on a page. If it was a TV show with dubbed voices, I could see it being irritating, but Britpickers are just as douche-y when authors use incorrect British terms/words. It's a no-win for fanfic writers unless we decide to go spend a year abroad to research stories that we provide for free.
