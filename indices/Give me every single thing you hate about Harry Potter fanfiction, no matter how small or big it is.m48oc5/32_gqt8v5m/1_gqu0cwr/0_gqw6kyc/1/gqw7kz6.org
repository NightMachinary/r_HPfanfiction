I'm being awfully pedantic.

Based on a skim read, it seems like a good attempt, thought there are a few things that stand out to me. Minerva being from An Gearasdan (Fort William) and seemingly being Gaidhlig native, likely wouldn't speak Scots like that. Also very minor but the lack of a â€˜Hiv and hae' distinction, though this may differ to your experience.

Some of it seems closer to Scottish Standard English than Scots.
