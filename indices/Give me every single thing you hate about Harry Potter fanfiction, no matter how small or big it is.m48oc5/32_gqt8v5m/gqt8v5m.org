Americanisms. The characters are British, therefore do not say "mom", "fall", "faucet" etc. It's irritating.

I love when non-native writers do British well - I read one recently that was McGonagall backstory and they were using Scottish terms correctly which was awesome.

Also in general writing, it's annoying that loads of folk use "loose" when they mean "lose" or "rouge" for "rogue".
