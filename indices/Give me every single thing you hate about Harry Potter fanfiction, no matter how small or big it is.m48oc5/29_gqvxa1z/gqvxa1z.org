The use of far too many family names. Like in canon we have Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, but does anyone call him that? No! He is just Albus Dumbledore.

So why the fuck is everyone calling Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peveral etc etc

I'm in a bit of a minority in that I actually LIKE alot of the stories with Harry controlling all those houses, but this pisses me off because that's not how it would work. At WORST he would be Harry Potter-Black and in EXTREMELY formal settings he would be INTRODUCED as Harry Potter-Black "of the houses Potter, Black, Gryffindor, etc etc"
