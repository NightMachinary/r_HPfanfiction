Overpower Hermione: I love her, but I already have read fics that Dumbledore says she's smarter than him and she's not even graduated. In the same fic, Hermione learns how to build a quidditch broom "just in case".

Draco Malfoy as Head Boy in 8th year: even though I read these fics every now and then, I'm pretty sure Draco would be a persona non grata, far from receiving this position. There was one good fic that explored this as Draco suffering bullying from other students that lost people during the war and Macgonagal turning a blind eye to the situation because she's not feeling very charitable towards him either.

More realistically, for 8th fics, Hermione and Neville as Head students make WAY more sense.

Hermione prefers doing ____ the Muggle way: I can understand preferring to boil water for tea using a kettle, but I don't understand so many authors writing that Hermione prefers doing the dishes by hand. Seriously, who likes to wash dishes? Didn't humankind invent dishwashers to exactly avoid this task? It's even more annoying when this fics portrait HG as a workaholic. After a long shift ar work, the least thing I want to do after coming home is to wash dishes.

Muggle tech being used in a lazy way: self explanatory and plenty of people already mentioned it in other comments.

Suddenly everybody knows how to perform Patronus spell: Canon always says how hard is to master this spell, but then in a lot of fics everybody just uses it all the time for communication. If it was so easy and wide-spread, why bother with owls? For me, it doesn't seem that technically is a hard spell to perform, but of having a happy memory strong enough to cast the spell. Surely not everybody will be able to do that.
