Is not that I especially enjoy that portrayal of Hermione, I actually don't think it suits her at all BUT washing dishes is something that some people do enjoy doing. The fact that you can't imagine it is your personal experience and doesn't make it unrealistic.

Also, Hermione does make a very reasonable character to transform into a workaholic.

And the thing about the patronuses is more a cannon mistake than a fanon one.
