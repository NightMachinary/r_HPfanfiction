About the Patronus, I don't mind if the character casting it was part of the Dumbledore's Army or the Order of the Phoenix.

What bothers me is, for example, is either Pansy Parkinson casting it in fics where she's only a spoiled brat (so she's not working as an Auror, or something like that) or Minister Hermione's secretary using it instead of the memos, you know? It's almost the same issue as fics that makes cell phones kind of common for the wizard folk.

The point about Hermione, it mostly just feels to me as a cheap/easy way to reinforce that HG is a muggleborn and "doesn't forget her roots". There's more to it than just the fact that I just hate doing dishes (I actually do) haha.

Why can't it be a weekly visit to a muggle library/bookstore? Or going to watch a movie?

As a muggleborn living in the wizard world, I'd personally would miss a bunch of other stuff instead of doing the dishes
