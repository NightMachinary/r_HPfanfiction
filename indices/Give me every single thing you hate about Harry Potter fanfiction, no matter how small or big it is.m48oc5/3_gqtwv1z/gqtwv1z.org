When 11 year old Harry or OC characters find out they're magical and go to Hogwarts with a grown up mindsets and are master manipulators / can talk their way out of every situation and outsmart their peers and teachers to display how much better they are than everyone else. I really don't like these. To me, it just looks like the author wants their character to be so overpowered and revered upon entrance to the magical society, as if anyone would give an 11 year old the time of day. Harry Potter defeated the dark lord when he was a baby and in canon he still gets looked down on by his peers when they get annoyed at him because that's how people are.

Things I specifically don't like about the above point: - Harry/OC finds out about the magical society and immediately knows all the right questions to ask in their first trip to Diagon Alley - calls Dumbledore out on his shit in their first meeting - teaches themselves Occlumency in their first or second year - somehow knows how to interact with every other student to resolve any conflicts and with their wise words gets them on their side - outsmarts professors---the experts in their field---on topics with cool confidence despite not even knowing of the wizarding world a few months ago - is just good at every single thing they do

I feel like authors who write like this just want to show how much more powerful and smart they would be if they lived in Harry Potter. But it's so unrealistic because no character, unless they're an SI reborn or placed in the HP universe, would just happen to have enough knowledge to do all this and be so perceptive and understanding of EVERYTHING at a glance.
