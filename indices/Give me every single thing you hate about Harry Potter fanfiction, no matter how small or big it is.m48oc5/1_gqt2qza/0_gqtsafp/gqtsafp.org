  People who insert modern things in without context is a big one. I read one which claimed it was still set on the 90s but somehow they had iPods and smart phones and laptops. They explained them using them by saying they worked out how to convert them to run on magic but... It was fucking 1992 in the UK... Nobody had anything like that as kids. Hell, I didn't get a pocket radio until 2005? MP3 players were rare and expensive, and no one I knew had iPods until like 2008.

While I totally agree with you that inserting modern technology sucks, I think the reason for that is that some writers are really young. They are like 14 or 15 years old. I teach kids that age - they were born around 2005 - they don't know a world without the internet or ipods, laptops and mobile phones. I teach history and last year I asked my 11 year olds if they know when the internet became mainstream - they were totally baffeld when I told them that I didn't had internet at home until I moved in my own flat - and that I am not even 30.
