Haha, yes. Children are notoriously bad with time. A real understanding about what is a year, a decade or a century is something that only developes during the early stages of puberty - sometimes even later, when they are already nearly young adults (it depends on the individual).

So because the internet was already there when they were born, they know it's something newer, but they can't estimate what "something newer" means in a historical context; I had children who thought it was always there, those who thought it's around for nearly a century, some who thought it's around for 50 years and then a handfull who (correctly) estimated about 15-20 years.
