Wait, seriously?! I know that they've always known the internet, but that they never thought about it not having existed until recently blows my mind. Like, I'm only 25 and I remember the internet before google was a thing and before web 2.0, and the internet now (everything they will have known) is even further evolved!

Just wow. I'd love to see their reaction to dial up now! ðŸ˜…
