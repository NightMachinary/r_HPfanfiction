I was about to be like "stfu boomer" but then I noticed 1. You aren't even 30, and 2. you're totally right. I'm part of the older bit of gen z who are mostly aware of that stuff, but I'm actually terrified for the younger bit. They have no awareness or comprehension of existence without being constantly connected to the internet.

Fuck, even I'm constantly connected but at least I'm using it to read instead of being sucked into TikTok for eternity.
