I think that is a little bit biased. They aren't that different to my generation or even to the beginnings of generation z, they are just children. Some of them are bookworms, others aren't - only the games they play are different. I remember that many kids my age had game consoles like the game boy advance when I was around 10-14. We played Pokemon or Zelda in our breaks and the adults were like: "It's the end of the world." "Those kids will never learn to read properly."

The truth is, that every generation had their games and things that were more interesting that books for great parts of their generation. And awareness that things were different before your time (historical awareness) is something you have to learn with age, because it's difficult for a childrens brain to grasp when you have so many things to learn.
