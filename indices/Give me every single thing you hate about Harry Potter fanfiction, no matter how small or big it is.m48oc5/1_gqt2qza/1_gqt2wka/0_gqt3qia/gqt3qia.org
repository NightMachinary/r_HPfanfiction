I think it's just a gradual thing as time has moved on. When I was little (late 90s early 00s) Americanisms were /really/ foreign despite watching the Simpsons and Buffy or whatever other TV. Now a lot of them are as common as the British ones for people younger than me, I think it's the Netflix affect, just a lot more American TV.

But sometimes a fanfic writer makes no effort at all to actually avoid American phrases, some genuinely seem to think the Scottish Highlands must be an American high school or something
