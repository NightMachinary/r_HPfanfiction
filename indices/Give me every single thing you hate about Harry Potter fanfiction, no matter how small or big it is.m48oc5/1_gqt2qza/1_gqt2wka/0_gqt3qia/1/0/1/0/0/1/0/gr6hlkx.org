Oh yes. I remember those old school lists. We had 'pair of outdoor running shoes' and 'pair of indoor running shoes' as well. It's funny, in high school we never had the same list and usually only wore one pair of shoes throughout the day. Though, in high school we had to buy our own reading list for English and French literature... Those were fun. /eyeroll/
