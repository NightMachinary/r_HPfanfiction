Oh no, like is definitely used in the UK, maybe not as often but still is. I remember on girl being told off by the teacher because every sentence she went "like", I swear one time it was every other word for a paragraph! I think it's probably used as a joke with an American accent because of all the high school clich√© movies and that it /is/ a thing teenagers do/did. (See also "totally")

The only insulated trousers I've come across we literally just called insulated trousers lol
