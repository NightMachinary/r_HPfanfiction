What /are/ snow pants?

We may just not have them in the UK, a lot of North America stuff for winter doesn't happen here because we've got a more temperate climate. If we get snow here it's usually not that bad unless you're up a mountain in the Highlands or on one of the outer northern islands.

"Like" is common in British English too, so you probably don't have to worry about that
