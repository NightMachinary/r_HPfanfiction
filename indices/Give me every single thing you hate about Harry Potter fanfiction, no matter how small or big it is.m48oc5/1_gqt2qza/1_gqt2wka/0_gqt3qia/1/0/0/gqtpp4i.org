In Cursed Child, Scorpius Malfoy says, "No way, Jose," which I absolutely cannot imagine would be said by a British person.

I grew up in NY, but my parents live in London, so I feel like I should be better at weeding out the Americanisms, but sometimes I feel like I'm trying too hard or messing up so I'll intentionally use Americanisms. Like, I would never have a character call another character a "bellend". I'd always say "dick". I'm also insecure about saying "arse" instead of "ass".

The one thing I absolutely always forget is that "trousers" are pants and "pants" are underwear. Actually, if anyone could tell me what a British person would call "snow pants", I'd love to just go back and edit it. And I struggle to weed "like" out of dialogue. And say "mom" instead of "mum" a lot but always catch that in edits.
