Mainly just American English used instead of British English. Like: "I'll write you", "I can't even", "grade" instead of "year", "my bad", some of the ones that were from the book translations ("kick the bucket"), then there's little stuff like "store" and "district" or "block", "flashlight", "restroom" (just say loo!), "Mail", "cart", "vacation", in certain /other/ fanfics "panties"
