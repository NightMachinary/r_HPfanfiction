The thing is that many fanfic writers can do research into Britain or into the British school system. We live in the age of the internet where information can be easily found with a simple search. It's understandable for an American writer to not know the British slang or the usage of the English language, but the same thing can't be said with the school system when that can be easily found out.

I write in a funny way but that's because I have British grandparents, received a very Canadian education, and speak French. My cousins overseas have compared my English to that of a French speaker, but with the added bonus of Canadianisms. Apparently, I only sound British when I am 'incredibly angry'. :P
