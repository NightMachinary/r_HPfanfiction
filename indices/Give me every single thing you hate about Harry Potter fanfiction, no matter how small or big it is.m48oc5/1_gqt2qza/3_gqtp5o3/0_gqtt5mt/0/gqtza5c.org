I feel like exposure to British English helps a lot. I have family that come from or reside in Britain. So I was exposed to the language through that, but due to being born in another country outside of Britain, I have picked up a lot of my own country's English. However, there's a lot of literature that is written by British authors or television/movie set in Britain where you can really pick up the language spoken in the UK.

When I was more active in fandom, I always got a Britpick to make sure that the language was alright. There are so many writers/betas out there that will be more than happy to look at your fic and edit it, give you advice, etc. Not a lot of people ask for help in fandom, unfortunately.
