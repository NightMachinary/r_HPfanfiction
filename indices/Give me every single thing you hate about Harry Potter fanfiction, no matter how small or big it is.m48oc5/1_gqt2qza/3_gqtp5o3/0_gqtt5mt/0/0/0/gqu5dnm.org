My family comes from two areas in England. There's the family that comes from Yorkshire and the family that comes from the London area. I can understand the thick English accents from Yorkshire, but can't really understand the dialect if my family from there speaks Yorkshire English. The ones from London don't really have that problem and I can understand them just fine. Sometimes, I have to speak louder to my cousins because of my accent, but sometimes I get the feeling that they are just pulling my leg and are saying that they can't understand me when they can.

The French side of the family is the same way. I had a French cousin in France that refused to speak to me unless I deepened my very obvious Canadian French accent. I refused to speak French out of spite. Every time she spoke to me in French, I would answer her in English.

I don't understand Scottish English as well as I do the English spoken in England. I once read a book (a medieval mystery series) by a Scottish author that wrote a lot of Scottish slang or Scottish English into her book and half the time I couldn't understand what she was trying to say. I mean I loved the book for what it was, but my enjoyment of the story went down because I felt like I needed a dictionary and felt real stupid. I can understand what is being said to me by a Scottish person who is speaking in English. I was in a Pipes and Drums band that did a lot of competition with highland bands that came from Scotland, so listening to them speak with their accents became real easy after awhile.
