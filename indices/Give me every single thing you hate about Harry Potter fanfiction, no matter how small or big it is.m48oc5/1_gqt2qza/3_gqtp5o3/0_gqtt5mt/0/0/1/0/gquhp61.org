Probably the biggest culture shock I had when I went to uni /wasn't/ that I was in a Welsh first language city, but it was actually that I didn't always understand or communicate easily with the other /English/ students. Sometimes it really was a bit awkward to sort out some dialectical words.

I sometimes wonder if people outside the UK realise how regional our languages are? Hell, even in Wales there's like 3/4 dialects of Welsh at least!
