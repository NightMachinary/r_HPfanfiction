That's true. I am British so don't really need a britpick, but I have found myself going "hang on a moment, nobody said that in Britain until recently" with some Americanisms. My solution is to imagine reading it to my dad, because if I ever said anything that could have been American as a kid he /always/ told me off and then gave me the English version.

I kinda get the dialects from other countries thing, I'm English, but I grew up in the south and none of the rest of my family did. Hell, one half is mostly /not/ English despite being British. So I grew up hearing Yorkshire, Scottish, Irish, and even Cornish English, as well as the local English. So I sometimes end up saying something which just doesn't match my accent or the local dialect down here.

Like, I work in electronics, right? And I had this one board and I passed it to my coworker and said "It dinnae work". Totally normal to hear those words from my mum, but it sounds dead strange out of my mouth
