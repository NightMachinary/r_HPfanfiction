I can forgive the Americanisms as well. There are different versions of English and with writing, authors will generally write the way they were taught. However, there are Britpicks out there where they will beta your work to make sure that you are keeping things British.

I am a Canadian so am exposed to the British English and to American English all the time. The 'Canadian' editions of Harry Potter that I grew up with are the UK editions. However, an American pen pal of mine sent the first three books of the American editions to me in an exchange, and they are different. The language in the American editions is different in comparison to the UK (or Canadian) editions. I suspect that to make things easier for an American audience that the publisher edited these books heavily.

My American pen pal always commented how different the Canadian (UK) editions were in comparison to the American editions she grew up with.
