People who insert modern things in without context is a big one. I read one which claimed it was still set on the 90s but somehow they had iPods and smart phones and laptops. They explained them using them by saying they worked out how to convert them to run on magic but... It was fucking 1992 in the UK... Nobody had anything like that as kids. Hell, I didn't get a pocket /radio/ until 2005? MP3 players were rare and expensive, and no one I knew had iPods until like 2008.

Or American writers who try to keep the story British but absolutely completely fuck it up. Use American phrases throughout and base school stuff on American high school constantly, apart from where they do something so stereotypically ""British"" (not actually British, just the American TV version of it) it breaks the immersion...ugh.
