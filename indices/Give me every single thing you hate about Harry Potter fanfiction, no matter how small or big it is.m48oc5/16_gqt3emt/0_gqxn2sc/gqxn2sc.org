I've actually read a lot of good ones with that element, it's a nice difference from the norm. Reading Harry doing semi-normal, relatable stuff instead of “becoming a world-renowned dragon tamer because parseltongue is a dialect of dragon-speech and oh wait he's also a seeker for the /insert professional quidditch team here/ AND he's only 14”, can be soooo refreshing sometimes.

Every once in a while, I enjoy reading a good portrayal of a happy, healthy relationship, or Harry and someone going exploring in the Muggle world or anything along those lines. :)

But I think people enjoy portraying their favourite characters in a setting they can relate to, and that's definitely alright. A lot of books now a days started out as fanfics originally, so if you have a hard time thinking up OCs for an original story, it can be a good way to kickstart your writing, in my opinion!
