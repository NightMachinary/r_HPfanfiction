Bashing, with the /occasional/ exception of Dumbledore bashing.

Related, Ron getting sidelined, even if there's no explicit bashing.

Canon divergence fics that still rigidly follow stations of the canon -- same events, same people dying, etc. (Time travel stories that extract drama from worrying over events being fated to happen can make this work.)

"So mote it be." It's not even so much that it's incorrect, it's just horrifically overdone at this point. I remember one fic used "so said, so witnessed" which struck me as a breath of fresh air at the time.

Harry being written as the most cliche yaoi uke to ever uke. (Mostly in slash fics, obviously.)
