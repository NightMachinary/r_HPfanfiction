Linkffn(Renegade Cause)

Didn't see this one mentioned. It's very long (500k words) and covers an alternative 5th year. I'd classify it as Indy/Dark Harry, but not one of those stupidly edgy ones. I mean, it gets edgy, edge is inherent in the genre, but it's employed correctly here.

Features a few developed OCs, but the story is still focused on Harry and how he copes with Voldemort's return and the brewing war. Voldemort is a competent villain.

The fic shows its age, no doubt about it, but I still think it holds up phenomenally for something originally published in 2008. One of my favorites.
