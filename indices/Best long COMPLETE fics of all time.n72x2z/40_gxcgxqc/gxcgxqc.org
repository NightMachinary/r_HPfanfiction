I would definitely recommend Through Sand and Sea by Looktotheedges. 100 chapters, 300k words, complete. Lots of worldbuilding, great plot, wonderful characters and definitely worth reading all the way through, and the ending will leave you sad that it's over but satisfied with all the various plot points. bit of a rare pair but still one of the best fics I've ever read, basic premise: Hermione from 2005 is in the Department of Mysteries when she gets sent back in time... to 1996, where her younger self is battling Death Eaters. There, she runs into Bellatrix Lestrange, and after that her life is one crazy thing after another- house elves, prophecies, etc.
