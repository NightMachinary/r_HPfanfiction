  Harry Potter's tale as witnessed by a Slytherin student.

  Everyone knows about the story of the Boy Who Lived, about his early childhood, his times at school, about his many adventures, and his final triumph over You Know Who. Everyone knows that story.

  However, several hundred students attended Hogwarts during those years. Many of them went on to live quiet comfortable lives, while a few of them became famous in their own right. However, all of them have their own story to tell, just as interesting and just as important. This is one of them.
