Sorry for the late reply! I saw this on mobile and saved it for the next time I had time at my computer. I hope you're still looking for recommendations.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. I really don't care for Ginny (just don't find her interesting), but this author writes her very well. True to character and compelling; one of my top three in the fandom. (182,592 words; complete)

Post-Hogwarts

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. They are 84k and 145k words, respectively
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578866/1/Modern-Romance][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. (293,493 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] is a Drarry fic. I saw it recommended here so frequently I finally read the damn thing and wish I had done so earlier. It is so touching and deals with going through trauma and isolation beautifully. (153,881 words; complete)
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are By the Grace, Another Mask Behind You (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), The Fall of the Veils (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and The Pure and Simple Truth (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations). They are all complete
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660/chapters/36872253][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries. (96k words, complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is an old classic in the fandom. It was originally written pre-HBP, so there are no Horcruxes. It's a response to the Severitus challenge. I've returned to it again and again over the past decade and still love it. (334,522 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is another Drarry fic. Draco and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. Harry is popular and beloved. Draco is a recluse who lives in the dungeon. After a petty prank has consequences, Draco is forced to actually interact with the world. (114,741 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] is an extremely popular Drarry fic while also being a bit canon-compliant. Harry does a good deed and helps an old man and, as a "reward" gets a glimpse into another life he could have led. (306,708 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is so popular that I feel embarrassed to include it, but my list wouldn't be complete without it. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] is an absolutely phenomenal new series. It is a series of stories that take place in pandemics: Spanish flu, polio, HIV, and COVID. I've read the first three and am in love
