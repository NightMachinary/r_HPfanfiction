In the same vein I feel like I have to rec Sunset Over Britain and Sunrise Over Britain, a pair of fics by Bobmin that can only be found on fanficauthors . net

[[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/]]\\
[[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/]]

about a million or so words, nearly the same length as Brave New World.
