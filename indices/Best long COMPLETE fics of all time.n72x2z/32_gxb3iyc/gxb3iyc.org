Brave New World by bellerophon30 [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw4f6rg5iwitk62/bellerophon30%20-%20The%20Brave%20New%20World.epub?dl=0]]

Explores the United State in an amazing world building fix. I thoroughly enjoyed it although theres alot of cringe and romantic stuff too.

I'll just reccomend the same thing I always do. I've literally considered writing a sequel to this 100 times. It's my hands down favorite book 5 divergent, noncannon pairing harry, with incredibly OC and world building. It's got some fluff and filler but it's just excellent. The best fred and george writing I've ever experienced. #therealgoldentrio

Warning some ron and dumbles bashing. Basically everyone is manipulative. And Dumbledore just isn't on anyones good list.
