There's a shitload of recs already, so if I duplicate something... sorry? At any rate, here's some good ones I haven't been able to rec in a while:

Hell Eyes - You know how there's a bunch of fics out there that claim to be unique? This one actually is. It's the most unique one you'll find, barring a crossover imo. It's also fantastic. (There's a 'next gen' sequel to it that's abandoned - skip it. The original story is complete as is.) Harry/OC, divergent from... I want to say 5th year? Maybe 6th.

Browncoat, Green Eyes - A EWE crossover with firefly, that does a fairly good job of prepping you for the series if you have no idea what it is. You'll miss out on some in-jokes such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI-fiGUjAPY][this one.]] (Jayne is the dude with the goggles.) Otherwise, you follow a rather older-and-wiser with fewer fucks to give Harry as he tags along with a group of thieves and tries to figure out where the hell all the magic went. Harry/River

Fates be Changed - A six year old Harry uses accidental magic to appear in Bruce Banner's path in this MCU crossover, and he ends up becoming Mateo Banner. I'm currently reading this, and I'm enjoying it a lot so far - great spelling/grammar/etc, and a big focus on how Harry/Mateo's presence influences Bruce's personality (and relationship with the 'other guy') and visa versa. No idea about parings.

Grey Space - On the shorter side, but an excellent 'what if Hogwarts started later' with great characterization. There's a sequel in the works as well, and that'll start posting once it's complete I imagine. No Pairing.

The House of Potter Rebuilt - If you need a story with tons of conflict, don't read things from this author. However, if you want a fluffy read about a rather more curious Harry, well. Here ya go. No pairing

One Hundred and Sixty Nine - The first of two Hermione-centric stories I'll (probably ever) recommend. She made a plan, headed to the past, and tried to fix the night of 31 October, 1981. And then went back to her proper time. Hermione/Sirius.

Six Pomegranate Seeds - The other Hermione-centric one. Hogwarts sends her spirit back in time to right the wrongs of a Battle of Hogwarts with more devastating results than canon, and she's shoved into the body of a dying girl from a dark family. Rosier? Rowle? Something like that, it's been a while. And she has to try to mitigate the effects of the war, while in Slytherin - as an orphan with no status - while the golden trio (and her old self) are doing what they do as griffindors.
