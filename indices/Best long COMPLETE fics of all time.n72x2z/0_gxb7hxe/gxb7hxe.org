[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][wind shear]] is great, might not be quite as long as you'd like at 126k, but it's one of the best fics I've ever read. The basics is that Harry is sent back to the 70s and would have left the magical world behind, if a group of death eaters hadn't broken in to slaughter the muggles in there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly]] is also great at just under 200k. Harry is sent back to 1992, as a shade, and ends up possesing Lockhart and ends up trying to make sure that this Harry doesn't go through the same things he did, shenanigan's occurs.

!Edit!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]], just remembered this masterpiece, basics is that Harry decides during the start of the summer before sixth year, that he doesn't think a kid can beat Voldie, so he decides he's going to live first by going on a world troting vacation, shenanigans ensues.
