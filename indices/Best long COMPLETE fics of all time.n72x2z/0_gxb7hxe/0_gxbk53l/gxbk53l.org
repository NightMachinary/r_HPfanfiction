  wind shear

  is great, might not be quite as long as you'd like at 126k, but it's one of the best fics I've ever read. The basics is that Harry is sent back to the 70s and would have left the magical world behind, if a group of death eaters hadn't broken in to slaughter the muggles in there.

+Wind Shear ends halfway through, IIRC the author passed away.+

Edit: Apparently I must have travelled from the Bearstein universe because I swear this fic was incomplete, but it's finished apparently.
