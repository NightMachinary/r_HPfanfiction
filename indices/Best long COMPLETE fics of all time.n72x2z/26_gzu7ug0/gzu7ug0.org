I know that the post is almost a month old now, and you have probably already found what you were looking for. However, for someone like me who has stumbled upon this gold mine via search, it's always good to contribute some more for future reference, right?

I'll focus on next-gen stuff (the generation of Harry's kids, since they're what I've been most focused on for almost 10 years. The second one isn't finished yet, but it's probably worth putting on alert since the last update was just two months ago. With that said, Allons-y!

The two best ones (one of them is a trilogy) that I've come across over the 10 ish years that I have read next-gen centric fics are Ignite (and Starfall & Oblivion that succeed it) by Slide linkffn(8255131), as well as Clash by shezwriter linkffn(12383732).

Note that Ignite is more of a POV fic with a few main characters, and Clash is a for the most part dual-perspective fic. Clash is an acquired taste though, for reasons that you can surmise quite early on in the fic (not the writing though, I can assure you that the writing is excellent - not quite Ignite level, perhaps). Ignite, on the other hand, presents its readers one of the best writings - both in terms of plot and of the linguistic commands that Slide has - that I have ever seen amongst the hundreds of fanfictions that I have read over the years.
