The first fanfic I ever read was a certain Sailor Moon/Ranma Â½ crossover. It's been over a decade without any kind of update, not even a note to say that it's abandoned.

And while my taste in literature is a lot more refined nowadays, the wooden, slightly stilted dialogue and barely-there descriptions are still leagues better than a lot of what I see in the Ranma fandom.

When it comes to Harry Potter, though, there are so many fics that show such potential and promise, but then Peter out halfway. Like the one where Harry befriends Hermione early because the Dursleys dropped him off at an orphanage/asylum place. That fic's only bad point was that everyone (including Dumbledore) kept being completely floored and awestruck because Harry and Hermione had managed to work out a few bits of wordless and wandless magic, via forcing Accidental Magic with Intent. Was it a cool thing for two pre-Hogwarts kids to do? Sure, obviously. But why would a 150+ year old wizard be stunned speechless by something that is on the Hogwarts curriculum, or at least the NEWT exam (wordless, wandless /Accio Wand/ is credit for both Charms and DADA, iirc).

TLDR I agree on the idea that abandoned fics are still fun to read at times, but man does it hurt getting blue'd so often, if you know what I mean.
