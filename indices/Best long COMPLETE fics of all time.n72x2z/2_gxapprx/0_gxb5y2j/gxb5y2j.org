Some abandoned fics are still worth it. It it makes you sad it won't be completed, chances are it was worth reading, is how I see it. On a Pale Horse, The Lesser Sadness, 0800-Rent-A-Hero, off the top of my head. Better to have loved and lost...

I still think though there should be a rule that abandoned fics can, after a period of time, be picked up by other writers, no hard feelings. It's all stolen anyway...
