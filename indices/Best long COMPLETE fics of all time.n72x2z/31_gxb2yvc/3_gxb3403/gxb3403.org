  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.

  Harry Potter died on June 24, 1995, in the Little Hangleton graveyard where Lord Voldemort returned to physical form. As the Dark Lord intended, this guaranteed that nobody knew of his rebirth except for his followers.And Draco Malfoy.(This story is a retelling of books 5-7 with the basis that Harry died at the end of his fourth year. It is named after and heavily inspired by the song "The Iron Sky" by Sunrise Ave. This fic is now complete, and has a sequel coming!)[If you have questions, we can be found daily on Tumblr @minxchester!]
