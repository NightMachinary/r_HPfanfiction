  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)
