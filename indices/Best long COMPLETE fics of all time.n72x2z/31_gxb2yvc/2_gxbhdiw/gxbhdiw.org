+Good... God. This is like a list of the worst in fanfiction. So much slash, so much Malfoy, so much Dumbledore/Ron bashing.... How is it possible to miss on /this many/ stories? The only ones remotely readable (to me, anyway) are Stages of Hope and A Year Like None Other, and even the latter (which I read /years/ ago) hasn't really aged well with me. Stages of Hope still stands up pretty well, though.+

+I mean, I get it, different strokes for different folks, but I was expecting something more from a list that long than a who's-who on the top five things that make me drop a fic instantly. A little bit more... variety. Alas.+

It was pointed out to me that this was rather rude of me to say. I can only say that it came out of a moment of frustration as I thought I'd hit a goldmine of new fanfictions, only to find that almost all of them were not to my taste. That isn't an excuse, however, only an explanation. I apologize for my harsh words.
