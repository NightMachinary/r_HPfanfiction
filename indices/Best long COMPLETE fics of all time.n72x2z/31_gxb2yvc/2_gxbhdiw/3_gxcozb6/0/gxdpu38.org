Slash. That's my issue with it.

Edit: To expand on the above, I think it's actually more about having explicit sex scenes than the slash alone. As a straight male, I don't enjoy such material. That being said, I don't enjoy explicit scenes with heterosexual couples, either. Something about reading characters that were significant in my childhood having sex is disturbing on some level, regardless of the genders of those involved.
