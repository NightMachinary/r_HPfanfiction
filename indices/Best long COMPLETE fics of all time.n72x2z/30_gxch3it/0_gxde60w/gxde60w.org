My biggest issue with it is the characterisation. I've only read the first ten chapters, but within that space, not a single character was anything like their canon personality, and they were all pretty one-dimensional; either they worship Harry's (undoubtedly mighty) toenails, or they're hopelessly incompetent and exist primarily as Harry's punching bag.

I guess if someone sympathised more with Harry's grievances than I do, like how he keeps complaining about having been left to the Dursleys even though he wasn't there for even twenty four hours, then they might like it better than I did.
