Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) once you get past the first 8 chapters it turns into an excellent 5 part complete series spanning years 2-7

Linkao3(conditionally by lomonaaeren) my favourite fic

Linkffn(a second chance at life by Miranda fairgold) first and still one of the best 'Harry goes to a new school' fics

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/990947]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/591278]]) crossover with Criminal Minds, surprisingly good
