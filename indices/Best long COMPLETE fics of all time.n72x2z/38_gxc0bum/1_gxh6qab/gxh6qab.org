Intriguing premise for the fic. I don't read much on the marauder side of things (I'm just so terrified of all the young dudes that I don't even enter the area), so it'll be a fun new experience. Also, I am just so sick of Prince of Slytherin.. I could say “I want a fem!Hufflepuff! Harry fic with no bashing that's under 10,000 words” and somebody would still recommend it just because..
