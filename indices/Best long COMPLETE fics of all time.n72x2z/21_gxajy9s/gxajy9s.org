Damn. I had a really long genderbent harry trilogy that you would probably have liked. About 750k words total, and completed and pretty good.

But it's genderbent harry (female harry) so.. unless you change your mind I won't suggest it.

I do have another series that's pretty good, the harry black series, it's still WIP but is not abandoned. The author is currently working on the 5th book in the series the first 4 are complete and I wanna say there somewhere between 700k-1m words already written in the series.

Sadly another really good work in progress (690k and counting) that is really damn good is also another genderbent harry.. it's take on the story is really unique too.

If you change your mind on being open to female harry fics, I'll gladly post em.for ya
