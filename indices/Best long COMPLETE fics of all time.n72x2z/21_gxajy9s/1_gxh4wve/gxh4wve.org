Haha I'll definitely check out the Harry Black one (even if it's in progress it doesn't look like it'll be abandoned). Unfortunately, I don't think I'd be able to get over my aversion for female Harry.. I don't even know what causes it, I'd be totally fine with any other character genderswapping, but it just makes fics unreadable for me when it's Harry as it kind of removes me from the fic since it's so jarring.
