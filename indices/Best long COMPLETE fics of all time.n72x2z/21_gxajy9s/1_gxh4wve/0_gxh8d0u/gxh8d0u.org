It never bothered me because I just see it as "this is a story of the same character if they were born a girl instead of a boy"

It's fanfiction, gotta open up to other things! I promise you your missing out on yule ball panic series and the odds were never in my favor.

At the same time though, I kinda understand where your coming from, in a way. For me, I'm fine with male harry, and I'm fine with genderbent harry. What I cannot stand is transgender harry. I refuse to read any fic with any transgender characters in it.
