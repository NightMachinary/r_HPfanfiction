Because it does nothing for me. I have nothing against trans people, but it is not a story aspect I am remotely interested in. I have no interest in reading a harry that suddenly thinks he's a girl when he was born male, or vice versa.

The only way I could see this being bennificial to a harry potter story is extremely niche, and they would be if he was somehow born a metamorphmagus and the ability to morph back and forth was useful for spywork.

But I have no interest in reading 14 year old harry potter having a gender crisis mid book
