If you like crossovers, one of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][The Inquisitor Carrow series]], by littlewhitecat. It's a Warhammer 40k crossover, but you don't technically need to know much about that franchise in order to enjoy this. Ever wanted to see a giant, OP, extremely violent, political genius but socially inept Harry Potter bludgeon his way through wizarding and muggle society? Find the prospect of third year Hermione toting a minigun in wartime Yugoslavia fighting alongside some Vampire assassins, muggle mercenaries with laser guns, a wizard secretary, a 7 ft tall Harry who wrestles tanks, and a very confused squad of UN peacekeepers incredibly funny? Want to see the God Emperor of Mankind geek out over flying skateboards? Than this is the fic for you. I swear it's only a little crackfic-y.

Technically it's not entirely done, the last story ended on a sort-of cliffhanger, but the next installment should come out soon and there are plenty of completed stories in the series until then. I also liked Through the Veil Strangely by the same author, where he becomes fused with a giant Space Egyptian Space Nerd.

Sorry, I just wanted to gush about this series.
