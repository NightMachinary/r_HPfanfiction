What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to save him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences...Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

So many storylines, so many characters, so much HISTORY! And it all fits together!
