Debt of time by shayalonnie. It's 700k words I believe and hermione travels back in time to marauders era and gets with Sirius. It's very very well written. Remain Nameless is a mature and comfort dramione read that's 200k. Pride of time is a hermione travels back to marauders and gets with snape it's 500k. All of these are very well written and all on ao3!
