You're welcome! I also recommend the Alkahest on ao3. It's not completed but it is 300k words and it's basically wrapped up and could be ended there. (It's more banter than plot at that point). It's dramione, but it's lighthearted, SO hilarious (I laughed so much), tons of great banter, amazing tension, fabulous characterization, and amazing friendships/relationships. I also recommend How to Win friends and influence people by olivieblake on ao3. Fabulous plot, ensemble cast, dramione, and espionage plot. Fantastic writing and super funny
