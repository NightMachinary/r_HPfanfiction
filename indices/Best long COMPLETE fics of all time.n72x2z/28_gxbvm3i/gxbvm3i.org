[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081016/1/The-Poker-Game][The Poker Game]] is 123k OP harem with a healthy dose of crack that starts with the titular event (ultra-high-stakes can bet anything style, you can probably guess where that goes), while it ends without 100% resolution (Voldie still technically out there albeit Harry's made a laughing stock of Draco and Slytherin in general, Harry's blurse flops onto Ron and that's only barely introduced before Harry basically decides to go have a honeymoon rather than help/watch, etc) I still like the ending. linkffn(4081016)
