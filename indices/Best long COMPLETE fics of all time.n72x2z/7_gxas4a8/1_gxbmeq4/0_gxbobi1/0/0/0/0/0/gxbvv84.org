Yeah I agree. I also know how hard it can be when you just want to finish a fic. Right now I have a conclusion to a fic that's been ongoing and it's a similarly quick finish, and I have to decide whether to take that cop out and actually give readers a conclusion or continue to try and write a satisfactory end, but the writers block I have now means that I do my know how long I'll be leaving my poor readers hanging and I feel terrible!
