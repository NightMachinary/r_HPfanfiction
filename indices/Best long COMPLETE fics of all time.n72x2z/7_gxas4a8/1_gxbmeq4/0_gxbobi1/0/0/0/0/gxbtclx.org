The author is excellent, and I believe certainly had the ability to write a satisfactory conclusion, but for whatever reason just chose - i think at least - to leave various plot points open. After reading hundreds of thousands of words hoping/expecting that certain central points would...come to a resolution in the story, that felt like fundamental issues that had been running through the story from the beginning, it feels so frustrating and unsatisfying, to me at least (and definitely at least some other commenters) for the author to decide for those resolutions not to happen within the scope of the story.

Also, certain other resolutions that did happen felt atypically rushed.

Basically, I felt the whole last few chapters didn't live up to the rest of the story. But it didn't keep me from /loving/ the series overall. And ymmv!
