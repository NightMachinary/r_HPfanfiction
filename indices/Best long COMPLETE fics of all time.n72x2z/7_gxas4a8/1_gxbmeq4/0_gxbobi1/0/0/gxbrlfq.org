Yes the last story (these star-flung futures) finished on 4/8. There's no indication that there will be another story in the series. “Hated” might be a little strong, and there's definitely nothing bad, no reason not to read it! I just felt that a lot was rushed, and there were a /lot/ of loose ends. It was that feeling you sometimes get when you finish a fic and you're searching fruitlessly for the “next chapter” button, because you just can't /believe/ the author really ended it with that, when there are still so many unanswered questions. That's how I felt!!
