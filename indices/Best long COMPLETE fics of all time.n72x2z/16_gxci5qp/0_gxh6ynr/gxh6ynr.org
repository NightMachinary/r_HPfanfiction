I'll definitely check these out as I don't get around to reading marauders much (it's just so depressing) but some of them look just right for my delicate sensibilities. I've been avoiding All The Young Dudes like the plague because I don't have the emotional stability to go through all that commitment to the story and characters and then have things end up the same way in the end.. it's just too depressing. I salute you for your clear emotional and mental strength though.
