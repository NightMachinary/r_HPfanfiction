Haha I definitely get that. I started my fanfiction journey reading Jily and those characters are still my favorites to read about today, but you're right that that means reading a LOT of angst, especially now that I primarily read post-Hogwarts Wolfstar. I mix in a lot of fluffy one-shots after getting through the more difficult stories. ATYD deserves its accolades and I would recommend reading it if you ever feel up to it, but I fully understand your hesitation. I had to take several breaks near the end because I was dreading everything post-Hogwarts so much. The TLE series will go through the end of the First War, but the author said that she plans to write both a canon-compliant ending and a fix-it AU ending. :) Remain in Light and Cartographer's Craft both have happy endings, and Cartographer's Craft is a fandom classic from 2005 (so pre-DH)! Blends uses their backstories and characterizations from canon to tell an AU story that doesn't have anything to do with canon plot lines; it also has a happy ending. Enjoy!
