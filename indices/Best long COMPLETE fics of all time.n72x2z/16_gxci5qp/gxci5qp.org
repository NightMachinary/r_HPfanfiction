I wasn't sure what you meant by "long," so I went with 150,000+ words. My favorite characters to read about in fanfiction will be immediately obvious. :) I hope one or more of these strike your fancy!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][*All the Young Dudes*]] *by MsKingBean89:* LONG fic charting the Marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][*The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights*]] *by CH_Darling:* It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world... but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth. Lily Evans wants a fresh start. James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him. Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story. Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon. Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571][*Remain in Light*]] *by veeagainst:* What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][*Cartographer's Craft*]] *by copperbadge:* In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7869079/chapters/17970910][*Blends*]] *by rvltn909:* Words got in the way sometimes, but Remus got the sense Sirius knew what he was trying to say. (FYI this is a non-magical/modern coffee shop AU, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea.)
