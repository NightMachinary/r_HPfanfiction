A lot of my favorites have already been posted but here's a couple different ones I love.

linkao3(16697380) is really really intense but definitely one of my favorite Tom Riddle centric fics

linkao3(22062673) is one of my favorite Drarry fics of all time because it really focuses on their growth as people. I just reread it and it still made me cry a little, in a good way
