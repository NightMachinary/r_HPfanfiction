I was recently persuaded to read The Debt of Time, after previously trying it and stopping. It turned out to be quite interesting, exploring how Hermione changes, and how her trip through time both does and doesn't change things, but there was quite a strong lemon flavour, which I could do without. For those who don't mind that, it's a heartwarming read.

Harry Crow, on the other hand, I literally cannot stomach. I mean what I say; trying to get through the first ten chapters, just so I could say I gave it a fair shot, made me want to puke. Harry isn't just a Gary Stu, though the goblins are on that level; he goes beyond it to Black Hole Sue. And every other character is a completely one-dimensional caricature, either Harry's ally and therefore an extreme doormat, or his enemy and therefore a hopelessly incompetent punching bag.
