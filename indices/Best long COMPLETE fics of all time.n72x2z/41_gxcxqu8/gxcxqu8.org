My two favorite fanfics that are complete aren't that long. That said, they pack one hell of a punch.

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) Quite possibly the most realistic dark!political!Harry fic out there. One of the best fics of all time.

linkffn(Betrayal by Butaleaner) This is a look into the mind of a maniac. And I didn't really like what I saw, but god-damn was it magnificent.
