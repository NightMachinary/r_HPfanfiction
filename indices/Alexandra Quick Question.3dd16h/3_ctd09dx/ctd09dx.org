The first one doesn't do much more than set the world. The plot isn't very large scale and nothing huge seems to be happening. Hell the entire first story is just about her getting detention over and over. But the second one starts to add some really interesting characters and ideas and the third one does that again (though she's a bit annoying in the same way in this one but in a different way), but then the fourth one after a certain ways into it takes the best of everything done in the series and applies it for a really awesome arc and things really click and her character seems a lot less annoying in general. Book 5 promises to have more moments like that.

Alexandra is kind of annoying at first because she gets in trouble so much when it's obvious that she shouldn't be doing things or goes off on her own while ignoring her friends, or obsesses over something or other. But it really clicked for me when I realized what an key part of her character it is and while she's foolhardy she's also a go-getter and is willing to go to ridiculous lengths while saying "fuck you" to the consequences no matter how bad it gets and that's more interesting that Harry having Hermoine doing all of his prep-work for him. She isn't a perfect character she has her flaws and a lot of her strengths also come with those flaws, but she becomes more well-rounded as she gets older while still maintaining that attitude.
