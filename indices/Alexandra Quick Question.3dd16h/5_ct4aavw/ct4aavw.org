I have to say, I made it about two thirds of the way through it. I kind of enjoyed it (and I REALLY enjoyed Houses Divided, Inverarity's other work) but the fact that ALL of the teachers except for the groundskeeper had it out for her was just so wearing. It was like every professor at Hogwarts was umbridge and snape--a little animosity is good, but that much surrounding her at all times was just so wearing.
