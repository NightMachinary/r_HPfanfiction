Good question, I was bothered by some similarities as well. I posted a month ago about AQ:

  AQ Series has a lot of original plots, but I see some plot points in AQ's life that are similar to HP's life: Neglected child with a prophecy about them, secretive headmaster and Snape-like professor, abused elf who becomes her friend, gets a broom as a gift, broom gets destroyed. There are probably some others I am forgetting.

  My questions:

  First, are there enough similarities that it feels gimmicky, like the author is saying "hey look! She's just like Potter!"?

  Second, if the similarities between HP and AQ are a bit overdone, does it matter?

Here is the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3afam0/two_quick_queries_about_alexandra_quick/][post]]. You might find the responses I got helpful. Overall, it is a really original fic, and I found it enjoyable. I did have trouble getting through the first book as well though.
