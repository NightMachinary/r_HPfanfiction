I'm not sure that's quite fair. None of the characters from any of the Harry Potter novels ever show up, as far as I remember, and the plots are totally different. I've read several American female Harry's, and I don't think this is one of them. I'll agree with you that I didn't find it as good as most people seem to, though. My problem with it is that when I'm reading fanfic, I want fanfic about the series. I feel like this is fanfic only in name. Change a few spell names, and it could be sold as an original work.
