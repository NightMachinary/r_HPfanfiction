It's never going to be finished, as Bobmin356 is no longer with us, but the trilogy begun with linkffn(7591040) "The Queen Who Fell To Earth" has Harry (and others) bonding with dragons.

kind of a crossover with the Pern series, but more of an homage to that series that Bob started when Anne McCaffrey passed away.
