I can totally see Ginny as a cheater. She was coddled by her family her entire life as the first female Weasley in generations. Even the twins didn't dare pick on her. Between being spoiled and her bad temper, she exhibits very little self-control. And, with her mother's example, probably became a screeching harpy as well.

Note I am not a Ginny hater. She really had very little personality in the books. I do happen to think she is a bad match for Harry, because all he ever wanted was somebody to see, "Harry, just Harry," and she only ever saw the hero.
