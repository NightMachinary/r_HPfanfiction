She is fairly tabula rasa, which is both a curse and boon in that regard. She has a ton of "baggage" that wasn't part of her character, but has been saddled with from the weight of other fiction, simply because authors over the years have taken small things in the books and extrapolated out from there as their story, and later biases dictated.

Is she the popular kid, and school athlete that's well liked? Is she the school broom? Will she be the second coming of Molly? Does she dislike her mom's method of handling children, and seek to be different? Was she a stalker? Was she just a shy little girl?

The inciting incidents for each of these are in the original text, but weren't the focus of the story, so none of them were fleshed out. When DH came out, JKR had spoken repeatedly about how she didn't want the story to be a grail quest, where Harry finishes the quest so he can get the girl, but in doing so, and by not including Ginny in the year long camping trip, her character is left pretty much with minimal development.
