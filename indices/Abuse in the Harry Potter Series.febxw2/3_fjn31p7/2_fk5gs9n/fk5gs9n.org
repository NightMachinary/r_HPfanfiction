Children's books have always been full of these kinds of situations. As a child, I read a 100 year old copy of Grimm's fairy tales and that had more going on than HP.

I do think that JKR should have made more effort to guide the reader towards knowing it was wrong, but one of the reasons HP was such a great children's book is that it didn't try to tell children what to think. They were able to draw their own conclusions.

If you look at Enid Blyton's work, the children often dealt with nefarious characters. The authors these days tend to guide children/young people towards knowing its bad these days, however it's not done in an obvious way.

Onjali Rauf has won awards recently for her books - >! The Boy At the Back of the Class features racist abuse and a refugee. The Star Outside My Window is far more hard hitting; the children all go on an adventure (missing from foster care) which results from the mother of the main character being murdered by her dad in an ongoing domestic violence dispute. It's all dealt with at a level suitable for children, but we need to give children more credit. !<

Susie Day's /Max Kowalski Didn't Mean It/ follows the story of a troubled boy and his siblings. Their dad goes into hiding for a few weeks to avoid arrest, leaving the children alone. Someone from his dad's gang shows up and leaves them with a load of money in suitcases, so they run away to Wales with stolen keys for a friend's holiday home.

I should add that the way these stories means that the bulk of the story is the adventure, exciting and understandable to all children with the back story slotting around it through the eyes of children. After all, these sorts of things really do happen to children and there is no harm in building empathy from their peers as long as the topic is handled responsibly.
