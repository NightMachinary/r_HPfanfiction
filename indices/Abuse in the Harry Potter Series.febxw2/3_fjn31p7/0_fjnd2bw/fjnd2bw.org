I think there was severe change of directions somewhere between GoF and OotP, where still PoA was a light fairy-tale childrens books, and then suddenly in GoF one of the good guys really died. Not like, ha ha, it was funny, I haven't died really (like what happens in fairy tales), but he was really dead and Harry was struggling with nightmares for it.

I am not sure what was the reason for it, but my suspicion is that it finally hit her how incredibly successful she was, or perhaps it was the reaction to watching her own story on the silver screen, or both. Remember PS film was 2001, and OoP the book was published on 2003.

When talking about the film and the book versions of some characters (Ron, Hermione, Snape), then we have tendency to forget that in the later books, these are the film versions, then most likely even JKR herself was enchanted by Alan Rickman and Emma Watson, and the disaster which is Hermione and Ron in the latter books could be under the influence of Steve Kloves (one more thing he is guilty of).
