The abuse that several suffered at the hands of adults is also blatantly ignored by JK Rowling.

What was she thinking making Neville's boggart Snape. Is this supposed make us sympathetic towards Snape because the class laughed when Neville used /ridiculous/ on it. Nothing came of it.

Oh what about that detention in first year where 10 times the points given for saving a student's life is taken for breaking curfew. And then sending 4 11 years(ok 3 11 and 1 12) into the forbidden forest to hunt something that kills unicorns.

What about Umbridge. Contrary popular belief Harry was not the only tortured.. oh sorry punished by her. In the movies the niece of the equivalent of the head of defense was one of them.

What about the deployment of literal soul sucking monsters at school or running multiple smear campaigns against a minor.

People say that JK Rowling shifted from a children's book to young adult's book was the reason for the many plot holes but I don't know how even the first book can be considered a children's book based on the first few chapters. We see abuse, bigotry and attempted murder within the first seven chapter. Here is an extract from seventh chapter of PoS if you don't believe me.

/"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."/

The world JK created was full of questionable stuff that should have not been in a children's book from the start.
