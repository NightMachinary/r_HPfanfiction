I think it symbolises Harry's filter of the world. His entire life was warped by neglect and war that he never developed proper secure adult relationships and didn't work through those issues to come to the same understanding we have.

Harry came to see Snape as a hero. He idolised Dumbledore. There's an interesting moment in Cursed Child where Harry wants portrait Dumbledore's advice and Hermione, with the air of having gone over it 100 times, tries to point out that he needs to stop putting Dumbledore on a pedestal.
