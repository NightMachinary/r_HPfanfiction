Unfortunately that sounds too smart for JKR. I think the real reason is that /she/ saw Snape and Dumbledore as heroes. There's a pretty dramatic shift in Snape's character in the last couple of books, which I think is due to Alan Rickman's portrayal of the character. Don't get me wrong, I love his version of Snape, but that's the problem. Book Snape isn't a snarky, cranky, comedic, attractive teacher with a tragic past who cares deep down, he's a disturbed man-child who abuses children, is completely irrational when his emotions get in the way (ironic considering he's one of the best Occlumens in Britain), who has an unsettling obsession with Harry's mom. Until JKR decided she wanted Alan Rickman's Snape instead of what she actually wrote.

As for Dumbledore, she's always considered him a hero and a grandfather figure to Harry, despite their few interactions up until 6th year and all the negative implications written into his character. I doubt many, if any, of those were intentional, it's just her not realizing the consequences of what she's writing. Which is unfortunately common in the Harry Potter series.
