I'm fine with people getting away with it despite the fact that I'd rather see them get punished. But something like having Harry name is kid after at least one horrible, abusive shitbag (Dumbledore is debateable as in canon he's still supposed to be a good guy despite the flaws we find when we actually examine his actions) is completely out of line.
