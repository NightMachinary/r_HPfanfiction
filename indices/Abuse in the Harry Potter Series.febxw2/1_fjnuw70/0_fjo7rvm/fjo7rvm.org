From exactly the same source you identified for the rest of your response. It has been pointed out again and again that JKR based Hogwarts and the general concept of the setting on the classical boarding school stories and their tropes.

  but the idea of a child having abuse in his backstory (and then it never really being dealt with) is a trope from older English literature that basically is supposed to show them having 'character'. We used to be really into the idea that beating a child was a way to instil discipline and make them a sound, responsible, productive member of society (think the Pink Floyd 'The Wall'/'We Don't Need No Education' kind of vibes). It's a very Roahl Dahl/Enid Blyton-esque era trope - corporal punishment as a form of child-rearing has been very reasonably disposed of for quite a while now. Legally, at least. Some investigations and such have found little pockets of it here and there, but it's gotten rid of ASAP after it's found.
