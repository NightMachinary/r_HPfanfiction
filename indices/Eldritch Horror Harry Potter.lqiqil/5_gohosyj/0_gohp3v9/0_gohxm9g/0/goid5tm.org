Harry Potter had done a lot of things first: he was the first person to survive the Killing Curse, the first to go a whole school year as Lee Jordan's intern, and now, the only intern who dared to ask to return to the position as a second year. And yet, on that Wednesday afternoon, a neon orange letter landed at Harry Potter's plate. "Congratulations!" it read. "You have been selected as Apprentice Radio Manager."

Yes, Harry Potter truly was a boy of firsts.
