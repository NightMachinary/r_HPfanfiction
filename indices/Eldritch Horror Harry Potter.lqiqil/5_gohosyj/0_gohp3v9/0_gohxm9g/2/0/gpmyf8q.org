“Listeners, as I let you go into the cold and unforgiving night, think on this:

Who was sally anne perks?

What was sally anne perks?

What was she doing that caused her untimely exit from the intern programme and, indeed, reality?

...

Sometimes the world appears vast, and oppressive. It is; this is a sign your visual organs are functioning correctly. Rejoice in the perception of that creeping shadow cast by no one in the third floor, the sallow, stretched taught skin of the DADA professor and her ever present smell of rot, in the doors that are not doors beckoning you. You're able to perceive all these things! Good for you!

They show you that the world is vast, maybe even endless, and that no matter how hard you try you cannot understand it all. And that is okay. Listeners, I do not remember sally anne perks. Out there, maybe none of you do. Maybe there's a half finished scarf you were making for a reason now lost to you, maybe there's a guest bedroom filled with the love and life of no one you know, maybe there's a hole in your heart that wasn't there before.

Maybe there isn't.

Maybe Sally Anne Perks passed through life without leaving a single memory behind in the minds of those that knew her. Maybe the only thing to show she ever existed is this note, right here, covered in wet black mold and the scent of blueberries.

I do not know. None of us do. But as we carry on with our day to day lives, after sally anne has left us and after the after, maybe you'll feel a little sad, for no reason at all. Maybe, without you even knowing, you'll miss the girl that was sally anne perks.

There is a cupcake on my desk, listeners, that neither I nor the house elves baked. There is a note pinned to the wrapper, saying that the baker has just gone to get one final thing, and then they'll be ready to celebrate. There is a hole in my heart where someone used to be.

The world is a little bit darker, listeners, without sally anne perks. But the world always gets darker, when we forget to hold on to eachother.

Goodnight, Hogwarts, goodnight.”
