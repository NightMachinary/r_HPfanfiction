It's listed as it's own subject, on the OWLs and NEWTs, in neat letters between Herbology and Potions: Intern, Hogwarts Community Radio.

The Radio Host is Lee Jordan, sixth year. It has been Lee Jordan, sixth year, since Augusta Longbottom attended the school. Since Griselda Marchbanks did. Hogwarts has had community radio - or something that fulfills the purpose of community radio - for longer than it has had radios or, indeed, a real sense of community.

Lee picks a new intern on Wednesdays, or Thursdays when scheduling errors mean Wednesdays no longer exist. He used to do it at feasts, but they weren't quite close enough - the 1953 disaster that led to the closure of the drama club, the banning of any future drama club, and the permanent erasure of any possible drama clubs from Hogwarts soil after Lee went without an intern for three days made that point well.

Lees interns are always first years, in spite of various Headmasters begging him to pick Better qualified tributes. He never does; his selection criteria are entirely his own, and those that try to force the issue find themselves cursed with blackening hands or shattered souls or a thousand other things that cannot be traced back to Lee, but that everyone knows, on a bone deep level, are because of the cheerful sixth year and his focused rage. His interns are always first years, and they always receive a purple envelope stamped with an unnervingly realistic human eye sitting on their plate at dinner.

That is the only thing they have in common. He has picked almost-squibs and full veela, purebloods and muggleborns, every Lovegood and every thirteenth Black and never, ever a Bones. They've been enthusiastic and terrified and reluctant, and it hadn't mattered. Not even removing a child from the school entirely could untangle the duties of an intern from a student that had been selected and still judged capable; little Irma Pince found every piece of paper she even looked at turn into a list of tasks when her parents made the attempt, including the contents of every wallet in a mile radius.

The duties of an intern were not particularly difficult. Every evening, they brought Lee coffee from the house elves, who regarded him with an unusual level of awe, even from then. Every morning, they tuned up the radio equipment, which did not require knowledge of technology as much as it did a working knowledge of the human circulatory system and determination. They would investigate whatever Lee told them to in between classes, and occasionally he would astrally project in to check on them. No, the duties were not difficult.

The death rate, then, was hard to explain. Things just seemed to happen around Lee and his interns. A quick trip to visit the mermaid village would reveal a high tech subway station in one corner that connected with Atlantis. Feeding the thestrals was significantly more challenging when the food you were feeding them reanimated itself and swore vengeance. Even a simple story about the various types of clouds would turn into a run for their life when one opened up an eye gleaming colours not designed for comprehension by humans and started following the interns everywhere.

Maybe every decade, an intern would survive a full year unscathed. Most of the time, Lee would run through five or ten or twenty of the first years, each one replacing a comrade who had died, vanished, been temporarily displaced, or developed a sudden and crippling case of “is a bird.”

And yet.

And yet...

And yet the students that did survive, that did gain that special qualification on their OWLs and their NEWTS, between Herbology and Potions? They became Ministers, became ministry heads of department or joined MI6 or did precisely whatever they wished. Bill Weasley became a curse breaker for the notoriously reclusive goblin nation. Rubeus Hagrid got to teach people about the wonders of creatures. Xenophilius Lovegood ran a profitable newspaper that no one ever seemed to read. Lee was not kind - Myrtle Warrens wish to stay at Hogwarts forever, Bellatrix Blacks wish to never be forced into a traditional marraige, Aberforth Dumbledores wish that his brother would look at him - but his interns always received precisely what they wished, god help them.
