Harry was trying to concentrate on Professor Sinistra lecture. Looking at his watch it read 11:59 class still another thirty-one more minutes before it was over. It was a pleasant night out. The sky was clear and the moon was high in the sky. A full moon, Harry noticed, his thoughts drifting to Remus. Professor Sinatra was standing in front of the class in the middle of her lecture, “Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust-“ Harry jotting down his notes half-listening noticed his watch turned Midnight, and the professors demeanour changed. Her eyes glazed over and her voice becoming more monotone “Tonight's full moon is brought to you by Pepsi. We created the moon and we will destroy it”

Was all I could think about when you said Nightvale lol
