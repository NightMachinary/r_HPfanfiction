I do am writing something like that, but it's more like the first paragraph with some of the rest.

Basically, it's standard Magical World for most people, but the Eldritch is there, in the underneath and in some things, regular Wizards can't deal with most of it so there are bloodlines of "superhuman" wizards and muggles who deal with this called Hunters(yes, inspired by BloodBorne), they are the ones called in when some stupid wizard summons something dangerous, they work with the DOM(or their country's equivalent) to help out, they serve as ambassadors to other magical nations (Fae for example) and on the side the hunt the more common creatures that are dangerous even to Aurors (werewolves, higher vampires, etc...)

Bloodlines like Van Hellsing and Belmont are of hunters, same as the Peverell and later the Potters, though it can skip a generation.

Harry 'awakes' that when he kills the Basilisk(they must slay a creature without their "superhuman"(think Captain America and Wolverine) abilities) and finds out the world has much more depth than he expected.
