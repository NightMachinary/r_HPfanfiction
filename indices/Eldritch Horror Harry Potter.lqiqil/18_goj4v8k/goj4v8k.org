It doesn't have anything to do with Hogwarts, but linkffn(The Adumbration of Cordelia by Temporal Knight) has a fem!Harry dealing with being an eldritch abomination.

Another one that doesn't involve Hogwarts is linkao3(Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel). It has a sequel: linkao3(Petunia Potter's Monster by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel).

Edit: It seems that the TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel has removed his/her stories from ao3. They are still available on [[https://archive.org][archive.org]]. I presume etiquette discourages direct links to the [[https://archive.org][archive.org]] pages in cases like this.

Since the bot doesn't seem to be working for ffn at the moment, here's the link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13347771/1/The-Adumbration-of-Cordelia][The Adumbration of Cordelia]].
