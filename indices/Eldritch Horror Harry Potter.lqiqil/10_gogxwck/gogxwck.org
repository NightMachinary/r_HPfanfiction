I can vividly imagine an eldritch Hermione (I'm picturing a Seeker from Skyrim, but bipedal and wearing a giant cultist robe) dragging her friends to the library to show them some horrifying tome. Meanwhile Harry's head is swelling from a parasite he picked up in the lake and his skin has turned into the wood of some eldritch tree, and Ron has bloated into a morass of gluttonous sludge. But they all have their canon personalities still.

It would be amazing.
