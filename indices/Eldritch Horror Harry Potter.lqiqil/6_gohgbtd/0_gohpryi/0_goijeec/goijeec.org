But that's just the thing, in an HP universe with a lovecraft twist, magic is measurable by Math and science, it just depends what aspect and how far the rabbit hole your willing to go down.

The further and more you understand, the less makes sense and the more questions you have. Don't go to far, or you might come face to face with the abyss. Things make sense 99.9 % of the time, if you ignore the frayed edges of logic and the slight inconsistencies of sense. The other .01% they don't, they really don't, they mind meltingly, existentially horrifyingly, nihilisticly don't.

Zeno Lovegood and his daughter took a look through the peephole to the .01%, Dumbledore glanced at it from his peripherals, Voldemort took a taste. Lily jumped in head first and tied herself to Harry right before she died.

The power he knows not, no one does, because to know it- Is Madness.
