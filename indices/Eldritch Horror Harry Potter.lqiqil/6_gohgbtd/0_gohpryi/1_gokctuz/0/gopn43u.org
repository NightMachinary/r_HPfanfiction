I will admit that all of that stuff sounds really cool. However, that's not what bothered me about the Arithmancer.

In the Arithmancer, Hermione invents new spells by using Arithmancy to count syllables and wand movements/twists. That's not how magic works. The fact that you can use magic in HP without incantations, wand movements or - in extremis - wands at all shows this. For me, using Arithmancy to create spells in the way shown by White Squirrel is twaddle.

In HP, wand movements and incantations are just mnemonic or focusing aids. They're not a required component of the magic.
