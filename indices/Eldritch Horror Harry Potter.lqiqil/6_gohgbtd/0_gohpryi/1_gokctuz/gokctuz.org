I'm the same way, but it was the way the author uses more and more transcendental types of math. Go advanced enough and all math becomes somewhat eldritch, with infinities appearing where they shouldn't be, strange nonexistant number constructs, ordinal numbers in the depths of infinity, etc. There might be ordinal numbers (numbers that are defined to be after something else) that exist so far into the realm of impossibility that they prove things like 0 = 1. The entire realm of imaginary numbers is fucking /whack/, with how they describe numbers with two dimensions to make up the mandelbrot fractal.

If you get down to it, all reality can also be described with numbers - light speed for example is like when a hyperbolic curve approaches a point for all eternity, a black hole is like a stack overflow error that causes gravity to suddenly become infinity, physical dimensions can be quantified and divided with each other to form logical results that describe their properties, etc.

It's a shame I suck so bad at math because it's an amazing field.
