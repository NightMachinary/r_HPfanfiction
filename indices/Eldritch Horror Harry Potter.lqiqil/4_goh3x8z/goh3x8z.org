I was just thinking about posting a similar prompt! Honestly, the HP universe is rife with inspirations for eldritch horror you just mentioned!

Anyone familiar with the tabletop roleplaying game Call of Cthulu (which is based on the works of Lovecraft)? Imagine something like that: a series of eldritch mysteries investigated by a band of specialists who struggle to maintain their health and sanity as they stumble into secrets of mysterious happenings rooted in ancient arcane relics and insidious cabals.
