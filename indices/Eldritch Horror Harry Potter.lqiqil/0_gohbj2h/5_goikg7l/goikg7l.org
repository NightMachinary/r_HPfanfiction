There's a story, I forget what it's called, where there's a tower at Hogwarts like that. Harry sends the Weasley twins up it.

> At five kilometers in, the buildings aren't even non-euclidean. They're so nonsensical that nobody's been able to come up with a self-consistent arithmantic theory that can describe them.

Hmmm, fertile ground for a Flatterland/HP crossover!
