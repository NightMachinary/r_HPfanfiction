There's a street that branches off from Diagon Alley where all of the arithmancers, unspeakables, and displaced dimensional travelers live. It's called Transcendent Alley, and it should be relatively short, since it points in the direction of the muggle street where the Leaky Cauldron's entrance is.

Transcendent Alley is extremely long, and the further in you go, the stranger the geometry becomes. Most of it's residents live on the first half kilometer. Xeno Lovegood grew up at around the 1.5 kilometer mark, and the experience obviously affected him. At three kilometers in, the geometry is so obviously hyperbolic that you need a long rope to avoid getting lost. At five kilometers in, the buildings aren't even non-euclidean. They're so nonsensical that nobody's been able to come up with a self-consistent arithmantic theory that can describe them.

Past this point, the unspeakables don't bother mapping the road or making any observations. Instead, they let convicts choose between the Dementor's kiss and going as far into the alley as they can, equipped with a long rope around their waists and a year's worth of supplies. The unspeakables measure the distance the convicts go by the amount of rope that plays out from the spools at base camp.
