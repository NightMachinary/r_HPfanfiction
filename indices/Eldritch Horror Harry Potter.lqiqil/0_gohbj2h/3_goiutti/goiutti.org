The most mind boggling part is that you can walk around the entire alley in 10 minutes. But if you go in, the road seemingly stretches to infinity.

(If anyone is interested in what kind of crazy shenanigans you can get up to in a *hyperbolic plane*, give [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/HyperRogue/][HyperRogue]] a try.
