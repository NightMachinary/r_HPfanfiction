Thanks for the rec. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things about this fic that took me out of it and which stopped me from wanting to continue.

I can just about forgive an author for renaming Harry to Hadrian if the rest of the story engages me, but this one failed to do that. No explanation was given for the Potters neglecting thier first son, and checking the reviews it seems like the pacing is all over the place.

As a result, I was unable to settle in and enjoy it. But I appreciate you digging it out for me.
