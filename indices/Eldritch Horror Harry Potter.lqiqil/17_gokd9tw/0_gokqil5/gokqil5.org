Harry must learn, very quickly, that if you find a window in the Underspace, you /don't look out of it./

It's not that there's anything clawing at the panes, or anything. No, nothing so mundane. But sometimes, through the dark mist, you can glimpse strange constellations. Worse is that occasionally, very occasionally, dark shapes will blot out those glittering stars. And if you stare too long, those shapes stop moving. Then they begin to get bigger.

Once, when Harry was exploring an Underspace manor, he found a figure standing, staring out of a window. Some poor bastard must have gotten trapped inside when the trunk outside was destroyed. I say a figure, though, because when Harry aproached and it turned around it was clear there was no way you could describe it as a person any more.
