I've been wanting to write a fic for some time about a Harry that runs one of those magical trunk shops, and discovers a trunk in the basement from an older stock he bought that contains a gateway into the Underspace - a section of space-time that contains the insides of all magical trunks whose outside was destroyed, and which drifted into the underspace, pulled together by a strange sort of gravity. He would wander this place, walking through dark manors and hallways and vaults and apartments. I think this could easily be made eldritch, as well, maybe with strange things living in the Underspace.
