Humans that manifest the essence of the eldritch gods are known as wizards and witches. Magic is thier watered down ability to manipulate reality. Wands are matched to thier souls, and use more ingredients for the cores than canon. Magical creatures muggles consider fantasy are all children of Shub-Niggurath,

For example, the seemingly innocuous unicron, so innocent, so docile, they will gore anything that bothers them with thier horn, and then reveal they actually have canines (like those pictures of horses but with dogs mouth's, google it) and the heard will swarm the victim and eat it alive. Knifflers can borough and chew through most anything to get the shiny, including human appendages. When a werewolf transforms they spit out all thier human teeth and then tear thier skin off to burst out like a bloody newborn, hulking wolf monstrosities, the apex hunters. Vampires are a combination of the ones from skyrim, underworld, and nomac from blade.

Magic accidents are common, but wizards and witches are resilient and can be healed easily, muggles, not so much. Having your limbs torn off, your ribs poking out of your shattered ribcage, twisted kneck, painful- but still something a wizard can recover from even after minutes of what would instantly kill a muggle.

The power he knows not, turns out Harry Potter is a remanifestation of ______________ elder god (whichever one u think is best). So he is especially hard to kill, like unholy shit why won't he die, oh god kill me I'm sorry levels of unlikable. Voldemort slowly finds this out the hard way.
