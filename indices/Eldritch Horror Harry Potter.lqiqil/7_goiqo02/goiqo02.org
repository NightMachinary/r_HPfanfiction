I have an idea.

Backstory: It is canon that the Ministry only learned of Azkaban when the wards around it fell. It is also canon that the Dementors were the /least/ scary thing they found there.

Premise: Azkaban is home to some eldritch horrors that are empowered by positive emotions, what then is a better prison than Azkaban - the immorality of prisoners will stop the spread of the monsters of Azkaban.

Unfortunately, Sirius Black was innocent, and his imprisonment there and the strength of his conviction has strengthened the monsters therein... dun dun dunnnnnnnn
