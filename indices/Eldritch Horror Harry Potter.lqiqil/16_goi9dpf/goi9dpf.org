There's eldritch geometry in the first Arithmancer story - the tower with the Grand Staircase in it is infinitely tall on the inside, and the higher you go, the weirder it gets. In 4th year, the Triwizard maze is a weird transdimensional shifting thing that gives Hermione nightmares, so in revenge she gives Bagman a copy of Lovecraft's collected works - after adjusting the title to make him think they're true.
