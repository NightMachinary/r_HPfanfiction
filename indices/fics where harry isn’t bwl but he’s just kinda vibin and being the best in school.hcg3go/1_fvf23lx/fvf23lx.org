Gonna hazard a guess and say this request was inspired by the often lauded Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. I don't know of any other fics that quite mimic the magic of this fic in terms of removing Harry from the BWL trope but keeping things interesting from a Magic point in school.

However, if you haven't heard of it, check it out!

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by Stargate-Lover)

The original is written by The Santi however stargate lover attaches the extra chapters, so that is why I have chosen to link that one.
