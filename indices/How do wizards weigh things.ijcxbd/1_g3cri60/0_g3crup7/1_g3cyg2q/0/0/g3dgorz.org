Well, yeah, the spell would have to tell you "It's directly above you/it's at x angle" and then you'd have to make the calculate or guess, it being a bit unwieldy. I guess this version of a time-keeping charm could still have been replaced by watches, and only been superior "technology" till mobile watches existed.
