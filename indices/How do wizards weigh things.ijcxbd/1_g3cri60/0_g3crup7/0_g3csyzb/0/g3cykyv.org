I want to argue that if a "weight measurement charm", existed, a arm scale would not present in the list of school furniture. I guess one could argue that "the brass was for his 1st year when he didn't know any spell yet, he learnt it later", but I think it is pretty unlikely.

Concerning the "Tempus" charm, the tradition ask for a parent to give a watch to his child for his 17 birthday (so when he is supposed to be formed). If the Tempus charm existed, it would be the worst gift ever. It would be like offering water cuff to someone who have just finished to learn how to swim.
