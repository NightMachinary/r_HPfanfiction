That would be horribly imprecise.

Say a student has trouble lifting a stone pillar with a /Wingardium Leviosa/, but a more experienced wizard can lift 20 times that. How accurately would they be able to quantify the difference, and then convert it?

If they could, this /could/ be an argument in favor of the non-existence of "intuitive potions genius", but everything in the wizarding world points to potioneering as an imprecise and often experimental science, even after the "proper instructions" have been laid down.
