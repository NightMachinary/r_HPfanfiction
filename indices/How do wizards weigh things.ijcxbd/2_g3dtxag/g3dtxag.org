Old school brass scales, enchanted to automatically duplicate/vanish weights in the deluxe models.

Or outside of Hogwarts just an off the shelf battery powered electronic scale, same as in my chemistry classroom.

Let's face it, given the small population -> small number of innovators -> few inventions in the wizarding world there are probably more practical solutions for a lot of problems available in the muggle world. I wouldn't surprise if someone bought various muggle items, added enchanted batteries that last forever, transfigured the surface plastic into brass or something else old school looking, and resold it as super duper enchanted stuff.
