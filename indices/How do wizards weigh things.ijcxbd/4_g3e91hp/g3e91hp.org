brass scales are canon.

I would think there is a measuring charm, though it's not used for potions because some ingredients are magic sensitive. and that's why students need them.

I wouldn't be against believing the healers were using such a charm on their patients to check if they are gaining/loosing weight or on newborns too. the charm could just measure without the person being lifter. it could come out of the scan the healers use (damn, are healer scans canon or fanon???) .

then other heavy stuff or food or whatever. goblins for measuring gold, although the goblins also had scales in the bank. not sure if only in movies or in books as well. Flamel in fantastic beasts 2 had also some scales on his table used for his alchemy stuffs.
