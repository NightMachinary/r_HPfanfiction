Oh my god the swearing thing - authors constantly having every character say shite because they think it sounds more British. Some dialects in the UK say shite but it's not just a replacement for shit and it sounds so bizarre to have Harry, who grew up in middle class suburbia in Surrey say shite.

And oh, god, the alcohol - I have had pearl clutching PMs from Americans about the drinking in my fics.
