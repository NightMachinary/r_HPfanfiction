It may be a difference of interpretation. I rather have the impression all your stuff is part of the same continuity, one giant fic. (Not that I've read all your stuff, just a lot of it.) That a one shot Tumblr thing (drabble I think you call them) is where you get the gin cabinet or the Ginny&Tonic stuff, just exists as another chapter or scene alongside the Christmas party with Hazel no different to the other non-linear chapters.

As to the style thing I don't read enough slice of life stuff to really justify that call, but it does feel like you're specifically highlighting that the characters drink. Like it's something we're meant to notice. I'm not trying to say it's obnoxious or feels non-canonical or anything (eg I like that it's not just firewhisky... Rowling seems averse to mentioning alcohol in canon imho) just that it's very visible.

I guess what I mean is that just because it's realistic that doesn't mean it's not a stylistic choice too.

(Also, while I'm here, what's Albus' job? I feel like I must've skipped over something.)
