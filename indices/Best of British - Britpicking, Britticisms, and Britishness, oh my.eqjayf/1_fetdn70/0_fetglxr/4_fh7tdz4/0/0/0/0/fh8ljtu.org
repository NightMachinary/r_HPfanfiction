I am going to stop here okay because I've spent too much of my life having arguments online. I feel like I'm not quite managing to say what I mean and my next response would inevitably follow the norms I have internalised in political threads in debate forums. I don't want to have an argument about this because I don't think we disagree (or disagree sufficiently) and because I really do really like your writing.
