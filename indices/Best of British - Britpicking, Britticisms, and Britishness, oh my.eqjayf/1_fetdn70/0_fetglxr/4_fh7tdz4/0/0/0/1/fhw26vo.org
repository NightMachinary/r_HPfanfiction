Example: When my wife worked in a coffee shop, they had a yearly awards night. Everyone was encouraged to come. Alcohol was free. My wife was commended for going to work to sleep and opening up the shop absolutely plastered. She doesn't even remember the first few hours. Almost every other branch of the chain in the city failed to open on time.

I do think people TALK about getting drunk more openly at work in Scotland than when I lived in England though.

On the topic of schools, my head of year went to a board school and told us how they crept into the woods and drunk until one classmate with an eating disorder got alcohol poisoning at which point they were terrified to get help and ran away. The moral of the story was 'always get help for your friends' not don't drink.
