Yeah it is, but yeah I don't think the existence of a drinks cabinet is that much of a choice - virtually all middle class families have one anyway? It's just a piece of furniture. It doesn't mean it gets used nightly or anything.

It's definitely just a cultural thing - I write stories based on things around me and anecdotes I hear from other people, and the UK has a bigger drinking culture than other places. So what's perfectly unremarkable to me is clearly standing out to others. It just becomes really exasperating to me when people put their cultural norms onto me and react with shock - especially for things like Harry getting drunk as a young man or people getting drunk at a wedding or family members going for a quick pint together. All of that is perfectly standard in the UK, and I'm only reflecting that. I don't think Rowling is averse to mentioning it at all - we see characters like Hagrid get drunk frequently, Marge gets drunk in POA, the students are drinking light alcohol from 13, Winky has alcoholism etc.

In my headcanon he has a job as a magical astronomer but I haven't written much about it.
