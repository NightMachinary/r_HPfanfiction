Can I just say... there /is/ a lot of drinking in your fics. They're basically that episode of Yes Minister where they're freaking out at the idea of going to a function (iirc) Saudi Arabia since it'd be dry. Which I suppose demonstrates your point, but what I'm saying is that it's... like a stylistic feature.

(I love your stuff btw.)
