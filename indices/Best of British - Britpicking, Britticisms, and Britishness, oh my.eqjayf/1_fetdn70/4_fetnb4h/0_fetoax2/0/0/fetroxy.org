Just because Hogwarts was founded 1000 years ago, doesn't mean it would be paid either. It makes far more sense for it to be free, since canonically speaking, it is the only source of Magical Education in Britain and Ireland, and one of only three magical schools in Europe. If it wasn't free then surely the Weasleys wouldn't have been able to afford to send seven children there, and Ron would've probably mentioned it.

As I've said earlier, Wizarding Britain Is meant to reflect Britain at the time it was written. In fact it makes the most sense for Hogwarts to be termed an Academy than anything else, meaning that it is state-funded, but relatively independent from outside control.
