Yeah, binge drinking is a huge problem here. Though it is getting better. It used to be so bad that The City of Glasgow, has open container laws, except on Hogmanay from 6pm to 6 am. It's dangerous but no-one would think you an alcoholic since it's only a binge on Friday and Saturday night, you aren't dependent on the stuff yet. Lunchtime or Day drinking is common too especially at Christmas and New Year.
