One that came up for me the other day, was clothing terminology.

Oxfords are shoes not Shirts, if you want to refer to a dress shirt, it's just a shirt. I was reading a fix last week that referred to hogwarts students as wearing White Oxfords, which makes it sound like they're in the middle of the 1920s.

As a speaker of Scottish Gaelic, please for the love of god, don't say Plaid. Plaide means blanket. In Scotland and Britain the general term is Tartan. “Plaid Skirt” is not a term we use. At my old Independent (Private) School, the uniform was for Kilts.

Swearing is an art form here, especially in Scotland, Ireland and the North of England, the south also has some absolute belters. Don't shy away from creative swearing. I've already commented about the use of the word “Feck”, it's not a replacement for the word “Fuck”

Hogwarts, specifically, is supposed to pastiche the government funded education system, and its also a co-educational boarding school that lacks supervision. Don't be prudish and shy away from blue comedy or Lads Humour.

Alcohol Culture is different. Its legal to drink at home, at 14 and in a restaurant at 16, but illegal to but until the age of 18. We are no strangers to drink on this Island. Most parents will allow their children to taste alcohol at younger ages. In the books for example, Harry is freely given firewhisky at 17, and drinks butterbeer which is mildly alcoholic at 13.

Hogwarts is free, hearing about people struggling to pay fees is very odd, it's more of a Posh state school than an independent school. Don't refer to the term “Upperclassmen” or “Lowerclassmen” these terms don't exist, just refer to sets of year groups instead; First and second years, seventh years etc.

Wizarding Society is meant to imitate British Society, so no complaints about hospital bills either.

Other small things include the Mum/mom difference, and referring to “blocks” as a means of navigation. Cities in Britain predate the Victorian grid iron street pattern, and haven't been upgraded since. When giving directions say “down the street, second on the left” or something.
