Let me just quote myself, then, since you're clearly unable to read.

#+begin_quote
  Can confirm the queen-praising (at least) isn't a thing where I am... or *if it is, it's probably just the old and classy doing it*.
#+end_quote

Is that "belief"? No. It's scepticism. But I'm not a rude old biddy who insults everyone who disagrees with them, so I conceded that it does, in fact, sound like something the "old and classy" would do. People who have their heads stuck in old "traditions" that only their family knew about in the first place.

And face facts, the other "traditions" in your comment only support the theory that you're someone like that.

  The only people I've seen praising the queen were either singing "God Save the Queen," or were Americans trying to look "in".
#+end_quote

Again, is that belief? No.

The only things I've "believed" this entire time was that A) you're some old hag with delusions of grandeur, or B) you're taking the piss. My comments were pretty clear on that.

Frankly, given this, said by AutumnSouls:

#+begin_quote
  Did you actually think people thank the Queen after taking a shit? And that they cursed Prince Charles if it didn't flush? *Honestly, dude hahaha*
#+end_quote

I'm kind of tempted to assume that you three banded together to try and trick someone into believing what you said. All you got were sceptics, so you picked the wordiest comment and started taunting them. Bully what you can get, and all that.

And IDK why I'm even bothering with this, you three clearly can't fucking read. Or rather, you can, you just choose not to because what I'm /actually/ saying doesn't fit your agenda. What are you going to do next, tell the mods that I told you to kill yourself and then edited my comment?
