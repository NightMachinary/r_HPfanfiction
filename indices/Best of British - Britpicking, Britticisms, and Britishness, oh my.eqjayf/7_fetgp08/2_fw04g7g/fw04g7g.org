  A common phrase for sex is to "cover his teapot". This is based on an old tradition: when a boy turns 18, he is given a teapot to commemorate becoming a man. When a girl turns 18, she is given a tea cosy. Traditionally, when a couple would get married, a part of the ceremony was placing her tea cosy over his teapot.

That's a southern thing only, though. Here in the north, a girl gets given a ferrent to take care of at about the same age that boys make the transition to long trousers. One of our fine old wedding traditions used to be that the bride would put her ferret down her new husband's trousers, as a sign of his commitment to the coming wedding night.

It has gone the way of all such fine old traditions, of course, but survives in the competitive sport of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret-legging][Ferret Legging]].
