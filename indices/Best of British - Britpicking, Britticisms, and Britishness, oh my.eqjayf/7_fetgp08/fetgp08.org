A few contributions:

- In America people "say grace" before eating dinner; in the UK we thank the Queen.

- When Americans say they have "biscuits in gravy", it's a savoury scone-like thing. By contrast, in the UK we have what Americans would call "cookies" in our gravy.

- A common phrase for sex is to "cover his teapot". This is based on an old tradition: when a boy turns 18, he is given a teapot to commemorate becoming a man. When a girl turns 18, she is given a tea cosy. Traditionally, when a couple would get married, a part of the ceremony was placing her tea cosy over his teapot.

- In Britain, the Superman-inspired habit of wearing your pants on the outside never caught on; unlike our American cousins, we still wear our pants beneath our trousers.
