At my first c of e school we had to say grace before and after every meal, we had the whole school seated and eating at the same time so it was possible to do this. Later schools had staggered lunch times and you left as soon as you'd finished to free up space so it wouldn't have worked there. I've never heard any mention of thanking the Queen, I don't think that's at all normal. Similarly never heard the teapot saying or the tradition of giving a teapot or cosy, is that really old and obsolete?
