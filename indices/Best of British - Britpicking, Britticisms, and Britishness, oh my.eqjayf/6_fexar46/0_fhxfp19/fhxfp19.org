Except no-one liked having the top button on their shirt done up so teachers would tell us to do our top button up if they noticed. You see this in the films where the first years are all neat and tidy and then later on they gently push the uniform rules with unbuttoned shirt and a looser tie. We had a minimum number of stripes that our ties were meant to be, the fashion was for girls to wear theirs as short as possible. But yeah the hysteria over having to wear a school uniform is non-existent in the UK.
