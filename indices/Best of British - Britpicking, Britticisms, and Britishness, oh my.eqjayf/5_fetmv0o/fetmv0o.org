My thing that always is a bit of a minor make or break bit in HP fanfiction, for me at least, is the use of "Mom". The only people in Britain who I've heard say it that way are Americans, the English use "Mum", the Irish, and sometimes the Scottish, are likely to say "Mam", I'm not sure about the Welsh, but they definitely wouldn't use "Mom".
