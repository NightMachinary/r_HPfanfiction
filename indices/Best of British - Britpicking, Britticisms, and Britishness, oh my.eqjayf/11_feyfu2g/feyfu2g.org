I have read a few fics recently where the author attempted to write in an accent for the Weasleys, and went for either cockney or some strange amalgamation of Irish and RP. The Weasleys are from a tiny place in the countryside in Devon near Exeter. If they have any notable accent it'll be West Country, see e.g. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahznvtDunEw][this]].
