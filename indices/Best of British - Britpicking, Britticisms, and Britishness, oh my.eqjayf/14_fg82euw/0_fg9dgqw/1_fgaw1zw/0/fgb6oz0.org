...I don't actually know. He's definitely a chav when he's out and about with his mates - that gold chain and t-shirt combo he was wearing when the Dementors attacked is peak Chav.

When he's with his parents and being 'respectable', then he's more... I think the American term is 'Preppy'? We don't really have an equivalent here - the 'traditional' vibe of the Preppy is more tweed suits and flannel and brown oxford shoes (think non-Magical Slughorn, basically) over here. I think our closest alternative would be a 'Sloaney', after Sloane Square in London, but that's more Nouveau Riche than a Preppy is.

Anyway. Yes, when he's with his mates he is very much a Chav. So, I suppose Harry could get a hoodie from him, if Dudley was willing to part with that side of his wardrobe. We only ever really see Harry in shirts and such, so I always expected that Dudley was giving away his crappy Sloaney gear that he didn't really care about.
