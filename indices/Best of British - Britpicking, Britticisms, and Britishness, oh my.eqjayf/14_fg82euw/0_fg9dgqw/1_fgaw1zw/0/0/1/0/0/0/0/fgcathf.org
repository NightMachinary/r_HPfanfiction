Exactly. You don't see what you see all the time. It just becomes the background. It's why I think the statute of secrecy would actually outlast smart-phone cameras. We're all as oblivious to the day-to-day as New Yorkers are about their neighbours.

Not as bad as I'm imagining it sounds, but yeah, it wasn't the best. I figure that's why they chicken-fry it. Softens it up and gives it a decent taste. I haven't been to Barcelona myself, but I imagine most of what you ate there was seafood, right? The Iberian peninsula in general is really good at seafood.

Basic overview (though only of the first two games, the latter two are a spiritual sequel that I don't write for) - Telltale-style five-episode game about a teenage murder mystery in a twee, slowly-declining fishing village in Oregon starring a socially anxious artsy-hipster protagonist who attends the improbably well-funded local art college and has wholly unexplained time-reversing powers alongside a mood-flailing bestie with a troubled past. Kind of Twin-Peaks vibes to the whole thing, really.

Quite a lot of reviewers of the game found that best friend incredibly annoying. She's very clingy. I really enjoyed the characters myself, but if you're not into listening to Young American Teens navigate their social drama while poking into a surprisingly well-constructed murder-mystery narrative and casually playing about with the fabric of spacetime, then you'll probably not like it. If that appeals, then great! You'll probably enjoy it and there are a bunch of good letsplays on Youtube that'll let you check it out before buying.
