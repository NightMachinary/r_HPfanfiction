I am intrigued by the storyline and in a video game no less... though I'm likely not going to pick up a video game... most of my screen time is devoted to writing or researching my writing.

I do spend a lot of time listening to young American teens navigate their social drama as a middle school teacher. :) And I loved Twin Peaks when it first came out. Very edgy at the time.
