Sure, happy to help. Feel free to ask whatever you want and I'll do my best to provide. Can't really complain about people not writing proper Britticisms if we don't help teach them, right? :)

If it's any consolation, I do the same for Americans when I'm writing Life is Strange. No dictionary though, but I have a little commonplace notebook where I write all the information I have about your peculiar nation. China may eat bats and scorpions, but America is the only country that would name a pastry something like 'Bear Claw'. :D
