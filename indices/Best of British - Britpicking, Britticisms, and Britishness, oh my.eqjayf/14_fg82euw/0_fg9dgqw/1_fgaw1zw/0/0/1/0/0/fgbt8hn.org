Thanks! I'll likely take you up on that in future. Right now, I'm mostly working on a Sci-fi blend of Dead Space and Life is Strange, so contemporary American Culture doesn't come up too much, but I suspect some of my other stuff will necessitate an ask or two. :)

Agreed. It's so distinct a thing, culture, and by nature it's really difficult to consider properly. Unspoken social norms and all. It always makes me laugh when people say that white people/white Americans have no culture. Because a five minute conversation can prove that you clearly do. :)

I've tried a Rattlesnake once, and I can tell you it wasn't very chickeny. Could've been chicken, but with the toughness of badly cooked octopus and the blandness of badly cooked steak. I think the Chicken is just because it's often Chicken-fried (a uniquely American sacrilege).
