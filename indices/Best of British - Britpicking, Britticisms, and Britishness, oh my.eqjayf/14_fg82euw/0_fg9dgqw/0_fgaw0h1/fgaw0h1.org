Thank you! I realized while I was editing my story that I had used the word hoodie... which is definitely what all the young people wear around here even when the weather merits a down coat, hat, and gloves. The hoodie really became a thing of its own and a universal symbol of solidarity after Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida in 2012 for looking menacing (aka being black) while wearing his hoodie and walking around a white neighborhood eating skittles and drinking a soda.

So, Harry's wearing Dudley's cast-off clothes... would Dudley be considered a Chav?
