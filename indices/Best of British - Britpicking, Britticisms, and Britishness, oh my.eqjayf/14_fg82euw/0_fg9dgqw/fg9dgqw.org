I know the term originated in the 90s, so we'd definitely've called it that. I personally have never owned a hoodie and wasn't born until '96, but I asked my father about them and apparently they were worn generally in the 90s, but they were mostly popular with Chavs back then.

In case you're unaware of what a Chav is, they're basically young people of low social class who're prone to violent outbursts (stereotypically, and typically stereotyped by older people, I will add. One of my best friends is cosmetically Chav and she'd quite literally struggle to hurt a fly) and swagger about in packs, commenting on their physical strength and intimidation factor by proclaiming how 'hard' they are. They're also known for wearing designer clothing and paying attention to that sort of thing - kind of a prequel to the modern Fuckboii, I suppose, being obsessed with hair and ridiculously overpriced trainers and such. Always made me laugh, given the other meaning of being hard, but they insistently use it to boast about their toughness nevertheless. There's also a female subset of 'Essex Girl' that's leaked into the stereotype a bit, often to be found caked in foundation and being particularly concerned with the shape of their eyebrows, but that's more of a 2000s and later thing.

Harry definitely wouldn't be a Chav. He's a little too posh for that. He might wear one in a gym-going situation, but other than that, he'd definitely go with a jumper or a v-neck of some sort if you were looking for him to wear something other than a jacket or coat.
