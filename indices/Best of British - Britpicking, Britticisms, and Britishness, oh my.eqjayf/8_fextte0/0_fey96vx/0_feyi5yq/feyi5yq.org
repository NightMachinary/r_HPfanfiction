  All indications are that magical England and Scotland have been under a common government since at least 1269

In general the political structure of Wizarding Britain has somewhat interesting implications. The word /Wizengamot/, for example, has rather clear anglo-saxon roots (deriving from irl [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][Witenagemots]]) and would definitely have been disbanded or at least renamed during Normanization. Probably the easiest explanation is a second renaming during a period of anglo-saxon cultural nationalism in the 1700s -- say, perhaps Wizarding Britain came down hard on the anti-Catholic side during that conflict, and evoked the concept of the Norman Yoke on a much greater scale than on the non-magical side. Taken together with the indications that England and Scotland have been in union since the middle ages, an alternative explanation could be that the Norman conquest only happened on the non-magical side, or even that the Wizengamot separated from the British government on legitimist grounds against William the Conqueror.

TLDR I think too much about the etymological implications of words JKR most likely just randomly scribbled on the back of a napkin.
