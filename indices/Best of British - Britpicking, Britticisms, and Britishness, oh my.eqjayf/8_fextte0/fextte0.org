Oh, I thought of a good one! The fact that Britain, Great Britain, England, and the UK/United Kingdom are four different things.

The United Kingdom is the name for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Island all together. It's our big political and national entity.

Great Britain is just the big island (England, Wales, and Scotland).

Britain is alternatively used as a shorthand for Great Britain and a single name for England and Scotland.

England is the country at the bottom with London in it.
