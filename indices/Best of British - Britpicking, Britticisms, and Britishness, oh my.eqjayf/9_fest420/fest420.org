[obligatory i'm an american caveat here]

when I moved to the UK for grad school I found that panel shows & Graham Norton helped me understand a lot of jokes and slang

and another thing to keep in mind is the unexpected (at least to this american) points of crossover between cultures. I have a friend who watched lots of re-runs of Full House on British TV so I could immediately be like "omg remember the time DJ dressed like her teacher lol" and I never thought of that show as the pinnacle of American culture haha. So don't assume there's no knowledge of American stuff but try to find out which things really took off
