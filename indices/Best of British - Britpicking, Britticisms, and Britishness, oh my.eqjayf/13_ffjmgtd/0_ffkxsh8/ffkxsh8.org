I admit, I had to google what this meant - for those equally not in-the-know, this means to swear rapidly and without pause. Essentially, a rant of swearwords.

I mean, we all swear a tonne and use a joyously exclaimed 'aight, cunt!' (here in the North, anyway) as a way to greet friends, so I don't think so. Our closest equivalent, I believe, would probably just be 'swearing like a sailor' or 'their swearing would make a sailor blush', but that generally has more 'creative swearing' undertones than ranty implications. Could also call them an 'Essex Girl', if you're writing in a post-TOWIE era, I suppose (TOWIE is our version of Geordie Shore).

That's also a thing. We don't say 'cussing'. We might say 'cursing', but we'd pretty much always call it 'swearing'. So we might, in some places, say 'swear a blue streak', but I've never heard it where I live.

EDIT - Oh! I forgot there's also 'swearing up a storm'. I've heard that a few times from my Irish relatives and I'm fairly certain that's not just an Americanism we've picked up.
