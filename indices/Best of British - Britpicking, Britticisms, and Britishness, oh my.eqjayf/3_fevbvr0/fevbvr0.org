When fanfics talk about grades, "extra credit" and the idea that homework or projects contribute to the end of year grades in some way. That's not how British education was run in Rowling's era. Your entire grade/marks came from your final exams. There is no such thing as "extra credit", nor even normal credit.

EDIT: For "extra credit", when writers make the characters talk about "semesters" instead of "terms".
