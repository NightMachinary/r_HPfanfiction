Idk I definitely had a teacher who reminded me of the teacher in that essay (taught Chem too oddly). He was the best teacher I ever had and ~20 years later I still keep in touch with him, he throws me some tutoring gigs when I need a job/extra cash and helped me with my grad school admissions essay. He made me love science, taught me "the beauty of a softly simmering cauldron," if you will.

However, if you were shit at the subject and didn't pay attention, he was pretty mean to you. Made kids cry on the regular, though usually for doing something dumb/dangerous like sticking your head out a sixth floor window or playing with the outlets on a lab bench.

I can see how Snape would be a caricature of that teacher from a student who didn't get along with him. I bet if we saw him from Malfoy's perspective he'd be portrayed totally differently. I liked that essay for making me see that perspective, but it could have used a +little+ lot of nuance.
