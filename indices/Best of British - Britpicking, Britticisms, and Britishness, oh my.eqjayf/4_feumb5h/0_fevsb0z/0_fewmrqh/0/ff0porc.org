What got me was when she defends Snape by saying that Rowling's old chemistry teacher, whom she insists Rowling entirely based Snape on, was a nice man and therefore Snape is a nice man.

I agree with her that old school teachers could be ferocious disciplinarians while still holding the admiration of students, but I really really doubt that was Rowling's intent with Snape. That's more Mcgonagall's character IMHO.
