Yeah. A lot of our houses were built during the Industrial Revolution by Factory Owners wanting to get as many people crammed into as little space as possible, so the terraced houses (also called 'Two Up, Two Downs' because they had two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs) were the cheapest way to go.

A general pattern on cellars (though this isn't absolute) is that some rural houses sometimes have a small cellar (called a coal cellar, and used for storing coal), but mid-range houses in bigger cities would be more likely to have a bigger cellar for servant-rooms and the like.

Also, a 'yard' here in the North of England is more of a dirt-filled area where you run horses or livestock. Not sure what it'd be down south, though.
