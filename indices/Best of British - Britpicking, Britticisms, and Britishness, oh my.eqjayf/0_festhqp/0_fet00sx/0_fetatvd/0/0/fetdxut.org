Yes, I'm in a terrace as we speak! Traditional associated with low income, though not always - London and various seaside towns have sweeping Georgian terraces that are highly sought after. These may include a basement, and nowadays they are usually basement flats.

A more typical terraced house may no have a garden, or if they do, it will be a small, walled in yard perhaps with a narrow back alley running behind the row of houses. This style of housing was very common in mining or industrial areas and might have originally been built specifically for workers - if you lost your job you also lost your right to that home. Obviously not the same now!

The more rural you get, the more likely you are to have a detached house, with a garden. Semi-detached, where it is terraced only on one side, is common in the suburbs or in small towns and usually come with a garden.
