Just to nail down the distinction: a back yard is small and paved, and usually found out back of a terraced house. (No idea what they call those in other countries, but basically a row of houses that all share party walls with the houses to either side. Range from tiny cheap houses built for mill-workers up to fairly opulent townhouses.) A back garden is larger and is, well, a garden.
