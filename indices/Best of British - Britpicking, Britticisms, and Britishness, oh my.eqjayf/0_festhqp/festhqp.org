Something I keep seeing lately is characters going out to sit on the porch. British houses aren't built like American houses and wooden porches as you're imagining aren't very common here, and most houses are not raised. A porch in the UK usually refers to a very small, cold room just at the front door where shoes and wellies get dumped.

Something more British would be a patio - just a paved area usually in the back garden with perhaps a garden table and chairs and a bbq or something.

It's a small obscure one and I'm sure everyone else will chip in with the usual things of pancakes and mom and sidewalk and all that but porch is annoying me a lot at the moment for some reason.
