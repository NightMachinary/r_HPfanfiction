References to religion. Religion here is not the same as America. I have read multiple fics with references to Hermione spending her sundays in church. Ron too, in fact multiple fics seem to think that the Brits are deeply religious Christians. It's far more likely Hermione would see the inside of a church on a school trip to learn about religion than every sunday.

Also, the purity culture thing. Strange body hang ups that come with the psychological abuse of religious purity culture. Really strange to see it in a fic, it's actually incredibly jarring to suddenly have a female character worrying about her virginity and if she should be kissing someone. It's honestly very American and not British at all.
