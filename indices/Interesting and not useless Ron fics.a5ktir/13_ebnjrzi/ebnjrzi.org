[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2812800/1/Timeless][Timeless]] is a fic I found interesting. A whacky magical illness that includes time travel? Ron, a competent protagonist? It sure keeps you guessing, right along with Ron. And you kind of know it'll have a sad ending from the middle of it, but the exact /how/ and the /surely not/ just keep you going.
