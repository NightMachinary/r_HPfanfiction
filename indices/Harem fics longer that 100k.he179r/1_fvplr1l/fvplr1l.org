linkffn(Effects and Side Effects by Pheonix Dawn). Incomplete, but I like it.

linkffn(He's Not Dead Yet by Redbayly). Complete.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic by Lord BladeDSF). Incomplete. I didn't care for it, but YMMV.

linkffn(Witches of Westfield by EJ Daniels). Complete. Not your typical harem story, but I like it.

linkffn(The Potter Attraction by Pax Humana). Not marked complete, but has a sequel. This is an HP/Naruto cross, and is a sequel to the Naruto story linkffn(Chunin Exam Day by Perfect Lionheart). It's not to my taste, but again, YMMV.

I don't believe links to the following are allowed here.

The XXXX You Say by Selector. On [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. Complete. Too much sex for my taste.

Like A Phoenix From The Ashes by Kinsfire. Complete (but only 99,764 words), and has a completed sequel. On [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], and probably requires a site login.

The Harem War by Vance McGill. On [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. Incomplete. Overall, I liked it, but I thought it had too much sex.

The Harem War by Radaslab. On [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. Incomplete. I haven't read it yet, but it's certainly got the length.
