I'm not exactly sure what you mean by original, but I shall try nonetheless.

Azoth, linkao3(1049966) is pretty neat. It's about Harry who, after the war doesn't really know what to do with his life, until he decides to take up potions.

Then there is [[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/]] (yeah, it has its own website for some reason, I don't think it's on ao3 or ffnet) I've been rereading it recently and I'm taking every chance I can to recommend it. It's not Harry centric, but this one has a pretty original premise and it deserves all the love.

These two are slash, and you asked for our favourite ones so I hope it's ok.

I wanted to add something nonslash and Harry centric as well, but looking at my list all those that qualify are either not that great, or are the usual suspects which get recommended every other day. So I'll leave it at that.
