I think those are pretty much the only ones. Linkffn(10932567) sort of fits. When Lily sacrificed herself in another universe she merged with Harry and they became a new person Holly. I think this is a side story to another series the author writes (idk as I've never read the series). I started this story and it was ok but all I remember was that it was a fair amount of smut involved. I never finished it but I think it was decent.
