I had a notion like this, in that the victim's soul is used by the killer to empower the horcrux as a soul anchor. Their soul isn't in the afterlife, /yet/. In fact the casting of the killing curse grabs that soul and stows it into the wand that killed them, which is why the spirits of Voldemort's victims were able to arise and act against him, which is well beyond the capabilities of a simple echo.

The problem as pointed out elsewhere, is that Myrtle's ghost still wanders around.
