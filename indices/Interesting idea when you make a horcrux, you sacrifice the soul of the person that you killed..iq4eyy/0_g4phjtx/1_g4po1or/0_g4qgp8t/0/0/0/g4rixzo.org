What you say actually makes. It sucks really bad that we did not get to know about the story of any person who created horcrux other than Tom. It was also just mentioned that Herpo the foul was responsible for creating the first horcrux. But from what I could understand through slughorns conversation with Tom, it seems that there may have been potentially other people who have tried to create horcrux and have been successful. I really wished JK put more stories around people trying to create horcruxes.

And I believe the '*reserved for significant people*' might have meant more for choosing certain kind of people that fit his tastes. Not that it changes how much a murder weighs for the person. Because I believe Tom never really had much hesitation in killing people, it's all the same for him. For Tom how important a murder is, might depend on the target person and it's safe to assume he is trying to pick the fanciest murders for creating a horcrux, just like how he chose priceless objects as his horcrux vessel.
