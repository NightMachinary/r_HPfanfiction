  I meant to say that `/the act of murder/` is the requirement for creating a horcrux, you don't require a soul for it. The soul of the person, that has been murderd is completely independent from creation of horcrux. You have to `/kill someone so that it rips apart your own soul/`. Creating a horcrux does not require any kind of soul of the person you killed, it requires your own soul to be split.

Agree with this. I think the symbolic aspect of making horcruxes is /self-destruction/ (or rather, self-mutilation). It's all about the /creator/ of the horcrux and his/her soul, what he/she is doing to bring about the death, and how those actions affect him/her, /not the victim./ That isn't to say the victim has /no/ importance in the process:

Dumbledore says in HBP:

Significant to whom? To the /creator/ of the horcrux. My guess is that the spell(s) that create a horcrux probably require the deaths to be significant* to the caster so that the soul is more receptive to manipulation (more emotional) upon being split.

*It could be argued that the fact that Tom used an Albanian peasant (diadem) and a muggle tramp (locket) shows that the deaths /do not/ have to be important to the caster. My response would be that the creation of multiple horcruxes probably deviates significantly from the original intended purpose and method. The first horcrux - the first instance of self-mutilation of the soul - is probably the most complicated and painful instance. Additionally, the soul is permanently damaged, potentially leaving it unstable. Subsequent horcruxes would become easier to create as there is less of a need to be in an intense emotional state in order to access the soul. This in turn would make the murder less important as well to the overall process.
