I meant to say that `/the act of murder/` is the requirement for creating a horcrux, you don't require a soul for it. The soul of the person, that has been murderd is completely independent from creation of horcrux. You have to `/kill someone so that it rips apart your own soul/`. Creating a horcrux does not require any kind of soul of the person you killed, it requires your own soul to be split. You have to murder someone and whatever happens to victim, whether they become a ghost or their soul goes to a different realm, is completely different story and in no way is it related to the horcrux creation.

And traces have always been described very loosely in the books, not to say that it has be illogical or out of place. As for the Imperius curse, Tom has always been very careful in using unforgivables during his years at hogwarts. Otherwise he would have just gone around killing Muggle borns with the killing curse instead of using a Basillisk. It really makes sense for Tom to put Morfin under Imperius and then make him kill the muggles, but it would be too risky for him.
