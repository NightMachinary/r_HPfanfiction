I meant if the ghost of Myrtle is her actual soul, it can't be in use to bind the diary horcrux together. The only reason I consider the ghost to be the soul is that ghosts can evidently learn things like modern English, people's names and gossip about them and hold onto recent memories. People whose soul have been sucked out by a Dementor don't have those capacities, so I associate memory and personality with the soul.

I have this problem with JKR's worldbuilding in that what people declare as being the case sometimes doesn't logically fit with how these things are portrayed, so I take evidence in action over declarations by characters. For the same reason, I think Dumbledore is wrong about how Tom Riddle handled the murders in Little Hangleton in 1943, given how the Trace actually seems to function. It makes much more sense that Riddle used the Imperius on Morfin Gaunt and made him go up the hill and kill the muggle Riddles. That way his memory of doing so would be accurate and genuine, and the only spell that might have been detected as cast by Tom Riddle would have been cast in the Gaunt's shack, where no doubt the Ministry ignores all spellwork since they're longtime Pureblood residents.
