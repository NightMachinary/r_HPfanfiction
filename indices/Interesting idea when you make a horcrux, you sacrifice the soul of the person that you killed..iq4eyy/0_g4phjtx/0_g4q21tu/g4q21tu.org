The act that is supposed to split the soul is evidently abhorrent beyond any other possibility, so I prefer the idea that the victim's soul is extinguished. Far worse than being temporarily (?) trapped in a wand.

And I don't see how ghosts present a problem in either line of thought; ghosts are left behind by souls taken from life and unwilling to accept it. Whether Myrtle straight up died, or her soul was snuffed out, or stored in a wand or wherever (even though the basilisk killed her), the point is that her soul isn't there anymore. Whether the foot leaves the sand for the water or concrete or grass, there are prints left behind.

I think what happened in the graveyard is perfectly in line with what ghosts can do, though I couldn't definitively label those afterimages as ghosts.
