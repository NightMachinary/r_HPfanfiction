Lily's soul probably "survived" due to the botched creation. I think that if her soul was annihilated, Harry wouldn't have been protected.

That being said, with that exception out of the way, this is an interpretation I've seen once, and also the most horrific one. Similar to a Dementor's Kiss.

EDIT: Thinking on it a bit more, I doubt Voldemort used Lily as the sacrifice at all since his initial plan was to save her. If anything I expected him to have used Harry. This might actually explain the botched Horcrux creation that still partially succeeded despite the AK counter.
