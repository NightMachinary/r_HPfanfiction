I have a weird concept about deaths in harry potter.

The death of Myrtle is completely different from every other horcrux victim. Myrtle was directly killed by the basillisk under tom's orders but tom did not kill Myrtle himself, whereas everyone else was killed by the Avada Kedavra directly by tom. I have heard from somewhere (a very loose theory), that you cannot become a ghost if you are killed through the Avada Kedavra. In Harry potter universe, if someone kills you through a knife or something, you can become a ghost and then testify yourself for your murder, but the killing curse makes sure such a thing doesn't happen. That is why the killing curse is considered so dangerous.

And your theory of soul sacrifice wont work. In memory that harry gets from Slughorn, it is mentioned that murder of someone will split your soul (regardless of whether you want to make a horcrux or not) into two. Horcrux happens to be a type of magic that allows you to embed this part-soul into an object, while your original soul keeps residing in your body. Horcrux allows you to take advatage of your murder, not that it directly requires some kind of soul sacrifice.
