I like the interpretation that the wand and stone corrupt the owner into wanting death on a (not so) subtle level. The stone is pretty obvious, but I think that it merely projects memories from a person rather than skype with the dead. The wand also kills, but that's mostly through hubris. Yet a supposedly powerful wand gives you confidence and calm therefore making you a better duelist through its reputation alone. Eventually, you pass a breaking point and end up dead due to your own increasingly aggressive tendencies and overconfidence.
