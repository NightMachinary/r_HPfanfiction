I have started to think of the Deathly Hallows as Love. In the book it says the the master of the Hallows become the conqueror of death. The Elder Wand is the the most powerful weapon, and there is nothing more powerful than love. The Resurrection Stone can bring back loved ones, or more realistically represents the memory of the ones we have loved and lost but carry with us forever. And the Invisibility Cloak, is something you can shield yourself with to protect you from danger. If you surround yourself with those that you love and that love you, you protect yourself from the dangers of our world. So the Deathly Hallows all refer back to Dumbledore's great weapon of all time, love.
