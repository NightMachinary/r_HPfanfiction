I have generally preferred Dumbledore's view, that the whole Death thing was simply a fairy tale. The brothers Peverell were simply supremely gifted artificers, and each created their artefacts themselves.

Also that the Veil of Death was one of Cadmus' early experiments with accessing the plane of the dead.

Meanwhile, my personal theory about the Master of Death theory was that it was a prophecy about the man who would do it, rather than a mantle he receives. Harry united the Hallows because he was the MoD, he didn't become the MoD by uniting them.
