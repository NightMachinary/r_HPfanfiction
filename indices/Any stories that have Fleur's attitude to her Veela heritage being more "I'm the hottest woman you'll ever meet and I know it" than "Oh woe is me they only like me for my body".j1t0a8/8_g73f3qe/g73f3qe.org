Despite it not being my favorite pairing (that would go to Harry/Luna with a Harry/Hermione as a close second)...

I have always had a soft spot for Harry/Fleur stories, particularly ones where either...

1. Harry reforms the "Im too good for you" style of Fleur and wins her over or...

2. Fleur takes Harry under her wing or "claims" him and goes on to turn him into a powerful force in the WIzarding world.

But I have to say I am not sure i agree with the OP's sentiments that most stories or even the canon story have her as a "woe is me" type. Shes already kind of "Im the hottest woman" type, but she just is a bit isolated and uncomfortable to a degree within Wizarding Britan rather than France.
