I'm not of fan of the Harry/ Fleur ship, which mean I don't read about her a lot outside of a very secondary role, but I'm . . . surprised by the whole "Veela Alure". Writing about Fleur in FF, it sound like a kind of mentale attack that she can control at will, while I always thought of it as the Veela being very hot. I mean, people like models can kinda "control" how people perceive them depending of how they act (full make up during a photo shoot it different from no make up in front of TV), but you can't ask them to stop being hot on demand.
