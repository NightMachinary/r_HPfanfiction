The idea of the "Veela Allure" is from GoF - if you read the scene of the Veelas walking into the stadium, it's pretty clearly the inspiration for it in FF. Obviously, everything gets dialed up a ton though.

Personally, I find the Veela Allure to be an interesting setup, but most fics don't really deliver on it greatly. It's just used as an excuse to somehow have Harry immune to it, be special/awesome, and then hook up with Fleur.

There's much more interesting things to do with a not-fully-human character than that, even if just to explore worldbuilding elements - add in that she's basically the only French character of note (which is objectively superior to British characters ;) ), and that she was good enough to become a champion and there's a lot more to her then just a prize for SuperSpecialAwesome!Harry to win.
