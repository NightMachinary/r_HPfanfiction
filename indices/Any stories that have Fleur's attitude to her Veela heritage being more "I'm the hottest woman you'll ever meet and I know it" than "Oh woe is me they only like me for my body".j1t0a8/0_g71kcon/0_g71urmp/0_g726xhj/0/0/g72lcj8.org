I've always seen it as Fleur being a stunningly beautiful woman naturally and that as a result of her Veela heritage she also has her Allure. With the Allure being a magical aura that causes those in its area of effect to see her - and possibly others according to the wiki - as more desireable.

However it's not something that she can control and is likely linked to her emotional state, similar to how Tonks' metamorphagus abilities are effected by her emotions.

Also, if you haven't read them the Half Blood Romantic and A Different Kind of War stories are incredible and definitely sold me on the ship.
