Right?! Where are people getting that she has any powers? The only place that says part Veela inherit the power to entrance men is the Harry Potter wiki, which sources Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire so it's not a good source considering it's not even mentioned besides people ( teenage boys ) being entranced by very pretty girls that are dancing through the hall. Veela aren't in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, so saying that they have any powers at all seems to be pure fanon.
