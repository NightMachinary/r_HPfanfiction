There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13298565/1/A-Court-of-Flowers][A Court of Flowers by DavidTheAthenai]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13855500/chapters/31870299?view_adult=true][Hope and Healing by Gomez36000]] which are in progress at the moment and being written as we speak. Hope and Healing is going through a full rewrite as the author wasn't happy with it about halfway through, they're planning on finishing the entire fic and then posting with a regular schedule.

If you're at all interested both Gomez and DavidTheAthenai are in the [[https://discord.gg/kSEQ4m][Harry/Fleur Discord Server]]. We have a weekly bookclub (sometimes longer if the fic is over 100k) and are currently going through [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9977668/1/The-British-Reformation][The British Reformation by kb0]]. We also have regular discussion, free beta reading services, high quality story reviews, a rocking memes channel, and a prompt channel where stories are proposed, discussed, and regularly explored. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/DrabbleCollectionTheFirst][Flowerpot Garden Collection]] is one such creation.
