I just think that both of those pairings - Honks or Flowerpot - just make far more sense than the canon ones Rowling pulled out of her ass and would actually have fit the story better because of it.

Despite the age difference, there's enough maturity/immaturity between Harry and Tonks respectively that would allow them to overcome it. Their personalities fit well without having to rely on tropes; as you've said they have enough common interests to have that bonding experience and Tonks' abilities as a Metamorphagus and position as an Auror gives plenty of opportunities for something to develop. Basically, she provides the fun experience that a character like Harry would need while still having a level of maturity to sympathise with him and his struggles.

Fleur and Harry, on the other hand, works well for a different reason; he's stubborn enough to deal with the rougher aspects of her personality, she's blunt enough to pull him out of his shell and deal with his moodier moments, she's also an incredibly powerful and knowledgable witch who was able to casually put a dragon to sleep at just 17, a dragon that from memory was meant to take a dozen people to take down.\\
Add to that the fact that Harry has her respect for saving her sister, that he's nice to her when others aren't so kind and that he's one of the few people around that doesn't drool the second she walks into a room and you've got a pretty decent reason to have them together.

Like you said they make far more sense than some of the weird shit that edgier/younger authors like to put out and I personally see them as making far more sense than the ones that Rowling pulled out of her ass. It also has the added bonus of allowing two interesting characters that could have been better (or even slightly) fleshed out to take a more central role that doesn't relegate Fleur as the hot one Bill is cool enough to marry or Tonks the depressed metamorph with a Lycan fetish.
