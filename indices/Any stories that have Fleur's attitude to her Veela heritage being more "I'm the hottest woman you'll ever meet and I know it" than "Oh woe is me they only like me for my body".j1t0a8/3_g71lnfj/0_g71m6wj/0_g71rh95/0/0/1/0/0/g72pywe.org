Hermione is another victim of that as well; Ron just doesn't make sense for Hermione for many reasons but Rowling's pro-feminist beliefs is one of them.\\
Dating someone you have vicious arguments with, who gets jealous over your successes and who relies on you to finish any work they struggle with is not exactly a healthy relationship, let alone a pro-feminist one.

As for Ginny there are plenty of things to critique her for regarding her pairing with Harry, not least of which is the apparent fact that Rowling had obviously planned for them to be together at the start but forgot to include that in the books until the last two.

Absolutely agree with you on how interesting the Honks relationship would have been, both during and post-hogwarts.

The smut is honestly 90% of the reason that it's so hard to find a good Honks of FlowerPot story. Horny authors only see Tonks as a girl that can look like anyone she wants and Fleur is simply the hot one.

I'd love it if those two ships became more prevalent, because as much as I can appreciate other popular pairings I feel like they've been done to death comparatively.
