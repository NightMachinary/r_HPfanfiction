It's because children write all those terrible things you listed out in the bottom portion of your post. It's okay and fine because Harry is a beta (which they use wrongly, of course) and gay. Even if he has to be forced into being gay through rape and Stockholm Syndrome, since they're kids, and their readers are kids, it's totally fine. But the same thing with a straight couple with that age difference? Hell no.
