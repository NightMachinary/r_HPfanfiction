Carmen Victory was a solid read but I remember there being something about it that eventually made me quit midway through it. I think it was something about the darker plot and characters, although it's been a couple years now so my memory is fuzzy. Never did get around to finishing it, probably never will tbh.

All I can say for certain is that I took it off the List and I usually don't do that without a good reason.
