I don't think so - she's from a different country (France), not /great/ with the language, and surrounded by boys who drool over her to an extent (eg, Ron's reaction at the feast). I think that's all natural to add up to someone being more restrained and aloof - that doesn't make her a 'conceited bitch'. Plus, we're seeing her from Harry and his friend's POV, and they're 3-4 years younger - most 17-18 year olds aren't going to pay much attention to 14 year olds, after all.
