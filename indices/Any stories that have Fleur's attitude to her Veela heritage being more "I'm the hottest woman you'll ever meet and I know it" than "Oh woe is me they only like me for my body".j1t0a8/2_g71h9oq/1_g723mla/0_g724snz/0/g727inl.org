I mean it does affect other people. Ron, for one. And I think her Yule Ball date Roger Davies is described as acting really stupid around her. I don't think we get the sense that she's able to turn it on or off, but presumably if she's acting in accordance with her hormones instead of against or neutrally, her natural allure (like normal attractiveness, not a superpower) is much stronger. At least that's how I've been taking the "blasting"/"not blasting" to mean in more reasonable fics.
