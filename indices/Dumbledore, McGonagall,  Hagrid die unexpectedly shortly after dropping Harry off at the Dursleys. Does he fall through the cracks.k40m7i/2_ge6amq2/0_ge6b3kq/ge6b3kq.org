I thought about that quote but the problem with it is its utter lack of clarity. First off, we know that even if the Ministry knows hes in Little Whinging, they don't know exactly where he lives. Secondly, that quote is made deep into the "school years", so we don't know the timeline on the "close monitoring" she speaks of, nor the full implications of what "past events" means.

Its easy to jump to the conclusion that they have been monitoring since day 1, but at the same time that seems to go against the idea that Dumbledore was hiding him away behind (illegal mind you) blood wards from the Wizarding world itself and factoring in that the Ministry was clearly compromised... well it just seems odd the Ministry would be as aware pre-schooling as that quote seems to imply.
