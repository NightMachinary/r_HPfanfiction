Possible points of contact (time)| Reason:

1. Hogwarts letter (usual time)| It /seems/ to have come automatically in canon.
2. Snape (after sorting of 1991) | Oath to protect Lily's son, knowledge of the Mundane (even if he doesn't end up as Potions Master, he probably will check on Harry, especially if he doesn't show up at Hogwarts).
3. Sirius (same as first canon meeting if not butterflied away)| He /does/ find Harry as Padfoot with seemingly little trouble. It is conceivable that he would be questioned (and thereby be motivated to seek out Harry) if he doesn't appear when expected.
4. Voldemort (After end of Years 1, 2, or 4 if the respective plots are not thwarted) | Wants to kill Harry, but /if/ the wards prevent attack or precise finding (after all, in book 7, they seem to have known at least the general area to wait in), he will probably be forced to wait for Harry to turn 17 or leave the protected area.

In case 1 we can have anything from "almost canon, as long as someone figures out the Horcruxes" to "arbitrarily butterflied AU"

Case 2 lends itself to Severitus

​

Case 3 is a standardish lead-in towards Lord Padfoot fics

​

Case 4 easily goes into Bad Future fics
