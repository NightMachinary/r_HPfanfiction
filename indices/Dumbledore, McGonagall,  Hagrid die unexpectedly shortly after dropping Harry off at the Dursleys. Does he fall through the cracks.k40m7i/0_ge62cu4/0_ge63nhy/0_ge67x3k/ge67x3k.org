The first two paragraphs are good questions, could go whichever way one wants for the story, really without contradicting a shred of the underlying canon.

Sirius finds Harry at least /near/ Privet drive - he's the big black dog Harry runs into after fleeing Number 4 with his trunk after blowing up Marge. It is not entirely clear how far away from Number 4 Harry was, or how far the blood ward's influence extends, so one could understand this as either "the wards successfully prevented Sirius from finding Number 4, and he was prowling around the border of the ward" or "Sirius successfully entered the wards".

In the former case, the wards do /not/ sense intent, and they just blanket-repel all magicals, or something like that.

I suspect it is the latter case, because Sirius later tells Harry that he had come by Privet Drive to check on him on his way to Hogwarts to get Peter, and he doesn't remark on being unable to enter or find him... It is possible he was being prevented and Sirius didn't realize that for any number of reasons.

Indeed. Without Dumbledore, the Philosopher's Stone probably doesn't end up at Hogwarts, so that might be closed off. Bertha Jorkins' Albanian trip and Crouch Jr. escaping probably still happen, and Voldie says he fled back to the same place after losing Quirrel, so blood, bone, and flesh probably still happens, just with a different Enemy. Year 2 could still happen, and without a Parselmouth to enter the CoS...
