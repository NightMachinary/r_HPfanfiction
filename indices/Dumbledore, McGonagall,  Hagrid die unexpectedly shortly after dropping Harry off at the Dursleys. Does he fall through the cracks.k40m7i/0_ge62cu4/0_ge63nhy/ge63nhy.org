The letter certainly comes automatically. 1 letter. The question is, is it normal to be spammed with them if you don't answer (I think not personally). And what happens if a letter is ignored?

The question with Snape is would he be affected by the blood wards and in what way. I would question how they would react even with his intent because of how that intent came to be. There is also the question of if he stays around with Dumbledore gone.

Sirius does find Harry but that is after Harry has gone back to school and after he has been trying to find Peter via the Weasleys so he may have come across information which may not exist in my scenario. Hell he may not even break out in the first place in the scenario I laid out since its predicated on Harry going back to school in a way.

Voldemort is a big ? without Harry in the picture in the traditional way. It is interesting to think about how he would be affected.
