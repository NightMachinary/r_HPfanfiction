I would ask another question: Does it matter if no one knows where he lives? On the one hand, the address on the letter appears to be magical -- no one could have known that Harry lived in the boxroom under the stairs, or the address of the hotel in Cokeworth. And on the other hand, clearly letters from Hogwarts can reach him at Privet Drive. So the progress of events would be thus; Harry gets a Hogwarts letter, whoever is in charge of the registration eventually realises there is no answer and resends the letter, and since the letter addresses itself, they know the address, too, and can deliver it by hand.

Ultimately, nothing else but what happens in Canon where Hagrid figures out where "Hut-on-the-rock" is using only the letter. So I don't think he'd fall through the cracks.

*Edit:* And of course, there's always the Muggleborn angle. No one knows where they live either, so there is a way to figure that out -- in the most simple case the self-addressing letter from above.
