Ah very true. I didn't consider the fact that Dumbledore could have been supressing any accidental magic incidents. Then again as you pointed out, we don't necessarily know how aware the Ministry is (ignoring outside interference for good or bad).

Of course then the question is, if accidental magic is detected and followed up on, I would assume it would have to happen outside the blood wards or they may not be able to find Harry. Not sure though...
