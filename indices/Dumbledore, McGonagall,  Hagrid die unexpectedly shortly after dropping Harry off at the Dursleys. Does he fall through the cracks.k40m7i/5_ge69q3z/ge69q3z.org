To me, This depends on how soon they die. We know Harry performed Accidental Magic while in Primary school. Asumming Dumbledore didn't have time to do anything, then in theory the Ministry would know where Harry is the moment the 1st bit of magic happens in a public area. Such as the "Wig turned blue" incident, or that time Harry apparated to a Roof.

I say "in theory" because it depends on who shows up to investigave the incident. If a former death eater is the one who shows up at say, the school, then chances are the Ministry won't know about it. Same goes for a former OotP member, only for the opposite reason.

Now, if the Ministry does find out where Harry is, chances are he gets removed from the Dursleys. Dumbledore issn't alive to fight this decision. The Ministry will want 'The boy who llived' to be part of their society asap, since it's, you know, safe.

But this only covers some of what could happen while Harry is at Primary School. Harry could leave the Dursleys sooner than this.
