Depending on how manipulative your notion of Dumbledore is, I would say Harry's life would be similar to or better than canon until the 1st letter came. As far as we know, no one came to check on Harry and Mrs Figg was not exactly effectual. So if Dumbledore used active magic to keep him at the Dursleys, without him, any complaints made to Child Welfare might actually stick. But that's a hard version.

Assuming the contact letter is automated, he should still get one. I like the notion of the new deputy seeing the address and getting upset (Cupboard Under the Stairs), but there's a good chance they aren't looking after 10 years. Now, the name "Harry Potter" will still carry weight so as soon as someone realizes he hasn't answered, I should think he would get a personal visit from the deputy. No shower of letters, though. Once at Hogwarts, I feel as though most of his canon adventures wouldn't happen; 1st year, Quirrel might get hired (which could still be very dangerous for Harry), but no Mirror of Erised, no Philosopher's Stone, probably no troll. Invisibility cloak potentially lost unless Dumbledore labeled it as a Potter possession. Hard to say about Snape's attitude or if he'd be friends with Hermione. No Quidditch yet either.

Of course, if second year starts out the same, it would probably end a hell of a lot darker. Harry dead or obliviated if Lockhart was still hired; Ginny dead; a young Voldemort resurrected. (I'm sure there is a way to spin it happier though)

Going back to the letters... if no one realizes what's going on with Harry and he ends up staying at the Dursleys, then I posit him eventually running away and living on the streets. Tracking accidental magic seems very hit and miss but if his was cloaked by something Dumbledore did, he'll get sensed by the Ministry as soon as he's away from Privet or never. On the streets, he's either a victim or a survivor, and we'd all prefer tales of the latter. He'll probably never learn about Hogwarts until his kid gets a letter (assuming he has any).
