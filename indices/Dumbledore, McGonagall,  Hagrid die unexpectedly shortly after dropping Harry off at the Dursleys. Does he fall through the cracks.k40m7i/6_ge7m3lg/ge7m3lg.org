This is really fascinating to think about.

First of all, we'd have to assume how they died. Dumbledore you could write from old age. But what about McGonagall and Hagrid? How do they die?

Hagrid, maybe from a potential too dangerous creature, finally got the best of him. McGonagall? Mhm... not sure to make enough sense.

It seems to be widely assumed that names are put in the book at birth. So, I'd assume that Harry would get a letter to Hogwarts when it's time to get one.

Now: A lot would change. With no Dumbledore, Quirrel might not get hired, there'd be no troll, no stone, etc.

Second year could be a lot darker: Ginny could be dead, a Teenage Voldemort could be around, more students could be dead instead of petrified.

Third year: Does Sirius escape? Sirius only escapes because he saw the newspaper and noticed Pettigrew's rat form. If the Weasley's don't go to Egypt, Sirius might not escape. Or he might say screw it and escape way earlier or way later then in canon. Several ways you could play with that. You also likely wouldn't get Dementors at the school at this point. Harry wouldn't learn Patronus.

And then we go from there, things get even trickier to decide what ends up happening. Especially, if Teenage Voldemort is around.
