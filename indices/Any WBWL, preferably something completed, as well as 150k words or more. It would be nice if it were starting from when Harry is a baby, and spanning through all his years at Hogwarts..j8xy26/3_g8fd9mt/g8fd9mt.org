It's not complete, but it's 350k or something and updates every week. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) And then obviously, there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) which is probably the best one out there in my option (I know that is controversial, don't flame me please, just an opinion). Granted, I think I'm going to like Ashes of Chaos better than PoS when there is more written.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) is also outstanding, but it's abandoned and has been for years. Still worth a read though.
