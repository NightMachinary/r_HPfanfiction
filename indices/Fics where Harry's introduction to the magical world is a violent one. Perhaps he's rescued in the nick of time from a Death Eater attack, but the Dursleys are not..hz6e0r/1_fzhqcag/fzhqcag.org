A Study In Magic: linkffn(7578572)

The Dursleys get killed in one of Moriarty's "challenges". Harry's first contact with the Wizarding World is Aurors trying to stun/obliviate his new adoptive parents (which happen to be Sherlock Holmes and female!John Watson).

It's not quite a good fit (he still gets a more normal introduction later on and isn't really affected by the attempts to obliviate his adoptive parents), but he's slightly more wary than in canon.
