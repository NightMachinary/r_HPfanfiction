Thanks, I thought it would be good divergence point kind of thing.

I was thinking before Hagrid told him. Perhaps several years before. Just... no real idea that magic actually exists until a couple of evil masked wizards kill his cousins and nearly him as well. In come the Aurors or the Order or Dumbledore, there's a short but intense magical battle that gives little Harry a fair amount of PTSD, and he's apparated away.
