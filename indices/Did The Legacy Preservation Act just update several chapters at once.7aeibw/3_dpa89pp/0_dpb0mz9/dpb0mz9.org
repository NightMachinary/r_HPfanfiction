Pretty much the same. The [[/spoiler][pregnancy]] was about the most predictable move ever. And the ending with the power of friendship was one of the cringiest bits of ff I've ever read. Don't know why people go for Romeo/Juliet style romances with Harry/Daphne but then have no inter-house or inter-family conflict because of it (other than Malfoy occasionally mouthing off).
