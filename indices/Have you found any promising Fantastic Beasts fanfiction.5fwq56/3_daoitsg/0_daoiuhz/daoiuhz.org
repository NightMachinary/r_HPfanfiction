  Newt is seven when he decides he likes animals more than people. (Well, he's seven when he cements that decision in stone, anyway.)He's seventeen when the Hogwarts Express leaves without him on it and his brother yanks him up by the shirt front and takes him to work at the Ministry with him. (Seventeen when the world goes to hell around him and everyone collectively stops what they're doing to fight and die in mud and dragon fire and mustard gas.)He's twenty-seven when Albus Dumbledore meets him in Paris (auburn hair starting to grey, looking far more exhausted Newt has ever met) and entrusts him with a task he's sure he'll never accomplish.

  [post-movie] Tina taps Queenie's shoulder, firm, three quick fingertip raps. “Queenie.” Her tone is soft, but beneath it there's the undercurrent of we've talked about this before.
