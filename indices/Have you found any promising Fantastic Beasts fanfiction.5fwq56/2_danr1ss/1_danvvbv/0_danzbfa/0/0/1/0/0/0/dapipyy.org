I've heard this rhetoric before, from someone in high school who 5 years later got arrested in a kiddie porn ring.

It is a mixture of not understanding the times and not having an understanding of anatomy. What was acceptable 100 years ago and is not acceptable now is just that: not acceptable. Also the idea that there is the same anatomy as adults is a falsehood for justification purposes.

Teen bodies are still growing at 15. Their brains are not completely developed until the early 20s, especially the parts that process morally challenging decisions, recognizing safety, and good judgement. Teens are in a near adulthood stage where they stuck in between their old lives and their new.

With newer information and understanding, the paradigm shifted to make such things social unacceptable.
