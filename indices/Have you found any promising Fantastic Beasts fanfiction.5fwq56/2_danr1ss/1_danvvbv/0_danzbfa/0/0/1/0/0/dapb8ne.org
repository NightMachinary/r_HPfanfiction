That still isn't pedophilia. Culturally, we view teenagers as children, but they have the anatomy of adults. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia][A child must be prepubescent for it to be pedophilia]]. 100 years ago (about the setting of this movie) there was nothing wrong with marrying a 15 year old.

Again, I'm not defending this creepy abuse of power, just it's not a mental disorder where adults are sexually attracted to children.
