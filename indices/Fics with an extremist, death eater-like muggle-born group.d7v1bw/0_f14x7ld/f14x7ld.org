I've always been curious to see an inversion of the Order-DE antagonism after the war. Voldemort and his Death Eaters were mostly Slytherins, hence Slytherins are evil. A Gryffindor recruits a band of zealots willing to "cleanse" the country from Slytherin "evil". Perhaps someone slighted during the War, losing his/her family.
