Haven't read much of it (because it's not my kind of thing) but [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc][*/Dangerous by blacklotus/*]].

Gdocs link because original site it was on is gone.

Here is a description of it by a user named finebalance.

  Once you get past the premise, Dangerous is a brilliant post-DH dark!Hermione fic that is rather well-written, unexpectedly sexy, and unrelentingly interesting.

  A short summary: After 10 years of minimal contact, Harry returns to a wizarding Britain where Hermione is a terrorist (a violent dark lord with a muggleborn following), muggleborns are openly attacked, and peace and reconciliation are further than ever. Hermione is actually brilliant, but scary; there's a dissection of the often skewed nature of Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron; there's an exploration of societal prejudice and violent resistance, as well as the consequences of many things casually mentioned and rapidly forgotten in book 7 (muggleborns in Azkaban; student's being tortured in Hogwarts).

  The world is bleak and the author holds few punches. Naturally, as it is with fics that center around any particular character, Hermione is too smart, and the past a bit too conveniently explicated to her advantage - though, in the later chapters Harry does begin to counter that narrative.
