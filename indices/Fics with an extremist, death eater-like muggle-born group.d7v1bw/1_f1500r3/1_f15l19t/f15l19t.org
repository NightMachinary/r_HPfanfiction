I dislike it when authors do that to Hermione in fanfiction.

There's been multiple times in the books where her character was wrong, but they point to the event as if she was perfect/the victim.

Honestly, it reminds me a bit of Snape.

Edit: I was talking about explicating the past to her advantage, and that it reminds me of Snape fics where everything is shown to be the Marauder's/Lily's fault. I didn't get a chance to finish the thought. Not the whole badass dark lady Hermione part (even if it's not always my cup of tea).
