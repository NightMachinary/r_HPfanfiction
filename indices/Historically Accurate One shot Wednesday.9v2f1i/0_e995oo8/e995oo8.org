The danger of writing within a historical context is that it is very easy to offend people. Take the magical Spartans as an example. By turning the Battle at the Hot Gates into a feat of magic, you basically imply that it was magic which held the Persians at bay, not bravery, skill at arms and clever usage of terrain. And the closer you get to the present, the worse it gets because people are still invested in these events.

If Grindelwald was Hitler's puppeteer, you are basically writing "The Nazis were not evil, it was all a wizard". If you write about magic in the Battle of Britain, you are taking away the achievements of the 303rd and 310th. If the Six Days war was a feat of Israeli/Jewish Wizards, oh boy be ready for the backlash of the "free Palestine /activists/". Perhaps the only safe conflict would be the Falklands War.
