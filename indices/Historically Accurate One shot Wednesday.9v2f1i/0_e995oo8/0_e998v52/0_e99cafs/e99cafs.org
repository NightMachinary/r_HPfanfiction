Magic gets "worse" the further you advance in technology. Fiendfyre in the Middle Ages? You summoned Satan. Fiendfyre in the 70s? Probably some Vietnam footage where they dropped too much napalm. Killing curse in 900 AD? You are a god? Killing curse in 2273? Looks like a Klingon Weapon.

Therefore I'd draw the line somewhere between 1500 and 1600, after that magic does not add so much bang and awe. You could make an unsinkable Bismarck or ship of the line, but it would be far less impressive than tearing down the Theodosian Walls with sentient fire. The one exception are large-scale field battles (think Waterloo) where magic could seriously fuck stuff up and kill thousands within seconds because the formations are packed so tightly.
