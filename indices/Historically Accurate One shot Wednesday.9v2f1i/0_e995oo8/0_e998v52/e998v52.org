Actually thank you for this. I don't want to imply that every victory was a magical feat. I merely want some discussion about how the magical society of these ancient civilizations would have functioned and how they would have interacted with each other and their non magical counterparts. Don't tell me you don't want see a one shot about an epic magical sea ship battle set in the golden age of pirates. I was especially interested in whether or not the magical pilgrims would have viewed America's magical natives the same way their non magical counterparts did or would they have seen them as equals.
