I'll add another thing to this. We see the statute from purely western european perspective in both HP and the fantastic beast movies. How did sun saharan Africa, the Americas, east asia react to European wizards trying to enforce the Statute.

What happened during the war with Grindelwald. If the Euripean mages where tied up in that would those societies try to return to a pre statute existence? Was there a follow up magical war or suppression in the aftermath of Grindelwald? Did they ally with him/get support from him given we are told one of his goals was to overthrow the statute?
