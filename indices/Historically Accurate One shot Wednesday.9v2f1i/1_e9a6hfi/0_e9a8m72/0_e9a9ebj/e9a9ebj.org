When the Statute came into effect, Christianity had already risen and was at its peak in all of Europe, and many other regions on earth. Around 1200, all regions of Europe had been majorily brought under the religious doctrine of Christianity.

The wiki states that in the 15th century, relation deteriorated, meaning that it wasn't Christianity per se, but the more fanatical side of it, embodied by the Inquisition that disenfranchised magic folk from muggle folk. You could say that once european Christianity no longer needed to be inclusive to pagan beliefs, but only had to deal with theological disputes among Christians, they could try and enforce a more strict dogma, including the belief that magic was of the devil (or rather, the magic they didn't like). It also states that magical people had to hide from muggle witch-hunters, which tells us that the Statute may have just been a legislative solidification of a matter of fact.

From all we see in HP, its safe to assume that there are wizards and witches that count themselves to the Christian faith. If so, you could probably separate them again by muggle-Christianity (catholics, protestants, anglicans coming from muggleborns) and wizard-Christianity which had a good chance of developing, especially after the split of the societies by the Statute.

I personally had religion as a defining trait in a political fic I wrote for a while. In it, Dumbledore's Party "The Phoenix" was a conservative christian party, while the "House of Black" was a religiously egalitarian party. You'd also have the "Students of Loki" who are a Norse pantheon conservative party, and the Naturalists who have a progressive view based on the celtic and norse pantheon.
