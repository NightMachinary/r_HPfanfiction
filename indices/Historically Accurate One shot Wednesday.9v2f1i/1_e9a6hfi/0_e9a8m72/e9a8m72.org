If I have read around correctly the statue of secrecy was implied that it mainly came into existence after the rise of Christianity which taught that magic and those who wield it were automatically evil and harmful while in most pre-Christian civilizations shamans, priest/priestess, prophetess ect. were respected and revered figures in their society's which I think implies that the line that separated the magical and non-magical world was either very thin or non-existent several thousand years ago.
