One question that needs answering before writing a historical event in the HP universe is how the Statute of Secrecy affected the world's societies. Was the Statute merely a text bringing to law an already existing fact? In other words, were magical societies already separate from muggle society and the Statute only solidified this?

Or was the Statute a huge cover-up operation? If so, then were wizards and witches a part of society until then? And how much of human history did the Statute switch delete or change for the muggles?

Both hold some implication for how to write a historical HP fic. The first means only that wizards and witches have only ever worked from the shadows or as the "guy behind the king". But that doesn't really make for a great story about their deeds on the battlefields of men. The other scenario implies that they must have been an integral part of any consideration back then, which requires you to deliver some massive bits of worldbuilding as an author.

I personally am a fan of the second option, and when I write historical stuff, I think in those terms.

That brought me to a few interesting bits. For example, I took the story of Jean d'Arc burning on the stake for being a witch and turned it into a story of a witch who turned her back to the muggles after she got screwed over by the Church.

Or when we go back into the era of the Danelaw in England, where some of the most famous families in the HP universe found their beginning. There I delved into old magic, its requirements and effects. I separated magical traditions (including the explanation why its called "Hogwarts School of /Witchcraft/ *and* /Wizardry/"). And it brought me to another point that I find interesting for historical fics: I always assume that Magic is, similar to science and technology, being researched constantly. There have been setbacks by having some knowledge bases destroyed, but in general Magic progressed from complicated rituals around fires, with hours or even days required to cast even the simplest spell (in my example, raindances), to a well researched and founded Art that we see in the canon books. Or in other words: Wizards and Witches have never been as dangerous and powerful as they are in the present day.

Some examples:

Harry is in a hospital in Bagdad, carried there by the father of Alrun, who's body Harry took over.

  The next days, Harry spent drinking and digesting the most horrid potions he had ever tasted. If he had thought Madam Pomfrey had some gruesome tasting stuff in her cupboards, he had not tasted early medieval magical potions. Those things tasted like scooped up feces and were delivered in way larger quantities than modern potions for the same or even weaker effects.

Later he is taught a spell by his new grandfather, Hagmund.

  “Point it at the hearth, at one of the unburnt logs and say ‘Skeutanan Haithjö od Logi'” Hagmund said.

  Harry looked for a good log on the side of the hearth and aimed his finger at it. He felt stupid without a wand, but if anything, six years at Hogwarts had taught him to just roll with it when it came to magic. “Skeutanan Haithjö od Logi” Harry said and he felt how something formed in his arms, deep within the bone and then, with one sudden shot, magic pressed out from the skin that was covered in the liquid and shot at the logs in the form of a small tongue of flame.

  ...

  Harry, frankly, wasn't impressed at all. The flame had barely heated the air around them and without any cinder it didn't even set the logs aflame. It was nothing like an Incendio spell and with an incantation that threatened to knot his tongue
