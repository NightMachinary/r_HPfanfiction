  “Awfully genuine, and probably the least Slytherin person in Slytherin I know, all years included. She isn't particularly dramatic, which --” Daphne frowned -- “I'm pretty certain the Sorting Hat puts students in Slytherin based on their dramatic potential.”

  Iris thought of Draco Malfoy, Daphne Greengrass, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, Salazar Slytherin himself putting a basilisk into his own stone head...
