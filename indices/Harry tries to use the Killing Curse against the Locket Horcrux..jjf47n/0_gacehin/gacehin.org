I'm not sure there are many directions to take this prompt in.

On one hand, in a canon-compliant magic system, this doesn't work:

"The killing curse, not a soul killer, does not remove someone's soul. One, it does not replicate the effect of the dementor's kiss. Two, Fawkes dies because of the curse. He survives because pheonixes can be reborn from death. Fawkes retains his soul afterwards. Three, the concept of death differs greatly from a "soul killer".

Indeed, horcruxes are notable because of the last reason:

  *‘But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,' said Ron, ‘why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?' ‘Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.'* Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, *‘Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.'* ‘Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,' said Ron. Harry laughed. ‘It should be, actually! *But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,' said Hermione. ‘But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.'* ‘That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,' said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort's soul as it vanished. ‘And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but, obviously, it came back good as new.

It's the destruction of the vessel that destroys a horcrux. The creation of a horcrux demands the destruction of the vessel and soul to prevent its functionality. The killing curse may kill someone, but it leaves their soul intact." (From previous comment of mine.)

On the other hand, if the killing curse did work, assuming a different magical system, I'm not convinced much would change. Sure, the locket would no longer be a horcrux. They wouldn't need to get the sword or worry about it being taken. They wouldn't go to Gringotts. But ultimately, they'd fall into a stalemate. They wouldn't be able to figure out where Voldemort's last horcruxes are, without Voldemort finding out about his missing horcruxes. And that forces the same race to Hogwarts. The stalemate would probably be compounded by Harry focusing on the Hallows even more.
