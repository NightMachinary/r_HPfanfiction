Isn't killing curse canonical way to get rid of a Horkrux? Not totally sure but I think it was mentioned somewhere and obviously it sukcessfully de-Horkruxed Harry himself.

On the other hand so is basilisk venom and yet Horkrux survived that one so some leeway is there... If Harry just tripped headfirst into basilisk maw to provide more info and further this theory.
