I can see a way to play with this.

Maybe each time Harry builds up and casts with the needed hate the soul fragment in his scar is empowered, or he takes on it's hate. So each time he destroys one of the other horcruxs with AK he himself becomes more like Voldemort - more hateful, less forgiving, less caring, more likely to cast to maim and kill rather than just stun or disarm.

In the end, no more Voldemort (except maybe Harry's scar?) but a new Dark Lord who is just as evil but maybe worse overall since he is still sane with an intact soul?
