While looking through it myself, I figured Id ask about a few of the posts I was curious about.

The first is [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=161007]]

"Help harry potter time travel fic/AU Ok so a while ago I know I read this fic but I cannot for the life of me find or remember the title. I think it was an FF.net but I can't be too sure, basically I think it was a time travel fic similar to midnight blues' the mirror of maybe where harry goes back in time to teach defence during his own years at Hogwarts. I remember Snape also being a teacher and that Harry freaked him out by using parsel-tongue to talk with his snake. i remember that they decide to give Snape some of the snakes' venom as an apology ad that the process take a while. I think the snake was the opposite of an ashwinder but again not really sure..."

Ironically, I think I recently read a fanfic just like this. I cant remember what it was called, but I am pretty sure it was Snarry, and that Harry dated him before he went to the past. Whether it was the same or not, I don't know, but thought I'd post it here in case others know about it and can remember what it was called.
