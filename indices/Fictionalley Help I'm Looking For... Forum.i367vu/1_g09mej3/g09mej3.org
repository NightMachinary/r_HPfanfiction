" Harry travels back in time to his parents Hogwarts time. Death Eaters kidnap the Marauders and Lily. Harry has a vision showing where they are and goes and rescues them alone. When they are in the hospital the Marauders chat and Harry overhears them. They speculate that he might be on the dark side. He runs off and hides in the room of requirement which changes into a cupboard under the stairs. "

I also remember reading something similar. I didn't think Lily + Marauder were in school, but otherwise sounds familar. I don't know what it was called but the one I remember I recall Harry doing some dark magic to help during/after Death eater attack. I think there was a whole confrontation within the Chambers of Secret between Harry and the "light side" (professors, maruaders, Lily) about his dubious means; I think some did accept him though.
