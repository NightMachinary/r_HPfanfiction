" ï¿¼ Unicorns and Harry. I read a story, in which Harry is abused by the Dursleys. I remember one of the chapters, in which Hagrid was away, and professor Grubbly Plank was taking over CoMC. She had some unicorns to teach about, and one of the unicorns went over to Harry and gave him its horn. After this, Harry was sent over to the Headmaster, because he was accused by the teacher, or his classmates, of using magic to make the unicorn go over to him. Dumbledore asked to touch the horn, which ended up on him being hurt. After this, Dumbledore became kind of sad, at not being pure enough to touch the horn. However, Harry could touch it and not become hurt by it, meaning he was really pure.

I'm not sure but I think it was a Severitus or Sevitus story. "

I never read this, but I was and still am curious if others know what it was.
