Just asking, how much realistic rocket science is there going to be in that fic? Magic should at least make a torch drive type of spaceship possible (constant 1g acceleration), which makes a lot of rocketry obsolete, although I'm wondering if spacetime manipulation demonstrated by bigger-on-the-inside things could enable Alcubierre style FTL.
