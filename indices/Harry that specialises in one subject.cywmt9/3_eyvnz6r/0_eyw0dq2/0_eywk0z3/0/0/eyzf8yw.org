"Why do they need a satellite?"

They didn't. It was simply to practice space-flight, which would have been explained in a later chapter.

"Where did they get the detailed schematic of the shuttle?"

Assuming brooms are relatively quick, Harry could have flew to a nearby muggle town and downloaded one from the internet. In Chapter 2 I decided that the cheap school brooms would be as fast as a turn of the century motor vehicle - around 80km/h - for no particular reason, other than to have them be fast, but not too fast.

"How can a single seventh year and three firsties create a massive shuttle and launch site from scratch in what feels like no time at all?"

Conjuration.

"How the hell does it work on the first try? They just strapped themselves to a huge tower of hastily transfigured explosives, how did they not get blown up?"

Luck. I even included a joke about the Challenger tragedy in Chapter 3:

'Also, the space shuttle taking off also looked much like a firework. However, unlike a firework, the space shuttle kept on going up and up, and unlike a space shuttle, the space shuttle did not ever explode.'

"Why would they even need a shuttle with chemical propulsion if Harry just explained that magic makes infinite energy possible and therefore chemical engines unnecessary?"

Why figure out how to translate magical energy into kinetic energy when conjuring a hydrogen solid-fuel booster is so much simpler, and is effectively exactly the same thing? Harry requires a machine that can launch a satellite into geo-stationary orbit so he is practiced incase he ever wants to launch other things into geo-stationary orbit, such as, say, a "Rod of God" over London with which to threaten government officials with?

"Instead of actually explaining how and why and exploring the basics of rocket science, they just magically copy what muggles would do without taking into account how magic rewrites the fundamental principles. All of rocket science is based on the rocket equation, and magic changes the equation to the point that the entire field needs to be re-developed from scratch."

I don't see why this would be the case. It was a muggle rocket propelled by muggle rocket fuel.

"If I was writing a rocket science Harry fic, which I'm planning to do, I wouldn't start with a full shuttle launch."

The version of Harry I have written is irrational, and behaves incredibly irrationally. He has been affected significantly by the moonrock from Chapter 1. More importantly, however, is that building interest early on in a story is how you catch someone's attention and keep them enthralled in it. I promise you the pace will slow down afterwards, and tease out the rest of the plot over 10,000's of words.

"So a magical spaceship could be a minivan with all the enchantments on the Weasley car, plus the entire rocket assembly in the back area and additional enchantments to seal the crew area vacuum tight. Then add a magical map that displays the planets around the ship and all distances and velocities. The map would probably be the part that'd take the most time apart from the rocket assembly itself, perhaps a year or so to create the enchantments and logic capable of computing orbits. Slightly less time if Moony helps since he's got experience with magic maps."

Sure, you can fly to space in a minivan. But then you would have flied to space in a minivan, when you could have done it in a rocket. That seems like a poor decision to make, aesthetically. Rockets look really cool.
