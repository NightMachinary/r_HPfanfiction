I started reading now but I can't really continue because there's so much that I feel doesn't really make sense or isn't explained.

Harry just started the rocket club at Hogwarts, immediately pulls out a schematic for a shuttle, and they fly to space and deploy a satellite.

Why?

Why do they need a satellite?

Where did they get the detailed schematic of the shuttle?

How can a single seventh year and three firsties create a massive shuttle and launch site from scratch in what feels like no time at all?

How the hell does it work on the first try? They just strapped themselves to a huge tower of hastily transfigured explosives, how did they not get blown up?

Why would they even need a shuttle with chemical propulsion if Harry just explained that magic makes infinite energy possible and therefore chemical engines unnecessary?

Instead of actually explaining how and why and exploring the basics of rocket science, they just magically copy what muggles would do without taking into account how magic rewrites the fundamental principles. All of rocket science is based on the rocket equation, and magic changes the equation to the point that the entire field needs to be re-developed from scratch.

If I was writing a rocket science Harry fic, which I'm planning to do, I wouldn't start with a full shuttle launch.

Instead, I'd start with a small transfigured test stand and a prototype rocket engine running on magic, either on a potion that works like rocket fuel but much better, or perhaps water heated with a magic fire to produce superheated H2O, just like the result of liquid hydrogen and oxygen combustion or water routed around a nuclear reactor, but much simpler.

A prototype engine that runs on magic could be vastly more fuel efficient than a chemical engine. More fuel efficiency means higher specific impulse which means exponentially less fuel required. Instead of a massive tower of fuel, a magically powered spaceship could use just a few cauldrons of heating potion.

If a rocket engine can run on magic fire (like what Hermione used to heat her polyjuice cauldron in the bathroom) and water, which can be created with a simple /Aguamenti/, then it's possible to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to bugger off and more or less explore the solar system without having to worry about fuel.

Of course, in my story nobody would go to space immediately. After testing a small scale rocket, there'd be tests of small sounding rockets to a few kilometers altitude, perhaps a small rocket strapped to a broom to break the Firebolt's speed record and to demonstrate what the new field of magic rocketry can do, to gain awareness and funding. A really fast broom would certainly catch the attention of the two Gryffindor beaters, who happen to be highly skilled tinkerers and enchanters.

The first wizard to space flight would probably be a suborbital hop on a rocket broom with modified and upgraded stability and control charms, with enchanted clothing and a bubble head charm to protect against vacuum, as the last of a series of increasingly higher altitude test flights.

Once it's proven that magic rockets can work reliably, that the control and stability enchantments work outside of the atmosphere, that it's possible to enchant something to isolate against the vacuum of space, and that all magic works in space just as well as on earth, then a true spaceship can be built.

Without the need to worry about Δv, a magical spaceship can use a completely different flight profile than a typical shuttle, which makes any kind of heat shielding or aerodynamics completely unnecessary.

Instead, the main requirements would be:

-To perform takeoff, atmospheric flight and landing through conventional magical flight without rockets to remove the need for ground infrastructure like runways or launch pads.

-To be invisible to muggles, including radar and cameras.

-Rockets capable of at least 1.5g of acceleration for long periods of time, resulting in very high Δv.

-Stability in vacuum and in atmospheric rocket-powered flight, to prevent the ship from tumbling around.

-Protection against vacuum.

-Navigation systems. You really need to know where you are, how fast you are going, in which direction, and where everything else is.

In canon HP, there's already a vehicle capable of points 1, 2 and 4, stable atmospheric flight and invisibility, sitting in Arthur Weasley's garage.

So a magical spaceship could be a minivan with all the enchantments on the Weasley car, plus the entire rocket assembly in the back area and additional enchantments to seal the crew area vacuum tight. Then add a magical map that displays the planets around the ship and all distances and velocities. The map would probably be the part that'd take the most time apart from the rocket assembly itself, perhaps a year or so to create the enchantments and logic capable of computing orbits. Slightly less time if Moony helps since he's got experience with magic maps.

To fly to space, just take off like a normal flying car, turn on the invisibility, push the button that opens the back door, turn on the engines to a soft 1.5g and slowly pull the nose up to about 30° above the horizon, then wait until you're out of the atmosphere and continue to hold prograde until the orbit is stable, then cut off the engines and enjoy microgravity.

Getting back to earth would just be a manner of turning retrograde and burning until the sideways velocity is almost wiped out, slowly descend by flying backwards and braking with the engines, until you're low and slow enough for traditional magical flight to work properly again, then just fly back home like a normal flying car.

After a successful orbital flight it'd still take some time to perfect the space suits, add an airlock, and add enchantments to protect against radiation before a moon landing could be attempted.
