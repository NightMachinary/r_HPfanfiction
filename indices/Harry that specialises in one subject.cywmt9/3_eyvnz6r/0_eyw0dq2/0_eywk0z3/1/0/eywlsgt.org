"Nuclear fission does not produce more energy than nuclear fusion. In nuclear fusion (6.4 MeV) per nucleon is given out which is much greater than the energy given out per nucleon (1 MeV) during a nuclear fission reaction."

Nuclear Fission produces 6.4 million electron volts per nucleon, which I assume is quite a lot. Fire and water (which you would not be able to turn into solid hydrogen/helium fuel - only oxygen) would probably struggle to match the quantity of acceleration such a reaction could provide.

Magic is going to play as significant a part as the rocket "science" will play, as Voldemort is still around and will have to be able to keep up with the heros to be a threat. I could have Voldemort be threatening solely through mundane means, such as hostage taking, but magic should spice him up and make the threat he poses a little more significant.

Also the fic's only 6,000 words right now. I'm writing just over 1,000 not very great words a day, though, so that'll change eventually.
