"Just asking, how much realistic rocket science is there going to be in that fic?"

All rockets featured in the fic will be based off of contemporary or near future designs based off of existing technology.

I could include a fission "torch drive" rocket, but I would have no explanation as to how Harry knew how to design a fission reactor which can create a stable reaction that produces more energy than it consumes, as currently no such designs exist, although the aforementioned unstable fission reactors do exist in labs in Germany and elsewhere in the world. I would not be able to explain how Harry knows a spell that can cause nuclear-fission, either, although maybe a studious villain can discover a lost spell invented by Merlin that can do such a thing.

These rockets would be fueled by deuterium and other hydrogen ions, and could reach up to 12% light speed.

I would consider introducing a time-travelling villain, but if they were a time-traveller they wouldn't have any need for fast rockets, so I think if I do include such machines in my fic, they'll be invented by a genius.

Nano-craft powered by lasers is another interesting concept which would only use contemporary technology. Such space craft could be accelerated to 20% the speed of light and can be constructed and powered with extant technology, however, being only a few atoms thick, would be incapable of aiding in manned space flights.

As for warp-drives, I'm not knowledgeable enough to come close to understanding any form of complex physics, but I think if I do ever include such things, I should save the most exiting concepts for last.
