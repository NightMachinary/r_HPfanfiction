It depends on the narrator's POV. This small story has an omniscient narrator, so they have the ability to get inside Molly's head and make this claim. An unreliable narrator wouldn't be able to, or could even lie to you. Some do that.

Since the books is told from Harry's POV mainly, there's things he just plain misses, or may get wrong.
