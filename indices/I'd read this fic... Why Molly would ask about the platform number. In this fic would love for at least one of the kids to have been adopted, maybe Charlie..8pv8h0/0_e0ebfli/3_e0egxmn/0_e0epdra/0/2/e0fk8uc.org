Why would Harry indicate such? He is a child himself. He wouldn't know. It is left to the reader to understand the scene. A reader at that age would be familiar with such behaviour from their own life, even if they do not understand the reason behind it. An adult reader would have the understanding to know what's going on. It is only the teenage readers, their memories of similar events faded already but not yet able to grasp what is involved in raising a child, who will miss the forest for the trees.
