You're supposed to read between the lines. There's probably a ton of stuff like that throughout the series. This particular one was dead obvious to me when I was a teenager reading it for the first time. Maybe because I had a much younger brother and people were doing that with him all the time.

I mean for future reference the next time someone asks their kid what the dog says or what color fire engines are, it's not because they've forgotten. They're trying to keep their kids involved and learning so they don't scream in the middle of target and grow up to be morons.
