Everyone forgets that the actual books are books. JKR wrote them and then a publisher ripped them to pieces before they actually went into print.

Fanfiction is a totally different world, we can write whatever the hell we want to and make it as long or as short as we want with zero consequences. An actual published author does not have that priviledge. The first drafts of PS were twice as long as the published versions, and a publisher told her that they would never print a childrens book if it was over 50k words. JKR essentially created the young adult genre of fiction where books can be adult novel length and still appeal to younger audiences. It wasnt until GoF that she was actually given free reign to write the books how she wanted, and even then her editors most likely tore the drafts apart until they reached a final manuscript.

I say all of that because when people bash canon in comparison to fanfiction they usually forget the limitations placed on the original author. They aren't writing in the same conditions that fanfiction authors are writing in.
