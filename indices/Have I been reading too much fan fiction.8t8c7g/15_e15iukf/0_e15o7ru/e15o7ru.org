  amatuer writer

By which metric? She is certainly not unpaid (which would be the usual definition), quite the opposite in fact. She also has approperiate education: A Bachelor of Arts in Classics from Exeter, so she is certainly quite knowledgable about literature.

Her worldbuilding is sometimes slightly inconsitent, but even the best-paid pros at Disney (seemlingly) fuck /that/ up.

However, her characters are usually great, have motivations, the world is lovely, the stories are easy to understand yet have depth, she juggles multiple themes perfectly, and - most importantly - her works are very enjoyable.

Like you can critique her all you want, her books are far from perfect.

But calling her an amateur? That is completely and utterly moronic.
