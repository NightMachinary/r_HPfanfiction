Considering it was her first novel, i think noun1 ,noun3 and or adj 1/ adj 3 can be correctly used. No one is saying she's inept NOW,, but what else would you use to describe a new author ? Keep in mind that she worked as a researcher/secretary before that...its not like she studied to be a writer in school or something.

Anyway, as i feel any further comment is unnecessary, regardless if you reply to this i will not, as i do not like being attacked for no reason. I only wanted to explain that what the original poster meant and how you interpreted was different.
