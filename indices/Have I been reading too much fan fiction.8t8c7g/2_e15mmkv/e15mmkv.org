I love reading fan fiction for HP. The initial world was so wonderful, regardless of flaws, that so many people have been able to express themselves creatively in it.

I'm always tickled and excited when writers bring things up that make me go... Oh yeah! I remember coming across one where Hermione asked Remus if he was renamed after he was bitten. And while reading the books I was so pro-Gryffindor that I cheered like Rowling wanted me to when Dumbledore gave all those points out at the end of year feast and Gryffindor ended up winning. But it didn't occur to me, until many fan fiction authors mentioned it, how cruel and unfair that was to Slytherin students.
