That actually really only explains Gryffindor not being in the lead. Yes he took points off Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff but not as much as Gryffindor, nor do I recall him giving his students an over-abundance of points. Especially seeing as how McGonogalltook 50-60 points off Slytherin in one night because of Malfoy and yet they still made it to the top, it seems to me that they more than likely worked for it. Perhaps had he not taken points of Gryffindor for stupid reasons they'd be somewhat even, but even then let's not forget it was McGonogall who took 150 point from Gryffindor in one night, so actually it was their own damn fault that gryffindor was in last place.
