And still the most damage from the house points did not come from Snape, but McGonogall for their own actions, which means as much as we "See" snape taking points which is all of what 1-2 potions classes in PS? it doesn't seem to matter.

Slytherin had: 472 Gryffindor: 312 Ravenclaw:426 Hufflepuff: 352

Now let's see Harry and company lost 150 points by themselves. So if they hadn't that'd be 462. Combined with the points they lost from other teachers excluding Snape comes out to be 467. IF you added the points Snape took back into the equation it brings it up to 479. A mere +12 points that we know were taken for sure. But those -12 points Snape took were less than the -20 points taken from Draco by McGonogall and therefore cross it out. Furthermore, if Snape were taking so very many points from other houses all the time, then I hardly doubt they'd all be so close. Even with Snape taking points unfairly, they had 6 other classes in First year alone, and 8 other classes Third Year and Up to gain more points with different professors. You have 10 other professors against one. It was more than likely that they also got points taken from other professor's. Which they easily could have avoided those and won now couldn't they?

Snape is unfair, and shouldn't have taken points without having a legit reason for doing so. But even with him doing so, Gryffindor still could have won the legit way. Had they even attempted to do so. They could have followed the rules so McGonogall didn't have to take all those points. They all (All Gryffindors 1-7 years) could have actually studied and done as much as they could to gain points, especially Harry and Ron who after all lost the house a good 100 points on their own and 50 more that Hermione did. But God forbid Ron and Harry don't copy Hermione's notes and homework and actually do their own work, and studying, so they may know the answers and may know how to gain said points back. But alas.

Snape is unfair, well so is life. People can sit back and whine about that and blame the world for being so unfair, or they can just go find a way of making it better regardless. And given that Gryffindor could in fact win regardless of Snape's influence I blame Gryffindor themselves.
