The word you are looking for is plot holes, inconsistency and loose structure of story with no clear picture. It was intended for an audience that claps when hero saves the day instead of audience that might look into a story and say, 'wait! What?' And that's what gives fanfiction so much leeway. There is so much information that can be used to fill the gaps and every inserted clog seem to fit the greater system and make it work.

Look at all the other great fiction. There is so less people need to fill that fanfic authors have hard time with 'I think xys could be the reason for abc...'
