Literally the only decent Slytherin in canon is Andromeda Tonks, the odd misfit who got booted out of a "Slytherin family" for being who she was. Canon Slytherin is a shithole. With the exception of Pettigrew, pretty much every bad person in the series was a Slytherin, pretty much every Death Eater came from there.
