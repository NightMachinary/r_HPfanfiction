When you do something wrong, is your first thought to go and say something to the authorities? To make yourself look bad, maybe even be sent to Azkaban? Probably not.

Besides which, I think you are forgetting that it was not common knowledge that Voldemort didn't die in Godric's Hollow. Hagrid and Dumbledore are pretty much the only ones who indicate otherwise until he shows up himself to Harry in the forest (or in Quirrel form apparently). And Hagrid pretty much takes what Dumbledore says as sacrosanct. It is entirely within belief for almost everyone else in their world that Voldemort really was dead; after all, no one understood why he was gone in the first place. People tend not to ask too many questions when "miracles" happen, because they are too afraid what they might find.

Also, the way you say "responsible for the second war" is terribly misleading. You could say the same thing about Harry: sparing Pettigrew lead directly to the second war. You can say the same about Dumbledore: not stopping Voldemort when he was younger lead directly to /both/ wars. Should we blame them, and any number of others in canon who are "responsible fo the second war" because of their actions.

I think you missed the point of Snape, Regulus, and Slughorn in the story though. All of them were conceited, or ambitious, or spiteful, or jealous and so on. And yet, when the time came, they found that there were things that were *more important* than blood purity or identity or jealousy or greed. With Regulus, he knew it was a horcrux. He knew what that meant, that Voldemort had split his own soul through murder. It emphasized how little he cared for anybody, not just the house elf. If he needed further proof, the army of inferi in the lake further established this fact to him.
