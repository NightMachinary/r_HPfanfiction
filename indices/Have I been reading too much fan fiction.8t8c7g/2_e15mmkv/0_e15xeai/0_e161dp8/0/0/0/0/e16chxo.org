Or...he turned because Voldemort, despite his begging and the incredible benefit of the information Snape provided, still killed Lily anyway. It points out Voldemort doesn't care about anybody, even when it would require practically no effort. Thats the whole point of Voldemort's character: he loses every time against Harry because he cannot understand the importance of love.

Snape is an asshole. He is petty, vindictive, and someone I would never want to know, even his movie version. But the point of his story is that love was more important than anything else to him. He willingly rejected his other long held beliefs because of it.

Still doesn't make him good (despite what Harry may have claimed afterwards), its just more of Rowling's hammering the whole "love conquers all" theme.
