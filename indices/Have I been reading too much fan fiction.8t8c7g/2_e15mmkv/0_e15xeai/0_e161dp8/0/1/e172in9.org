I'm not so sure. By the time Slughorn realized that the information about horcruxes was definitely important, several of them would have been all but out of reach--the cup in the bank vault, even the diadem in the RoR, especially since Dumbledore didn't even know /what/ it was, and Harry only found out by reading Voldemort's mind. Fics often find easy solutions to these problems, but as described in canon, it's entirely possible Dumbledore's trail would go cold before Voldemort returned.
