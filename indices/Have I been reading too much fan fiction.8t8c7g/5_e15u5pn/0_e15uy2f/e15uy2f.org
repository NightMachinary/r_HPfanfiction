Most of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/][Starfox5's]] fics, with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]] being the best examples. How Dumbledore dealt with Umbridge and Death Eaters during the DoM battle in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]] is very impressive, linkffn(11773877;11080542;11102515).

Dumbledore was very happy that Harry found a new home with the Grangers in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146). He quickly arranged to have Granger home protected by the best ward and brought Tonkses in touch with them.

From the same author, Dumbledore took the Basilisk very seriously in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), and the canon plot was easily shot afterwards.
