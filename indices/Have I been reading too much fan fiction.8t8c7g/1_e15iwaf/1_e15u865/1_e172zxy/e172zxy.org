- Entry-level in the meta-narrative. Hermione didn't seem to be reading out of /Fantastic Beasts./ Plus, in-story /Fantastic Beasts/ is not the same and is also not necessarily complete, especially since Slytherin could have created a one-off hybrid. Most importantly, none of the sources mentioned petrification--only death. Seeing that, you're probably going to skip over that entry the first few times...I do admit it strains credulity, though.
- I thought it was implied that Tom learned his lesson last time and was actively avoiding killing people to keep the school from being closed.
- It would have helped. It would have taken some more detective work on Dumbledore's part, but yeah, he probably could have solved it. The bigger question is why did they let Hagrid keep working at Hogwarts when he was expelled for suspected murder?
- Definitely this. The plot could have been done in half a year. No attacks from December to May? No Quidditch matches from November to May? Yeah, JKR isn't great with time.
- Already wrote that one.
- Not even that far. If he figured it out, it would be a simple fix to blast the Chamber open and take a rooster down there.
