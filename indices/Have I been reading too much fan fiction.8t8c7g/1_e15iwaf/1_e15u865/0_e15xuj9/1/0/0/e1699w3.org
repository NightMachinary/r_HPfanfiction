It's no more ridiculous than the 'curse' on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position.

Otherwise, it's improbable for there to have not been more fatalities from students falling off of moving staircases, exploding cauldrons and other potion mishaps, spelling mistakes, and the whole Quidditch thing.

Or maybe it's happening in the background and just never gets brought up. Perhaps that's what happened to Sally-Anne Perks.

The alternative is the thing some stories have where wizards have stronger and more resilient bodies. Because magic. No thanks.
