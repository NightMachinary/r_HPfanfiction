Canon CoS plot is awful:

- A 13 years solved the plot in an entry level creature book whereas the entire staff was basically useless. It's really a worst manifestation of the “useless adults” trope in children's literature.
- Petrifications in Basilisk attacks are actually the exception. You need tons and tons of luck to have 6 petrifications instead of someone getting killed.
- Dumbledore knew Hagrid was innocent, and he should know where Myrtle was. Why didn't he ask her a few questions during the 50 years in between? The CoS plot would be instantly solved if Myrtle just answered how she died. I personally think it's another case of “useless adults” or “stupid characters” tropes.
- JKR had a habit of dragging the plot until the end of the school year. Fic writers are under no obligation to do that.
- Basilisks were extremely dangerous creatures. Just imagine how many would have died if that thing had gotten into the Great Hall during a Feast! Since Hogwarts was Magical Britain's ONLY school, the damage of that attack to its future could be worse compared to London hit by a megaton range nuke. If Dumbledore really cared about his students and was not a dumbed down plot device, he should identify Myrtle's killer as a Basilisk long time ago and take drastic steps immediately after the first attack.
- Basilisks had one huge Achilles heels: roosters. I expect Dumbledore to seed the entire Castle with roosters after the first attack, if he figured out the truth of Myrtle's death.

I greatly appreciate authors who develop their own COS plot. Unfortunately, still too many rehash it, even some of the best ones.
