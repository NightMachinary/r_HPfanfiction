I am no Dumbledore fan, but cut the old man some slack. Nobody could have figured out Voldy's secret about horcruxes like Dumbledore did. Considering how universally hated Severus was, nobody else would have bothered to utilize his talents and make him a spy. Sure, in the end, Harry and his friends did all the heavy-lifting and killed the baddies, but it was all made possible because of Dumbledore's tactics and guidance. Without him, the order was destined to fight a losing battle, let's be honest.

Also, I always like to think Dumbledore retained some of those 'For the Greater Good' philosophies from his cavorting days with Grindelwald. Because it explains why he was always a bit callous towards emotions, pain and suffering at the individual level, and was willing to manipulate people in the worst possible ways in order to achieve the greater goals.

I was just thinking this yesterday. A brilliant Severus-Lily fanfic that I had thought was abandoned, ended up being completed last year, and by the time I finished with it yesterday, I finally realized that I could no longer go back to the books again. Sure, I might have taken a quick peek now and then, to relieve specific moments or check up on facts, but I could not read them again from start to finish because fan fiction had warped my mind - kinda turned me from Smeagol to Gollum. James Potter had already transformed, in the space of one book, from being one of the coolest dads ever and an all-round awesome guy to someone who brought back my worst memories of being bullied in school. But when I realized that the books expected us to forget this revelation about James and go back to remembering him with fond memories, I turned to fan fiction and over-indulged, so much so, that reading too much to reinforce what I felt about James in the end made me hate my favourite character from the whole series - Sirius!
