So first of all the orphan with comically despicable caretakers is a [[https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/orphans-in-fiction][Dickensian literature trope]] , see also: A Series of Unfortunate Events . Part of the trope is the kids always â€˜win' in the end.

And obviously a morally gray, ancient, eccentric , male, bearded wizard (who is a manipulative dick) also a page from classic lit.

A series of novel trials to get to a prize ..same deal.

Harry Potter is a lot like Star Wars: A New Hope. it is not a psychorealistic drama, it is a lot of epic coming of age and fantasy elements put together to tell a thrilling story. In Rowling's case with trademark whimsy and world building .

Fanfic - I love it for what it is, but yeah. if deconstruct the stories and remove the wit and charm they are pretty freaking sad.
