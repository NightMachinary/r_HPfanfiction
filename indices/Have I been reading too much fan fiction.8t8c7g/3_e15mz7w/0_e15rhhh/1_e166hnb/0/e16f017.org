You missed the point. The reason I doubt she intentionally used this trope was because there's a clear difference in tone and scope from book 1 to book 4. Dumbledore could be excused for assuming Harry's last relatives would treat him nicely. We are constantly shown that Dumbledore can be forgiving and assume the best in others. And then we are told exactly the opposite. JKR couldn't maintain that core contradiction in the series, that Dumbledore was wise and good, and yet didn't realize how awful Petunia and Vernon were (and after all, McGonagall told him in book 1 that Dudley was not a good influence). So we had to be told that literally there was no other choice because of course Dumbledore knew. Which forced a change in him being the paragon of good, and made a more complex view of him necessary.
