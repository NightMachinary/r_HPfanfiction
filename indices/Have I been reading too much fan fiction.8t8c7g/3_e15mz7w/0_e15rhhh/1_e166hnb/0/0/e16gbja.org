He left Harry there for magical protection / the Petunia connection. We learn this later , when Harry learns it, but obviously Dumbledore knew all along. It sounds like you think it wasn't fair we didn't learn earlier. But the book is largely from Harry's POV, yes? Have you read any other fantasy coming-of-age series? Being stunned by revelations that you are a pawn in a bigger story is not unusual .

One of the most famous thing about this specific series is that book 1 is written for a child audience, and it gets increasingly complex as it goes on. So many things that appear simple or relatively innocent in book 1 appear less so later on. People fall over in a slapstick way when talking about He Who Must Not Be Named... later, we learn about torture and terror and other things that aren't funny at all. That's not a contradiction. It's the whole design.
