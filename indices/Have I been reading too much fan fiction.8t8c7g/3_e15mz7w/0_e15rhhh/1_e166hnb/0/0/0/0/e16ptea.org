No, not really. The Dursleys were always terrible, and Dumbledore is not naive. But remember, Dumbledore is not the villain. Harry got screwed by Voldemort. Prophecy discovered by Voldy's minion. Parents murdered by Voldy. He's at risk from age 1 for the rest of his life, until he is old enough / powerful enough to fulfill the prophecy. So he is stuck in a nasty safehouse (Dursleys) until he is 11 years old. Then he goes to Hogwarts, where he is still at quite a bit of risk. Dumbledore's main fault, and open regret, is that he didn't foresee the risk of Tom Riddle and destroy him before he gained power. You definitely could argue that Dumbledore should have placed Harry with a loving wizarding family; that he didn't is a calculated move that--- in the end--- actually worked out pretty well. It was really hard on Harry, but any path would be hard on Harry, because: Voldemort.
