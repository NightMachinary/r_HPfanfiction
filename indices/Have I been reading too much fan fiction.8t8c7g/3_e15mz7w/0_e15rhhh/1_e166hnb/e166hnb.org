Of course there's a reason the child was left there.... there always is. That's not a reason to say she just randomly stumbled into a famous (and largely English) trope.

Gandalf knew what he asked of Frodo would lead to pain and suffering of the innocent Hobbit . He asked anyway, for the greater good, without really warning Frodo in any kind of detail what he would face..
