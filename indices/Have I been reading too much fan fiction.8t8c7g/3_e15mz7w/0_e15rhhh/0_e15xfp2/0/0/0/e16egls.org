I didn't say Dumbledore was to be seen as perfect, but as virtuous and wise. The issue is we see him directly put Harry in those circumstances. He even admits to knowing what would happen to him there. It's not even clear the bond of blood protections were better than other options such as the Fidelius. After all, he would later be attacked right up the road from Privet Drive and House elves could Apparate right into his room (imagine of Lucius had realized he could order Dobby to teleport Harry away from the warded home).

So it's far more complicated than "He goes there and lives otherwise he dies". JKR seems to have had the idea for the tried and true "hero comes from poor circumstances", but the way she constructed her world made things lose cohesion. Dumbledore is great in many ways, but never even checks in on Harry? That's just neglect.

Also, you have to be careful with JKR's history. As I recall, she said that someone had inflated her life story a bit. She was on government assistance for a few months. Definitely not fun, but it was, I suspect, not the entire inspiration for Harry and her story.
