To me Dumbledore never seemed to be intended as perfect or all knowing. Harry, at 11 years old, sees him as such because he's a child. Other adult characters see him as a leader and a role model because he is inteligent and a war hero (Grindelwald as well as Voldemort) and an educator. But every character in the HP verse, from the very beginning has always had more than one side to them. Ron is loyal and funny and righteus, but also jealous and callous and thoughtless. Hermione is smart and empathetic, but condecending and arrogant. Harry is good at puzzle solving, brave, passionate and overall a very good friend but he overlooks many things, can be thoughtless and is quick to anger. McGonagal is fair but strict. Malfoy is crule but witty. Almost everyone, from book one, has good and bad sides.

So to me Dumbledore developing more (and even Petunia and Dudley later on) doesn't feel any more "tagged on" than Snapes backstory. In fact it feels much less so. We don't see much of him in the fist few books. He's mostly just there for one or two scenes, not nearly enough to get to know him well as a character. The more we later learn about him the more rounded he gets.

I really appreciate the moral dilemma Dumbledore had to face in knowing he had to either set Harry up to be miserable with the Dursleys or set him up to die. Because that's what would have happened. He'd have lost his blood protection and been dead against Quirrel at the end of book one. I think it's unfair to afford every other character their flaws and not do it for Dumbledore just because he "should have found a better way". There wasn't one. That's it.

I think the fact that his plan worked it also something that many people forget. Harry was a horcrux and for all intends and purposes should not have survived the end of book 7. He did because of Dumbledore betting on the smallest hope that if the blood protection from Lily, that Harry and Voldemort shared, was maintained, it would mean the Voldemort would not be able to kill him.

I mean, you can criticise JK for writing the HP universe that way I guess, but I cannot stand this trend in fandom where people seem to blame Dumbledore for everything from Voldemort's rise to the Dursleys not caring for Harry as they should have. Other people made choices too which lead to these things. Petunia could have chosen not to blame an infant for being magical, but she did. Tom Riddle could have chosen not to go around killing people, but he did. I do not blame Dumbledore for his optimism and his will to give a second and third and a thousandth chance to literally everyone, up to and including the person literally in the process of trying to murder him. In fact, I admire him for it. Some of the time it worked out for him as we see with Hagrid and Snape and Remus, sometimes it didn't. The Dursleys are the best example.

A lot of these things are down to genre and theme in the HP novels. The idea that the underdogs will win, that love, loyalty, family and friendship are more powerful than physical or magical or political strength. The hero has to overcome adversity to reach happiness. I think it's important to remember that JK is also an abuse survivor, and at the time when she was writing the first book lived off of government aid as a single mother. The books are a reflection of her experience. (Which can be clearly seen in how she writes the ministry for one but that's another wall of text and this reply is too long already.)
