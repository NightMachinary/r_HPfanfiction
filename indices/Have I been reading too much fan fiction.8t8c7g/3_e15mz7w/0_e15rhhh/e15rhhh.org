My only issue with this is it's kinda obvious JKR didn't intend to do such a trope. Proof of this is the attempt to conjure a good explanation for Dumbledore putting Harry there. But OoTP ruins this by having Dumbledore saying he knew it would be "dark years" beforehand and he ends up just sounding silly ("I cared about you").
