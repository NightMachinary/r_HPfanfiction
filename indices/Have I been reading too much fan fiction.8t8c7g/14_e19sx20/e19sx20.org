I think the reason he is portrayed as an amazing character is the canon books are told from harry's perspective and thus harry's rose-tinted lenses. He is the subject of dumbledore's manipulations, young and innocent, and an abused child craving love. Even though he sees through some of dumbledores manipulations in DH in the same way a child coming of age sees the flaws in previously idolized parents/adults, the respect for dumbledore he grew up with does not go away that easily.
