  In the "Muggle" world the Dursley's would have been charged from everything from neglect, to straight up child abuse.

When you say “muggle world”, do you mean some utopian imaginary place in your mind or a setting based on our own reality? Because in reality UK has been notorious for both ignoring child abuse crises and even actively covering them up.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal][The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal]] has been described as the "biggest child protection scandal in UK history".[16] From the late 1980s until the 2010s, organised child sexual abuse continued almost unchallenged by legal authorities[17] in the northern English town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. ... The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up.

And those were cases were the child abuse was blatantly obvious, while in Harry's case they may have even just judged that his treatment is not bad enough to be deemed child abuse.

Finally, I'd like to mention that while there are many aspects to the Harry Potter universe that stem from Rowling's shortcomings as a writer, I think many of the things that often get critisied as too unrealistic are specifically intended that way, to point out the problems of society she grew in herself. Snape's abuse of his pupils, Umbridge's abuse of her authority with the students and larger population just meekly accepting it all, the ineptitude and corruption of the Government, the bigotry, the cowardice, etc.
