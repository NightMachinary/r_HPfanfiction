I always thought that Dumbledore's problem is being an extremely competent adult surrounded by average teens in a kid/YA novel where the teens are the ones supposed to save the day, so it's mostly fault of JK's writing. She had to make the trials for the stone easy or the Trio would never overcome them and doing this she made Dumbledore look like and idiot or even manipulative.
