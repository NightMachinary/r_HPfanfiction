That's not fact! Where did Dumbledore manipulate TMR? Sorry, but I don't see it! In fact I seem to remember Voldemort doing that because he a) wants to breach Harry's protection and b) because he sees Harry (because: Prophecy!) as his main enemy! Dumbledore's blood would probably have been ok, too but he can't best Dumbledore in his weakened state (hell: He never actually could best Dumbledore) and all other sources of blood of the enemy aren't as potent (Moody would work, Crouch after all had him under lock and key!), so he kind of had to go with Harry!

I agree that Dumbledore raised Harry as a sacrificial lamb! A person raised with higher self-esteem and self-value wouldn't easily lay down their life after all (especially for a world that alternates between worshipping the ground he walks on and villifying him for being "the heir of slytherin" or "a deranged murderer")! No, Dumbledore IMHO knew what he was doing (otherwise he would have never talked about condemning Harry to "...ten dark and difficult years..."), he wasn't enjoying it but that doesn't mean that what he did isn't WRONG on so many levels!

ps: Also: Why not capture Voldemort, let Harry live a long life and then kill Voldemort once Harry is dead?

ps: Shoot! I want your wall of text (even to only rip holes in your arguments - sorry, I love debating stuff! I don't mean any disrespect if I deconstruct arguments!)
