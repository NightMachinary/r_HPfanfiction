  That's not fact! Where did Dumbledore manipulate TMR?
#+end_quote

I'm writing a super long post about this, but the gist of it is that the events of the Philosophers Stone were not actually about protecting the stone --- it was all a charade by Dumbledore to trick Voldemort into seeing a prepubescent 11 year as a credible threat. It was only after the Philosophers Stone that Voldemort decided to use Harry's blood in his resurrection ritual; before he encountered Harry in the first book, Voldemort considered Dumbledore to be his greatest enemy. It's worth keeping in mind that Voldemort didn't know he couldn't touch Harry until /after/ the events of the first book.

But this is more or less a pet theory of mine, so don't take it as fact.

  I agree that Dumbledore raised Harry as a sacrificial lamb! ... Why not capture Voldemort, let Harry live a long life and then kill Voldemort once Harry is dead?

Why bother capturing Voldemort when you can just kill him /and/ keep Harry alive? Don't tell me it's not possible, because this is literally what happens in canon.
