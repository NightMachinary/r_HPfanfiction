Sorry mate, but I don't agree.

Triumph requires success, which requires an attempt, which implies a plan.

The "but in essence divided" line is immediately followed by a look of satisfaction on Dumbledore's face --- /not/ a look of realization, which means he already knew (or at least suspected) that Harry was a horcrux, and that test merely confirmed Dumbledore's theory.

Plus, once you know that Voldemort has horcruxes then it's not hard to figure out that Harry is a horcrux himself, and I can't imagine Dumbledore not entertaining this theory from at least Book 2.

Also, your two points are logically incompatible with each other. First, you say that Dumbledore realized Harry didn't have to die in book 4. Then, you say that Dumbledore realized that Harry was a horcrux until book 5.

If Dumbledore didn't know Harry was a horcrux until book 5, then he would have literally /no/ reason to think Harry needed to die during book 4, and therefore wouldn't have had a moment of triumph when he learned of Voldemort's resurrection.

Also, I think it's worth pointing out that even if you're right about Dumbledore learning Harry was a horcrux in book 5, then that means Dumbledore never /ever/ actually planned to sacrifice Harry. If he did only learn that Harry was a horcrux in book 5, then that means he had already realized Harry could survive /before/ he realized Harry needed to die; there was never a point when Dumbledore knew Harry needed die without already knowing Harry would survive his "death."

Therefore, Dumbledore never thought of Harry as a sheep to slaughter.

As for the Dursley situation, I'm writing up a more lengthy post that explains my views on that, and if you want I'll link you to it when it's done and we can continue this discussion there.
