  How so? It's almost certain no person had ever been a Horcrux before, saying it would be obvious is premature.

Harry being a horcrux was the dominant fan theory between the release of Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. Some fans had even predicted that a part of Voldemort's soul was within Harry years before the existence of Horcruxes was even revealed.

I'm just saying, if uneducated fans can figure it out, then Dumbledore should have some idea.

That being said, your JKR interview is The Word of God, and I don't really have a response to it. However, JKR also insists that the lunch lady on the Hogwarts Express was actually a secret magical terminator, so, YOLO --- fuck it --- I'm sticking to my theory anyway.

  But he had no way of ensuring he survived until Voldemort unwittingly gave him the way.

Sure, but that doesn't mean he intended for Harry to die. Not being able to ensure Harry's survival is totally different from actively working towards Harry's death. It's not a trivial difference.

  You can link the Dursley thjng, but I'm under no illusions I'll buy into it.

Yeah, I'm not going to pretend that the Dursley's were good guardians for Harry. I just think Dumbledore had no other choice.
