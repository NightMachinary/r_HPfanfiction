  not a look of realization, which means he already knew (or at least suspected) that Harry was a horcrux, and that test merely confirmed Dumbledore's theory.

JKR confirmed in an interview that Dumbledore didn't know Harry was a Horcrux until that line. Yes he supposed something was there (he mentions Voldemort passing on powers to Harry), but it was made clear by how Harry described his vision.

  Plus, once you know that Voldemort has horcruxes then it's not hard to figure out that Harry is a horcrux himself,

How so? It's almost certain no person had ever been a Horcrux before, saying it would be obvious is premature.

Fair enough. But he had no way of ensuring he survived until Voldemort unwittingly gave him the way. That's a big reason why he was afraid to tell him the Prophecy, as Voldemort having an unknown number of Horcruxes made the conclusion of the Prophecy seem inescapable since Harry would never run.

You can link the Dursley thjng, but I'm under no illusions I'll buy into it. Dumbledore seemed to clearly admit his guilt at having done so, not having believed anything else would work.
