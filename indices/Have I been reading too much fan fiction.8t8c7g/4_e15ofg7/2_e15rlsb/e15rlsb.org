No. The impossibility of Voldemort to kill Harry wasn't Dumbledore's plan at all. In fact, it's clear in in GoF that he didn't realize the possibility until after Harry told him how Voldemort returned ("something like triumph appeared in his eyes"), and in OoTP it's clear (as JKR confirmed) that Dumbledore didn't realize Harry was a Horcrux until then (the line, "But in essence divided?").

Dumbledore thought the Prophecy gave Harry an out, but it wasnt until GoF that he could actually see a way for it to happen. Harry was a sheep to slaughter, at the very least intentionally put in an abusive home (inarguable, Dumbledore says so in OoTP).
