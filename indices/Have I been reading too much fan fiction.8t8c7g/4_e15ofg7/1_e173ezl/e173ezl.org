Also, Dumbledore didn't know about the horcruxes until the end of Book 2. They were one of several theories of his, and he didn't have evidence until he had the diary in hand.

At that point, Dumbledore strongly suspected Harry was a horcrux. I don't think he got hard evidence of that until Book 5, but either way, he appears to have begun working on that assumption, trying to find a way to kill Voldemort that left Harry alive. He may have believed Harry had to die for a little while, but /not/ from the start.

At the end of Book 3, Trelawney's prophecy made it more concrete. Voldemort was prophesied to come back bodily. It's hard to say when, but sometime before the end of Book 4, Dumbledore figured out the blood protection loophole and correctly predicted that Voldemort would sew the seeds of his own downfall.
