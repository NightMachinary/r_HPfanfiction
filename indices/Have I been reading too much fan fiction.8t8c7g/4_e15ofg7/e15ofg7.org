Dumbledore didn't raise Harry for slaughter. He manipulated Voldemort into using Harry's blood during the resurrection ritual, so that Harry would become immortal as long as Voldemort was alive, therefore giving Harry a way to survive having his horcrux removed.

He didn't tell Snape or Harry this, because he wanted Harry to believe he really /was/ going to die, so that when Harry "sacrificed himself," and "died," it would activate the same blood-love magic that Lily used to save Harry as a baby, therefore making Voldemort unable to harm anybody that Harry was trying to protect.

Notice that I put "died" and "sacrifice" in quotations, because at no point did Dumbledore actually plan for Harry die; he knew Harry would come back.

There's also an explanation for Dumbledore's actions in the Philosophers Stone, and for why Dumbledore didn't remove Harry from the Dursley's, but those explanations require a little conjecture and a /huge/ wall of text. I might make a longer post that goes into the details of Dumbledore's plan, if anyone wants to read it.
