You have to understand something: the seven books of HP are almost like watching evolution occur in literary form.

The first three books are classic fairy tale stories, and are analogous to the finned-species that would eventually develop legs from their fins:

- Magical school
- Evil "step-parents" (ugly too, because why not)
- Old white bearded wise man
- Castles filled with talking paintings and three-headed dogs
- Villain with a snake-fetish and half-baked plans reminiscent of something a second-tier Captain Planet villain would come up with

The 4th and 5th books are where the changes become obvious, like you start seeing alterations to fins in fossils and see development of small or even vestigial legs:

- Larger world-building begins to occur
- Greater interaction in the magical world outside of Hogwarts for the main character
- Danger becomes a more constant threat, rather than just something that the happens once or twice in the books
- There is an exact point where you can say "okay that is where they started to develop working legs instead of just useless limbs." Its the moment Cedric is hit by the Killing Curse. Its no longer a fairy tale, its a war story, and anybody can die at any time. Magic is no longer just a whimsical tool, it can be a weapon of unimagineable horror.

By the 6th and 7th books, the whimsy and lightness has been utterly eradicated. To complete the analogy, legs are now fully developed and capable of supporting the species, and show up in all of its progeny. The books are now fantasy/war stories instead of fantasy/adventure/friendship stories. Examples include:

- Murder created soul-splitting
- A cave filled with an army of the undead
- Multiple deaths in stories of named characters that no longer become a story focus for the long term (Moody and Dobby)
- Demonstration of the moral gray area that people occupy (Dumbledore, Snape, Harry, etc.)
- Portrayal of the Death Eaters and Voldemort less as fairy tale villains and more like modern terrorist organizations (charismatic leader, central idea for rally point, use of guerilla tactics, etc.)

What I am trying to get at is that Rowling, intentional or not, began to change the style of the stories halfway through. This is understandable, given the nature of the main story arc, but it calls into question many of the story points and character decisions made especially in the earliest books (ex. giving time-travel to a 13 year old, practically everything about CoS).

She had a set story, and she wrote the books in essence to reach a handful of end points that she wanted with the minimum amount of additional story (they weren't exactly short books). This is partly why many "miraculous" situations resolve themselves in Deathly Hallows for Harry, Ron and Hermione (ex. what would have happened if Harry hadn't inexplicably said Voldemort after months of not doing so for no good reason).
