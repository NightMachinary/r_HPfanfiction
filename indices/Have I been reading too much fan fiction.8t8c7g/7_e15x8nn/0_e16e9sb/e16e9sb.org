True, Harry interfered where he shouldn't have. However, it could be argued he was meant to. As many have pointed out, all of the obstacles were easy enough for first years to make it through.

How could each have made it harder and more protected? That would be fun to think about.

Maybe mandrakes instead of the Devil's Snare for Sprout's. Even baby ones are supposed to knock you on your ass without earmuffs, right? So if someone went down there unprepared... Bam! :D Stick a key to the door in a pot under a mandrake. You need to unpot it to get that key.

Problem is, mandrakes were introduced in book two...

Side note for the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone in the mirror... There had to be a failsafe to get the stone it somehow, right? Because, aside from Harry, who would want it, but not to use it? Let's you live forever, turns metal into gold... And if there's a failsafe (Dumbledore has to get it back out somehow) it might be able to be overcome.
