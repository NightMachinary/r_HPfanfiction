Depends on your opinion on badass, but I can give you some fics that involve Harry taking the fight to the Death Eaters with bad-assery:

- linkffn(Taking Control): an oldie and indie!Harry fic, but its never over-the-top, still feels somewhat canon, and has Harry taking an active role in fighting the Death Eaters. Bashing is minimal, though Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore are by necessity painted somewhat negatively.
- linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): this fic is the ultimate bad-ass!Harry as he time-travels to June 24th 1995 and speed-runs Voldemort and the Death Eaters all in twelve hours. Filled with brutality and gore, so not for the faint of heart.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): and less-so for its sequels, but this pre-HBP fic depicts Harry throwing himself firmly into the role of "Saviour of the Wizarding World" and taking on the Death Eaters.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): once Voldemort is revived, Harry and Dumbledore decide he would be better served dropping Hogwarts and preparing for war. Depicts some very dark and sinister moments with Harry in the war, with a good Harry-Dumbledore mentorship.
- linkffn(The Weapon Revised): long-story-short, Harry goes stir-crazy after OOTP and dedicates /everything/ to learning enough to defeat Voldemort. Can be a bit depressing, but actually shows the sort of hardships Harry would likely need to undergo to "train properly for Voldemort" and the resulting psychological effects and trauma.
- linkffn(The Denarian Lord): third book in the trilogy, has Harry basically acting as the enforcer for the Order and doing the brutal work as he simultaneously takes down both the Denarians, Death Eaters, and Winter Court. Harry here is honestly more what I would expect if he had been trained or overpowered in some regard in canon as many readers/writers pontificate about.
