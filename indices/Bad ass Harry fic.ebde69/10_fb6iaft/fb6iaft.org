CW suicidal ideation (not glorified but most certainly explored. [Spoilers if you want specific warnings!! Not super spoiler-y plotwise] Includes mentions of succeeded attempts, not by any main characters, and a failed attempt by main character, along with depressive thinking after. Said depressive thinking was resolved basically by distraction and refocus.). I personally really like the way that the author approached everything, but like, it is a pretty prevalent theme so be careful.

This fic is one of my all-time favorites. Essentially, Harry uses Sirius's death as motivation to kill Voldemort. More specifically, again spoilers if you want the deets, in the first half of the fic, Harry decides to lure Voldemort into his mind via occlumency, trap the dude, and kill himself. The second half is what comes after, and is mostly offensive/legilimency based. Eventual Snape mentorship (though they never quite lose the animosity between them). Harry isn't evil-dark, but by the end he's definitely magic-and-moral-dark, and I'd probably consider him a "rogue weapon of destruction."

This fic /is/ relatively nuanced, and he doesn't "leave his friends behind" so much as... slowly grow apart? Sort of? No bashing, no pairings, and IMHO a brilliant take on the bamf!dark!loner!Harry trope.
