Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) by Belial666. Valeria, the main character, uses an enhanced version of Neville's potion accident from the first lesson on Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle in the dead of the night after petrifying them so they wouldn't be able to scream and so at the end of the next day they have to be delivered to St-Mungos and they have to stay there for a whole month. Keep in mind that she did that because he made her trip in the stairs and insulted her because of her blood and that was like six/seven hours before she did that to him and it was their first week of first-year. She often munchkins the crap out of magic in a non Mary-Sue way.
