  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  Harry and Hermione grew closer after Ron left. And then...that day at Malfoy Manor, Hermione was tortured into a coma. When she wakes, she cannot remember beyond the Horcrux Hunt. Now it's her thirtieth birthday, and Harry visits. Harry, who is married with three children and who cannot forget the seventeen-year-old girl he loved. Dark AU. Tragic Harmony.
