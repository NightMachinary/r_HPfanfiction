That fic is awesome. My personal favourites are linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13395213/1/Ron-and-Agent-J-s-Unintentional-Team-Up]]), but that one's a close third. I love fics that touch upon the often-forgotten bits of canon.
