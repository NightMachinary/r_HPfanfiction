Of chapters on mugglesftw? Idk. I'm working on some chapters for Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and other morals but I sort of wrote myself into a corner and I'm trying to figure out what the hell go do. Like A Red Headed Stepchild is kinda the same way. Last Auror when I look at it now is so silly and takes itself so seriously I just dont know where to begin.

I've read some of the Dresden Files microfiction but the trailer for Peace Talks has me stoked and I NEED SOME HARRY/MURPHY IN MY LIFE GODDAMMIT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER A DECADE BUTCHER AND YOU GAVE ME BLUE BALLS LAST TIME.
