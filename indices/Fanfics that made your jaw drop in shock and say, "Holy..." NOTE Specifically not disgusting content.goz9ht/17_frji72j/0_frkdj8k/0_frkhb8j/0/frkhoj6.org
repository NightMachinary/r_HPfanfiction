Actually I'm going slightly mad and writing stories in Konosuba and MHA on my other account, which is actually Full-Paragon. Astonishingly, I actually managed to finish a fic before I started a new one which is a mew thing for me.

Really looking forward to the Dresden Files and Stormlight books this year though. Consider I also got the last Age of Legends book by Michael J Sullivan it's been a good year for readers.
