"I work for a family business. They have their fingers in a lot of different of pies. Construction, waste management, shipping, small loans, they do it all. As for me, I work as... a jack-of-all-trades. Primarily I keep track of the books and help to make sure that all debts to the business are settled in a timely manner."
