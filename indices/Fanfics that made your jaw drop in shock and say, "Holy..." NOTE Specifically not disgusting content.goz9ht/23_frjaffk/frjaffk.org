I /hate/ Prince of Slytherin (seems to be an unpopular opinion, but there you are), but the moment in year two where diary!Tom reveals his whole plan honestly blew me away. The climax of that story arc (I refuse to call it a book) actually meaningfully used all of the seemingly disparate and ancillary information that came before it, unlike the third year arc, which is honestly just a mess.

* edit: I don't mean that the culmination of diary!Tom's plans was good by PoS' standards, I meant that it's an amazing piece of writing that genuinely knocked my socks off. It's a great example of somebody writing fanfiction specifically for people who read a lot of fanfiction: we're all used to Diarymort opening the Chamber and the basilisk attacking any muggleborn it can with no real long term plan. Realising that /every single attack/ was very specifically targeted to test the school's reactions was incredible, and his plans from there didn't disappoint, either.
