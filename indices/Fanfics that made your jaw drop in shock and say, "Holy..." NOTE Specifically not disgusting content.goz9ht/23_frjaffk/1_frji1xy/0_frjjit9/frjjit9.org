OP asked about jaw-dropping moments in fanfic. This was a jaw-dropping moment in a fanfic. I don't see how it's off topic. Also, maybe don't tell strangers on the internet what they feel and why? I have no idea why you think "I hate the whole story because of one part," nor to what one part you're referring.

There are things I genuinely love about PoS, but there's a /lot/ more that I don't, and on balance, I consider it to be a /very/ bad story.

* edit, because point of order: your prequel comparison is . . . perplexing to me. People are allowed to dislike things, and they don't need to justify disliking things, to you or anyone else. If someone dislikes the prequel trilogy because of Jar Jar, provided they aren't being a jerk about it, how is that /any/ of your business?

Even beyond that, it's a wildly inaccurate comparison: hating a trilogy of movies because of one character who only plays a prominent role in the first of the three is in no way comparable to hating a million-word story because roughly half of it is a poorly-conveyed tangle of ideas with dismal execution.
