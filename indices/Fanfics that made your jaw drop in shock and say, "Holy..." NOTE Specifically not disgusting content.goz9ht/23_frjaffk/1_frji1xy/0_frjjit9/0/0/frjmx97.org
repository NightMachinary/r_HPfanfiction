I'm not reviewing PoS: I mentioned year three because it was relevant and didn't mention year one because it wasn't. Draw from what I said what conclusions you will, but know that you aren't getting anywhere near my full opinion or thoughts on the fic because I refrained from bogging down my comment in unnecessary and irrelevant information and limited myself to relevant context. Again, make of that what you will.

* edit: also, just to be clear, I didn't love the second arc. I loved parts of it, same as I liked parts of the first and third, and while it's overall my favourite of the three, I still consider it the best of a bad lot. Plenty of media that I genuinely dislike or even hate has done stuff that I adore, and my being able to sincerely praise something I dislike doesn't make me dislike it any less.
