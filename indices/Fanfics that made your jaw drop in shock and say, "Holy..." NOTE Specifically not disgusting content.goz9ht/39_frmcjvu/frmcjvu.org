Bear with me, they are both HP x Marvel crossovers.

On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads. I read it on ao3. It might be the fact that I read it all in one night and at 3:20 you start to get emotional at every turn, but it's also fantastic world building by the author and maybe a little cheesy at the very end tbh

Child of the Storm. I'm still reading it on ff.net, but holy... this isn't just world building, it is actual universe building, and it incorporates so many comic elements and references I sometimes have to put my phone down and stare at the wall for a minute. And it's the length of eight novels- 400k+ words. Smh

I recommend OPGAAD for an emotional read, but CotS for a mind-bender.
