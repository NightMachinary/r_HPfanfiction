Hahaha, I'll give links, but mostly because your 'y'all' amused me.

I hope the bot works, this would make it easier...

linkffn(Echoes in the Fog by BolshevikMuppet; Hogwarts Battle School; Invincible by Darth Mars; The Life he Leads; The Mind Arts by Wu Gang; The Legacy by storytellerspw; Beyond the Curtain by Bobika; Defiance by Blackstaff and Nightmare; Eclipse of the Sky by Firefawn; Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Causality; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by TheSinisterMan; Realignment by PuzzleSB)

Though I could be called a bit biased on both Eclipse and ITT (I beta for those), I really do love them.
