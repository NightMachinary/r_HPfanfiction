Realignment, the 3-way battle at the Ministry.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Imago Dei.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament, the Maginot Rouge scene.

Eclipse of the Sky, the tree Horcrux, the island scene, the Forbidden Forest with Carrow, and the rest of the fic.

Defiance, Harry's fight against Dumbledore.

Beyond the Curtain, literally the last scene so far, but the whole fic too is jawdropping.

The Legacy, the Notts scene.

The Mind Arts, the first task and when he discovers what his power seems like.

The Life he Leads, every major Helian Magics use.

Invincible, during the whole construction and departure of the ship.

Hogwarts Battle School, Fulminata, every major battle.

Echoes in the Fog, pretty much the whole fic.

Those are the ones that come to mind. There are several fics that are fantastic, but these are a few that I love. My favourite of the bunch is Eclipse, followed by ITT and then Beyond the Curtain. Echoes is great, but you need to read at least another 7 fics to get it.
