Yeah, I really liked all that fan theorizing and would love to see that again. Sadly I'm not a fan of ASOIAF and the current trend in YA of realistic fiction like TFIOS or Eleanor and Park doesn't really seem to encourage that. Probably going to have to wait at least a few years before there's a book trend I actually like, which has ripe potential for fan theories.
