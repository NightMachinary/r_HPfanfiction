Yeah, speculation was everything back then. I remember thinking the people saying Harry was a Horcrux were out of their minds.

And there were tons and tons of fics where people wrote the next book themselves, while waiting for the actual thing. That was what got me into fanfic actually, I started reading a 5th-year fic on Quizilla before OotP was released.
