I've not spoken to anyone recently who has JUST read the books, but I'm in my 20s and read them as they came out.

One of the things that was really wild for me back before the series was complete was the sheer amount of speculation. EVERYONE was reading them and EVERYONE has opinions on what was coming next. I spent hours and hours reading on mugglenet forums discussing theories and trying to find evidence that Sirius was coming back, that Dumbledore wasn't dead, all kinds of things. I also was a Harry/Hermione shipper back then :) it was such a worldwide phenomenon and I can honestly say I've not experienced anything on that level since then. I went to many a book release and waited in line with my dad and with hundreds of other fans, it was like instant friendship just because we were all there together.

Now, a lot of people have only seen the movies and consider them canon, which is a bummer. They're so incredible and I wish more people would experience them.
