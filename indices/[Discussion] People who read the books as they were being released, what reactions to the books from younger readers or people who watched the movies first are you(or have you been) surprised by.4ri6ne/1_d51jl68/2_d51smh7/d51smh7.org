This, for sure! I started reading the series before OOTP came out, so OOTP was my first taste of /the long wait/ and the endless discussions and theories and speculations and what if's, and analyzing every word that JKR said looking for any tidbit of a clue....

It's kind of sad that we won't be able to get that back. It was fun to ride that wave with the rest of the world. But because of all that, Potter has become so pervasive that there's nothing left to pique the average kid's curiosity.
