Ah, I didn't quite read them as they came out, but I did at least get into the series sometime before I was 10, so before DH got released. Before I got into fanfic, I was really into fan theories, reading these forums that theorized everything they could from the smallest bit of subtext. I didn't ship back then, since I was only 10, but I was curious if Snape was a good guy and if Harry would survive the series and other stuff like that.
