I started reading the Dutch translation in 1998 when I was around 10 years old. Around CoS/PoA I began reading the books in English. Now is the English language something that always came to me rather easy, but the first couple of books I read with the translation next to it. After GoF I gradually began to read /only/ the English (UK) version.
