I remember back in the day how one of my English (ESL) teachers was really into HP. I was a fan too, but hadnt started to read them in English yet until we did some class exercices with her reading HP fragments. I remember her and another teacher telling me how crazy was for them seeing so many students, which normally werent so keen about reading in English, reading those long and not that easy books because they were so hooked to the story :) I couldnt wait for the translations either, so from book 5 i read them same day as published in the original :) They've been an awesome tool for me to practise without seeing the effort (not anymore, now i keep reading them/listening to audiobooks because I'm a crazy fan :p)
