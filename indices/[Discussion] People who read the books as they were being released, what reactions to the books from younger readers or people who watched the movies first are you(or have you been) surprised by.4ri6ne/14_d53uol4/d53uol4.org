Adding more thoughts... I think personally, now away from the hype of the movies, I find a lot of the HP movies to be a quite disappointing adaptation.

I think a lot of fanfiction has stimulated a lot of in depth analysis and second-guessing of the good nature of Harry Potter characters since the books were released. I am particularly fascinated by the long term moral consequences of Hermione cursing Marietta Edgecombe with 'SNEAK' on her forehead; the way a society could be rebuilt after war; why great female characters like Tonks and Ginny get sidelined in DH when JKR promised us a kick-ass Ginny!

I also think, as mentioned on another thread here somewhere, the DH movie gave us a huge glimpse into the plausibility of H/HR and I've seen heaps of fanfics jump from those infamous scenes.
