I sort of suspected this might be the case, given that Harry Potter - unlike say THG - shows us a world that it insists is /our/ world, rather than a separate place entirely. It is set in the 80s and 90s, but it doesn't outright say so until pretty deep into the series, so for a long time it just seems like it has no technology or nothing that people nowadays rely on day to day for no reason. That would break my suspension of disbelief for sure.
