I teach millennials - far from what Buzzfeed would have you believe, Harry Potter is not as popular as it was even ten years ago for the young ones. So I would say that quite a number of younger readers don't immediately reach for HP, or have even read it yet. My students know how obsessed I am with Harry Potter but the many references I make fly straight over their heads!

Some of the more popular books at the moment are John Green's novels, and the dystopian craze of THG and Maze Runner still hangs on. I also see a lot of YA type medieval fantasy romance series. Younger kids are really into Andy Griffiths, Rick Riordan and anything any youtube vlogger writes eg. Pewdiepie's book.

So I guess my two cents is that as a fantasy book, Harry Potter does hold up well, but younger readers of today generally are steered more to where our culture is going eg. stories featuring more technology etc and non-fantasy YA books. At least the flavour of the month isn't Twilight!

I find, as a member of the generation Buzzfeed loves targeting it's #TBT's to, the sheer amount of products and consumerism associated with HP is unbelievably popular and I think that says a lot about the fandom eg. fans getting very detailed or artistic HP tattoos, the slew of HP cosmetic products (some of which I totally own). I think that says a lot about where the fandom is moving.
