Harry/Hermione ship goes by Harmony or Harmonians.

Also I totally agree. The movies made it hard to love Ron, or harder for a broader raft of people to like him. The compressed time frame doesn't help either - 2 unwarranted betrayals in 8 films, as well as him not being active in the finale of POA which stands up as many people's preferred film of them all these days.
