Another unrelated thought --- I was so excited by Hermione as a strong, relatable female character, but I remember really loving Ron. And his portrayal (and I don't blame a child actor for this) was just the equivalent of the dopey dad in a sitcom. I really felt like he was not given his due. So when Ron shows weakness---as they all do, but his disappearance in book seven is pretty straightforward, I think he wasn't allowed much grace. He gets bashed by some Dramione shippers (and I have written one, so I don't lump all of them in) and some Hermione/Harry shippers. (Do they have a cute one-word name?) I feel like I need to go scratch out a feeble Loving On Ron story now.
