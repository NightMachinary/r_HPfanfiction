I was /convinced/ of Harry/Luna after book five. Why? Well, Jo likes to give people names that mean something and Luna's last name is Lovegood, so, of course her love is good and would be good for Harry. Then she was also /the/ person Harry managed to have a somewhat helpful talk with after Sirus' death. - she seemed more interesting and better fleshed out than Ginny ( who I did consider the only other option, I was firmly in the Ron/Hermione camp and did not even consider slash as something that might happen in canon). So, it just made sense to me.

Even so much later I am still a tiny bit dissapointed that I was wrong.
