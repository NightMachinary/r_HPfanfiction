Fair enough.

Speaking for myself, I have long since seen my shipping skills stagnate. Part of this is because I prefer Missing Moments fics and stories about deep, passionate, *platonic* friendships.

I'm especially fond of fics that explore Ginny's friendship with Luna.

On that note, my very favorite fanfiction was /Faith and Understanding./ But it got taken down--I think the author just disconnected her fanfiction account--and I didn't have it archived.

It chronicled the story of Ginny and Luna's platonic friendship, starting with their meeting on the train.

Oh, what a story it was. Through her friendship with Luna, Ginny pondered what "truth" meant. They sat next to each other in class and studied together and laughed and listened and made each other angry--Ginny is actually the one who coined the "Loony" nickname, though she only meant it as a private joke. They thought about what real friendship means. They confided secrets in one another and Ginny played a guessing game, asking Luna questions about herself and then tried to anticipate Luna's answer--which she usually got wrong.

They became very close. Luna spends time at the Burrow and lets Ginny use "Loony" as a private, affectionate nickname, because "if it's you, I don't mind. You can call me whatever you like."

And it balanced the tone of the books well, the juxtaposition of the war and the fact that these are just kids.

Ginny and Luna train for Dumbledore's Army, readying themselves for war, and sprawl barefoot in the grass on the Hogwarts grounds watching the clouds.
