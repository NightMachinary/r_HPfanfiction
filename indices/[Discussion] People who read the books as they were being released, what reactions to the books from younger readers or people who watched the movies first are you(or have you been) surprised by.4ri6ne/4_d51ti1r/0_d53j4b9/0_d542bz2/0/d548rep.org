In the movie, we already saw a /Confringo/ bounce off Nagini when Harry revealed himself. It's blink-and-you'll-miss-it, but she's strongly magic-resistant either because of Voldemort's protections or because she's a (correctly-made) horcrux.

Edit: They were trying to kill her with a basilisk fang, but they couldn't get close enough.
