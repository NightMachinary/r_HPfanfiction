WhiteSquirrel the writer? Its so cool to see you replying to my topic! Your work is so good.

Yeah, DH is so dark, I think it's why it still holds up as my fave of all the books to this day. Ironically I think the movie-makers shot themselves in the foot by changing characterization so much in the previous films; the book characters could hold their own in that darkness, the movie characters (especially with so much added comic relief and angst for Ron) struggled to bring him back from that brink. Also by continuing to chase a lower rating so that kids could watch the films still. Bring on my HBO series in ten years time, please.

Of course, for me the worst scene in DH is Ron and Hermione chasing Nagini and trying to kill her by throwing rocks and pieces of rubble. Are you a witch and a wizard or not?? That scene was crying out for someone to utter that line.
