I re-read the books for the first time since they came out two years ago, and this was what made the biggest impression on me. Even having seen the movies of /Deathly Hallows/ a couple times in between, I'd forgotten how things in the book just kept getting darker and more desperate up through Malfoy Manor. I have objections to other things in DH, but that definitely hit the right tone better than most fanfics.
