Not quite what you're asking but... My mom recently finished reading the books, and I think she hasn't seen the last movie yet. She knew all about them since I and all of my siblings are avid fans, and she'd read the first three or four books, and seen bit and parts of all the movies as we were watching them, but never took the time to sitt down and read/watch them herself until a few months ago. She called me in the middle or reading Deathly Hallows to basically tell me that she'd never realized how /dark/ the books became, and how she was internally cringing that she'd let my 10 year old brother read the last books before she did, just because she was under the assumption that they all stayed light and happy and good triumphs over evil, etc etc. I was shocked that she didn't realize this...
