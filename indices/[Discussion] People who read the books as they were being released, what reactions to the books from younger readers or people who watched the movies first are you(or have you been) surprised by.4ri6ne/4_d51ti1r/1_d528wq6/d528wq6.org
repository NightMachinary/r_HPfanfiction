My mother read the books alongside my twin brother and me. After a while, my brother and I were much further along in the books, because she liked to take her time.

One day, about a month or so after the seventh book came out, my brother and I had long finished reading it and were playing a video game. It was rather late at night and my mother walked into the computer room, in tears.

She looked at us and whispered, "Dobby just died."

I was thirteen when I read the seventh book, and I remember reading that scene like a punch to the stomach.
