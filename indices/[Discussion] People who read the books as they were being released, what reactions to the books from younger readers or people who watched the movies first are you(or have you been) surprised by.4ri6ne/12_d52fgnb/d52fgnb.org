My friend has watched the movies but never read the books. He was pretty surprised at just how much the movies cut out from the later books.

As an intern and student teacher I haven't seen a single Harry Potter book in the classrooms. Back when I was in school the books were the first ones to fly off the library's shelf. Now it seems hardly any kids read them, which is really a shame.
