Three years ago, a friend's 10-year-old daughter had a teacher who required the kids to read a chapter a day in a book of the child's choosing. 10-year-old mentioned to me that she didn't know what book she wanted to read. I offered to let her borrow my Harry Potter books. I was informed very quickly that "Ew! No way, only nerds read those books!"

Sigh.
