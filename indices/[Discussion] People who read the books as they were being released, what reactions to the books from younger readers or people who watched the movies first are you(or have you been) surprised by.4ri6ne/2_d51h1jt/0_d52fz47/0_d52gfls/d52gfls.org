I'd buy that - I can see why a Slytherin aesthetic would form mass, especially among young adult readers, or readers who started with the books then. I think they appeal to many of us who did a collective eyeball roll at the rah-rahs who would have been happy to be in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff (though really, I suppose I would be sorted among them, if I were to have the Hat.)

And I see the call on Snape/Lily. Had to be a reason why a guy Harry's parents' age hated him so much. Please correct my if I am wrong, but doesn't Severus complain in book one to Dumbledore about Harry being as obnoxious as his father? My books are a lazy walk away, so I may be misremembering.

Look up Felton on Instagram and you see many rabid HP-generated fans.They seem to be very invested in his love life. That is part, but obviously not all, of the Venn diagram.
