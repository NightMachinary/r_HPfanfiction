It was definitely not just the Tom Felton effect - I was on the fringes of the fandom before the first movie, and there was already a pretty good sized Slytherfan division. Heck, the first or second fanfic uploaded to FFN back in the day was a Snape fic (I think it was even Snape/Lily, actually, which was an amazing call after only the first book).
