I see people who consider the films canon, which I do not. I would agree with JKR to a point that girls have loved Draco because they fancied Tom Felton, although I would disagree that this explains all Draco-based fanfiction, because I write about him, and I don't think of the films at all. The scene with Hermione and Harry dancing in the tent sails the HP/HG ship for many, and of course many Snape fictions are wholly based on the lovely Alan Rickman.
