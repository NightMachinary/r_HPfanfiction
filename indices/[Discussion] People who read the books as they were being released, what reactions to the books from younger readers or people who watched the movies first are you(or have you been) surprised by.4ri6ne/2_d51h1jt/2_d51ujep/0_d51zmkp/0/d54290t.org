I mean, to be fair, all of Snape's generation were hilariously badly cast for the ages they were meant to be.

James and Lily Potter in the mirror were meant to be essentially soldiers who died in their 20s, not the middle-aged couple with the sensible clothes and shoes it shows us. Sirius and Lupin (and Pettigrew!) are meant to be early 30s? No way!
