But this begs the question of Grimmauld Place. If the secret was that it was the Headquarter of the Order, and it no longer was then shouldn't it be gone. Or was it still in place because Snape thought it was, and therefore as long as a secret keeper thinks it is still true means that it actually still is. I just gave myself a headache by trying to figure out Potter-canon logic. Not that FFlogic always is better. But hey.
