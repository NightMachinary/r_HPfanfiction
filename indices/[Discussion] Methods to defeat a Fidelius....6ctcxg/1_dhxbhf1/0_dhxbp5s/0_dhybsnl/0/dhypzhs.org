"The Potters live at XX Godrics Hollow."

The Potters no longer live there/are no longer alive, there is no longer a secret for the Fidelius to protect.

I've always thought that the Fidelius doesn't hide a location, it needs a subject and a location to work. The Potter family/Godrics Hollow, the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix/Grimmauld Place.
