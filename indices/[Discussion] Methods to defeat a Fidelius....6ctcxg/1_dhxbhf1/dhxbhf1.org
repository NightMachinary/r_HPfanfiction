There's only one broken Fidelius we know of in canon: the Fidelius charm over Godric's Hollow is apparently no longer in effect at all, as it is visited by tourists and can be seen by any witch or wizard. All other Fidelius charms have stayed in place and merely been undermined by e.g. the death of the secret keeper.

I would suggest that this indicates that one way for the fidelius to fail is for the secret to no longer be true.
