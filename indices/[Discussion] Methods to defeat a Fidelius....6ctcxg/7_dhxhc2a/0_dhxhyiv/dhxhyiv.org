Yeah, I wrote a similar idea in another reply. It's really not clear to me where the Fidelius would draw a line (if anywhere) and how it would decide what is voluntary.

New headcanon: The Fidelius doesn't protect against coercion at all, it's all just propaganda in the hopes that the likes of Voldemort won't test it. That's at least a worthwhile conspiracy, if I'd be a magical researcher/scholar I'd be willing to lie about it in my awesome magic tome.
