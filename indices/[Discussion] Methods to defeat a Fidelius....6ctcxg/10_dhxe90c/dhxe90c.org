So while searching for other discussions on the fidelius charm, I found this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10893602/1/1001-Uses-for-the-Fidelius-Charm]]

I'm only a couple of chapters in but it's already given me a good laugh. I'm hoping that it'll come up with some interesting ways around it, as well.
