It's a pretty foolproof charm if your not a idiot when using it

I recall a fanfic where harry puts the secret in a random muggle and lives in secret for years only being discovered because said muggle randomly got run over and died

if it had featured a more heartless harry he could have petrified the muggle and dumped him in the ocean
