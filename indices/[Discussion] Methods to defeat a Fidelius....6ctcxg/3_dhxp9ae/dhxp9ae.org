A few observations that may be helpful.

The Fidelius is only ever used on a property- the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow, Grimmauld Place, Shell Cottage, Aunt Muriel's place.

It appears that the owner of the property needs to be involved with the casting, probably because /they're the ones who have the right to secure it/.

The root idea of 'fidelius' is trust; I would infer that the secret must be entrusted to someone other than the owner of the property, or else there really isn't any trust being leveraged. My workaround for Shell Cottage on this is that Arthur may have bought the house for Bill & Fleur, so for the time being it was his property and not Bill's. [That still doesn't explain why Ron could tell Dobby to take everyone there, as he shouldn't have been able to tell the secret unless Shell Cottage's orginal secret-keeper had died.

I would think the way the Fidelius charm secures the knowledge in the secret-keeper prevents them from confessing the secret under duress of any kind. The knowledge would be impossible to find in their mind, impossible for them to say or write down unless they were choosing to betray the trust. Wormtail chose to side with Voldemort before he was made secret-keeper for the Potters, so he intentionally betrayed the trust. There doesn't seem to be a penalty for this, other than a desire by the entrustors never to trust them again.

The actual hiding of the property seems to erase any evidence of its existence, so anyone in the right area will not be able to catch it using physical or magical ways to counteract invisibility. Area of Effect spells and explosions may be effective, though a protected property might already be charmed to resist the effects of bombs, conventional fires, floods, tornados, or other acts of God. Even Fiendfyre might be flummoxed, since the fiends in the fire seem to pursue what they see as worth consuming- moving creatures, anything flamable in the way. For them, they might not attack a Fidelius'd building simply because they can't sense it. Their collateral flames may not be strong enough to burn through to the property, if it's properly charmed against it.

A nuke might work (I think Hogwart's protections may be enough to survive one when they're fully engaged, but most places don't have that kind of defenses), but that's a bit of overkill.

I think [[/u/ABZB][u/ABZB]] has the right idea; try to deduce who may be in on the secret and force them to deliver destruction within on their next visit. Don't try to break the Fidelius; work around it.
