In Wormtail's case, he knew that Voldemort was going to kill Harry and probably James and Lily, but he believed Voldemort was too powerful to lose the war. Peter chose to betray them because his allegience had changed. If anything, magic would abide by what the secret-keeper intends; if he doesn't wish to betray the secret, it would help him keep it unto death.

As for ownership, there's some explicit effects of inheritance that Dumbledore used to prove that Harry owned Grimmauld and therefore could command Kreacher. How that is established or ensured is left vague, but I imagine signed contracts or declarations would be involved. The more enchanted a place is, the more likely that it has the beginnings of its own personality and might have rules to follow to determine such. An empty cave or campground on a bluff probably doesn't have enough inherent 'self' to define ownership, and can be claimed by a wizard willing to go to the effort of defining the place and assuming ownership.
