  Wormtail chose to side with Voldemort before he was made secret-keeper for the Potters, so he intentionally betrayed the trust. There doesn't seem to be a penalty for this, other than a desire by the entrustors never to trust them again.

I think this explanation is "as good as it can get", but I really have difficulty with Death Eaters telling Voldemort anything without being at least a little bit under duress. The guy throws out curcios like candy, you're going to be extra forthcoming with anything that could help if it avoids future punishment.

  It appears that the owner of the property needs to be involved with the casting, probably because they're the ones who have the right to secure it.

How do you suppose magic determines ownership? Is it looking through the filed papers at the Ministry of magic? What about "unregistered" properties? Is ownership even a thing that a natural force like Magic would recognize? Seems a bit silly...

I really enjoyed your explanations though. You should have a discussion with the dude who's really angry about Secrets vs Locations.
