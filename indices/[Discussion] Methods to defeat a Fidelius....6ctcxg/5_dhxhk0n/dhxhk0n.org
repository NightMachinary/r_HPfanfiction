Imperius random people who you think might know the secret (and are not the secret-keeper). Command them to accomplish whatever task you need to access said location for, or perform acts that will compromise Fidelius (destroy the location) or render it moot (carry the object or person desired out of the Fideliused area).

Either they have been told the secret, and this works, or they do not. If desired, and the risk is low, also command them to Imperius others to do the same if they cannot do it themselves.
