The trio disapparated from the Ministry with Yaxley still attached. When they arrived at Grimmauld, Hermione kicked him loose and re-disapparated them to the Forest of Dean. Since Ron got splinched in the process, they had to fix him up and decided to set up a camp with a bunch of protective and concealment charms.

Hermione's assumption was that Yaxley had been effectively 'told' the secret because Hermione brought him there. I think she's wrong, but I also think Yaxley might have been able to work around the Fidelius from the inside by using the Floo to call out for assistance. So long as they kept one of their guys in the house and he Floo-called out regularly, that access would remain open.
