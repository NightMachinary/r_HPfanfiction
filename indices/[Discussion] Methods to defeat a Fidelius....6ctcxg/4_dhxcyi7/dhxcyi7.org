"The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."

I just realized why the fidelius was broken in Deathly Hallows. It wasn't the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix anymore because the order no longer existed. If they'd just kept it house it probably would have been a lot more tight and maybe even usable by Harry and co more.
