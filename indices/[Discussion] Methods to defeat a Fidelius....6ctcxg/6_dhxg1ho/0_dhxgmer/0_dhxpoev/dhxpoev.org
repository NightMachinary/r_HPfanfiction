As far as the Order Fidelius, I always saw it as the Headquarters (physical location) is located at this address. The Headquarters and the house become synonymous, and they are the secret, so you can't see them or detect them. However, the address stays the same, and that is why anyone can see that there is supposed to be a number 12, or it was skipped or something, but since the sign and house are missing, you simply get a blank space.

TDLR; House is headquarters. House is hidden in address, which is not hidden.

As far as coercion, it requires you to think and concentrate. Like doing a math problem in your head. Impossible under torture, but if you are being threatened hard enough, you can choose to divulge it. But it must be of your own free will, with your full knowledge of what will happen.
