  As far as the Order Fidelius, I always saw it as the Headquarters (physical location) is located at this address. The Headquarters and the house become synonymous, and they are the secret, so you can't see them or detect them. However, the address stays the same, and that is why anyone can see that there is supposed to be a number 12, or it was skipped or something, but since the sign and house are missing, you simply get a blank space.

I've asked this somewhere else in the thread, but this line of thinking seems to beg the question too: Can Narcissa and Bellatrix not visit the ancestral home of their family anymore (not the headquarter of the Order of the Phoenix, let's just say Bellatrix wants to have a talk with Walburga)?

  As far as coercion, it requires you to think and concentrate. Like doing a math problem in your head. Impossible under torture, but if you are being threatened hard enough, you can choose to divulge it. But it must be of your own free will, with your full knowledge of what will happen.

Okay. Personally I think that's the best approach. It makes protecting the secret keeper that much more important.
