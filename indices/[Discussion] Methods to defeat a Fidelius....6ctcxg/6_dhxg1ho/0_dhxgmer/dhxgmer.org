  It is a small mechanic, but worth thinking about. The fidelius charm must be used on a secret. The secret must have no one other than the casters know about it when it is cast. So when the Grimmauld Place Fidelius went up, people could know about the Order, but in order to cast it, Dumbledore and Sirius would have had to decide that they were going to make it the Headquarters without anyone else's knowledge.

That's an interesting idea. Instead of creating a secret it hides a secret more. It wouldn't be able to hide the whole building at Grimmauld Place then though. Just no-one could conceive of the idea that the Order is hiding there (which would work just as well).

  As far as coercion goes, it cannot be tortured out of you. Veritaserum will fail, you will not scream it under Cruciatus. What happens is that you must make a deliberate decision, in full mental capacity that you will give up the secret, with all the consequences which follow.

It's not really clear where the line is drawn here. An information given under duress can still be given deliberately, in full mental capacity. I think I have explained enough about how I see a conflict here with how Pettigrew was able to divulge the secret.

Especially with magic in play I just see way too many way to terrible options to make someone more inclined to share information with you. But let's stay in muggle territory: What if I put a gun to the head of your child and ask you to tell me the secret? Will the Fidelius force you to sacrifice your own child or does that count as 'voluntarily'?
