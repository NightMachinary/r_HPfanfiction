It is a small mechanic, but worth thinking about. The fidelius charm must be used on a secret. The secret must have no one other than the casters know about it when it is cast. So when the Grimmauld Place Fidelius went up, people could know about the Order, but in order to cast it, Dumbledore and Sirius would have had to decide that they were going to make it the Headquarters without anyone else's knowledge.

It is a bit of a nerf, but it makes sense. It means that you have to be choosy with your wording. You can't Fidelius the Ministry, because the secret is already out. But if no one knows that you are in the Ministry, then it works if you are casting the Fidelius on yourself.

The other thing is that it must be a secret. A secret with one person knowing it, and another one being Secret Keeper. And if you are part of the secret, you can't hold it. So the Potter family couldn't use James as Secret Keeper, because he is part of the Potter Family.

That is why Dumbledore was not the Potter secret keeper. Because if he was and then died, then everyone with the secret becomes secret keepers, and if they die, then the Fidelius breaks as it is no longer a secret between people.

Another thing is that the magic which powers the Fidelius is used to keep a secret, absolutely. That is the point. You use it to shore up every other defense, and then place all your vulnerabilities on one person. So spray painting it won't work, it is practically in a different dimension, and everything is warped so it is the opposite of a black hole, in that it warps space so that nothing can get in, unless they have the secret.

As far as coercion goes, it cannot be tortured out of you. Veritaserum will fail, you will not scream it under Cruciatus. What happens is that you must make a deliberate decision, in full mental capacity that you will give up the secret, with all the consequences which follow.

As far as ways to manipulate how the secret is shared, I would argue that it must be shared. While you could get it by eavesdropping, any recording devices will fail, and photocopying a written secret will give a blank page, because you are not the Secret Keeper, and only the Secret Keeper can give out that information.
