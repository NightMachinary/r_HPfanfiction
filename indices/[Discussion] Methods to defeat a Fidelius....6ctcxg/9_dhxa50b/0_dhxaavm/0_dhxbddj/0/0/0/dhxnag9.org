  Potters choose Sirius to conceal their secret about where they live.

  Sirius chooses Dumbledore to protect his secret. That he let's the Order use his house as a headquarters.

  Muriel chose Bill to protect her secret, that she hides him and his family in the Shell Cottage.

I understand that. What stops anyone from hiding more fundamental secrets? What stops anyone from hiding the secret "Avada Kedavra is the incantation for the killing curse"?

... is a simplification of what happens in canon. The whole house disappears. The Death Eaters know the general location, patrolling the area, yet can't find it. Bellatrix or Narcissa surely remember the ancestral home of their family? So they're not just hiding "The headquarter of the phoenix is here", they're hiding the house from everyone.

Anyway, it all sounds very much like hiding a location to me. Why again are you against that idea?
