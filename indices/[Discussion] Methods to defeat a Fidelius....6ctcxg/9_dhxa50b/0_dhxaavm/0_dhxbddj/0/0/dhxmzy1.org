  Except that's the only way it makes even a little bit of sense. If you could hide any kind of secret, I'll just hide "Human beings have to Eat and drink through their mouth" and everyone will starve.

It's not. Look.

Potters choose Sirius to conceal their secret about where they live.

Sirius chooses Dumbledore to protect his secret. That he let's the Order use his house as a headquarters.

Muriel chose Bill to protect her secret, that she hides him and his family in the Shell Cottage.
