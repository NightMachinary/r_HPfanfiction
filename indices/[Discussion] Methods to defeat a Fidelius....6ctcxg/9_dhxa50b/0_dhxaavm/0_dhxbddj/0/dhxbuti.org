  They switched it from protecting secret to protecting space

Except that's the only way it makes even a little bit of sense. If you could hide any kind of secret, I'll just hide "Human beings have to Eat and drink through their mouth" and everyone will starve.

There's an interesting fic that explores the idea how broken the Fidelius is as a concept if you can hide anything you want:

  Additionally, the rules of how the secret is protected were changed for the same reasons. Fidelus (and magic in general) in DPaSW is a great example "how to not write it".

Fanfics constantly change the rules, because the rules of the HP world only work for children's books that aren't questioned. I do not understand how you can enjoy any fanfic if your requirement is that the rules shall not be changed, because that's everywhere (not to mention that the rules in canon are often at best very unclear and at worst contradictory/inconsistent).

DPaSW is amazing for what it does with such a flawed concept.

Edit: By the way, I'm wondering now, why didn't Fumbledore cast a Fidelius on Harry then? "Harry Potter is the boy who lived" would have been really useful.
