  This is [[/r/hpfanfiction]] not [[/r/prayatthealtarsofhpcanon]], no?

Quoting you:

  A lot of this will probably be based on speculation, but we should allow everything that doesn't directly contradict canon

Also, as I said, the mechanics in DPaSW are boring and bad and the author should feel bad. They switched it from protecting secret to protecting space and eliminated all restrictions connected to it so it could be abused. Additionally, the rules of how the secret is protected were changed for the same reasons. Fidelus (and magic in general) in DPaSW is a great example "how to not write it".
