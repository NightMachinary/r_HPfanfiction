Northumbrian's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]] series is canon-compliant and will keep you busy for a while. You can read the stories in any order.

All the Young Dudes, mentioned earlier, is a beautiful, heart-wrenching story, but departs from canon in giving Remus a different backstory, and also making werewolves sensitive to silver, so it might not fit your request.
