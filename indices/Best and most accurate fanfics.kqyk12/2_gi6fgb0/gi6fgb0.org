linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89)

I know it's a cultfic at this point but it is canon to me now and nothing will change that.

It's a Marauders era that follows Remus from 1st year to OoTP. It's just the right amount of funny and tense and heartbreaking and warming all at once. It has some of the best character development I've read. I was completely absorbed by it. It's really marvellous.

And slots perfectly into Canon ðŸ˜Š
