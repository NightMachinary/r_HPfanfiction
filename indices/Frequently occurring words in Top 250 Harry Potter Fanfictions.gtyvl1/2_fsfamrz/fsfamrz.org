This is cool - thanks for this! I'd love to see more analysis like this about fanfic. I wonder, for example, how the top words in canon differ from fanfics, or what language differences between the two exist in general.

One language quirk that's different, for example, is that Snape in canon speaks in very clipped, short sentences. He uses pretty straightforward language even when expressing complex ideas. In most fanfics on the other hand, Snape's language suddenly becomes more elongated, with long sentences and thesaurus words.

Thanks again :) really interesting and it took a bit of time to do, I see. This is valuable fan content.
