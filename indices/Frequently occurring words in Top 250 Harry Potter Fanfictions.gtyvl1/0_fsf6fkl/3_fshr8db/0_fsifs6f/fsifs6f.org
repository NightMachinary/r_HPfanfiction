That I get. But there's a dozen of those in Harry's year.

Daphne, Tracey Davis, Sally-Ann Perks, Lisa Turpin, Mandy Brocklehurst, Megan Jones, Isobel MacDougal, Lily Moon, Sophie Roper, Sally Smith, and Su Li are all complete non entities. Hannah Abbot, Susan Bones, and Padma Patil get mentioned more, but don't have much character fleshed out in canon. And those are only Harry's year, and only counting the mostly blank slates.

I'm just wondering how Daphne emerged out of all of those possibilities as the main non Ginny or Hermione choice at Hogwarts.
