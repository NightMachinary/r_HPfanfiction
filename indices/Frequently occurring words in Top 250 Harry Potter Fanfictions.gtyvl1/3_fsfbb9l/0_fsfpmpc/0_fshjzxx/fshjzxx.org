Ron is so fascinating a character to me because he has such a chip on his shoulder but its completely logical and realistic and he's still good, brave, heroic, and he gradually works out his issues. I think that it makes sense that Indy! Harry writers hate him hes a nuanced, loveable flawed character who's poor and doesn't become rich, who works for and slowly improves and grows whereas they love to instantly over power Harry, make riches and status fall onto him with no effort and avoid nuance and complexity in their story wherever they can. Ron is the antithesis of that
