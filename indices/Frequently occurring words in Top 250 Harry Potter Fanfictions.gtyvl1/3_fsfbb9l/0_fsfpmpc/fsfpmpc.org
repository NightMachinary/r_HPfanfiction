I think that it must be very difficult to write Ron as a character - precious few fics that I enjoy manage to treat him like a real character.

He is either left out of the story because they author doesn't know what to do with him, or they bash his character so they can justify pushing him aside. The way that JKR shows his flaws while also having him be funny, brave, and loyal to his friends is one of the best parts of the books.
