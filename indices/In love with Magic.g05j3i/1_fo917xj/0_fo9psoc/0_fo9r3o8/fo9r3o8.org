I'll give those all a glance, thanks. Think I've read "Fair Lady" actually, not sure.

I've seen a few posts similar to this one over the years (as have you, I believe) and, it's a shame, they always go mostly unnoticed. This is just an unpopular subject, it seems. One of these days I might sit down and write my own. I've certainly got a lot of ideas, just not overly confident in my abilities. Though writing is definitely the way to improve anyhow, so...
