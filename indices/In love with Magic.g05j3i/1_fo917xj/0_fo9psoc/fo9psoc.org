Welcome, welcome! Better late than never!\\
You say you've had a hard time finding the 'anthropomorphic' Magic recs?\\
Well, the first, and most satisfying would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5934267/1/][Finding Why's]] , which features Magie as Harry's first friend / caring sister. Very nice, very sweet if not exactly romantic - Harry's young.

There are a few more I do not remember, as well as a few that do not fully fit (Fair Lady by kideaxl has Death instead of Magic). Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror has a wide variety of deities and 'humanized' concepts, but this is a Fate/Cross, so it's expected. Not exactly love, but normal interactions.
