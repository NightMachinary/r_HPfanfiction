Awkwardly late, I know. Was gonna respond earlier, but forgot.

I've been looking for something along the lines of your first type for /years/. I've, unfortunately, not found anything decent. You say you've read some, any recommendations?

My favorite fanfiction of /all time/, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control by Anonymous58,]] is one which I think /semi/ fits /both/ of your types.

While I wouldn't say this Harry /loves/ his magic, he definitely anthropomorphizes it, (gives it a body in his head) and views it as his /"savior"/--something (or, perhaps, the /only/ thing) which was always there for him. There's a definite /unique/ relationship there, if nothing else.

For your second type, I believe this Harry /semi/ fits because he is, at least, /aware/ of his lack of "awe" toward magic--something /so/ awesome--and seeks to better himself toward the end of the story. Unfortunately, the story was never finished, and updates are unlikely.

"Control" is pretty trope-y in many ways, (this Harry's a dick, but all the ladies love him, very edgy, so on) but I've personally never much cared for such things. (though, I think this Harry's edginess is mostly mitigated by the colorful personalities of various other characters, I think)

  Snape-rant me?

Snape was /hardly/ an "/interesting character/", and an even worse person. Never got the love.

Again, sorry for the super late response.
