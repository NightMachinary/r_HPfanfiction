As another take, what if spells require a target to be cast? I imagine it as trying to paint a picture without a canvas, you have no target so the spell would fail to cast. To me, having one able to fire off blind Killing Curses makes the spell feel a lot more like a gun, as opposed to the crystalized hatred I prefer to see it as.
