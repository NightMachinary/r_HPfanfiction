But crystalli,ed hatred DOES have a target; It xomes fron one's memories the same as the happiness for an expecto patronum comes from one's memories. Voldy's hate from orphanage days and stuff led to him being able to AK now. If his orphanage days were mundane and he grew to be a mundane wizard, he wouldnt be able to AK if he wanted to. At least, that's how I see it.
