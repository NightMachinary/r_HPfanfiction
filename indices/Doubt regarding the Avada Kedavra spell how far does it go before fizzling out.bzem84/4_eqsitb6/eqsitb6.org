Do the games count as canon? I've always thought of spells as short range (50-100m max) in my head, with some being really short range (imperio, incendio, aguamenti), some medium range (avada kedravra, crucio, reducto) and then some longer range (stupefy, diffindo). I don't know why, but that's just how I've thought of them. The short range ones make sense, then I've always thought that the more damage the spell does, the more magic it takes to hold it together, so it has a shorter range.
