It just goes straight ahead until it hits something, following the curvature of the Earth.

There's a Dark Lord who has the reputation of being a bit barmy amongst his peers, who's been staying in an out of the way area for years now, firing killing curses all around him while giggling like mad.

As he is surrounded by mountains and seldom hits anything beyond the occasional rabbit or deer, nobody's bothered to try and take him down.
