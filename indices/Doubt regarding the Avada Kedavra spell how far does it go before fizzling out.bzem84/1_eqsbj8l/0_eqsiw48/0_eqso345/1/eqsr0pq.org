It's got nothing to do with what degree light is affected by gravity. It's affected in the same way regular objects are (to my knowledge), but when something travels horizontally at 300000000m/s you tend not to notice that it's accelerating downwards slighty. Black holes just have a strong enough gravitational field strength that they noticeably affect light.
