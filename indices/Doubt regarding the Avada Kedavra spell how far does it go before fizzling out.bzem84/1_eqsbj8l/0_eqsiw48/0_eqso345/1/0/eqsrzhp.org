Yes, but light bends ever so slowly around earth that it is virtually unaffected. Light even escapes the gravity of the sun and several times larger stars. So unless it heads on to a solid object, it is highly likely it will just go on. If magic behaves as light does, and considering the weightlessness of it, and the speed, it may just never hit anything.
