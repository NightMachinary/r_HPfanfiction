HPMoR is the biggest genius!Harry story of them all. It's very controversial because it does some things /really/ good and completely fails at other aspects (realistic characters). Basically, Harry is a super genius who teaches genetics to Malfoy, discovers breakthroughs in Transfiguration and chemistry with Hermione, invents a rocket powered broom on the fly while adventuring with Quirrel and so on. There's lots of science, creative plot and ridiculous humor, but characters are somewhat unrealistic (11 year olds messing around with upper level magic) because it's all in first year because Quirrel is a really important character. There's also a lot of interesting philosophy, but many who fundamentally disagree with the author's views really hate the story because of it. Keep in mind that the first few chapters are /very/ different from the rest.
