Harry was adopted by iirc a physics professor. He's a “rationalist” check out the webpage Less Wrong and you'll get it. Quirellmort is also a rationalist. It's a long and convoluted story as Quirellmort deceives and mentors Harry. I read the whole thing. I went from thinking it was a half decent crack fic (first 16 ch or so) to thinking oh this is a weird direction to go, to enjoying the Ender's Game rip off to waiting for it to end because I invested so much time in it.

If you like unbelievable smarminess and an abuse of Baye's Theorem then this will be for you... or if you're an edgelord “bright” who thinks the only objective moral evil is death then you'll agree with the author
