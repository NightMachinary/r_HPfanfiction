Both Harry and Quirrelmort are much smarter than their canon versions, which results in a story with a lot more plot twists than canon. It's also full of references to a whole lot of other sci-fi and fantasy books, which are fun little Easter eggs, but you don't have to get all the references to enjoy it.

Many readers hate this Harry because he's an insufferable know-it-all, and consider him a ridiculously overpowered author insert, but he's written like that intentionally. Even Hermione considers him an insufferable know-it-all. It's all from his POV, and he's very overconfident, so all we directly see is how great he thinks he is, but his flaws lead him to make some really major mistakes.
