  It's also full of references to a whole lot of other sci-fi and fantasy books, which are fun little Easter eggs, but you don't have to get all the references to enjoy it.

References could be annoying, though. When you don't understand a reference, you might keep worndering what it could mean because you cannot judge whether it's safe to skip or it's something that will be relevant/explained later in the story.
