I can't remember if this is the name, but you might enjoy linkffn (in the mind of a scientist). Super genius, mad scientist Harry who's fairly OP and I think well written. That first story is just Harry Potter. Then there's Madness at the Gate, a sequel crossover with that Harry and Stargate. Then a third crossover called Madness Effect, which is a Mass Effect crossover.
