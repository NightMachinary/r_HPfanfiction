Same here! Just discovered them a few months ago. Yeah I really wanted him to continue and see what happens when Harry meets the reapers.

How badly does he beat them? Which of their powers and technology does he copy for himself? Who's the friend that he owes the favor to? Did he ever reach his "full potential" and becomes super powerful like those ancient beings mentioned in Madness at the Gate?

These are things I need to know!
