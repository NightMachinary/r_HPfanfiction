That's a very interesting premise, though from the title alone, I wondered if you meant a story which took the canon fats "snakes can talk" and "murder damages your soul" to their logical conclusion, and had Harry's soul damaged by the stain of having, you know, stabbed the Basilisk through the brain.

At any rate, I am enough of a pedant to point out that within canon, the Basilisk venom isn't supposed to harm the soul shard itself --- rather, it damages the physical container to a sufficient extent that the Horcrux enchantment loses hold, “freeing” the soul shard, which, unable to subsist in the physical world on its own, immediately disperses. So the equivalent for a living being who gets bitten by a Basilisk is that they die and so /their/ soul leaves their body.

But, of course, that's not to say you couldn't have it work differently in an AU.
