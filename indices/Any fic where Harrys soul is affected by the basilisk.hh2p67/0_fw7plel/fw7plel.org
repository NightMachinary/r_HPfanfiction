In the Archmage of Arda Harry can't live in his world anymore because he's a walking contradiction. He has the most potent forces of destruction and creation flowing through his veins (the venom and tears) so Death basically says "either let me kill you or go to Arda" Harry chooses to go to Arda.

He's functionally immortal because of it. He will literally live longer than multiple universes
