  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  Sequel to 'As Black As Night'. One night can change a life. One night can change the world. One night can change everything. Forever. But as long as the stars are in the heavens, the House of Black can weather any hell. Rated M.
