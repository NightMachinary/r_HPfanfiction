[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]]! It's a next gen fic, about a rivalry between Hogwarts powers. It's a little confusing and verbose at first, but very very worth it. Legit moral ambiguity and a complex ensemble. It's arguably much more about the effects of what the protagonists are doing rather than the protagonists themselves. The last chapters are going up soon.
