There's 1 mage per every 1000 people by jkr's statement at some event. That means a worldwide population of 7 million mages. In the US, there's approximately 24 million children age 12-17 or 1 kid of hogwart's age per thirteen people in the US(that means 12,400 kids at ilvermorny!). With the US pop being approximately 5% of the world population, we can somewhat unsafely assume world hogwarts age children to be 480 million or approximately 8%. That means If you break that down by national populAtions, you can then have a good working number for how many kids should be at hogwarts(2600 I believe?) or comparable schools by their population.

It is two am here and my math could be fucked.
