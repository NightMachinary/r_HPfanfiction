Rowling said that Hogwarts is the only school for Britain and that there are only 4 in Europe (some weird Russian one is number 4), but the problem goes far deeper.

How is the magical world administrated? Or more specifically, how are the borders. The whole statue of secrecy went into effect in the 1700s. At that time, there was no Bulgaria for example, but you had Prussia or a multitude of states in Italy as well as the mess called HRE. Since I don't see Wizards bowing to Muggles and suddenly considering themselves members of a different country just because the Muggles say so, where does that leave administration? Are Muggleborns forced to accept the Ministry from a country which muggle counterpart is actively killing their family (the whole Balkan in the 90s for example)? How and why do magical borders change? Are muggleborns forced into a school where they don't understand a single word? Are they forced to pay taxes, and if so to whom? How do they pay for their education and who covers the expenses if the parents cannot?

It doesn't really impact Britain after the Act of Union, but the rest of Europe underwent massive, frequent changes. I have hoped that Rowling would touch onto these issues at some point, but instead we got more next gen stuff.
