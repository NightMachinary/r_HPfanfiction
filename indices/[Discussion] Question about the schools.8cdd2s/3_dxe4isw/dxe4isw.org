I assumed that there would be smaller, less significant schools scattered around Europe, while Beauxb√¢tons and Durmstrang are basically the Russell Group, Ivy League and so on of European magical education.

Where do the Scandinavian and Eastern European Muggleborns go? (Possibly even before Karkaroff; if their leanings weren't towards blood purism, why would they ever let a war criminal take over as headmaster?)

I also compeletely disregard anything about the uninspired Google Translated Academies of Magic, such as Castelobruxo and Mahoutokoro.
