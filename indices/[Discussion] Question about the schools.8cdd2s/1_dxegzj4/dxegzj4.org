To my understanding, (and like other commenters have said) there's Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Koldovstoretz that cover all of Wizarding Europe. Personally, I think this doesn't make much sense, even if you account for homeschooled students. In my AU, I add three more schools. The Irish Academy of Magic is very small, and takes only students from Ireland. (Students from Northern Ireland still attend Hogwarts). Olympus is located in Greece, and takes students from Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ferviditious is located in Italy, and takes students from Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia.

I've also tweaked the catchment areas for some of the canon and semi-canon schools. Durmstrang is located in Northern Scandinavia, and serves Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland. Koldovstoretz serves all of Russia plus the majority of former Soviet satellite nations not already named under other schools.

This is just my two-cents -- the more I think about Rowling's education system, the less it seems to make sense. If I think about the issue more, there should probably be a school located somewhere close to Bulgaria, but then that messes with what we know about Durmstrang from canon.
