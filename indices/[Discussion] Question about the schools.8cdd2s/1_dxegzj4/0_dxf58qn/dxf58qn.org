Why would Durmstrang serve Germany and Ferviditious take Austria? Wouldn't it make more sense to have a school for the German-speaking part of Europe? Plus, with the development of modern languages, what language would these schools teach in? Would students be forced to learn a new language immediately? I'd like to see Chessmaster take this on because it would be something to explore.
