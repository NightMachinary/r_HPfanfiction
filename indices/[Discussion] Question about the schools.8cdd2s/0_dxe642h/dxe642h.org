There are four, not three: there's also a school in Russia called "Koldovstoretz". This may or may not exist depending on your definition of canon, but it is from materials created by JKR, so it's likely that when she reveals further schools, Koldovstoretz will be there.

Also, Durmstrang is larger than Hogwarts in terms of student numbers, as is Beauxbatons:

  Beauxbatons Academy has a preponderance of French students, though Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Luxembourgians and Belgians also attend in large numbers (both Beauxbatons and Durmstrang have a larger studentship than Hogwarts).

In any case, not every country is "covered" by a school. The international norm is not to attend one of the large, prestigious schools, but rather either:

A) Attendance at smaller, more itinerant schools.

B) Home schooling.

  The number of countries that have their own magical school is minuscule compared to those that do not*. This is because the wizarding populations of most countries choose the option of home schooling*. Occasionally, too, the magical community in a given country is tiny or far-flung and correspondence courses have been found a more cost-effective means of educating the young.

  There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, all of which are registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. *Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone*, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry (in which case, I cannot vouch for the standard of education they might offer). Anyone wishing to know whether there is an approved magical school in their region should address an owl enquiry to the International Confederation of Wizards, Educational Office.
