It's hard to confirm specific correlations between the movies and how they've affected fandom/fanon perspectives. With Snape and Draco, for example, the choice of actors and portrayal may have impacted the number of fans, but morally dubious characters with (potentially) redeeming characteristics are pretty much always fandom catnip.

There are a few notable exceptions, though, such as Hermione's Mudblood scar which is pretty ubiquitous. Same with the dementors and magic visuals.

Other times, such as with Ginny's characterization or with the ages of the adult cast, I find fanfiction usually sticks closer to the book.
