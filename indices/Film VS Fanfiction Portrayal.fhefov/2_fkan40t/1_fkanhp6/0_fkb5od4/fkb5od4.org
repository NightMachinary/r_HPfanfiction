Can you recommend the Harmony fics that you read. I am a huge fan of the pairing but can't stand Ron bashing.

As for your question, I think Dumbledore was also affected by the movies. As impressive as his duel against Voldemort in the Ministry was; it failed to tell just how good Dumbledore actually was.

In the books the Order is getting curb stomped without managing to down a single Death Eater. Then Dumbledore enters, just flicks his wand and tada all Death Eaters wrapped and ready to be shipped to a cell.

The movies also made Ron a bit more unsympathetic in that scene in the scene in which he left the hunt. In the books he does not actually say that Harry's parents were dead and that he had no family. So definitely that.

The movies also gave Harry, Hermione and their relationship a new light with the scene where Harry says that he had known he had to die for a while and that he thinks that Hermione did too. Not to mention Hermione saying that she would go with him. That whole scene was one of the strongest in the movies.
