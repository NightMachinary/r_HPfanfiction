I hear you, it's why I love David Thewlis portrayal, and I hear you on the Ron part. There's definitely moments when the chemistry between Ron and Harry in the movies is there but it's 100% not a great portrayal mainly I think to the writing. I don't doubt, they are great movies it's just they could have given Ron better lines. I definitely think that the way Ron was portrayed in the films leads to his bashing in Fannon, but I also think it leads to wanting Harmony fics without alienating Ron (have read good fics where Ron also wants them together so I think it just takes a good writer). I also think it leads to the whole “Molly dilemma” as I like to call it. Both films and books portrayed her similarly which is a protective mother who loves her children unconditionally. But it leads into the whole “Weasley” bashing.
