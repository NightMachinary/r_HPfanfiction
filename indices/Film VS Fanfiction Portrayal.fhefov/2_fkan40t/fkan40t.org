Ron, I think the hate he gets in fanon is due to his poor characterization in the films and the writer giving all his best lines to Hermione. Not bashing Rupert Grint, I think he is a good actor. Remus was OK, until he disappeared in Harry's 4th year, with all the shit Harry was dealing with he didn't even send him a letter. And trying to abandon his kid and Tonks in DHs doesn't endear him to me. His woe I'm a werewolf is annoying.
