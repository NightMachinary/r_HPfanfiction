I don't think it's entirely the film's fault - I think a good bit of it is from the books. IMO, it comes from him being the most 'normal' of the trio - where Harry is the protagonist & literal chosen one (not a /huge/ fan of that narrative choice myself) and Hermione is the researcher/genius of the lot, Ron doesn't have any highly visible strengths in that same vein. He's important and great, of course - but of the trio he's the one that seems 'easiest' to replace with a character a writer might be more interested in (eg, Neville, Luna, etc). His actions in not believing Harry a few times stick out - eg, the one in 4th year (despite objectively being a minor spat) stands out as larger due to how it made Harry feel and how it was emphasized in the book.

The films being faster paced did hurt him a bit, IMO - past just giving some of his lines to Hermione, Ron always shone in the more relaxed parts of the books IMO, where his humor was the best fit. Not having as much time to cover the day to day situation - or to convey how Harry feels about finally being included in a family like the Weasleys, or how important his friendship to his best/first friend is - makes Ron take another backseat.

Oh, and of course - Ron ending up with Hermione does exacerbate the issue somewhat, because a lot of people don't see them as a great fit - and obviously, taking a side on the shipping wars is dangerous ;)
