Movie Snape I think is one of the reasons why he's so popular in fandom. And it's not just that Alan Rickman is very charismatic and doesn't look and act half as unpleasant as book Snape, it's also how they changed some scenes to make him look better. PoA, for example -- in books Snape's at his worst when he tries to get two innocent (and he knows that) men killed and loses it so much that he has to be knocked out. But in movies he's a hero who shields the kids from werewolf with his own body. And it's the later version that I often see fanfic authors use.
