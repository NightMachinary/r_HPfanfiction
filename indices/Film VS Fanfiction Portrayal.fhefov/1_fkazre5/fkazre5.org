First things first: canon, not cannon; fanon, not fannon. I see this so many times I can't help but cringe. Sorry.

Now then, here are some obvious ones I have interpreted from the wider community:

- Films made magic much more simple - fireworks and sparks due to the visual nature of it being more conducive to film as a visual medium. The FB movies are a /bit/ better in this regard, but they sort of also make magic seem much more easy (casting AK like its nothing).
- Snape and Draco are the obvious villanous standouts. Both are portrayed with more charisma while toning down their respective viciousness. Snape's behavior as a teacher comes across more as an overtly strict teacher than as a sadistic jerk, while Draco is portrayed more as a arrogant but popular rich kid than as 'New Money classicist product of nepotism' that he is in the books.
- Sirius is way more sane. I mean, the portrayal in OOTP by Oldman is such a contrast that its almost staggering. And I think that tends to bleed into a lot of fanon.
- Dementors as being physical beings with literal effects on people and the weather. I mean, it looks good in PoA film, but the dementors only affect perception, they don't fly so much as hover, and they certainly don't lift people into the air.
- Ron and Hermione in particular get this treatment. Their respective good qualities (and even memorable lines and moments) ended up being compounded into Hermione while diminishing Ron with their bad qualities. Thats probably the worst one out of everything - that they made the two more caricatures than anything.
