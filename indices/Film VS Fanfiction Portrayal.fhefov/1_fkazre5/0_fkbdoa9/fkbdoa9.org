Mostly agree, but:

-The books represent most spells as fireworks and sparks, the movies didn't create that. As early as Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Malfoy are described as shooting colored lights out of their wands at each other. Some spells aren't described as having them ever (Body Binding Curse), but Rowling seems to have thought it a better choice for her magic (I agree, tbh).

-Its not really easy to see how the portrayal of at least Draco you're asking for is possible. He mostly did act as an arrogant, bigoted rich popular kid until really HBP, where he had to do something himself. He hadn't had much opportunity for much directly vicious before OoTP. All that's left is his petty name calling and bullying before.

-The Dementors are physical beings in the books. I feel like you've flipped it. Yes the film's make them fly (which actually makes more sense with things like them going at Harry on a Quidditch pitch, where people would otherwise outfly them), but the books have them mostly walk around and open doors and such normally (like on the train) instead of using telekinesis to open them and making the air feel cold while not actually lowering the temperature. If anything, the books just have them have less "real" affects on the environment and but as really tall, mysterious hooded figures.
