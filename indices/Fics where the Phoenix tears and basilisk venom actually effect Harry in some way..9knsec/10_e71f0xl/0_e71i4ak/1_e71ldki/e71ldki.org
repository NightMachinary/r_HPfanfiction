I ran into a Star Wars fanfic a few weeks ago that was really a rant that feminism should mean all men should be raped and murdered. She (I'm assuming) then bragged about how she murdered her husband (though she called him a slave owner). There are several "stories" by this account that are basically the same thing in multiple fandoms. I, along with a lot of other people according to the reviews, reported the account and all the stories. Not sure what ended up happening.
