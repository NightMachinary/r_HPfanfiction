Does anyone know the fic where the dragon Harry faces in the TWT was actually a shapeshifting Japanese Princess who he befriended by speaking to her in Parseltongue? And I think Snape gets together with her friend that's a Kitsune?

Honestly prpbably not what you're looking for, OP, since I remember it being a comedy and not taken too seriously, but he does befriend a dragon and your post reminded me of it, just can't remember the name.
