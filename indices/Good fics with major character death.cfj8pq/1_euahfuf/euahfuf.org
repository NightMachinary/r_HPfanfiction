Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles, and things get out of hand pretty quickly. Because when Voldemort is in charge of Al-Qaeda and North Korea and figures out that you can just duplicate fissile material with magic to make as many nukes as you want, you can't expect it to be resolved without a few cities nuked and a few million people dead.
