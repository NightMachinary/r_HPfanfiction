Sound a bit like /Magical Relations/. Duddley get a Hogwarts letter, So Vernon takes Harry and Duddley to get their school supplies (though harry is told he'll have to pay back every pound spent on him). Because of that, Harry never learned about his vault, and asked Filche for a job working with him to earn money to pay Vernon back and buy subsequent school supplies. It's a pretty good read, I'd recommend it.
