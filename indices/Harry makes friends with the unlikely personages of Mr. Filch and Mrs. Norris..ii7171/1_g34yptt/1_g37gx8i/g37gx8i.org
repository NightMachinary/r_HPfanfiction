But how can Filch be the one solving mysteries when he's a caricature of a Scooby-doo villain?

Oh, there's a fic idea. One of those "Dumbledore realizes Harry's being abused" fics where Filch takes him in. To entertain a small child, Filch does mystery games with Harry, who solves them with Mrs. Norris. Harry spends the entire plot of PS thinking the teachers are getting in on the game.
