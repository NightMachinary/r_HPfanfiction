Pretty sure that would've been game over. If the prophecy is to be believed, the only two people who had the power to defeat him are now dead. At the time of the attack on the Potters, Voldemort was winning, and had been eliminating Order members semi frequently. He also had his spies in the Ministry, that ended up getting off after he was gone. It's likely Voldemort would've all but won once he killed Harry and Neville, Dumbledore didn't even know about the horcruxes for sure until Harry's second year. Lily Potter's sacrifice is basically what saved the Wizarding world.

Snape would've remained a Death Eater, because Voldemort did the one thing he asked for, spare Lily. Wormtail would've probably have gotten away with it, and remained in hiding until they overthrew the ministry.
