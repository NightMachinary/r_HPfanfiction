I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge. COMPLETE.\\
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind. It's a oneshot
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] Harry gets adopted by a different Remus, one whose parents abandoned him for being a werewolf so he had to start a life of crime. This is a oneshot.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. Harry is raised by Remus and Severus. It is complete.
- Also by the author of TSLoP (see previous) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter, so he raises himself. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
