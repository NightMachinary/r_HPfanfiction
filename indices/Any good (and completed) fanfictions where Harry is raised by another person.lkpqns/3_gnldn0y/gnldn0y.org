I don't have a lot with Weasley bashing so some of these might contain it and some might not but they are all raising harry/harry eventually gets a family. It's been awhile since I have read some of these. There a couple where the writing might not be great, but the stories were enjoyable - they were included.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555228][Aftermath of Hogwarts]] this one is a little different from the others. It starts after the battle of Hogwarts and has different scenarios. Some are better than others.

This one starts in the Marauders Era and is basically canon up until POA. Sirius doesn't stay in hiding, he gets his freedom and gets custody of Harry [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/61511][A Bond of Family]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1449436][Building Family]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/][Savior of Magic]] this one kind of goes off the rails at one point. Harry is kind of raised by a ghost. Powerful Harry - Ravenclaw Harry - Harry/Daphne

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1989831/chapters/4309809][Raised by Wolves]] - I do remember having some issues with how this was written but I enjoyed the premise.
