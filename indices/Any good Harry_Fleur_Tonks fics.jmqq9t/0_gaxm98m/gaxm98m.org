Most of the fics with Fleur AND Tonks tend to be Coven stories. Not sure why that is. By far the best Tonks story I've come across was one where Tonks is an Unspeakable. Harry Potter and the Summer of Change is the fic. Harry ends up a bit OP... but he earns it. Little bit too much tit grabbing, but it does go with the story. Not that there's anything wrong with (consensual) tit grabbing...

Have you read the big Coven fic? Either the "clean" version or the not so clean, maybe a tiny bit too weird version? The second one is called "Hermione's Furry Problem" I think. Not sure I'm comfortable with a full on recommendation for that one. But I DID read it. So there you go. There were some cool concepts in that story.
