Considering it was made in the 14th century and if the rules of alchemy holds true in the hp universe (Equivalent Exchange) then it wouldn't surprise me if one of the ingredients is a few human souls.

immortality for more than one person + the ability to transmute gold would require quite the sacrifice IMO.

Actually makes me wonder how many people one stone could sustain with eternal life. We know Flamel shared it with his wife, but how many more could he do? Did he design it with his wife in mind?
