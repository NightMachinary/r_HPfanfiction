Gives me this idea.

"The Stone is unique, Dumbledore. Do not take those words to mean little. Uniqueness is one of it's properties. Should another alchemist try using my method, even should they do it perfectly, they will fail. There can only be one Sorcerer's Stone. If the original is destroyed then it could be remade elsewhere which is why I cannot simply break it as you ask. Now you know why I cared so little when my research was illegally publicized. There was never any fear that something would come of it."
