My head Canon is that it is well known how to create one, just that Flamel is the only one skilled enough to successfully make it.

I mean the stone has been around for hundreds of years, surely someone else would have stumbled across how to make one in that time.

I like to think of Felix Filicius in the same vein of thought. It's devilishly tricky to brew but also requires luck (as an ingredient of sorts), hence it's rarity.
