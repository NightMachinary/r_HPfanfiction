I read this great crack fic where Snape became a tailor because Dumbledore caught him testing out the Cutting Curse and that was the first lie he could come up with. Dumbledore in his eagerness to help a fellow wizard with a passion for fashion set him up with some contacts and he couldn't really refuse. Linkffn(13159554)
