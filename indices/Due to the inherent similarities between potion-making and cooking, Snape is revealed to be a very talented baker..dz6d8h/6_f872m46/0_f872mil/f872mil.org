Chapter 2:

"EXPELLIARMUS!!!!!" shouted Harry, with the earsplitting force of 10,000 dragons all roaring at once!

As quickly as it had begun, Harry knew, that with the cupboard door flying off it's hinges and the sound of a thump on the ground intermixed with a short yelp, that the battle was over.

Whoever had been on the other end, was now laid about in a heap near the table, unmoving, yet caked in flour. Harry was frozen in place. He didn't utter a sound.

Seconds ticked by...

A full minute...

Five minutes. Harry started to panic. /Should be enough time. I hope... Oh god! I hope he's not dead./

Harry slowly but steadily crept up to the now prone, flour caked man. He couldn't tell who it was, but it had been around 10 minutes now, and the man hadn't even so much as stirred. Harry was starting to get really worried now.

/Have I actually killed him?!/ He tried to calm himself, but the pounding of his heart wouldn't go away. Knowing that this could back fire horrendously, but still worried about the unmoving mass on the floor, he had to check to see if he was alive. So, hoping the man would forgive him for his actions, pointed his wand at the man and cast a whispered, "E/nervate."/

The man grunted. "Damn whoever it was that interrupted me. I'd almost done it. Perfected the treacle tart into something better than the original."

/Strange/, thought Harry. The man sounded somewhat familiar...

Harry suddenly felt a part of his soul being ripped from him, not unlike how the Avada Kedavra curse would have if Voldemort had hit him it with last year. /Oh Merlin no!/

The man, not noticing the boy, as he thought his eavesdropper had already fled the premises, got up, looked down at his robes, and must have cast a /Scourgify/ on himself as the flour started dropping off in waves.

Harry's heart dropped, and the hope of forgiveness along with it... and what he saw that day would be burned into his mind forever.

Snape.

Conclusion:

"Snape?"

The man in question stilled, and spun around, wand at the ready. He locked eyes with Harry. The air cooled, and time seemed to slow down.

"..."

"..."

Suddenly, Snape /smiled./ Not the usual sneer but a real, genuine looking, smile!

Harry started to tremble as he said, "H-h-hi P-p-professor... F-f-f-f... F-fancy m-meeting you HERE?!"

His voice cracked. His f*cking voice cracked. /God. What have I done to upset you?/

More silence...

Snape shifted suddenly, making Harry jump. He moved out of the way, and gestured to the door with his hand, all the while keeping the smile plastered on his face. He uttered a simple, three words.

"You may go."

Harry didn't need to be told twice. He pushed off, nearly running towards the door. He tripped on a pan, slipped on the flour, but nothing would stop him from reaching that door! Except that as soon as he was near the door, he found he was frozen in place.

Snape was already right behind him, and whispered into his ears, "*/If yOu TeLL aNyone... I WiLL DROWN YOU IN THE DaRkESt PiTS OF THE CASTLE."/*

/"Finite Incantatem..."/

Harry stood there, nearly pissing himself out of sheer fear. In all of his years of fighting Voldemort, in all his years of fighting monsters, he had never come across something as scary as a smiling, but equally furious Severus Snape.

"Leave."

He left the castle and stayed over for the next two weeks in Hagrid's Hut. /Never again/. He told himself.

/Never again./
