Here's a short AU story I came up in the span of an hour. Hope you like. I've never written fanfiction before.

Prologue:

In a world with no house elves, it all started when Dumbledore asked the newly appointed 5th year prefect, Harry to gather some sweets for the headmaster in the kitchens below... If only Dumbledore had picked one of his staff, but noooo it just had to be him.

/Damn my luck/, thought Harry, keeping a brisk pace towards the kitchens. /If only there was a means... or a creature of some sort that wizards could boss around.../ /well whatever... better just get this over with./

Eventually, Harry arrived at the place the headmaster had told him about, near the Hufflepuff common rooms, the long hallway had expanded into an even wider room. To others this would seem to be a dead-end, with a very peculiar set of paintings along the rooms walls. But to Harry, it was the entrance to the Kitchens.

Quickly he cast a quick /lumos/ spell, as the room, lit with torches as it was, was still rather dim, and Harry needed the extra light to find the painting he was looking for. He thus began his small trek to find the portrait.

One would think this is easy, but no, they had to put 14 exact replicas of the painting in the room*. "*Thank Merlin none of my friends were here to see me do this," Harry muttered. /Just think how Ron would react if he saw me down here, near the basement/Hufflepuff common rooms, fondling painted pairs... you know what? I don't want to think about it./

By the 14th replica, Harry was starting to lose his patience. /Damn the person who made this blasted, mind-bending entrance! Damn Dumbledore for sending him here! Damn this neatly stacked bowl of fruit! Damn this--- wait what?/

Next to the 14th replica, off to the side of it, there was a bowl of fruit. Harry stared at it.

And stared.

"..."

He reached out and fondled the pair on top.

The 14th replica's pear turned into a door handle.

"F*ck you." Harry walked through.

Chapter 1:

He was in. The smell of yeast permeated the air and there were a menagerie of kitchen items strewn about the place. The place however, unlike the rest of the castle did not look it's age. It looked brand new, in some ways looking similar to some of the muggle kitchens Harry had briefly seen on the telly before being screamed at by his aunt not to. He ventured forward.

As he made his way around a rather old table which lay in contrast to the rest of his crisp surroundings, he heard the distinct sound of humming. A low, baritone humming. Funny, he'd never heard anyone who's voice matched it. The humming continued, and as he edged closer, he saw a conjoined room, it's door closed but an almost ethereal glow flowing from underneath it.

Suddenly, nearly five feet away from the door now, the humming turned into song. The man singing, sung in a voice as soft as silk, but as powerful and deep as anything he had ever heard before. Harry was enthralled. /Why would anyone with a voice that godly stay and work in a place like this? This doesn't make any sense./

He was now close enough to the door to grab the handle. /Should I do this?/ He wondered? /Well, I've gotten this far. No point in turning back now. Here goes./

He touched the handle.

Immediately he knew he must have tripped a ward as soon as he touched the handle as he heard the distinct sound of the grand singing turn into a growl, with pots and pans clattering to the floor which were then followed by a rather loud and colorful string of words. Words in which if Harry hadn't known any better, would have been interpreted as an incoming spell, been quickly /expelliarmussed,/ and then would have set off a second set of security measures... but alas, this was a kitchen, and the young man entering it knew better.

Instead, as soon as he heard the clattering along the floor, he frantically looked around, locked eyes with the nearest cupboard, and barged his way into it. /This is ironic. For the first time I'm actually willing to stay overnight in a cupboard. Well, home sweet home I guess. I wonder if----/

All thoughts were shattered however, when he heard the door he was near not even 5 seconds ago, slam open! He stayed absolutely still, hoping to the gods above that whoever it was wouldn't come his way. Fate however, had other plans.

Slowly but surely, he came to the realization that footsteps, once quiet were getting louder with every step.

About five steps away, Harry stopped moving.

Four steps, Harry slowed his breathing.

Three steps, Harry stopped his breathing.

Two steps, wand out. His only hope of escape disintegrated. The only way out of this was /through./

One step... His wand was already going through the motions.

The turning of the handle...
