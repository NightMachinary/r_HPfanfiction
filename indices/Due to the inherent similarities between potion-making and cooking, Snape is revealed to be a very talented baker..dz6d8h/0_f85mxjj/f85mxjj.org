The Mauraders weren't the only students to find the Hogwarts kitchens. A lonely Slytherin also would often join the house elves for dinner or a snack. And if he would occasionally offer suggestions or new recipes, the elves were happy for the new dishes they could make for their young charges. Severus' recipe for treacle tart would be enjoyed by students for generations to come.
