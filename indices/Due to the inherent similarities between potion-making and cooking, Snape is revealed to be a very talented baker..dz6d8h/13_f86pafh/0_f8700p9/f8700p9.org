Not saying you're wrong in because I agree that Snape would be a dope chef and baker, but I view potions to be pretty similar to baking. While the proportions do matter, how you treat your ingredients will determine your finished product. Take cookie dough for instance, melting the butter will yield a chewier cookie whereas keeping it softened at room temperature will make it more firm/fluffy. Similarly to HBP when Harry crushes the sopophorous bean (totally googled that) rather than chopping it to release more juice. Another example would be how you handle your mix. Coming back to them cookies, if the dough gets overmixed you'll probably get flat, tough cookies or if you pop that baby in the fridge you can get some thicker floof cookies. In HBP adding an opposite stir every so often effected the maturation/development of his potion. This is quite long! If you couldn't tell I'm quite into baking and have spent too much time pretending to be a potions master while sprinkling chocolate chips into dough
