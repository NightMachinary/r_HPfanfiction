In the end, I used a term, then made sure to explain that it differs from canon for anyone who would nitpick that it's incorrect.

I considered it bases covered, someone seemed to object, so I backed it up with links.

I'm not trying to have a debate about the actual use of the terminology itself because I'm not qualified to---I am not British, and I don't have the desire to research it at this time.

It's hard to distinguish whether it's a pure discussion on terms usage or a criticism of how I used them, but I'm hoping it's the former?
