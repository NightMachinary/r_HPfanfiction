Most of the sites I've visited call 'Potions Master' simply the title for being the Potions professor at Hogwarts. I've only ever seen it listed as a qualification in fanfiction.

edit: I think it SHOULD be a more involved process than 'whoever holds X position gets 'Potions Master' as their title,' though.
