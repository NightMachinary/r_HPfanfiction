I don't have a story to suggest, but I am currently writing one where the lead character is both a talented baker and a Potions Master. In the story there is a category of baking where the baker uses potions. The recipes require￼ emotional attunement to a potion, where half goes into the mix and you drink half.

I love the connections between baking and Potions!

Edit: Using the fanon of Potions Master where it's a qualification with a internship as opposed to simply having the job of teaching potions at Hogwarts￼.
