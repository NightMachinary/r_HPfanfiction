From the viewpoint of Lupin I agree with you. Why would he "stalk" the child of a dead friend just because the child lives with close relatives? That would be a bit creepy.

But from the viewpoint of Harry I disagree. He's had a shitty childhood for 10 years, and when he discovers that a very close friend of his father didn't rescue him from the Dursleys I can understand Harry's anger. Harry is also an unreliable narrator, so his anger and disappointment would necessary colour the narrative. The same goes for Dumbledore. He had no reason to check up on Harry, but Harry would of course not accept that.

You're right, but you're wrong.

It doesn't help that Dumbledore admits that he knew Harry would have a bad childhood.
