Thanks for your contribution, you've presented a nice counterpoint.

I'm glad your brother has such close friends. That's awesome. But not all friendships, even good, close friendships, are like that. I'm not sure that we have evidence to suspect that Remus was really that close to the Potters at the time in question.

A situation like this is much clearer. You've been duly appointed and informed of that fact.

As for the Marauders though, I think the fandom assumes a lot about the relationship. Remus was suspected of being a spy and was on the outs with the rest in 1981. I don't think the relationship was very close.
