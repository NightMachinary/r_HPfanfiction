Eh, I don't know. For a time there prior to the end, yes there was tension. But before that we know there were 7 years of very close friendship. We know that Lupin feels gratitude as a debt (as shown in how he deals with Dumbledore) and while there may have been distrust towards him as a possible spy, I don't think he felt the same towards the Potters but would rather still feel gratitude and debt.
