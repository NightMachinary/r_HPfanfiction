See, I feel the opposite. My brother has high school and college friends who would absolutely expect visitation rights with my nephew should the worst happen to my brother and his wife at some point. Similarly, I have a friend who has put me in her will as the one to take her kids should her husband and she die, and she has several living siblings (who are nice people but parent very differently). None of us live particularly dangerous lives. I would imagine that living in immediate peril, one would be even more likely to expect one's friends to protect each other and any children. Especially because the Marauders all had few surviving relatives (that they chose to associate with), their friends would absolutely stand in for family.
