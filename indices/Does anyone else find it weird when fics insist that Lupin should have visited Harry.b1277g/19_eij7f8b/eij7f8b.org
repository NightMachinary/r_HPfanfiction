No, seeing as James, Sirius, and Remus were a tight-knit group. All best friends. He'd probably know that the Dursleys hated magic with a passion. Also I mean Sirius and Remus were like Uncles. Except that Sirius tried to look after Harry as much as possible and Remus was just his third year professor and an order member he knew well. Honestly I think Remus had no self-confidence at all just about.
