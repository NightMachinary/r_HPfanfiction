I read a one-shot that pointed this out and I'm really upset that I can't remember its name.

Basically, Remus showed up on the Dursley's doorstep asking if he could see Harry every once in a while. Petunia says that he either takes Harry now, or never show his face again. She doesn't want any wizards coming into the house and if Remus really cared, he'd take Harry. Remus, knowing that he can't take care of a baby as a werewolf who can barely hold a job, heartbreakingly decides that it's best if leaves Harry, hoping that his aunt and uncle will take care of him.
