Throw in his self-hatred issues, crippling loneliness and depression because of his friends deaths(along with Sirius' imprisonment), and the fact that he's a bloody werewolf with no access to the Wolfsbane potion and you get a guy that should in no way be allowed near a toddler. Lupin was probably suicidal in the years after the war.

Lupin would have known this, though I still think he should've at least checked up on him. I can't really hold it against him too much, considering no one else in the Wizarding World did either.
