Oh, I agree with you there. I'm just saying Remus would've also seen himself as a threat to Harry if he ever went to see him. IIRC the only reason he went to teach at Hogwarts was because Dumbledore promised him a monthly supply of the Wolfsbane potion. Add in all his issues post-Volemort's attack, along with how he himself was turned into a Werewolf and no access to the Wolfsbane potion, you get a guy that is likely terrified of going near kids. I'm just speculating here but that's what I think.
