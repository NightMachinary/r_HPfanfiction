I disagree. In PoA, during one of Remus and Harry's patronus lessons, Harry confesses that he hears Lily's death scream and Remus makes a move as if to touch him, but thinks better of it. I think Remus wanted to hug him, but Harry didn't know of their connection so Remus held back. I definitely think Remus was meant to be an uncle.

I can't find any canon justification for Peter though.
