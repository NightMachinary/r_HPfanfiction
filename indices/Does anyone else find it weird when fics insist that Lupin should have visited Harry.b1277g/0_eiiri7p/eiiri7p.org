In the context of your argument definitely agree. However the bonds between James et Al were described as closer than friends, more like brothers, in which case Remus could be argued to be a surrogate uncle... However canon actually supports your argument, Remus spends majority of Harry's life pre Halloween being suspected of treason and in hiding & isn't visible in Harry's photo album he got from hagrid, so they probably had very little interraction during his toddler years. This I think would justify his decision.
