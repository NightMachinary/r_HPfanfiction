Given Remus's mental state, and the information he had, staying the hell away from Harry was his best choice. He's a bad luck charm and he knows it. Everyone he gets close to dies.

This could also explain him leaving his pregnant wife. He married and impregnated Tonks in a moment of weakness, but came to his senses and tried to correct his mistake by leaving them, in the hopes that they wouldn't suffer the same fate as James, Lily, Sirius, various other early Order members he may have been close to, his mum... What was the death count among his loved ones at that point? Dying quickly in some heroic way was the best use he could think of for his life. He wasn't going to subject young Harry to his bad luck, and he didn't want to subject Tonks and Teddy to it either. After that disastrous professorship when he attacked students in his wolf form, I'm sure he decided to stay away from kids, including his own.
