I wish I had seen this post earlier, but better late than never, I suppose. I only wanted to say that you brought up an interesting point. I know nowadays people don't like it when someone says this is what men think/do and this is what women think/do. But I personally have to admit I might have forgotten Remus is a man. I know that I never imagined men to be very inclined to talk about emotions and personal problems, but that might be because the men I knew certainly didn't, so I really liked your post and other comments. I remember being very surprised when I learned some people seemed almost to hate Remus for not contacting Harry, and then going on a rant about what a wonderful godfather Sirius is for doing the exact opposite in GoF. I was genuinely surprised it was such a huge problem for some fans. Well, maybe they are more observant than me. I find it hard to judge Remus, since I know that my parents friends wouldn't have gone out of their way to be involved in my life. I've seen many comments here where people say that they would expect their friends to be a part of their children's lives, and I was very surprised by this. It seems that here, like in many other cases, our own experience influences our expectations. I also would like to add that Remus doesn't strike me as someone who finds it easy to reach out and I suppose that would be a character flaw, but it's a bit unfair to judge a character for not meeting our own expectations. I mean, we don't know so muchh about their friendship, but we want so much from him. I don't read Harry-centric fics, but it seems that people are so focused on Harry's unhappy childhood that they want to find and punish every single character who in their opinion didn't do what he/she was supposed to do.Though I have to admit that I find it hard to be objective since Remus is my favourite character.
