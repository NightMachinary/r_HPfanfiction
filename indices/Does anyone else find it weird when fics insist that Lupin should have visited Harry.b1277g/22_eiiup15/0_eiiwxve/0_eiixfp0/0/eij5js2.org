I agree.

But also, just because Dumbledore and Snape didn't maintain boundaries, doesn't mean that Remus shouldn't maintain boundaries. Unlike the other two, Remus is shown to be professional and competent as a teacher; it's within character for him to maintain the expected boundaries with minors.

I agree about the letters. It would have been nice, but I don't think there's an obligation. Outside of the narrative, however, I think the simple answer is that JKR forgot about him during the writing of GoF.
