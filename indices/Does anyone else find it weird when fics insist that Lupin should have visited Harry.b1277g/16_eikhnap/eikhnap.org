Hmm, well. I think number one, the Dursley's would've steered all of Harry's Parents relation from him because, as they said in the philosopher's stone, they swore to stamp his magic out of him. (And I'm still unsure if I like the sound of it) Second, Remus would think thrice before showing up at Privet Drive, mostly because he knew Dumbles would disapprove, and he will feel bad about his lycanthropy, third he wouldn't want to alarm Harry if Harry already forgot him. So GUUUYS! Give Remmy some credit, it's not like he didn't want to alright...
