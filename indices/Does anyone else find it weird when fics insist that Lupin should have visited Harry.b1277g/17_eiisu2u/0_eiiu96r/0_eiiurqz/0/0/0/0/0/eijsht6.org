  I think at this point we've kind of hit irreconcilable differences

Could be. It's okay to disagree.

  in your example dialogue, you have to admit he sounds kind of psychopathic
#+end_quote

The example dialogue has an intentional tongue-in-check tone. The tone is meant to reflect off the previous post and help emphasize the point while only using a few words. It's not meant to be taken literally. Obviously that wouldn't be an actual conversation between real human beings after a personal tragedy. The point is that Remus likely found out that Harry was placed with family, and then he tried to move on with his life.

  I don't see why we need to go to either extreme, where he's a doting uncle or Satan incarnate
#+end_quote

I agree. But that just seems to be the tendency in a lot of fanfiction. And then in those fics where the author tries to stay away from the extremes, there's often some sort of awkward (and unwarranted IMHO) apology from Remus to Harry for "never checking up on him." Coming across another such instance on that is what motivated me to make this post to begin with.
