... Okay, I'll admit I might've taken the dialogue a little too seriously there, but... I'll still maintain that while the apology might be awkward, I think Remus did at least owe Harry an explanation for why over the span of eleven years, considering the neglect and abuse he went through, he never did check up on him. Whether it's for a good reason or a bad one. YMMV of course.

BUT I'm coming to the conclusion that debating this from a Watsonian perspective might be pointless... because the real reason why Remus wasn't in the picture until PoA? Was probably because JKR just hadn't invented him yet.
