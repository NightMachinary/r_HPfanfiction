... I mean, I think at this point we've kind of hit irreconcilable differences in how close he was to James and what he owes to Harry, but c'mon dude, in your example dialogue, you have to admit he sounds kind of psychopathic. The guy was one of Remus's best friends for years, he was just brutally murdered, they were all willing to die and kill for each other in the war. I'd expect him to take a little more interest than THAT in the welfare of James's orphaned son--- hell, McGonagall was a lot more concerned about Harry's living arrangements, and she certainly wasn't half as close to any of them.

I don't see why we need to go to either extreme, where he's a doting uncle or Satan incarnate. Maybe Remus tried to maintain contact and Dumbledore told him to remain at arms' length, maybe he was too broken by depression and grief, maybe the Dursleys told him to go kick rocks and he never dared show his face again... there's a lot of potential explanations. I won't necessarily call him a â€˜scumbag' for not whisking Harry away from the Dursleys, by any means, but if he was too wrapped up in his own self-loathing and pain to so much as enquire about Harry's whereabouts or want to make an occasional visit, I'm fine with calling it another example of his cowardice. Part of a long pattern of behavior in his life.
