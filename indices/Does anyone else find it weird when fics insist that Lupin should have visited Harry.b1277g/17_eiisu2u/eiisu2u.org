What if one of your closest friends died, his wife died, literally anybody they knew and trusted who would look after their kid is incapable for some reason, their kid went missing, and your government doesn't have any notable forms of CPS or adoption or anything, and there's very good reason to believe that people are after the kid?

You wouldn't be at all curious to see if the kid ended up somewhere decent?
