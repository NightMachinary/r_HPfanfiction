No Raven I do not. :) My sister's best friend often used to come over and see me and also sometimes even take me to HER house when I was younger to help my sister out with me! She does not do that anymore NOW but she still does visit so yes. :) I think it does depend on what kind of super friendship you have for it to be either weird or totally normal! They are like sisters too and not just best friends.
