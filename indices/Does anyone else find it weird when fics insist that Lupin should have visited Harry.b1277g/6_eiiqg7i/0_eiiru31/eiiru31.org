I agree that it's an easy (if irrational) way to bash Dumbledore (right, the parent's former headmaster who is also a national and international governmental leader as well as the most powerful and likely busiest wizard in the world should /also/ find time to be a social worker. That makes /total/ sense. /sarcasm). But Lupin? Most of the time when I come across it, the author is trying to show Lupin to be sympathetic. He's apologizing for not visiting, and abashedly making excuses like, "He was in a dark place for a long time."

Is it some sort of sympathetic bashing?
