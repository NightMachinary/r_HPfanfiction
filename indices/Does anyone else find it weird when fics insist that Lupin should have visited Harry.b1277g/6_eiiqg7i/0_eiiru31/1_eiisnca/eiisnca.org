It's also often used in fics where Lupin's being cut out of Harry's life because of his dependance of Dumbledore and his adherence to the "don't visit Harry" bullshit. It's bashing fics where Harry is (way too often) an overpowered moron.

In a perfect world (which Rowling's is *not*), Dumbledore would've had nothing to do with Harry's placement of who is allowed to visit. Lupin would've not visited anyway, because there I agree with OP, why the heck would you want to visit the child of your (extremely) good friends unless you are his godfather or otherwise familiar with him? Especially when those friends are murdered by another friend. It would do no one any good. Just brings up bad memories. Especially if you believe that the murderer is also the kid's godfather.
