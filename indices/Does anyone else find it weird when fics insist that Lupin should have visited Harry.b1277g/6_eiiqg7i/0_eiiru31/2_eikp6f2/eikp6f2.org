Though Dumbledore might be busy, he made it his responsibility when he inhumanely dropped off Harry at the Dursleys... So a manipulative or evil Dumbledore actually suits the story... We can remove atleast even 5 mins daily from our resting time to do such a responsibility that whether the child he left was properly taken care of...
