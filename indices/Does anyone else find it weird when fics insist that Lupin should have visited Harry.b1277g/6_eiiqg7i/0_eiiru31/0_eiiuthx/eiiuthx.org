  right, the parent's former headmaster who is also a national and international governmental leader as well as the most powerful and likely busiest wizard in the world should also find time to be a social worker. That makes total sense. /sarcasm)

When you spirit an infant away in the middle of the night and drop them off with no warning and nothing but a note, then leave powerful magic that ensures that nobody can find the kid, I believe you take some significant level of responsibility for what happens to them.

He doesn't need to be a /social worker/. The man can literally teleport and go check to see that the parents aren't, I dunno, beating him or something. Remember, he was specifically warned about what type of people they were by an old friend.

This isn't a huge time investment. Teleport over. Knock on the door. Check out the situation. Teleport home. Ten minutes, maybe thirty, done.
