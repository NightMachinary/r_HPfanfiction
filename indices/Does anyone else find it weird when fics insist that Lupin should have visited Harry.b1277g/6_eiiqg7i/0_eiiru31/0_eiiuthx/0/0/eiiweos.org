Hmm. House elf magic has been shown to be kind of overpowered in some ways. Dobby also apparates in and out of Hogwarts, casts magic without setting of the trace, then deliberately /fools/ the trace. So I'm chalking that one up to OP house elf magic.

The Ministry owled him there, true, so I suppose some people there had to know his location.

I always assumed Sirius reasoned where Harry ended up and went to check, he didn't know.

If he's not hidden, what's the point? Any Death Eater can wait till he's out of the house and kill him.

  Dumbledore left an orphan with his next of kin. That's pretty much the norm in every legal system in the world.

I'm fairly certain that the norm also includes making sure that they're willing and able to take another kid, and I imagine they then follow it up with at least a couple of visits. Particularly if the next of kin are second class citizens.
