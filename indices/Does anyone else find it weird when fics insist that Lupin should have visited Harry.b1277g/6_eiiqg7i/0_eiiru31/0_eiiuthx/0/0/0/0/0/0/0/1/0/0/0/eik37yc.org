  I rather suspect that she kept information about her muggle relatives as hidden as possible except from people who she'd trust keep it to themselves.

It's fine to suspect that. It might be true, and it might not. But there's no evidence for it in the books. To the contrary, reading the books, it seems like everyone simply knows who all the Muggleborns are. They tend to stand out.

  Do you have any proof for your theory?

Harry was never attacked by Death Eaters in his house OR in the surrounding neighborhood of Little Whinging. Also, until Voldemort weakened the protection by taking Harry's blood, I don't think Harry had ever really been harmed by a Death Eater at all. Was he? The only thing I can think of his Peter taking some of his blood in the graveyard - but that was rather minor.

And even after that, is Harry /ever/ directly harmed by a Death Eater beyond something minor? My mind is blanking - I honestly can't think of anything.
