Not necessarily. That could be the case. Or not. When don't really get to see how the charm worked during the years that Harry lived at Number 4 full-time. So it could be interpreted in a whole bunch of ways (and fanfic has done just that). But I don't think that's really the point. It's moreso that the charm isn't useless.

I would posit that Harry was safe at and around Number 4 because of the Blood Protection and also additional reasons, like:

1. Soon after Halloween '81, the Death Eaters were rounded up and put on trial. Those that escaped justice weren't about to jeopardize themselves by going after the Potter baby. It would be hard to claim the Imperious defense when Voldie was already gone.

2. He was firmly in the Muggle world and the wizards were conscious of the Statues of Secrecy.
