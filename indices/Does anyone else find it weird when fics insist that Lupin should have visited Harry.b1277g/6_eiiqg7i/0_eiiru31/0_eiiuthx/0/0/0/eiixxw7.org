Dobby still had to know where to go in order to get there. He was bound to the Malfoys at that time, not to Harry. How would his magic have just told him where the kid was? The magic in HP is often OP, poorly reasoned out, and inconsistent, but Dobby is not a god.

Sirius would still have needed to find out somehow where Harry lived. Assuming you're an adult, do you know where your best friend's wife's siblings live? Do you even know their names?

I think (and I could be wrong) Sirius only even met the Dursleys once - at the Potters' wedding. But after 12 years in a hellish prison, how could he have possibly remembered where Petunia lived?

Nope.

Sirius had to have looked it up somewhere.

  If he's not hidden, what's the point? Any Death Eater can wait till he's out of the house and kill him.

The point is he's protected from Voldemort. Besides, the Death Eaters weren't very active after they were rounded up. Between the trials and the incident at the World Cup, I don't recall that they ever did anything as Death Eaters /per se./
