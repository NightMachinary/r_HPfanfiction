As for Petunia's married name, you figure that out by asking around. Like this:

"You remember Lily Evans?"

"Yeah"

"Did she have a sister?"

"I think so. I remember her talking about a sister."

"You remember the name?"

"Petunia, but she got married so I don't know her last name. But Amelia was at the wedding, ask her, she might know."

And so forth and so forth until you find the information you need.

As for the fanon, there's nothing in the series that proves that the Blood Charm is "utterly useless" unless he's facing Voldemort himself or inside the house at Privet Drive.
