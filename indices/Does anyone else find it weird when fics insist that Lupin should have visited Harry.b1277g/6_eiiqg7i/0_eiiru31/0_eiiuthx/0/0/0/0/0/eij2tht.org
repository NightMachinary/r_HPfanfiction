  The argument you're making is that Harry's location was so publicly known that the #1 most wanted wizard in the country could find out? And you find this to be a more believable possibility?

Then how else did Sirius find the information?

  put his address in the newspaper, then just... prayed? Good luck Harry, try not to die?

I never said that. But it does seem reasonable from what we know that Harry's address is on file at the Ministry. Certainly not in a newspaper, but perhaps, you know, in a phonebook.

As for Dumbledore just wishing Harry good luck, he clearly did more than that - he established a rather strong protection with the Blood Sacrifice. But I don't there there's anything about it that's /secret/. The Blood Sacrifice is not some sort of /Fidelius Charm./
