  But there's no evidence for it in the books.

There's also no evidence that anybody can casually find out where Harry Potter is living, and the idea that they can seems rather absurd to me. I also didn't say that Lily being a muggleborn was any kind of secret.

  Harry was never attacked by Death Eaters in his house OR in the surrounding neighborhood of Little Whinging.

You've already heard my explanation for that.

If Death Eaters were able to find him, but not actually hurt him, you don't think they would have tried? What about Harry's rabid fans - There was nobody willing to come and basically stalk the Boy-Who-Lived? Or someone like Rita Skeeter.

Peter didn't just cut Harry's arm, he used magic to disarm and subdue Harry. I would not call that minor. Barty Crouch Jr. imperius'd him. Snape attacked his mind repeatedly with no issue.
