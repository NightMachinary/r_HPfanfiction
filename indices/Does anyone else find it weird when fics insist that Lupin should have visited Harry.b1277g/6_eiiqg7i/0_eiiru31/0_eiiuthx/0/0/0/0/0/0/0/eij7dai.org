  Unlike most anybody else, he might know that Lily had a sister and what her married name is

Why wouldn't anybody else know this information? There's nothing secret about the fact that Lily had a sister. I think it's reasonable to assume that she told all sorts of people about her family while she was at Hogwarts for seven years. It wouldn't be the kind of information that everyone would know, but a little asking about about Lily Potter could get anyone that info. That certainly wasn't something that only Sirius could have done.

That's a fanon theory, not canon.
