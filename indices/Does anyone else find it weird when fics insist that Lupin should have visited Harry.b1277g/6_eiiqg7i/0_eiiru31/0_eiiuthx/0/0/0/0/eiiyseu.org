The argument you're making is that Harry's location was so publicly known that the #1 most wanted wizard in the country could find out? And you find this to be a more believable possibility?

  The point is he's protected from Voldemort. Besides, the Death Eaters weren't very active after they were rounded up. Between the trials and the incident at the World Cup, I don't recall that they ever did anything as Death Eaters per se.

So Dumbledore dropped Harry off with some muggles, put his address in the newspaper, then just... prayed? Good luck Harry, try not to die?
