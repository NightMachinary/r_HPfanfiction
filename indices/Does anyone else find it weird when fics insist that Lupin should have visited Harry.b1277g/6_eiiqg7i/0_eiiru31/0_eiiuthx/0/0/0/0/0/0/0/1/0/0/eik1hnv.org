This was a time when Lily would be painfully aware of Voldemort and the dangers of simply being muggleborn or a muggle. And she decided to fight against him. I rather suspect that she kept information about her muggle relatives as hidden as possible except from people who she'd trust keep it to themselves.

  As for the fanon, there's nothing in the series that proves that the Blood Charm is "utterly useless" unless he's facing Voldemort himself or inside the house at Privet Drive.

We've got lots of instances of Harry getting quite injured. Do you have any proof for your theory?
