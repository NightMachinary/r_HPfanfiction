It may have been worse, but maybe not. The attitude towards "exonerated" Death Eaters would not have been so lenient so recently after the war - if they had even had a chance to clear their names before Harry gets placed somewhere. It was a different Minister, and Crouch was the head of the DMLE and we know he takes a hard stance against anyone he thinks was associated to Voldemort.

Either way, that still means Dumbledore decided he knew best, and made it happen despite advice to the contrary provided by someone he trusted.

He's not Harry's "magical guardian", but he doesn't hesitate to act like it when he wants to. You don't get to control someone's life like that and not be responsible for their well-being.
