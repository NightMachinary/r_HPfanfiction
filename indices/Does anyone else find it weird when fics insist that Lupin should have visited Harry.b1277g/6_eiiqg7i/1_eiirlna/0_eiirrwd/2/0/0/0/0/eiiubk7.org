Magical Britain has a town sized population, obviously most of the things like where orphans go wouldnt have proper procedure but be done on a case by case basis like with Harry. If anybody in the Ministy had complains they could easily have brought them up against Dumbledore.

​

Also the ministry definitely knew where to find Harry because they knew whom to send letters to when he used magic in book 3, and Dobby knew where he was in book 2. Ron was also aware that he lived with muggles when he met him.
