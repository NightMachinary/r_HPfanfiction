  The letter I'm talking about is the Hogwarts letter. When they realized that the wizards had some way of finding out where Harry slept, he was suddenly upgraded to a proper bedroom (albeit the smallest). This shows they had some awareness that the way they were treating Harry was wrong, and that they didn't want other people (including wizards) to know about it.

Sorry, i misunderstood you then, I thought you were referring to the one in order of the phoenix, but here I also disagree with you, they actually started to treat him worse after he was accepted into Hogwarts. And they only seemed to have changed his room because they didn't want it to match the location on the letter, its the same reason why they kept moving their location.

  In this Dumbledore is correct when he tells Harry that at some level, Petunia did love him. Microscopic though that concern might be.
#+end_quote

No he didn't think she loved him, he even confirms it when Harry says it , but he also says that she still took him in and that is what matters for the charm to work.

  He certainly seemed to be doing a lot to defeat them, that's why so many walked free with the Imperius defense in 81.
#+end_quote

The Imperius defense is still legitimate defense like it was discussed yesterday [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b0mwi0/imperius_curse_defence_is_not_as_weak_as_its_made/][here]], Dumbledore himself had no real way to prove who was lying and who wasn't.

  Even when the situation moves into a secret war after GoF, Dumbledore still expends most of his group's efforts on patrolling Harry's house,

Because he rightfully believed that Harrys life was in danger and he has grown to care for him.

  Even when the situation moves into a secret war after GoF, Dumbledore still expends most of his group's efforts on patrolling Harry's house, and then the Department of Mysteries. There are envoys sent to Werewolf and Giant communities, but very little is shown to us of these, and they result in failure anyway. Dumbledore and his followers were constantly on the back foot, reacting to Voldemort's moves and not making any of their own that we are shown. This... Is not the behaviour you'd expect of a paramilitary organization with a spy in the enemy camp. Snape must have been a terrible spy. Most of the information you see him relaying to Dumbledore revolve around Harry and the prophecy. Not Azkaban, not Amelia Bones or Emily Vance's murders.
#+end_quote

That are only the things Harry becomes aware of, Harry never really found out about the full extent of what the Order did, because Dumbledore didn't want to include him. We can easily assume that they did more than that, because it was Dumbeldores death that stopped Voldemort from taking over the Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had the personal power to defeat large groups of Death Eaters singlehandedly, a spy to identify them and he had in his custody many of their children. Had he been more ruthless, he could have totally decimated their ranks, and made a Ministry takeover much more difficult or even impossibe.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is afraid of taking personally power, and being more ruthless because the last time he tried, he may have killed his sister.

#+begin_quote
  I don't see any sort of attempt to actually attack the Death Eaters at all in any of the books where Dumbledore is alive.
#+end_quote

Because it would be useless while Voldemort was still Immortal, the Death Eaters are no threat without Voldemort, we have seen twice that they immediately loose without him, their entire position of power relies on one man. Killing that man is obviously the goal. Researching Riddle and finding and destroying the Horcruxes is the best thing he could have done to stop Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  his plans that we can see are focused almost myopically on Voldemort
#+end_quote

Because if you defeat Voldemort, the Death Eaters as organization will cease to exist.
