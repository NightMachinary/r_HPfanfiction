Dumbledore knows more about magic than we do, if he as authorial mouthpiece mentions that the only way to keep Harry safe from Voldemort is the bond of blood charm than thats the way it is.

All magic in Harry Potter is not infallible.

Dumbledore had to choose between giving Harry a happy childhood and risk that he is killed by Voldemort a dark wizard more powerful than him or have Harry grow up abused but ensure that he would live.

Surely a abused child is preferable to a dead one.
