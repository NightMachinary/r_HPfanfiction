Bear in mind that Bellatrix and several other death eaters went after the Longbottoms within a few days of Voldemort's fall, proving that even an ancestral manor and the abilities of highly skilled aurors like the Longbottoms was no protection against the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had very little time to make a decision, and his suspicions that most forms of protection wouldn't be enough were proven correct by Bellatrix.

In the face of such danger, trying to protect a baby who was such a huge target would require drastic measures, and Dumbledore flat out said that his priorities were keeping Harry alive above all else- including his happiness. Without the benefit of hindsight, his decision does look like the best of many bad options.
