I disagree with you on one point: at the time in question, Dumbledore had no reliable information from which he could conclude that Harry's upbringing would be abusive. He had Minerva's opinion that the Dursleys weren't nice people, but that's hardly cause to refuse to place a child with his next of kin.

Dumbledore did the best the best he could in a terrible situation, and it's pretty much the same thing that any reasonable person would do as well.

Expect for the whole basket thing - but that's just fairy-tale storytelling.
