  Dumbledore literally mentions that why he did it, his priority was keeping Harry alive and sending him to the Dursleys was the only sure way he knew of.

I know he stated his reasons. I think his reasons are terrible. If one of the greatest wizards, both in terms of power and intelligence, of all time could not come up with a better solution then to leave a child to an abusive household, then the bar for 'great wizard' is far too low.

This is shameful behavior, regardless of what his reasonings are. Genuinely despicable.

Even if he had to leave them there... if there was truly no other way, then he should have directly stepped in to ensure Harry was not abused and neglected.

If I"m a little fiery about this, its because of my real life experiences. I work as a foster parent with DCS and see what really happens to abused and/or neglected children, and it is nasty. It can be hell on Earth, and that is what Harry experienced. In real life, he would come out of that home damaged and in desperate need of therapy.

So I can and will take issue with how he handled the situation and I will criticize the hell out of him for his crap decision.
