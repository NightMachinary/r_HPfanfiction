  You're asking me to accept child abuse. I will not do so.

I am asking you to accept child abuse as preferable to letting a child be murederd.

  s there no other way to make her willing to keep Harry there? Dumbledore could literally add an entire separate wing to the house so that they'd never have to see Harry. He could pay them off. He could provide someone to do all their housework for them, or provide them with any other number of comforts to persuade them.

I think you are underestimating what kind of petty assholes the Dursleys are, they are the kind of people who wouldn't allow Harry to stay with a baby sitter if they thought that he wouldn't have a miserable time there.

Do you really think they would change the way they live for a wizard under any circumstances.

  Or he could simply imply that they will absolutely be killed if Harry was forced to leave. It wouldn't even be a lie, and Petunia seems perfectly understanding of this fact a couple times in the series. Self preservation is a hell of a motivator.

I assume the bond of blood charm wouldn't work if Petunia was deceived into accepting, and the Dursleys weren't of interest in the last war, why would they be know if they have no connection to Harry.

  He's a creative person (supposedly), have him get creative.

Dumbledore's option were magically limited because because the bond of blood charm required the blood relation to be willing, and even more limited be the blood relation is extremely unreasonable.
