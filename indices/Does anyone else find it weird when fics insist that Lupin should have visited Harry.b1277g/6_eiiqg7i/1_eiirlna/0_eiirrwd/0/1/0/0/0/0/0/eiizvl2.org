You're asking me to accept child abuse. I will not do so.

Is there no other way to make her willing to keep Harry there? Dumbledore could literally add an entire separate wing to the house so that they'd never have to see Harry. He could pay them off. He could provide someone to do all their housework for them, or provide them with any other number of comforts to persuade them.

Or he could simply imply that they will absolutely be killed if Harry was forced to leave. It wouldn't even be a lie, and Petunia seems perfectly understanding of this fact a couple times in the series. Self preservation is a hell of a motivator.

He's a creative person (supposedly), have him get creative.
