  Dumbledore was in no position to get them to change their behavior, they were the ones in a position of power, because they knew that Harrys survival depended on their onsent.

The letter I'm talking about is the Hogwarts letter. When they realized that the wizards had some way of finding out where Harry slept, he was suddenly upgraded to a proper bedroom (albeit the smallest). This shows they had some awareness that the way they were treating Harry was wrong, and that they didn't want other people (including wizards) to know about it.

I can see part of this from their perspective. As muggles they're utterly powerless against a hostile wizard, and they don't really know that keeping Harry with them keeps them safe outside of that one letter Dumbledore leaves them. Had he visited later, tried to reassure them or intimidate them, he could have curbed their worst impulses. Canon Dumbledore is a manipulator extraordinaire, and I don't doubt he could have handled them had he bothered to. In HBP when he comes to collect Harry he manages to cow them quite completely, and never do they show any willingness to abandon Harry, Petunia even tries to argue that Harry isn't an adult until 18 (by muggle standards). In this Dumbledore is correct when he tells Harry that at some level, Petunia did love him. Microscopic though that concern might be.

What I am saying is that this concern, this fleeting glimpse of love, could have been marshalled and encouraged instead of how canon turned out.

  And Dumbledore really didn't believe in the Prophecy, he fully attempted to defeat the Death Eaters without Harry ever coming in contact with them

He certainly seemed to be doing a lot to defeat them, that's why so many walked free with the Imperius defense in 81. Dumbledore literally had a spy on the inside who could give him intel on not just deeds but even motives of the various Death Eaters.

Even when the situation moves into a secret war after GoF, Dumbledore still expends most of his group's efforts on patrolling Harry's house, and then the Department of Mysteries. There are envoys sent to Werewolf and Giant communities, but very little is shown to us of these, and they result in failure anyway. Dumbledore and his followers were constantly on the back foot, reacting to Voldemort's moves and not making any of their own that we are shown. This... Is not the behaviour you'd expect of a paramilitary organization with a spy in the enemy camp. Snape must have been a terrible spy. Most of the information you see him relaying to Dumbledore revolve around Harry and the prophecy. Not Azkaban, not Amelia Bones or Emily Vance's murders.

Dumbledore had the personal power to defeat large groups of Death Eaters singlehandedly, a spy to identify them and he had in his custody many of their children. Had he been more ruthless, he could have totally decimated their ranks, and made a Ministry takeover much more difficult or even impossibe. I don't see any sort of attempt to actually attack the Death Eaters at all in any of the books where Dumbledore is alive. Don't get me wrong, a Dumbledore willing to hold children hostage would be completely OOC, but still, his plans that we can see are focused almost myopically on Voldemort. Could you point me to anything that would back up your claim?
