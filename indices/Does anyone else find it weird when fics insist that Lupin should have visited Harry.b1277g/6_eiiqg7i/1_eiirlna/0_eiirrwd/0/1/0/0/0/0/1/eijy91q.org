  And Harry wasn't really neglected, he still had all his needs fulfilled except for a short period during chamber of secrets.

Sorry for the double response, but I circled back through this conversation and it really struck me what you said here: he had his needs fulfilled? If you actually, genuinely believe that, please never have children. They absolutely need love and respect, not to live in a literal closet and know nothing but insults and hate.

I don't think you understand how damaging his circumstances would be if he didn't happen to be on the cover of the book. This is stuff of literal nightmares for children.
