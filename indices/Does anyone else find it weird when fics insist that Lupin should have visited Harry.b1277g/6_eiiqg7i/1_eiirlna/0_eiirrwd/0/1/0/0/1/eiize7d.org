Dumbledore makes the best of two bad decisions, this is canon. It still doesn't absolve him completely, and that is why he apologizes to Harry in canon. People are treating this like it's binary. Dumbledore is either an evil old coot like the bashing fics portray, or a flawless hero.

He could and should have checked on Harry at least once a year. Relying on Arabella Figg is just one more example of Dumbledore relying on a ridiculously incompetent lackey. It would have taken very little input from him to curb the Dursley's worst behaviour, such as housing Harry in a cupboard when there are 2 spare bedrooms upstairs. This is after all the "Chosen One" of prophecy, destined to defeat Voldemort where even he could not.
