The bond of blood charm required the Dursleys to be willing, do you really think they would put up with a wizard telling them how to raise a child. They had no obligation to keep Harry and Dumbledore knew that.

Also Dumbledore doesn't believe in the prophecy, the only reason he even cares about it, is because he knows that Voldemort does.
