  The bond of blood charm required the Dursleys to be willing, do you really think they would put up with a wizard telling them how to raise a child. They had no obligation to keep Harry and Dumbledore knew that.

They certainly changed their behaviour quickly from just a letter being sent. I understand why the Dursleys were never curbed for Doylist reasons, but there are no real Watsonian reasons why they weren't. They are mere muggles in the face of wizards and witches The bond of blood keeps them safe as well, which was the main reason they allowed Harry to stay after 4th, 5th and 6th year. Just being relatives of Harry Potter made them targets, and giving Harry a home, powering the blood protection, was for their benefit too.

  Also Dumbledore doesn't believe in the prophecy, the only reason he even cares about it, is because he knows that Voldemort does.

He certainly does a lot for someone who doesn't believe in the prophecy. This seems like you're pulling at straws. It doesn't matter what Dumbledore believes, he knows that Harry is an important set piece in the coming struggle, and he should have taken more care.
