That part is mostly fanon, the Dursleys dont insult Harry and are not overly hateful, they are just extremely dismisses of him and basically keep reminding him that he is below him or just choose to outright ignore him. They do thing like send him a toothpick or a fifty-pence piece for Christmas, they dont insult him all day.
