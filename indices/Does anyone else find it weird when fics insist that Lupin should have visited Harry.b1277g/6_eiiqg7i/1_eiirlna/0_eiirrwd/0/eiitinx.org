You believe leaving a child unattended on the door step of people who he KNEW would not be kind is not a valid reason to bash Dumbledore?

Edit: the leaving on the doorstep is really minor compared to leaving him on an abusive home. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b1277g/does_anyone_else_find_it_weird_when_fics_insist/eiiwguu/][this comment]] just so I don't have to reply to so many of you.
