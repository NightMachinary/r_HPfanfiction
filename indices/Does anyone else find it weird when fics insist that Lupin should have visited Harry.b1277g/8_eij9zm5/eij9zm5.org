It makes sense that he didn't visit Harry the first 12 years of his life, but after they got close in Harry's third year that seems strange. There is no indication that Remus wrote to Harry or otherwise kept in touch with him at all during 4th year, 5th year (despite when he went to order meetings) or 6th year. That to me is more shitty. By that time he had a relationship with Harry and was no longer his teacher so there is no reason he could not send him a letter every now and then.
