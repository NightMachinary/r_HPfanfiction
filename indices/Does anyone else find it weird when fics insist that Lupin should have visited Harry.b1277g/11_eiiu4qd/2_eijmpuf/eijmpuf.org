  Remus might have asked Dumbledore how Harry was doing or where he was out of duty and Dumbledore probably gave him some cliff notes version that he was fine and with family.

This seems most likely to me. By the time Remus even knew what had happened, Harry had been placed with the Dursleys, Peter had disappeared, and Sirius was already in custody for multiple murders and quickly condemned to a life sentence at Azkaban. It's likely that the first thing Remus would've heard of it is everyone toasting to the now-famous baby Potter as The Boy Who Lived.

I think it's likely that Remus reached out to Dumbledore or McGonagall or perhaps an old school acquaintance to ask after Harry. At this time, there were probably a lot of inquiries about Harry (and any number of other topics related to the Potters), and any insiders would have been careful to keep details quiet, for Harry's safety.

Any response to Remus would've been perfunctory and designed to discourage further inquiry. “Harry is unharmed and in good health; for his own well-being, I will disclose only that he is being brought up within a family and in a safe environment, and everyone involved has requested, and expects, that their privacy be respected.” That would definitely be enough to satisfy Remus that Harry is cared for and convince Remus that he shouldn't try to connect or impose himself in the future.

I'm sure he probably took an interest and kept tabs on mentions of Harry once he resurfaced, and of course he took the opportunity to teach and mentor Harry at Hogwarts. Once the relationship was established he maintained an appropriate role in Harry's life.

I'm not sure what else anyone could ask or expect of him, under the circumstances.
