1) Again I would argue that it's debatable that James and Remus were close after Hogwarts. We know they were good friends between ages 11-18. We don't know what happened to Remus after Hogwarts. We do know that 3 years later there was enough distant that James and Sirius thought Remus to be the spy. Unless Remus promised the Potters to look out for Harry, there's no debt or promise to fulfil there.

2) Your point here is filled with assumptions and influenced by what we as readers know. We don't actually know that “everyone” knew that Lily and her sister didn't get along. I would imagine James knew because he was married to Lily and Severus knew because they were childhood friends and actually knew Petunia. Anyone else knowing is debatable. I read a discussion here a few weeks ago about Remus and Lily's friendship and learned that there was very little evidence in the books that shows they were close. That is pure fanon. He never mentions Lily, and the letter from Lily to Sirius in DH makes no mention of Remus, but mentions Peter. Remus might not have even known that Lily had a sister, never mind the relationship with her. Sirius knew because Lily mentions her in her letter to him in DH. However even Sirius seemed surprised when Harry wanted to leave the Dursley's to live with him in POA.

Furthermore, someone's relationship with their siblings as a child or even as an adult does not impact what kind of guardian they would be for their nieces and nephews. Lily and Petunia did not have to be “best friends” as you put it for Petunia to be a decent guardian. I have a brother who I didn't get along with as a teen and still don't see eye to eye with as an adult. However if something happened to him and I was ever in a position where I was asked to take in a niece or nephew, I would make sure I did the best I could. People can love their nieces and nephews while having a complicated relationship with their siblings. Unfortunately we as readers know that was not the case with Petunia. But we're given all the information, we don't know what information Remus had. My point is that if you're told that your high school friends' orphaned kid is being raised by their sister, it's not unreasonable to assume that's the best place for them.
