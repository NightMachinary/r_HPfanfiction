You can't dismiss an argument for being speculative and then argue based on your own speculation without solid evidence

  We don't actually know that “everyone” knew that Lily and her sister didn't get along.

  Furthermore, someone's relationship with their siblings as a child or even as an adult does not impact what kind of guardian they would be for their nieces and nephews

It does when the reason is magic. See the point above why it would be known in the Potters' friend circle. I mean, that's like one sister hating her half-sister for being black and then expecting her to suddenly like the black child (that example works with any hatred, be it racial, religious or national).
