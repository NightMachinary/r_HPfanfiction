  I agree that it's odd that people insist Lupin should have visited or even taken in Harry.

Those are two very different things. Lupin had no legal obligation towards Harry. That is undebatable. But he had a debt of honour towards Lily and James. Not to adopt their child, but to check in once in a while.

  At 21, if any of my friends had kids and were killed, I would assumed that their extended families would be the best place for the kids.

Only, everyone knew that Lily and her sister did not get along. If they had been best friends as well as sisters, we would not be having that debate since your argument would stand.
