I agree that it's odd that people insist Lupin should have visited or even taken in Harry. He was 21 years old when Lily and James died. I think people forget just how young the Marauders were. At 21, if any of my friends had kids and were killed, I would assumed that their extended families would be the best place for the kids. Unless someone explicitly asked me to raise their kid or something. I don't think Remus has any reason to believe otherwise. Remus might have asked Dumbledore how Harry was doing or where he was out of duty and Dumbledore probably gave him some cliff notes version that he was fine and with family. Remus probably spent the rest of his time extremely depressed and trying to survive.

Also, the Marauders thought Remus was a spy. It's why Peter was secret keeper. I doubt Remus was around much if that's what they believed. It's possible that Remus only met Harry once or twice. It's also possible that he was living with the werewolves as he did in HBP and had little contact with any of them. I think fandom paints a picture that he and James (as adults) were closer than they were. The Marauders might have been close in school and then started drifting apart as adults between the war and adulthood.
