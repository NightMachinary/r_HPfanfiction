I think you've focused a bit too much on that high school analogy. I could easily modify the OP's statement with my own experience to make the same point. For example: the friends I had in my neighborhood growing up. We probably all met when we were 4 or 5 years old. We were friends through primary and secondary school and we hung out basically every day during the summers. A few of us even still live in the same city.

Now we're out of touch with each other and our only interaction is maybe seeing a facebook post that another makes. A couple of them have kids. I've never met them and likely never will.

People grow apart. It happens. There's nothing wrong with that.
