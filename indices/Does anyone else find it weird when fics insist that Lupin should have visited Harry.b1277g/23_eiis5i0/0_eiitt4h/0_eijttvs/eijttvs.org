Except they met at 11. Studied at hogwarts for 7 years. American high school lasts for 4 years starting at the age of 13/14. Quite the difference I'd think. We develop a lot in those years in-between.

Then you remove the aspect of american's going all over the country for college and maybe meeting up with HS friends during summer vacations and such. It's a cultural gap. Smaller distances, mean less likely to fall out of touch. As well as they didn't even got to college or a college equivalent.
