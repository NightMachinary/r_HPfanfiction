I agree. I also think that he'd be terrified of fucking up the Dursleys' already shitty impression of magic. In one of my most recent stories, I wrote that Remus was essentially terrified that if he visited, the Dursleys would find out he was a werewolf and deny Harry any contact with the magical world, and how could he live with himself if his selfishness in wanting to see Harry led to him being denied a chance to go to Hogwarts? Not to mention the fact that Remus was penniless and an outcast. How much shit are we going to drag the guy through?

There are kids I used to babysit whose parents got a divorce and I've never seen them again. People I was best friends with all throughout high school have kids I've never met. I don't feel like having been super close with their parents back then gives me a right to see their kids. Our lives diverged and I'm grateful for Facebook, basically.
