I think calling the police might be a bit extreme, but I do agree that if he showed up out of the blue after two years with no explanation, it would definitely look fishy. However, what about the middle ground where he shows up after a few days or weeks?

Here's my thinking: even if the fanon "honorary uncle" status is overblown, there are two reasons in canon why Remus might want to visit Harry. One is if he fears Harry will be mistreated. And the other is that Remus knows Harry personally and is also his closest remaining link to the magical world, so he would would probably want to see him and would also be a natural point of contact for him.

Remus knows that Lily didn't get along with her sister, but he never met Petunia personally. Even if he did, he probably wouldn't /a priori/ expect Harry to be mistreated--probably less so than Dumbledore or McGonagall, who also never checked up on him. But suppose that he does. He would then ask Dumbledore if maybe someone should check up on Harry (not necessarily himself). Dumbledore would (most plausibly) tell him Petunia would react badly to a visit. If Remus still fears there is trouble, he would probably observe them in secret (objectively creepy, but no one needs to know), and if he does find something amiss, he would tip off a social worker. In this scenario, there is no need to visit in person until that is resolved.

Option 2, that Remus just wants to see Harry and provide support, has two possibilities. First, if Remus decides to step in right away, he might then visit directly. The sensible way to break the ice would be to talk to Petunia and say, "I'm very sorry about your sister; this must be very hard for you; I was a friend of hers. I know you're not very comfortable around magic, so if there's anything you need help with in dealing with the magical world, I wanted to let you know you can contact me."

This probably gets the door slammed in his face. In fact, this could well have happened in canon, and Harry would never have known.

On the other hand, if Remus chickens out of visiting, but wants to reestablish contact after a couple years, the sensible thing to do would be to write a letter. This would be regarded much less suspiciously than a visit. If Petunia is smart, she would politely reply to say she doesn't want any contact with the magical world, and Remus would respect her wishes. He would probably assume, like Hagrid, that the Dursleys at least told Harry about magic, so there's no worry there.

If, on the other hand, Petunia is /not/ smart, she doesn't reply to his letter. Given Remus's character, he would probably try a second letter, and if there were no reply to that, he would ask Dumbledore if everything is okay. Return to Option 1.

So, I think you're half-right. There aren't a lot of reasons for Remus to visit Harry; there are some that would make sense, but it would almost certainly not be the first step.
