I don't think Dumbledore was inclined to pass any letters or messages onto Harry though. I think he actually quite appreciated the benefits of keeping Harry isolated in the Muggle world and unaware of his background and the circumstances of his parents' death. Harry spent his early years as a Muggle, and got to start out in the wizarding world without any preconceived notions about magic or his identity, and I think it was very, very important to Dumbledore that Harry have those experiences.

Given that, I think Dumbledore would do what he could to discourage or prevent the formation of any connections between Harry and the magical world, at least prior to Harry's 11th birthday. Dumbledore knew or should have known to expect that Petunia Evans Dursley wasn't going to be raising Harry with a ton of warmth or an open-minded view on magic or the extraordinary (or at least, it was well within his power to keep tabs on that, and I have to believe at least Minerva was checking in). And if Dumbledore thought it was important for Harry to have a connection to magic or his parents' friends, then Dumbledore could have and probably would have facilitated that. But he didn't, despite his position of knowledge and influence, and from that I can only assume that Dumbledore thought the status quo was acceptable.

Maybe Petunia didn't specifically ask him to lock down all communications, but I think it's almost certain that Dumbledore did just that (either for his own purposes, and also because he likely realized Petunia would want it that way). The Hogwarts letter was the very first piece of mail of any kind that Harry ever received, and the books are very clear on that.

And regardless, Remus was never going to be Harry's guardian or caretaker. For one thing, he wasn't nearly as close to Harry's parents as Sirius, so his taking custody of Harry was probably never something he contemplated. For another, he was a friendless, unemployable 21yo lycanthrope whose condition made him unwelcome in polite society and suspect as a possible Death Eater sympathizer. He would not have considered himself a suitable parent (let alone single parent) and he would have been right about that, under those particular circumstances.

A more interesting question would be what would've happened if Sirius wasn't sent to Azkaban. I think Sirius would have been much more insistent on raising Harry, and Dumbledore would've had a hard time keeping Sirius away.
