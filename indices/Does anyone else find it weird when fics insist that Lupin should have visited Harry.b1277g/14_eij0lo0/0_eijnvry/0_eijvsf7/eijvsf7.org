Harry's mail was almost certainly screened or blocked, but I'm not convinced he would have been unreachable. I feel like he almost certainly /wouldn't/ have been by muggle post. At worst, Remus would have to ask Dumbledore to pass on a message.

However, I doubt Petunia ever directly expressed her wishes not to be contacted. "Remember my last" was the letter Dumbledore left with Harry, so it would have been a response to that letter. It's possible that Petunia did reply to it. It's even possible that she had to give written consent to seal the +blood wards+ bond of blood charm, but I doubt it. I was under the impression that Petunia's intent in taking Harry into the house and not driving him straight to an orphanage was enough, and that she never attempted to contact Dumbledore after that.
