I doubt it was possible for anyone expect maybe Dumbledore (and possibly the Ministry) to contact Harry or the Dursleys at Privet Drive, particularly before Harry started Hogwarts.

Given all the protections placed on Harry, the Dursleys, and the house, I doubt Dumbledore would've left open the possibility for just anyone to be able to find them or send them mail, even if they knew where they lived. Imagine the fan mail, hate mail, solicitations, and other correspondence he might have gotten --- it would've been overwhelming, and probably unsafe. Even well-meaning notes from genuine acquaintances of the Potters would have been confusing and painful to Harry, who would have had no way to verify the contents of the notes or the identity of the sender.

I think it's also likely that Petunia may have established expectations with Dumbledore at some point, or otherwise made it known that she would only begrudgingly accept Harry into the home, and /only/ if any and all magical freaks stayed well away from them. Given Dumbledore's desire to keep Harry hidden, I'm sure he was only too happy to oblige. After all, that would shield Harry from any potential threats, and also prevent him from hearing any “unauthorized” versions of significant events from anyone other than Dumbledore.

It's also pretty likely that Harry's mail was screened at Hogwarts, to prevent strangers from bombarding him with mail while at school.

All this to say, it's not like Remus would have the option to just write to the Dursleys or show up at their doorstep to see Harry. Once he was informed that Harry was living with a family in an undisclosed private location, he didn't really have a choice but to wait it out until he had the chance to meet Harry in an appropriate setting.
