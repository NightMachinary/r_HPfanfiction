We readers know the Dursleys were horrible to Harry. Lupin doesn't. If he had known, he should have acted. But he doesn't and since Dumbledore is supposed to be watching over, it's reasonable for Lupin to think Harry is well enough. On top, he has open mental wounds about that time of his life and may be looking forward to put all that behind him. What's in it for him other than pain?
