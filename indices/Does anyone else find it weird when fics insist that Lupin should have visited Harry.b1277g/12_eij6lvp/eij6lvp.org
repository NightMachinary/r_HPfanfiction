It depends: From an adult/mature point of view, Remus had plenty of reason he did not, could not, didn't want to do so.

From an angsty teenager point of view? Fuck you Moony, you never even TRIED to see me! You could have found out I was being emotionally and physically abused and helped put a stop to it!

So... depends on what you are going for, what type of Harry.
