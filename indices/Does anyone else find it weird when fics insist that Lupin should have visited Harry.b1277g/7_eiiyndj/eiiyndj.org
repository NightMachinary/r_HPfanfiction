... I think you're viewing this through a very contemporary lens. The Marauders weren't high school friends who drifted apart when they all went to separate colleges--- they were like brothers. They fought in a war together. Sirius was Harry's godfather. How could it possibly be creepy for Remus to be involved in Harry's life? I don't think it'd be the slightest bit creepy even in the real world.

I don't even really want to condemn Remus for never visiting him--- I doubt Dumbledore would've divulged the location for Harry's safety, and I'm not inclined to judge a grieving twenty-year-old for not stepping up to be a responsible parent--- and I agree that the whole â€˜Uncle Remus' thing is pure fanon, but come on. These guys didn't play on the same soccer team here, they were willing to die for each other.
