I think Lupin is crapped on because cowardliness is his worst trait, and it taints some of the most emotional moments he has with Harry. It's not that he doesn't visit Harry at the Dursleys that makes him come off as a "bad" person, but the way that he /knows/ James and Lily died when Harry was too young to remember them, and when he has a chance to tell Harry about it, he chickens out. From Harry's PoV, we know his parents are his heart's greatest desire, and to have memories of them intentionally withheld from him creates an instinctive emotional kneejerk response in the reader.

  ‘I heard my dad,' Harry mumbled. ‘That's the first time I've ever heard him---he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it ...'

  Harry suddenly realised that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.

  ‘You heard James?' said Lupin, in a strange voice.

  ‘Yeah ...' Face dry, Harry looked up. ‘Why---you didn't know my dad, did you?'

  ‘I---I did, as a matter of fact,' said Lupin. ‘We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry---perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.'
