He also runs out on his newly pregnant wife. And doesnt tell Dumbledore about Sirius being an animagus because he thought Dumbledore would kick him out. He kept the secret of a murderer known to be after a child, known to have snuck into the school, and attacked another child...he had many opportunities to tell Dumbledore, but he didnt to protect himself.

I love remus, hes one of my favorite characters. But there is more than one kind of bravery - throwing your life against death eaters is one. Putting your emotions out there, admitting your faults...that's another.
