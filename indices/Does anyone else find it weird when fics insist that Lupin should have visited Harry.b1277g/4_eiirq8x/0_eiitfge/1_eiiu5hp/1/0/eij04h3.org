The pretty heavy implication there wasn't that Remus weighed his two options and made the agonizing decision to leave his wife behind for the greater good--- it's that he'd completely lost his shit and wanted to run away from the consequences of impregnating Tonks, for the more glamorous prospect of joining the Horcrux quest. Even seventeen-year-old Harry (not exactly a paragon of self-control) was mature enough to realize that his motives there were far from selfless.

I don't hate Remus or anything, but one of his defining character traits is his cowardice and avoidance of conflict. When shit goes south, he either pretends it's not happening or runs in the opposite direction.

ETA: I actually went back to reread this scene in DH, and it's even worse than I remembered it--- Remus doesn't imply anything, he outright says that he regrets marrying Tonks and that he plans on abandoning her and the baby permanently. â€˜And if by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!' (213) Jesus, no wonder Harry went off on his deadbeat ass.
