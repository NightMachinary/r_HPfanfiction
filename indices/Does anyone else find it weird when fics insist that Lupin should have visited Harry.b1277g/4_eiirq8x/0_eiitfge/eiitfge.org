Is he really that cowardly though? He's a Gryffindor, a member of the Order of the Pheonix, is willing and able to jump in front of a boggart, can stand up to dementors, repeatedly fights the Death Eaters, goes off to try and negotiate with werewolves who hate him, etc. Not very cowardly.

In the example you cited, it reads to me as more like Remus found the whole situation awkward and didn't know how to deal with it. How exactly do you tell a child about their dead parents?
