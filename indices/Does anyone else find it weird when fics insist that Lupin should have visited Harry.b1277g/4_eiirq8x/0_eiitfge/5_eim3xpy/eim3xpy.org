I think there are two incidents that can be pointed to to indicate that, to at least a certain extent, cowardice is a character fault that Lupin has to deal with.

First, his own words, in which he admits that, out of cowardice, he has refused to provide Dumbledore with valuable information as to how Sirius - a suspected(if never convicted) traitor and mass murderer, is entering the castle. Of course, he is innocent of both crimes, but Lupin has no way of knowing that.

Second, his attempt a few years later to run off with Harry, Ron and Hermione, abandoning his wife - who, at the time, was pregnant with their son. Harry rightly calls him out on this, and he does go home eventually.
