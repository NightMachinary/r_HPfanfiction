He doesn't make any decision, as opposed to making the decision to do nothing. Being a coward is bowing to fear, and Lupin definitely does that. He's afraid of reaching out to Harry, of choosing between Sirius and Dumbledore, etc. He lets that fear make choices for him. Lupin believes Dumbledore to be THE good man, who is in a position of power, potentially able to help Sirius if his innocence is proven.

On either side of the fence, guilty or not, Lupin SHOULD have gone to Dumbledore with the information. If Sirius is innocent, a real chance of proving it arrives. If Sirius is guilty, Dumbledore wraps up the situation nicely.

Honestly, despite whatever lingering friendship Lupin felt with Sirius, it was 15 or so years since Hogwarts, and 13~ years since he'd last seen Sirius. And with him in Azkaban the whole time and with the implication Lupin believed the official story, it starts looking like Lupin is aiding and abetting a fugitive by withholding information. But either he's /too scared/ to turn in Sirius, or he's on the decision making level of a sponge.
