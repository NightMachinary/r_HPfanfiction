Guilt-ridden is a trait I agree with.

But I still disagree with cowardliness. Lupin might see himself as a coward, but that doesn't actually mean he is one. Courage and bravery are traits that are most often recognized in a person by others. Heroes say things like, "I was scared the whole time." A person can easily think that they're a coward when they're really not.

I don't think Lupin withheld information about Sirius because he was a coward, but rather because he was conflicted about how to deal with the situation. That's not cowardice.
