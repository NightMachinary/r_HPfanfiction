  Heroes say things like, "I was scared the whole time." A person can easily think that they're a coward when they're really not.

sure. but his claim corresponds with his actions. at that point, it's your interpretation of his own behaviour vs. his own description of how he feels. the 'i was scared the whole time' trope is usually used when they do something heroic anyway, despite feeling fear. remus doesn't 'do it anyway'
