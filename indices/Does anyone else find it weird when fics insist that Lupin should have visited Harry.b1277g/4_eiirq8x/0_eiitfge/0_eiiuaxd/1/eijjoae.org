  Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. â€˜All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly.'

I don't think this was just cowardice though. Lupin might see it that way himself, but he's frequently self-critical, especially in relation to his judgment when it comes to his school friends.

If Lupin was afraid of Sirius Black, it would have been easy for him to take that Animagus information to Dumbledore and the Ministry. A more cowardly man would have done this immediately, and slept easier knowing that Sirius had no secret dog form to sustain his fugitive lifestyle.

As you point out, it came down to friendship. On some level, Lupin must have still had some faith in Sirius's innocence, or at least Lupin was unconvinced that Sirius presented a threat to Harry and other innocents. If I was certain a dear friend had committed horrible acts of betrayal, violence, and murder, I wouldn't hesitate to turn that person in. Lupin didn't do that, because the friendship they once shared left him doubtful as to Sirius's guilt and/or the justice of his sentence. That takes trust, loyalty, and to an extent, even bravery. In this case, Lupin's faith was well placed.

Notably, Lupin was immediately prepared to kill, incapacitate, and/or turn in Pettigrew to the Dementors, on first sight, and without hesitation or remorse, so it's not like he wasn't capable of standing against an old friend, provided that friend was actually guilty.
