Nope I still think it's bullshit. I know two separate men who, after their friends died, they kept in touch with their dead friends kids. Helped the mom out when she needed it, monetarily and spending time with the kids.

Men can have deep and meaningful friendships with other men. I can name 3 or 4 friends of my husband off the top of my head, that if he (or both of us) died tomorrow they would be involved in my kids lives.
