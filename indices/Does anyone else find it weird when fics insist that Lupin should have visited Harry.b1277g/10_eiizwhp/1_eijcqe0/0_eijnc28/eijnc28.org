I also read your edit, and I still think you are just looking at shallow, face value friendship. It's not “feminine” to have a friendship based in feelings. I know plenty of macho, “men's men” who talk to each other about their lives, their families, and their problems. I actually feel kind of sorry that you look at friendships the way you do.
