  I wouldn't call anyone I had a 'guy friendship' with my friend, much less my BEST friend, if we didn't talk about feelings or our personal lives--- if all we do is hang out together and our relationship is just about performing a certain activity, IMO that's an acquaintance at best.

  the Marauders... weren't linked by a mutual love of pranking, and that seems like a major oversimplification to me.

I think you're illustrating my point about male vs female friendships rather well. In my experience, women are often confused about the way men "do" friendship. I can see how you might think a male friendship was nothing but an acquaintanceship. But that's just how guys work. For example, a typical conversation a man might have with his wife/girlfriend/mother/sister/other female figure in his life after hanging out with his friends might go something like this:

Woman: How does Bill like about his new house?

Man: Fine I guess, I don't really know.

Woman: What do you mean you don't know? He's your best friend! You were together for hours!

Man: It didn't come up.

Woman: How could it not come up? What were you talking about?

Man: Umm... the best strategies for surviving a zombie-spider apocalypse.

Woman: /Stares at the man as if he's crazy./

Man: /Wonders why the woman is upset./

I've had plenty of great friendships with other guys. Men I'd easily call "best friends." Guys that I would readily entrust with my life. Heck, I have entrusted one with my life as I've appointed him my medical power of attorney. I saw one of my best friends from school for the first time in a couple years this past summer and we spent the whole time playing video games, drinking beer, and cracking jokes. I've never once had a conversation with any of them about our feelings. Nor have I had such a conversation with my actual brothers. Most guys don't do that.

As for the bonds that develop through experiencing war together, etc., that obviously makes something very strong, and while I can't personally speak to such a friendship, I highly doubt that it would result in something that would resemble a female friendship among men. I simply can't see that happening. Guys don't work like that.

James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter were men, and from the glimpses we were given in canon, it seemed like they had a pretty typical male friendship.

  Sorry for the frigging novella, I got a little overexcited.

No worries there. It's an interesting discussion.
