I understand your perspective better now that I've read it, and I suspected that gender might be playing a role in the disconnect here... I found it interesting to read your POV, but I still just don't think your conclusion applies to Remus and the Marauders exactly.

At least in my mind, I wouldn't call anyone I had a 'guy friendship' with my friend, much less my BEST friend, if we didn't talk about feelings or our personal lives--- if all we do is hang out together and our relationship is just about performing a certain activity, IMO that's an acquaintance at best. Of course, I'm approaching this from a female point of view, so you might feel differently.

But even putting all that aside, the Marauders... weren't linked by a mutual love of pranking, and that seems like a major oversimplification to me. That might've been the beginning of their friendship, and I do believe that the group was sort of more the JamesandSirius show, with Remus and Peter somewhat on the outside of their inner circle, but they were all very tight even during their Hogwarts days (I believe McGonagall outright described James and Sirius as being like brothers in PoA).

And by 1981, they were all fighting in a devastating war together; they weren't exactly drinking buddies who'd drifted apart since their schooldays. Sirius was Harry's godfather, James's first choice as secret-keeper, and the best man at his wedding; I'm pretty sure he, Remus, and Peter regularly visited the Potters in hiding and saw the kid. I'll buy that towards the end of Lily and James's lives, there was a lot of tension and suspicion between Remus and Sirius, but Sirius snarls in the Shrieking Shack that Peter should've chosen to die before betraying his friends, like any of them would've done for him. That's evidence of a very close emotional bond between them all--- would James have trusted Sirius and Peter with his family's lives otherwise? Would Peter's defection have been nearly as devastating?

I actually agree with some of what you're saying here--- I think James was by far the closest to Sirius--- but I'd still say Remus was one of his friends, and in the 'female' sense. I think you're applying your personal experiences to what was, canonically, a much deeper and more serious bond between four soldiers in wartime. I don't even want to condemn Remus for not playing a greater role in Harry's life (he was grieving, his world was in shambles, and I doubt Dumbledore would've allowed it), but your argument that it would be inappropriate or outright creepy for him to have? I just can't get behind that.

(Sorry for the frigging novella, I got a little overexcited.)
