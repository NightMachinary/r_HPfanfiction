  Are you also a Wizard?

The last time I checked, I was not a wizard.

  and possibly the only living link to the Magical World (and the world of the parents) for the child in question?
#+end_quote

I'm not the last link to anything. Neither was Remus. There were plenty of other links to the magical world - Minerva, Hagrid, and even Mrs. Figg who was living right next door.

#+begin_quote
  Is also the Godfather of the kid in question in prison and suspected of murdering the parents?
#+end_quote

The godfather being in prison does not give any rights or obligations to the friends of a child's deceased parents. If the parent's chosen guardian for the child is unable to fulfill that role, it is perfectly reasonable for the child to then be placed with the next of kin.

#+begin_quote
  Are you also aware that your friends had a bad relationship with their remaining relatives that aren't dead?
#+end_quote

Was Remus aware of that? Even if he was, suspicion is not sufficient ground for him to barge into someone's house and demand answers.

#+begin_quote
  If I were the Dursleys (aka not an asshole and wanting the best for the kid) I'd be ecstatic about an old friend of his parents showing up and wanting to become some kind honorary uncle.
#+end_quote

So, if a strange adult that you didn't know showed up at your door, spun some story about having gone to school with your 3 year-old adopted son's parents, and then asked to spend time with the kid, you'd be perfectly fine with that? You wouldn't be weirded out? You'd just say, "Great!"? That's scary.
