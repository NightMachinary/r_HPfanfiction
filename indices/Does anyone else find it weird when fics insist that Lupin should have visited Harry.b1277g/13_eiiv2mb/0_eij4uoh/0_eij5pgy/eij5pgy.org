  Minerva, Hagrid, and even Mrs. Figg who was living right next door.

A teacher (who likes to distance herself from her students), their school's groundkeeper (were they even friends? honest non-rhetorical question), and... a crazy squib cat lady?

  Was Remus aware of that? Even if he was, suspicion is not sufficient ground for him to barge into someone's house and demand answers.

I assume there was a wedding and some kind of birth celebration of Harry. It would have come up.

  So, if a strange adult that you didn't know showed up at your door, spun some story about having gone to school with your 3 year-old adopted son's parents, and then asked to spend time with the kid, you'd be perfectly fine with that? You wouldn't be weirded out? You'd just say, "Great!"?

It's dead simple to verify their story. No blind trust is necessary. And again, if I cared about the kid (your argument hinges on the fact that the Dursleys would care about Harry's well being and not being raped by stranger danger) I'd probably be not an asshole and know one of their closest friends or more realistically would have reached out on my own to the guy.

And in the actual scenario of Harry Potter, if he were an evil wizard, he wouldn't have to ask. He's not a vampire.
