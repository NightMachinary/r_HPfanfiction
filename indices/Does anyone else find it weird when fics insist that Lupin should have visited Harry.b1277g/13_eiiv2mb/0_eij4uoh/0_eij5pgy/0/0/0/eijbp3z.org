  You wouldn't notice the loud and obnoxious presence of the Dursleys making an ass of themselves among all the freaks? Or you wouldn't notice the absence of any family of Lily's?

There are no given details about what the Potter's wedding was like. For all we know, the Dursleys might have sat in the corner quietly and then left early.

  Not to mention that best friends are usually involved in the planning of the wedding in some way.

In my experience, it's normally the bride and her friends that are involved in planning the wedding like that. The guys don't often do that. There can be exceptions to that, sure, but exceptions are just that: exceptions. I have a hard time seeing James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter sitting around with Lily and her friends, picking out place settings. The guys were probably off somewhere else, drinking beer and planning pranks.

  No I understand, your point in question was to isolate the scenario entirely from Wizards, Muggles and Harry Potter. My point is that this makes little sense.

My point is to ground the actions of the characters in the way that real human beings act. The fact that the characters in HP can wave sticks that make pretty colors does not change the fact that we as readers can relate to them because they act according to human nature. The fact that Remus is a wizard doesn't really change the scenario.
