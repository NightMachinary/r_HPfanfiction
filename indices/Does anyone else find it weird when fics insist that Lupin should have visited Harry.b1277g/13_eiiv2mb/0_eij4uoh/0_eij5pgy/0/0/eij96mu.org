  How about a blood-thirsty werewolf?

Absolutely true! Beggars can't be choosers. Lupin is sadly the best of the bunch. He certainly wouldn't be my first, second or third choice.

  I've been to the weddings and other significant events of several friends. I did not garner any intimate details about their inner family relationships from those events.

You wouldn't notice the loud and obnoxious presence of the Dursleys making an ass of themselves among all the freaks? Or you wouldn't notice the absence of any family of Lily's?

Not to mention that best friends are usually involved in the planning of the wedding in some way. I imagine Sirius and Remus hanging out quite a lot at Godric's Hollow or wherever Lily and James lived after school.

It would've come up.

  True, but I'm not sure what this has to do with the point in question.

No I understand, your point in question was to isolate the scenario entirely from Wizards, Muggles and Harry Potter. My point is that this makes little sense.
