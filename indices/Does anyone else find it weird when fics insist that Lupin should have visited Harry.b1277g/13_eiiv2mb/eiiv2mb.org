  I'm a grown man and I have several close friends who have young children. But if, God forbid, something were to happen to my friends and their children went off to live with their relatives

Are you also a Wizard and possibly the only living link to the Magical World (and the world of the parents) for the child in question?

Is also the Godfather of the kid in question in prison and suspected of murdering the parents?

Are you also aware that your friends had a bad relationship with their remaining relatives that aren't dead?

I could go on, but I think it's clear what I mean...

I feel like any analogy between the fantastical situation in Harry Potter and a "real world" best friend doesn't hold up at all and I'd frankly be surprised if you wouldn't feel some minor responsibilities towards Harry Potter - The Boy Who Lived, who is now an orphan and living with Muggles if you were in Lupin's shoes.

  I would be very suspicious of any of my hypothetically deceased siblings' friends that showed up at my door looking to visit with a 3 year-old. I'd probably slam the door and call the police.

Also I find this very strange behaviour, but some people are really paranoid about their children. If I were the Dursleys (aka not an asshole and wanting the best for the kid) I'd be ecstatic about an old friend of his parents showing up and wanting to become some kind honorary uncle. If not for anything else than just him being able to tell Harry about his parents.
