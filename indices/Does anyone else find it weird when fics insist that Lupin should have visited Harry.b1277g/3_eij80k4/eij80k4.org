Well, I'm not a British wizard lycanthrope living in the 1980s, so take this with a pinch of salt. I would absolutely visit my deceased friend's children, or at least send presents, with some way to ensure it reached them. Adopt them? No. Visit at least once, maybe send gifts ? Yes.

But in the culture I come from, close friends are supposed to "keep an eye" on each others' children. Parents' close friends are often called "uncle" or "aunt", and sometimes give gifts at Christmas. Many of my peers have stories of truancy or some other illicit teenage adventure getting interrupted by an "uncle or aunt" yelling at them and threatening to tell their parents. I can see that it's clearly not the cultural norm where you're from. I think it's important to note Harry Potter is a global phenomenon, with fans and readers from around the world and not just the US and Britain.
