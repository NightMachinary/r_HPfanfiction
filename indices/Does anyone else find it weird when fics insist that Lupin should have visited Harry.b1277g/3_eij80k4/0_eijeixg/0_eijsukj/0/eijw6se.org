  Calling a close friendship "female oriented" sounds pretty insulting of men, as if we can't form close friendships, and if we do, we're acting outside our gender.

That's not what I was saying. I was saying that there are different types of close friendships. Then I gave two examples of general types to help show the distinction. And I also said, "Now this obviously doesn't hold for all cases, there are always exceptions... Neither form of friendship is better than the other, they're simply different. Also, there will, of course be men who gravitate more to the female type of friendship and vice versa." I never said that one type of friendship was better than the other, or that if men had "feminine" elements in their friendships that there was something wrong.

I also don't think that there's anything insulting about men expressing something feminine. If someone thinks that's an insult, that's for them to deal with.

The fact is that we don't know a whole lot about the friendship between James et al. It isn't shown in canon. I think that it's highly likely that they were pranking buddies. And that does not exclude the possibility of their being close friends of that type.

Furthermore, I think that to say that all close friendships must be built upon sharing feelings and relationships and cannot be built upon sharing common interests is a rejection of the lived experience of many people in the world. It's telling people, "Your friendship doesn't fit my model. Therefore it is not really friendship."

I've proposed two models of close friendship based upon the natural division of humanity into male and female and the differences that are often (but not always) exhibited by each. The distinction, as I mentioned, is not absolute - there might very well be gradations. There could be more divisions. Someone else might come up with a different method for making the distinction that better speaks to their experience.

Having a close friendship that is based upon shared activities and not based on sharing emotions does not make it a lesser friendship. The bonds can be every bit as strong - just with a different focus. The individuals therein will know different things about the other.

As for Peter, I would think he would be guilt-ridden after betraying a friendship of either type. I know I that if I was betrayed by one of the guys I've been playing D&D with for years it would be absolutely horrible.

(And there's also the whole Life-Debt thing that JKR almost forgot about...)

I can't really speak to Naruto - it's not something I've ever been into.
