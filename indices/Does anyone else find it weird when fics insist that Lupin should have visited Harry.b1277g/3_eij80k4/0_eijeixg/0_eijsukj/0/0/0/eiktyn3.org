  What I'm disputing is that somehow being "side by side" friends with someone means that you know less about them, and care less about them and their family.
#+end_quote

I don't think I'm saying that. I'm saying that you'd know and care about different things about those friends, not necessarily less about them. It's about difference, not more or less, or better or worse. And those differences will naturally lead to different interactions with the friend's family members.

  What concerns me is that you're making it completely a gender thing when it's clearly also very much a culture thing.
#+end_quote

Gender is simply the tool I used to make the distinction. As I said in my previous response, other methods to make the distinction can be used as well. To me, gender seems to work well for making the distinction between types of friendships that exist within the same culture. If you'd like to broaden the conversation and bring in other cultures, that's great. But I don't think it negates anything I've said - especially as the friendships in question (James et al.) exist within one specific cultural context - Britain in the 1970s and 1980s. But again, if you want to widen the conversation, go for it! What distinctions would you make between types of friendships in another culture?

  Let me try to work through this using my own friends as examples. With my best "bro" friend, I don't know his daughter's... Yet, if I were walking on the street and saw someone bothering them, I would be moved to protect them...

I agree. I'd have the same reaction. But to further the example, if something terrible happened to your "bro friend" (God forbid), and you heard that the child was placed with other family members, would you think there was anything strange with that? Would you be compelled to check up on the child? Would you simply assume that the family had the child's best interests in mind?

  What would constitute a betrayal by your D&D buddy?
#+end_quote

I think you're over-thinking this. Just consider normal friendships and why they might fail. It happens all the time. It doesn't have to be something super dramatic like Peter betraying James to Voldie. People talk about each other behind their backs. Spread lies. Abuse trust for self interest. Steal your girlfriend. Whatever. If one of my "Bro Friends," to use your term, did something like that, I would feel rather betrayed. "Bro Friends" can still be close friends.

  They expected that these men would be willing to die to keep them safe. These are not the actions of men who only spend time with each other to be "pranking buddies".
#+end_quote

Why? What is it about a friendship based upon a simple, common interest that is somehow lesser than being friends based upon shared talking about the details of your personal lives? Why can't my closest, best friend be the guy that I've simply drank beer, played video games, talked current events, and cracked jokes with for 15 years? I've designated one of my friends like that as my medical power of attorney - I trust him to be willing and able to make life and death decisions about me should the need arise. And I think he'd do a great job should the need ever arise. He's one of my closest friends, and it's a great friendship. Yet we've never talked about or feelings and I don't know his sister's name or where she lives, etc. And I don't think the friendship is in any way lesser for that.

  it is strange that Remus, who ostensibly had this same bond with James and Lily, makes so little effort towards Harry in books 4 - 6. Till book 7, then suddenly Harry is the godfather of his child...
#+end_quote

Honestly, I just chalk that up to poor character development by JKR.
