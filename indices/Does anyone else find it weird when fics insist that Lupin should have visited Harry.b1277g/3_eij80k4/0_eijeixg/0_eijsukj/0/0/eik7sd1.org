  Furthermore, I think that to say that all close friendships must be built upon sharing feelings and relationships and cannot be built upon sharing common interests is a rejection of the lived experience of many people in the world. It's telling people, "Your friendship doesn't fit my model. Therefore it is not really friendship."

First of all, you imply in your edit that because they are "prankster buddies", that James' family and what happens to them is somehow less important to his friends than if they had a more "female" friendship. What many people, including me, are reacting to, is that what you are portraying is in no way an equal friendship. I understand that there's "side by side" and "face to face" ways of interacting. What I'm disputing is that somehow being "side by side" friends with someone means that you know less about them, and care less about them and their family.

  I've proposed two models of close friendship based upon the natural division of humanity into male and female and the differences that are often (but not always) exhibited by each. The distinction, as I mentioned, is not absolute - there might very well be gradations. There could be more divisions. Someone else might come up with a different method for making the distinction that better speaks to their experience.

What concerns me is that you're making it completely a gender thing when it's clearly also very much a culture thing. Much of the rituals and stereotypes of contemporary Western male friendship is in reaction to public acceptance of homosexuality in the West. Rewind just 100 years and you'll find correspondence between male friends ("macho" soldiers at that) that's a lot more "female oriented" than what we expect between two straight male friends today.

  Friendships between men are often activity oriented. Men have drinking buddies, or golfing buddies, or D&D buddies, etc. They like hanging out, engaging in an activity that they all enjoy, and having a good time. It can happen that men who are friends often do not know very much about the details of each other's personal lives because that's not actually important to the friendship.

Let me try to work through this using my own friends as examples. With my best "bro" friend, I don't know when his daughter's birthdays are (only remember his because facebook reminds me), I don't know what their favourite cartoons are, or their favourite meal. I don't interact much with them aside from giving them chocolates or small amounts of money when I see them with their Dad. Yet, if I were walking on the street and saw someone bothering them, I would be moved to protect them (even willing to use violence to do so), especially because they're my best friends' daughters.

  As for Peter, I would think he would be guilt-ridden after betraying a friendship of either type. I know I that if I was betrayed by one of the guys I've been playing D&D with for years it would be absolutely horrible.

This made me think. What would constitute a betrayal by your D&D buddy? What do you expect of him and what sort of actions would be considered a betrayal of this? James and Lily both entrusted Sirius and later Peter with their lives and the life of their son. *They expected that these men would be willing to die to keep them safe.* These are not the actions of men who only spend time with each other to be "pranking buddies". There's clearly a strong bond there that goes beyond the scope of just pranks and to other parts of their lives. And that is why it is strange that Remus, who ostensibly had this same bond with James and Lily, makes so little effort towards Harry in books 4 - 6. Till book 7, then suddenly Harry is the godfather of his child and is so important that he offers to abandon his family to help Harry.

To reiterate, I don't think Remus not contacting Harry makes him a bad person. But it definitely highlights his weaknesses and character flaws, and this makes him interesting.
