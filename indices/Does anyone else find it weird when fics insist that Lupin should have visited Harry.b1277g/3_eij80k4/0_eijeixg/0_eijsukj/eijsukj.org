I've seen your edit and I have to say, this sort of gendered projection of friendship seems very culturally derived. Calling a close friendship "female oriented" sounds pretty insulting of men, as if we can't form close friendships, and if we do, we're acting outside our gender. It's like when guys comment on reddit saying things like "I'm a real man and my friends are real men, I could never cry in front of them" and all I can think is that this person needs to get better friends. I have several close guy friends, and if I were emotional about something, I could absolutely cry in front of them. I'd probably get roasted to hell and back if they deemed my reason for being emotional invalid or humorous, but they'd still be there for me in the moment.

The Marauders were more than just "pranking buddies", they were best friends for years from the first year of boarding school till that fateful October night in their early twenties. How do you justify how Remus acts towards Harry in the Deathly Hallows (willing to abandon his wife and unborn child for Harry, making Harry the godfather) without accepting that there is a special bond between them due to his parentage? How do you justify Wormtail's guilt-ridden final moments and how he spares Harry's life? They were in a sense Harry's "uncles", and if it weren't for the war and choices made would have surely spent Harry's childhood spoiling him and bonding with him.

I don't think Remus should be bashed for not making an attempt to contact Harry, he had mountains of his own issues to deal with, but I do think Rowling was leaning on a relationship in Deathly Hallows that she seemingly forgot all about for the majority of the books. And I'm not surprised some fanfic authors picked up on this relationship and interrogated it with a little bit of their own cultural logic to form a picture that's not very flattering of Remus.

Masashi Kishimoto, creator of Naruto, is a lot worse with this. In Part 1, Kakashi is introduced as Naruto's mysterious Sensei. He's a typical shounen teacher, which is to say he's useless and often borderline abusive of the main character (Naruto). He tends to show more attention towards Sasuke, Naruto's rival and the most competent of the three people on Naruto's team. In Part 2, it's revealed that Naruto's father (Minato) was his Sensei, and as Kakashi was an orphan, Minato basically adopted him (anime only I suspect) and doted on him. He introduces these new details to flesh out the character and make him seem cooler, but it has the unintended effect of making Kakashi seem like an incredible asshole. Naruto's childhood is even worse than Harry's, and Kakashi does nothing to help Naruto throughout it, even though he idolized and loved Naruto's parents and they did so much for Kakashi. I think in a long series, details like this are just inevitable, where an author loses sight of a character beat and fanfic authors focus on it with results that seemingly contradict canon.
