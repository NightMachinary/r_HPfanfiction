Almost all of the kids, including Harry, have the same exact child-like British accent to me, give or take a few pitches up or down depending on gender or age. Exceptions include Luna, who I give a fairly high, wispy voice that sounds constantly deep in thought, and Draco, who sounds similar to all the others with a slight poshness to it.

Mcgonagall has a very severe voice, with a barely noticable Scottish inflection, though I admit she only has it when the story points it out or I spontaneously remember that she's Scottish. Snape has a methodical yet drawling voice that sounds just about as greasy as his hair is described in every single HP fic. Dumbledore is straight up the King from Zelda CDI just because of how many times he's said "My boy" to Harry.

Quirrel sounds just as anxious and stuttery as he's described in the books. During the all-so-important Sorcerer's Stone scene, however, his voice is not stuttery at all. Instead, it's thin and angry. Voldemort gets the honor of having the generic evil villain voice, albeit with an added British accent.

Hagrid, Fleur and all of the other foreign students/headmasters with written out accents sound exactly how they read, with respective levels of throatiness depending on whether it's Hagrid or literally anyone else.

Sirius, for whatever reason, has an urgent voice with a middle-pitched General American accent. Sort of like... Solid Snake? I don't know how I conceived of this internal voice, but it's there. Peter (Pettigrew) is somewhat like Quirrel's voice if it was actually his natural tone of voice. If there was a voice that was rat-like, that would be the one for me.

Most of the other adults have generic middle-aged British voices. I may have missed a few, but that's pretty much all for me.
