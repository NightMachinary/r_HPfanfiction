I rely very much on visualization when reading, picturing people, locations, events and what have you. I do sometimes imagine voice (usually movie ones) but far less. For example, I have a consistent picture of teenage SS as a result of reading a lot of Marauder-era SS fics. I do not have a consistent teenage SS voice.
