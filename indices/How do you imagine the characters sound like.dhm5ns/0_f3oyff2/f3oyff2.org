Honestly when reading I personally don't 'hear' the dialogue in my head. But when I do think about it Hermione sounds like a friend of mine doing a slightly pompous British accent, we read fics to each other and her voice just feels right. Other than that the characters really just sound like text to me. (If you are wondering what text sounds like, the answer is nothing.)
