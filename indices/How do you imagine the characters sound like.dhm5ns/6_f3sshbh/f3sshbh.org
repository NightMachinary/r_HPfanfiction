Every character has the same voice to me: a very monotone, robotic, Bristish female voice straight from my Samsung Galaxy's TTS options.

I like listening while driving and audiobooks aren't really a thing for fanfics. But, more seriously, I'll often read things as if someone else is narrating it if I've been listening to someone for a decent length recently. For example, this weekend I binged a bunch of Armoured Skeptic videos on youtube, since I haven't actually watched them before, so currently I hear his voice narrating stuff when I read. Another youtuber this has happened with recently is MauLer.

As for when it's just my normal internal voice and I come up with voices for each of the characters, I really can't think of them off the top of my head. I'd have to be reading something to actually hear it, and I don't think I'd be able to properly describe them. Vaguely British, I guess.
