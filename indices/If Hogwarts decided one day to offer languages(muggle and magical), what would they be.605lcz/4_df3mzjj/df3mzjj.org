It seems like there are ways to learn languages quickly using magic (Crouch knew 150 languages) so assuming it's not too difficult, it's pretty reasonable to have students be proficient in two or three languages.

French and German due to the schools. Latin, Greek, old English, Egyptian...

Definitely Latin though, that should be a requirement.

I'm more interested in the magical languages like talking to mermaids.
