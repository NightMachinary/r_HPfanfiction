Latin would be a must. JK has a background in Classics and it shows - almost all the spells have Latin roots. Just knowing the meaning and intent behind spells would make them easier to identify and use, I suspect. If a wizard decided to cast an unknown spell during a duel, someone proficient in Latin would possibly be able to work out its function and plan around it. Tbh, I don't know how spell-crafting works or whatnot but I presume that Latin would probably be helpful.

Even though this wouldn't be particularly relevant to a Hogwarts student, a healthy portion of the characters in the books have names from a Roman origin or Latin background also (e.g. Severus = strict, Dolores = pain).

So yeah, definitely Latin.
