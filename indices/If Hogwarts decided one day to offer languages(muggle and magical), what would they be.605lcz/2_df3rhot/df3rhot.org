You might check out linkffn(11762909) and linkffn(11862560) by inwardtransience. Both have additional language classes because Wizarding Britain held on to Celtic traditions much more than in canon. The author really puts a lot of work into that, far more than I can understand, really. It's impressive, and the stories are fantastic as well.

As for canon, Hogwarts could potentially offer Classical Latin, Ancient Greek, Ancient Egyptian (Phoenician too?), French, and whatever the /lingua franca/ of Durmstrang is (Russian? German? Old Norse?). Any of the Celtic languages could be fair game depending on the larger history of Wizarding Britain. You might also throw in others depending on what the larger international magical scene is like; maybe Arabic, Mandarin, Swahili, and Hindi to start, and possibly even Mesoamerican languages if the Aztecs and Mayans left a decent magical heritage.

For magical languages, the obvious ones are Mermish and Gobbledegook. Not sure what else there is (Troll?).

I think you could make a good argument for anything between none and several dozen additional language classes, depending on how easy it is for wizards become fluent and how dominant various cultures are in the magical world.
