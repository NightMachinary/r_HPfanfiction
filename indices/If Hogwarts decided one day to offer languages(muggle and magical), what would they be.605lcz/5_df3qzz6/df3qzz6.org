*Classical Languages* (Latin, Ancient Runes languages, Sanskrit, etc.)

Basically these are languages that directly improve someone's facility with magic. Sanskrit is included because I assume it takes the place of Latin in South and South-East Asia (with Classical Chinese and Koranic Arabic doing the same in East Asia and the Middle-East/North Africa respectively).

*Modern Languages* (French, German, Spanish, etc.)

These are languages that let speakers communicate with other major wizarding powers. French and German because of other schools, and Spanish because I assume it covers Latin America.

*Magical Languages* Parsletongue, Mermish, Gobledygook, etc.

These are included because they let speakers talk to other magical races or creatures.
