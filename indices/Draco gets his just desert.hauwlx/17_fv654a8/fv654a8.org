Great instant payback in the first few chapters and more for others Money, fame, family name means little to Harry. Great redemption had by some characters because of the influence in early years. Goblin are warriors, raised and trained harry from day 1 and isnt the best in the beginning, but the writing settles nicely much farther in. But some parts are too romance centered for young HarryxHermione. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]])
