People on this sub constantly downvote any opinions that they don't have. A lot of people are reasonable on here though there just is an immature faction which is understandable we do discuss fanfiction of a children's book series on here. My feelings aren't hurt. If anything I find it funny how much kudos I lose on here ðŸ˜‚
