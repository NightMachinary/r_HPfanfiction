I mean... Painting Lucius and Draco in a good light is fine /if it matches the tone of the fic/. Either you have them as decent people from the start, or Harry being evil with the narrative being from a Death Eater's point of view. What is not okay, in my opinion at least, is these random changes of heart which basically amount to "Oh I served the Dark Lord but now you're winning so I'll be a good person" or, as I sometimes see happen (and honestly it's the reason I avoid slashfics in the HP fandom), "Harry just fucked me so good I'm gonna betray the Dark Lord who managed to track Karkaroff down effortlessly and will most likely kill me if not for the plot armor"

However, if it's done well, I can see Lucius actually /convincing/ people that he was good all along, if it's done at least 1/3rd before the fic ends and he manages to play the model good guy throughout all of it. He's supposed to be the ideal Slytherin, so spinning that lie could be possible. I've also read a couple of decent fics where he goes to Dumbledore or Harry when Voldemort requests Draco, with Lucius still being a vile asshole but going against his ideals for his family.

Absolutely no hope for Draco tho, if he's anything close to canon.
