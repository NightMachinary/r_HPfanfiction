Snape is a great character. He is not a good person at all, and he isn't heroic as J.K Rowling said and not in an anti heroic way. He turned on fascism because he didn't get what he wanted ( a girl who was smart enough to kick his toxic ass out of her life). He's awful. Brave? Yes in his twisted way very much so. He's utterly fascinating. But Snape Stan's want to remove all the compelling parts of his character in their romanticization and the it revisions to his character. Fanfic Snape is boring
