Linkffn(An Incomplete Potter Collection by Racke)

This is a series of snippets/plot bunnies. Chapter 9 has 6 snippets. The first one is called "Malfoy's Beat-Down".

The set up isn't great, but it's very brief and gets to the beat down quickly. In the triwizard tournament Harry ends up in some kind of fanon veela/life bond thing with Gabrielle. Neither of them are at all happy about it. Draco tries to start bullying her but Harry isn't having any of it.
