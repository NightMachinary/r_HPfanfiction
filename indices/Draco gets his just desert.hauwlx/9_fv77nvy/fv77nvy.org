I think it was in (The lie I've lived by jbern) that he decided to bully and humiliate Draco to the point where even the Weasley twins say it's too much.

This, after Draco went and cried to daddy when Penelope Clearwater (muggleborn head girl) gave him detention for calling her a mudblood, or something like that.

To which drama queen Malfor sr responded by blacklisting her from a ministry job like Harvey Weinstein who just got rejected by a young, self-respecting woman.

I remember there was a scene where he embaressed Draco in front of the whole school + Beuaxbatons and Durmstrang and he also 'pranked' him on a daily basis. I'm still longing for a sequel to that fic ):
