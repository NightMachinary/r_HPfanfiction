I have read many, MANY, time travel ffs. My favorite are:

Linkao3(Carpe Noctem)

Linkffn(A slytherin through time)

Linkffn(The bureaucratic error)

Linkao3(Yesterday is Tomorrow (everything is connected))

A slytherin through time has my favorite characterization of the Slytherin house. Best thing? Just because Draco time traveled it doesn't mean he isn't a git anymore.

Edit: i wasn't talking about the Carpe Noctem the bot linked. I meant Carpe Noctem by LeEspionage. How do i change it...?
