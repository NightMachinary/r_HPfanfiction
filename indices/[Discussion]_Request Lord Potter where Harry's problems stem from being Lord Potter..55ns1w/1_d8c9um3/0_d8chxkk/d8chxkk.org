Thanks, I'll look into that.

I think that it would work better if the setting was in Skyrim and the characters came from the Potterverse. Make it more of a Skyrim fanfic though. Still have Voldemort and the Death Eaters to fit in somewhere Skyrim friendly, but Skyrim is know for dark mages.

I'm not actually sure of my ability to write Sheogorath, so I don't think he'll be making a big appearance. Do have plans for Nocturne though.
