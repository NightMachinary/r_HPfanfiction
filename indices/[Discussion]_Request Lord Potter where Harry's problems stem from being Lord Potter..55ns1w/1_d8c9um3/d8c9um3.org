Since Vikings (and medieval Scandinavia) are /the/ inspiration for Nords, I'd suggest learning a bit more about their social structure for some ideas of what things might pop up in the plot. It's interesting to see the interlaced obligations at work in such a system, even if /Skyrim/ is a more "modernized" version of it, if that's the right word for it. Minus the thralls.

It's much easier to find out the duties of medieval lords, and just as insightful regarding the large amount of roles and work that went into managing land.

Not everything is going to translate to Tamriel's various cultures, but it can be tweaked or used as inspiration for existing canon.

I'd suggest starting with some of the links at the [[http://www.sca.org/links/misc.html][SCA]], in particular [[https://regia.org/research.php][Regia Anglorum]] which focuses on "Viking Britain." Similarly, give [[http://www.hurstwic.org/history/text/history.htm][Hurstwic]] a look.

Some other helpful resources:

- [[http://home.olemiss.edu/%7Etjray/medieval/feudal.htm][Feudal Terminology]] and [[http://home.olemiss.edu/%7Etjray/medieval/manorial.htm][Manorial Language]] - Focused on Britain, but helpful for giving you an idea of just how much stuff was involved in running an estate.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_household][Medieval Household]] - Wikipedia, I know, but actually well-written for a tl;dr version. Check the links in the "See Also" section as well.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages][Early Middle Ages]] - Seems to be the inspiration for the game's current era.

- [[http://www.medievalists.net/tag/early-middle-ages/][More Early Middle Ages Stuff]] - A mixture of reviews about books and movies interspersed with various topics at Medievalists. Pain to sort through, but informative.

- [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Main_Page][UESP]] - *The* resource for all things /Elder Scrolls/, especially lore. Helpful for fleshing out the background.

One thing I'd like to add: Religion plays a big role in /Skyrim's/ plot, complete with its moments of awe or horror ... but you never wholly get the feeling that worship is this profound, pervading thing like it was for real-life early medieval peoples. With gods you can literally talk to, religion really needs to hold more weight in everyday activities for the setting.

It's the one thing that a lot of original fantasy fiction forgets, never mind fan fiction. Including it will instantly give another layer to the worldbuilding.

And who can resist leaving out Sheogorath anyway?
