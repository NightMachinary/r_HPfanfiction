Speaking of archaic laws, check out this [[http://justsomething.co/the-22-most-ridiculous-us-laws-still-in-effect-today-2/][link]]

Nobody bothers to enforce them anymore, and if any idiot tries to apply them, the judges are likely to throw them out and the legislature will repeal them. Even if one judge is stupid enough to let it go to trial, it still faces appeals court, state supreme court, and The Supreme Court. In real world, we do have plenty of safeguards against stupid laws.
