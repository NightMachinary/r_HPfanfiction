Those laws aren't that ridiculous, the rabbit one is probably to protect the wildlife and polygamy is a problem in Utah, but the most serious one is the one is the last. In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest, dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps. Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in. They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas. Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. Of course Washington would have a Bigfoot law.
