I've had a crackfic idea where Harry inherits a lot of weird obligations dating back centuries, in some cases. You could easily adapt that - as Lord X, he has to provide his liege with one White Mountain Goat each year. Sadly, they are said to be extinct. He is also responsible for the protection of a family/village/whatever who is invlved in a blood feud with its neighbours. Then there are the obligations to his direct liege, and to the liege Lord of his liege. Further, hospitality laws are very specific and very archaic in his holdings - he has to provide visitors of a certain rank with rather exotic goods and services, on demand.
