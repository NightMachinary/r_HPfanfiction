AO3 apparently occasionally gets really nasty, but authors can clean up comments and a lot of drama appears to occur off-site. I think the fact that the site is more welcoming of certain content helps, along with the overall higher age among users. I don't remember if you can even comment as a guest on AO3, but if you can't, I assume the barrier to entry (the need for either invites or a waiting list) weeds out trolls, especially those who would otherwise flame a bunch, get banned, then make a new account immediately.
