What we've found with AO3 is the responses lend themselves to discussion. Comments, questions, quotes. On FFnet, it's usually a sentence or even just 'pretty good'. There's not a strong interactive element because there's no public discussion. Tbh, I rarely remember to post on ffnet these days because it's just this one (albeit lovely) person who tends to read and comment so it feels more like writing in a vacuum.
