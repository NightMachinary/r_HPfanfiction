I think you're on to something. I like reading reviews and comments, and... It's generalized, of course, and there are plenty of nice and thoughtful reviewers on FFN... but in my experience the numbers of trolls, intolerant douchebags and people who get butthurt because a fic doesn't cater to them personally is notably smaller on AO3... also the reviews on FFN can sometimes get a little, ummm, bizarre.

I've been pretty lucky with my one fic, Holly Potter and the Witching World, which is a Fem!Harry story where most of the magical population is female... mostly the reception's been positive on both AO3 and FFN.

But, well, it wasn't on AO3 I got anymous reviews saying "female garbAge shitfic"... and yes, it did have that random capital A... and it wasn't on AO3 that I got reviews accusing me of plagiarizing myself.

I mean, seriously, when a fic is posted on AO3 under the handle "D_M_Nealey" and then the same fic is posted on FFN under the handle "D. M. Nealey," you'd THINK that people would get that it was the same person posting the fic to both sites, right? But I had like three separate people on FFN accusing me on plagiarization. Two of them took it to PM, the third posted reviews saying "good job stealing D_M_Nealey's work from archive of our own."

I have to say that overall I like AO3 better. :)
