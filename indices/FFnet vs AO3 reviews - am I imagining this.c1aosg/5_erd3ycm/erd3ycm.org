No, you're not imagining it.

I pretty much hate ff.net; the only reason to look at ff.net there is that the site is vastly more popular and thus gets more traffic and more stories published. ao3 is far better designed, far easier to search (the search features alone are worth using it for), has far nicer and (dare I say) better users. ff.net also uses dirty tricks to try to prevent anyone from every finding out that ao3 even exists (they block most non-shorthand ways of referring to ao3), and the only site that blocks ao3's story import feature is... ff.net.

Plus, ff.net will do stuff like nuking stories without so much as a minor warning; look at what happened to Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past recently. ao3, by contrast, has very little to no censorship. You don't have to worry that they'll remove your work and account without warning or the ability to appeal. ao3 is run by a tax deductible non-profit whose whole mission is to make sure fanworks are protected and cares a lot about making things better for writers and readers, and ff.net seems to exist mostly to juice out as much advertising profit as possible from a site whose technology is ancient and never seems to improve.

And yah, I post anything I write to both places. And certainly I get more hits on ff.net --- but my heart's with ao3.
