I don't know why you got downvoted, it's the truth. Every honest and constructive review I've left for someone in Ao3 I made sure to be very neutral and professional sounding so it didn't seem like I was attacking, but the author responds and argues and attacks you. Even something as simple as ‘hey, you may want to look this over again, you missed a lot of capitalization and you accidentally switch from third person to first person in the middle' or something nets screeching defensiveness. Hell, tbh even on ffnet they often send you private messages doing the same, so most authors are very over sensitive. 🤷🏻‍♀️
