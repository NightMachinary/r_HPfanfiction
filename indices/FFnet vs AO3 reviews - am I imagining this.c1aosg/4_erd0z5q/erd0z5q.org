Probably due to better tag system in ao3, readers know pretty much exactly what they're getting into so no one is left feeling like theyve been ripped off or lied too. Granted this doesnt excuse some of the comments on ffn but that's what I feel causes some of them.

PS: plus ao3 cultivates an environment of like minded degenerates that I freaking love while ffn seems to reward staying in your lane and not stretching outside of the norms as much.
