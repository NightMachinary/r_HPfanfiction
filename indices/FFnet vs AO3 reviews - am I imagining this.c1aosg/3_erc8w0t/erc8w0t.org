I much prefer FF.Net reviews.

For a start, there are a lot more of them. I crosspost Victoria Potter on both FF.Net and AO3, always updating at the same time so it's not like one has an advantage over the other.

Reviews on FF.Net: 448

Comments on AO3: 30

FF.Net wins on quality of review as well. In terms of length, of my 30 AO3 comments, only 11 are longer than a single line. In terms of content, I would identify 10 out of 30 as genuine reviews, by which I mean they engage with the fic on some specific level, either by asking questions, making predictions, or commenting on the quality of specific story elements. The rest are all fairly generic. If you combine these two metrics (length and content), the number of substantial reviews I've received on AO3 is... 5. For the whole fic. So let's say 15% of AO3 reviews are actually substantial.

Meanwhile, on FF.Net, the number of substantial reviews (length and content) I've received on chapter 18 alone is 6 out of 13. So FF.Net reviews are around 50% substantial.

So yeah, I definitely prefer FF.Net when it comes to reviews.

It's true that on FF.net you get more critical reviews from people who just don't like your fic and want you to know it. That's fine. I've posted my story publicly, people are entitled to shit on it if they dislike it. But then, I'm the kind of person who rolls their eyes when an environment is described as "toxic" just because someone's feelings might get hurt.

You also get more trolls on FF.net, but I just ignore them. Jokes on them in the end; they're just increasing my review count.
