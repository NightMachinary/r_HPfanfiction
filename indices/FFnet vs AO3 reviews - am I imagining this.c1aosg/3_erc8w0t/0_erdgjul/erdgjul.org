  But then, I'm the kind of person who rolls their eyes when an environment is described as "toxic" just because someone's feelings might get hurt.

When reviews boil down to "I don't like you and I don't like your face, so fuck you, cocksucker.", I would consider that toxic, without the quotation marks. Not liking a story and shitting on it is one thing. Attacking the author because you didn't like a story or because they ignored your demands about what to write? Yeah, that's a little much.

I'm not an author, I'm not one to get offended easily and I can swear with the best of them. But damn, some of the comments I've seen make me want to take a bar of soap and stuff it down somebody's throat.
