Also worth noting that AO3 specifically prohibits harassment in their ToS, unlike FFN, and has an Abuse team that follows up on complaints. Obviously, negative reviews don't necessarily count as harassment, but I think that, plus various options for authors (you pointed out writers being able to delete comments, but they're also able to moderate comments and lock fics to AO3 members-only) encourages a stronger norm of being polite to writers than exists on FFN.
