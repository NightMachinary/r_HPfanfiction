The only time I've seen really toxic or just negative reviews on FF have been when the author seems to have very deliberately misspelled half the words in their story. I get people are posting for fun and what not, but you can't expect to totally through out the English language in your English language story and not expect to be buried for it. Then the authors complain, and reviewers are validated by the fact the author is trying to justify their terrible attempts at spelling, or not using commas, or switching tenses back and forth mid sentence(I've seen this in multiple top rated stories), so they continue on in their attacks.
