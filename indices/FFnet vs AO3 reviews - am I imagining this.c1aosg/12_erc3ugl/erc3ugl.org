I definitely notice the same, but the stories I have on FFN and AO3 are very different, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.

I wonder if the fact that AO3 comments can be replied to (whether by the author or other commenters) prevents the worst of vitriol because there's a chance they'll be called out on it?
