I'm posting my current story on both, and the AO3 comments are far and away just plain better.

On AO3 a comment requesting an update would be 'cant wait to read more!'. On FFN it's 'update now'

Criticism is worded better as well. I had a person on AO3 dislike my characterization of Harry at times, and they said so, but then followed up with positives the liked about the story as well.

Had a criticism on FFN that tore me apart in a flame, but the roots of it were good points on problematic areas of a recent chapter that I ended up fixing.

On AO3 I haven't gotten a single comment about boring, bad characters, or crappy story, like I have on FFN. I don't expect everyone on AO3 loves my story, but I dont think they feel compelled to say something if they dont, like FFN readers do.
