It's unclear what "favorites" is meant to convey. Does it mean it's actually a favorite story of yours, or are you trying to convey a complement to the author? AO3 separates the functions; there are bookmarks (which you can put reviews into as well so people know why you're recommending things) and kudos as distinct features.
