Oh I don't know. My reviews on FF haven't been toxic and while I'm not reading a crazy amount of HP these days, the few I have don't seem to get too much unfair flak. I've had some harsher ones over the years, yet never anything I'd call really mean. Mostly, I've had positive responses. Typically, they're all pretty short and simple (lots of "Thanks for the update!", "Nicely written", "Good chapter").

What difference I have noticed between the two is while I get less comments on AO3 as whole, what I do get is typically more thoughtful. Even if they're still not saying a lot, they remark on something from the actual chapter they liked instead of just giving generic praise like my average FF.net reviews.
