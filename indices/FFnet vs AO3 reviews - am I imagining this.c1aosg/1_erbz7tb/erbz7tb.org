I'm exploring FFnet these days, and, yeah, the comments are something else.

I also remarked that a lot of them make demands out of the writer. It's rare on AO3 for a commenter to say « ok, after this scene, writes this, make this couple happen bla-bla-bla ».

Or, worse, something happened that goes against their demands and suddenly it's ok to violently insult the writer. It's really wild.
