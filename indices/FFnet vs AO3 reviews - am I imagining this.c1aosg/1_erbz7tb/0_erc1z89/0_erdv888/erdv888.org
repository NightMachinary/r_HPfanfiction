FFN users certainly criticise harder, but it's rarely constructive from what I've seen.

With the tagging system on AO3, readers can see if the fic has tropes/pairings they dislike before clicking, and if they still do, that's on them. So those really bad fics have their target audience that would praise them, and other people are able to avoid them in the first place.
