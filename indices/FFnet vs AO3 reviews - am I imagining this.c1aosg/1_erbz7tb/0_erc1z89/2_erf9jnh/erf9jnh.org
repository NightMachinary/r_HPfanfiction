Haha, yes, I'm French. And sometimes I still have a hard time putting the right ponctuation. (English has a really weird use of the ; for exemple).

(And I didn't even know that â€˜blah blah' was a french/European expression!)

But, yes, they're harsher but without any real feedback, I feel. It's more criticism but without the constructive part of it. Whereas, as someone still learning English AND learning to write fiction, I can get really good criticism on AO3. (And, tbh, with the quality of the fic on AO3, I feel like they're more justified in their criticism/advice).
