If you're writing in a smaller fandom, you get far more attention and hits on ao3. ff.net gets far far more attention if you're writing Harry Potter stuff. I write in some fairly obscure fandoms and there are essentially no stories (or hits) for those on ff.net but they get regular comments and kudos on ao3.
