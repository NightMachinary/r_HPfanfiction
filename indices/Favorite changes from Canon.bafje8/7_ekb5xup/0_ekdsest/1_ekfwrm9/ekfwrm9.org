Yeah, and with Slughorn I'd wager that "best" really means well-connected and resourceful. She was a pretty, popular girl who maybe had help from a friend who really /is/ brilliant at potions (Snape), which are all recollections made fuzzy by years of dead-hero-worship and messing with his own memories to assuage his own guilt. I guess I just wouldn't take Slughorn's statement at face value.
