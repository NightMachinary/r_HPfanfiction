I do not subscribe to that theory, Lily was brillant in potion from first year to her seventh year, she cut ties with Snape at the end of fifth. Slughorn would have noticed it if her apparent skills had decreased, no that theory comes from people having a hard time accepting Snape not being the only brillant potionner among his peers.

For all we know Snape's recipes altering might have come from Lily.
