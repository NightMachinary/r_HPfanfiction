  More studious Harry - *He's told his mum was a charms prodigy* and he's had multiple attempts on his life, why wouldn't he study more to survive

Well the bold part isn't canon, Harry is told his father and Sirius were the cleverest students of Hogwarts, he heard from McGonagall that the two of them were /extremely bright/ but it is never said that Lily was a charm prodigy. However Slughorn described her as /one of the best student he'd ever had/.

Otherwise I agree that Harry should have been more motivated in learning magic, I feel like there is a shift between the first books and the last books in that aspect
