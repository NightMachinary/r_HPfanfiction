- Better Pairings - Everyone has their favorites but a few canon ones just make no sense (Hermione/Ron and Remus/Tonks are garbage pairings)

- Worldbuilding - Love seeing more of the magic world

- Magicbuilding - Let's be honest everything is better with more magic

- More studious Harry - He's told his mum was a charms prodigy and he's had multiple attempts on his life, why wouldn't he study more to survive
