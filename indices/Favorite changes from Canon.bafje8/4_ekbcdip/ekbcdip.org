Ignoring Cursed Child/Crimes of Grindlewald.

Daphne Greengrass. She has a clearly defined personality in the world of FF, is usually written roughly the same, and is genuinely one of my favorite characters. Looking back i don't think she has a single line in canon. It's amazing how so many people can write her the same with that in mind.

I love any bit of story that gets kinda nerdy bout wards. Funfact, wards aren't canon.

New Teachers! New characters in harry's friends group are usually ehhhh, but original characters as Teachers usually turns out awesome.
