The term 'wards' itself is never used. It's a fan made creation. The stones are also a fanmade creation. So yes, technically speaking you could argue since it's a fan made creation, that fan made definition would stretch to cover any sort of protective enchantment in an area. But that's not what most authors seem to consider wards, and it's not what I would consider wards when I'm talking about what I'm interested in.

That said, I'll amend my previous statement.

"The term "wards" and wardstones are not canon".

Hopefully that's enough to keep everyone happy.
