The change is permanent, but that doesn't mean it's consistent or uniform. Hogwarts transfiguration lessons are full of silvery matchsticks and metallic colours beetles. Which is kind of necessary quality control for anything you'd want to eat or use as a tool/toy/furniture. If an average wizard changed water to milk, I wouldn't drink the milk. If an average wizard transfigured a tree into a flight of stairs, I'm taking the elevator.

Of course there are wizards whose transfigurations are perfect or close to it. But I don't think this is a large part of the population, and also most of the goods we see for sale in the books are magical. We are never shown a transfigured object having magical properties, so it's probably safe to say that if you wanted a magical tool or object (flying broom/vanishing cabinet/wand/etc) you needed to make it the old-fashioned way.
