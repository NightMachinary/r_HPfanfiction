A lot of canon support ? Like how Sirius basically sold Lupin to teach Snape a lesson ? Or when the two of them believed the other to be the traitors who was giving information about their best friends to Voldemort ? Perhaps you're referring to Sirius dying whitout leaving anything to Lupin in spite of his friend -or rather lover (apparently supported by canon)- poverty.
