Major changes. Give me Voldemort coming back to life on first year because he gets the Stone, give me someone else getting the diary and perhaps even Tom Riddle revived through it, give me Harry not being chosen to participate in the Triwizard Tournament, give me new adventures that we never saw in the books...

Essentially, I like the concept of having one very small change mess up the whole series of events from early on, slowly accumulating more and more divergences.
