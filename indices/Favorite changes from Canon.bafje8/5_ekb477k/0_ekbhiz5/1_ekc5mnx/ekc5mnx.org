It's entirely realistic, people don't suddenly change their nature just because they discover something exciting. Interest can only fuel you so far before magic becomes both ordinary and your interests shift elsewhere into having fun at Hogwarts.

Harry is exactly how most people would react, initial interest and then not so much as it becomes the ordinary, but the excitement and discovering something new would always be there.
