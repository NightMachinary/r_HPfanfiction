It probably didn't yet have a fidilius, and owls in Harry Potter seem semi- sentient, I think it's possible that owls would have to be told the secret- as hilarious as that would be it should have been included in the books/fanfiction but I haven't seen it yet.

As to nicknames- I think it matters that the owl knows who they're talking about, but... there are no limits seen or tested really, though they are in fanfiction- more than a few people follow owls to some warded location, and wizards never thought of it before the main character- usually Harry- gets creative.

What I'd like to see is someone trying to mail letters for profit and shit- like "Take this letter to a rich dying widow." or "Take this letter to a lonely supermodel or veela" and following behind on their broom.
