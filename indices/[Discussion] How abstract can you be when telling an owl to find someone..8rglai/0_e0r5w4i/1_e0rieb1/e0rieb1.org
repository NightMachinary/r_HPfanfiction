Yeah, basically I think you're right on the money. Post Owls speak their own language but they're as sentient as House-Elves or Portraits, and so if /they/ know who the target is or how to locate them they'll go. Presumably most Post Owls would refuse to go along with "Take this letter to a rich dying widow"-type loophole abuse because they would see it as compromising their honor ("I'm a delivery-owl, young man, not a money-detector! Hoot! Hoot! Hiss!"), but they /could/ do it.
