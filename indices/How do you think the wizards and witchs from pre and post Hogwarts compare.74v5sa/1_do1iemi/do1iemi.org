I'd say the greatest wizards were always on about the same level, because people like Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald and Merlin don't have to /rely/ on lore except for the most powerful effects --- they just instinctively shape magic, Force-style, to fulfill most of their everyday needs ---, and Hogwarts doesn't really teach the more powerful magics that a grand sorcerer would need to /learn/.

On the other hand, the /average/ modern wizard knows a lot more spells (both everyday household charms and duelling spells) and is thus arguably more capable, though on the other hand the pre-Hogwarts wizards, even those who didn't have much native talent, probably knew more wandless magic than modern ones, out of sheer necessity.
