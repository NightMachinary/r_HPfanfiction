I don't know. Instinctive, will-shaped magic is just too boring for me. I would say that they all had high magical potential and understanding, but had different skills based on the magical knowledge available to them. Due to the accumulation of magical knowledge, higher levels of magical knowledge are likely more easily available after Hogwarts was established.

And the pre Hogwarts wizards may know more wand less magic, but it is almost certainly made obsolete know with more efficient wand magic alternatives.
