  Due to the accumulation of magical knowledge, higher levels of magical knowledge are likely more easily available after Hogwarts was established.

Well, /yes/, but that's not /directly/ related to Hogwarts. More powerful spells and rituals were created and recorded throughout the millenium that Hogwarts' existed, as others had throughout the millenia preceding the founding of Hogwarts --- meaning there are, indeed, more powerful lore available to modern-day wizards --- but that would largely have happened with or without Hogwarts, just as it always had before. I'll grant you that some of the spellcrafters may not have reached their whole potential if not for Hogwarts, but...
