I kinda started reading it but i kinda stopped after reading the part where dumbledore took Harry's money for the order downplaying that most of Harry's possessions where gone because they needed it. I know its not a major part but thieving Dumbledore just doesn't sound right to me. He's headmaster for years with all thos awards and i doubt he even have the need to get Harry's money.
