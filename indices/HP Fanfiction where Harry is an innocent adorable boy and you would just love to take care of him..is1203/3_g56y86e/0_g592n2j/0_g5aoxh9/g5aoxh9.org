That's fair. As with all recommendations, your mileage may vary. I think the author had a pretty good explanation for that point.

1. I also wanted to write something different than the many super-rich Harry stories. While the books don't really answer the questions that Harry's assets or lack of them raise, I felt an explanation might be possible. My Dumbledore is not an evil person: however, his eye is always on the big picture, and he is so old that everyone else seems like a child to him, which is why he never tells people anything more than he thinks their tiny minds can handle.

2. the Dumbledore in this story is not a thief and sincerely believes (though he may be wrong) that the things he does are necessary to secure the greatest good for the greatest number. My greatest reservation about him is that he appears to believe that the ends justify the means. I think the historical record indicates that tainted means pretty much always produce a tainted result. However, it would be difficult to argue that the wizarding world has much regard for history, if the presentation of the subject at Hogwarts is any indication. I don't want to write an essay on how Dumbledore let the wizarding world down. I could, but we've heard it all before. Many of you were also pretty appalled at James and Lily's bad money management. Be careful about taking Snape's thoughts about them for gospel: he is not capable of putting any but the worst construction on anything James Potter ever did. To be completely fair, I believe that 1) they were rightly convinced that defeating Voldemort was the most important thing they could do. 2) There was no reason to be cheap, because if Voldemort won, it was the end of the British wizarding world. Better for Harry to be poor than a slave-or worse. 3) Once James had committed himself to supporting the war effort financially, it was impossible for him, young, proud, and under Dumbledore's influence as he was, to draw the line when the money started running low. 4) James, like many young people who grow up in wealth, had no idea what it would really mean to be poor. 5) Lily might have grasped the idea that they really could die. James, however, had not, and believed that after they defeated Voldemort they would be able to recoup their losses, either through work or making a deal with Celestina Warbeck to get the estate back.

Did you try the second story?
