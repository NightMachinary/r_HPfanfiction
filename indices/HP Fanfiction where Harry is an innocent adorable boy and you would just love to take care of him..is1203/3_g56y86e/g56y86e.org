If you're looking for Happy!Harry, you can't go wrong with this one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] may sound like a tired premise (Snape mentors Harry), but the author's refusal to downplay characters' negative attributes make this interesting and fun to read. Also, it's complete!

This is less happy, but definitely falls under the "Harry is an innocent and adorable boy you just want to take care of" part. It's also complete and my absolute favorite series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]]. It's sad, sweet, and Harry grows up undeniably cherished. Definitely a must-read.
