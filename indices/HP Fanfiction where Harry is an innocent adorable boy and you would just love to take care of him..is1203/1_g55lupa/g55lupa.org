Definitely this one, the plot is that Harry sees Lucius's abusive behavior (the summer before 2nd year) towards Draco and does something about it, because he knows that "father's aren't supposed to act this way,". Super sweet, is drarry, and meets all of your requirements. Harry is for sure cherished in this one. It is also a series (incomplete) with 334,207 words and 5 works.
