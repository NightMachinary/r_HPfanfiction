  After two years, they are finally out of SAO, but the real world is not how they remembered it. They are now strangers in a familiar land. Now they have to try to adjust to a new world... again. But what about those they left in the real world? Will they like the changes that everyone has experienced?

  The magical world isn't as ignorant of muggles as it seems, and Lucius Malfoy has an idea on how to get Harry out of his way. Now Harry is in Japan and trapped in a virtual world of swords. Cut off from his friends and allies, and what he knew, he has to make new ones and get used to an illusory world that has become all too real. Welcome, to SAO Harry. Do try to survive.
