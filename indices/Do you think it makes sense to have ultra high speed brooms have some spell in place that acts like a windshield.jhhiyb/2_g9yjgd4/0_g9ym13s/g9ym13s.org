I was thinking like a bubble head charm but way bigger around the entire broom. That way you could fly at 10000 mph if the broom was capable of that without getting wind in the face and without breathing problems at high altitude.

Maybe a spell to move the air out of the way like the knight bus moves cars out of the way would make more sense though. Less aerodynamic trouble and no fiery ball of plasma when you go past mach 5.
