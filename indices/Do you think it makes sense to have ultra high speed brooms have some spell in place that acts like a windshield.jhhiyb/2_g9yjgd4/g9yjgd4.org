I'd say it should work more like a cow-catcher or a snowplow than a windshield. Windshields work quite well, or so Top Gear told me, due to cars needing to be a certain shape to help them handle their mass and stay on the roads (air flows over the body of the car and pushes it down onto the road). Brooms are a lot smaller, a lot lower in mass, and need to turn in every direction without the need to stick to roads. Something more conical would probably be most appropriate, letting it deflect air and bugs by diverting them around the entire broom rather than absorbing them (holding up a flat dinner plate shield in front of your face would fuck with your flying, and curving the windshield spell like an actual windshield would keep pushing the broom downwards).
