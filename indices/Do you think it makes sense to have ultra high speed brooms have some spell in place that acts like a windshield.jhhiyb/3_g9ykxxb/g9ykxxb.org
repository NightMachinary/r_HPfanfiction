Up to each person I think.

I'd say probably not because of the increased resiliency wizards have; they wouldn't need a spell to deal with the ill-effects of high G-forces such as passing out.

On the other hand, it might also be needed because the increased resiliency doesn't come with increased strength. While the high wind and high acceleration might not result in health consequences, the wind might cause one to let go of the broom without a spell to mitigate it.
