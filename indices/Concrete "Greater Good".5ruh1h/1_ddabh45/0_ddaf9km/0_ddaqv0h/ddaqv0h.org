  And at the end of OotP he didn't have any political power

That's just not true. I refuse to believe that the entirety or even a majority of wizarding Britain simply believed what the Minister and the Prophet were telling them.

No matter how much people here and some authors especially like to think of the general public is 'idiotic sheeple' the real world just doesn't work that way.

Dumbledore is like a living legend, the man was held in the highest regard for almost 50 years, he was a hero for defeating Grindelwald, the only wizard that Voldemort was genuinely afraid of and he held 3 of the most important political offices in the world. You don't discredit a man like that with a simple smear campaign in a few months.

The only reasonable explanation for his behavior in OotP is that he was simply too busy hunting Horcruxes to bother with Fudge. He knew that Voldemort would show himself in a reasonable time frame and any preparations Dumbledore and the Ministry could have made in that time simply weren't worth more than finding the Horcruxes.
