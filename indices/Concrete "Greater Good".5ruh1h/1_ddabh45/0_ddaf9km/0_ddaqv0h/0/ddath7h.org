Oh don't get me wrong. Dumbledore still had a great social standing and was still highly regarded by many. But he had not a single official function right after he duelled Voldemort. He got removed as chief warlock and Supreme Mugwump after all.

Also, besides the points you mentioned for his inactivity in OoTP there is also the point that leading a coup against Fudge while Voldemort is lurking around is so fucking stupid that I can't even put it into words.
