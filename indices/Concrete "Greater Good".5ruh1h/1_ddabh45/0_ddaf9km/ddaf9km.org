The first is a believable and somewhat canon supported idea.

But the second is just as far out there as a 'actually good guy Voldemort'. It has never been shown that Dumbledore tries to keep ancient bloodlines alive.

We've also barely seen Dumbledore as part of the war effort. 5th year is more espionage and 6th year he's already crippled and dying. And at the end of OotP he didn't have any political power so how would he have been able to make decisions on the fate of the prisoners...

As you might have noticed, I dislike the 'secretly pureblood supporter' Dumbledore immensely.
