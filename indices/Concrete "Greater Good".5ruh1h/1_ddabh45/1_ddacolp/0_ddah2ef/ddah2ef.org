Wanting to save the lives of your enemies is generally considered compassionate - not "fucked up". In fact, most civilised countries have done away with the death penalty for even the worst crimes.

All the reasons people in reality believe the death penalty is wrong apply here too. And in the Wizarding world there are even more reasons to be wary of killing your enemies. With things like the Imperius Curse how can you even be sure your enemy is there of their own free will?

Fanfics tend to shit on that last point, since Malfoy and Co. used it to avoid Azkaban, but I believe it is canon that there really were innocent people forced to commit crimes under the Imperius.
