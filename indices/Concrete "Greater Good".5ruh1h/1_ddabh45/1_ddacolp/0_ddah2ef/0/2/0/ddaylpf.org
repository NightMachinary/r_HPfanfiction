Except that is not the whole picture. I think that most people in the fandom agree that there is not nearly enough concrete information on the first blood war, so let's come up with a plausible scenario for the sake of argument.

As of the first war, Voldemort utilizes terrorist tactics. He keeps under the radar by using quiet disappearances, assassinating those with the power, magical or otherwise, to stand up to him. By the time he has gotten momentum, he is carrying out full scale massacres against Wizards and Muggles. The Ministry has no idea what to do, Dumbledore cannot fix this by waving his wand, and so the terror continues. Voldemort allows for his name to be leaked to the upper levels of government, and by extension, Dumbledore. He places a Taboo on the name, and is able to successfully use the tactic to sweep in with multiple coordinated raids to kill public officials, severely weakening the Ministry. The Imperious curse is used liberally, and that is Voldemort's greatest tactic. He only needs to imperious a single Auror, and by doing so, infect the ministry with a wave of spies, who actively pass information, and sabatoge operations. The Department of Mysteries is immune at first, but falls with the recruitment of Augustus Rookwood. There are three circles to the Death Eaters. The Inner Circle are the leiutenants, strategists, and the Death Eater High Command. The second circle consists of marked death eaters, who aren't crucial to the operations. The third circle is the cannon fodder, werewolves, inferior and imperioused wizards. Except in certain situations, the Inner Circle never see combat. Instead, kill squads are sent out, groups of third circle operatives directed by second circle operatives, all of which are compartmentalized.

Now, let's look at the effects this would have. Literally anyone could be a traitor. And all those traitors and spies could also be innocent. Frankly, Voldemort could run his operation with perhaps only 10 people, and simply have a network of imperioused fighters. After all, the imperious cannot be detected. There were two times that execution was a serious possibility canonically. Just after the war ended, and right after Voldemort's resurrection. After the war ended, they had swept in, and dismantled a lot of Voldemort's power structure. You then have loads of people, of whom maybe 10% are actually guilty. You cannot execute them all, and there is no way to prove guilt in that situation. So you jail the obvious ones, and just leave it at that. They could have killed them all, but given public perception, not only would it do no good, but it would set a very bad precedent and create a potential scandal, if it ever came out that they had executed an imperious victim.

After Voldemort was resurrected, Dumbledore really couldn't do anything without having a bad time. Even without him trying to execute prisoners, canonically he was ousted from literally all of his positions. He could well have been thrown in jail himself, and almost was.

TLDR:Canon does not explain enough about the situation to judge it, and from the facts presented, one could easily come up with a canon compliant scenario which explains the reasoning. Yes, you can paint Dumbledore are evil or obsessed with second chances, but there is not nearly enough evidence for that to stand up on its own.
