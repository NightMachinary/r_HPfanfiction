There is a big difference between kill on sight and execution after investigation and trial.

The Sirius case exposed how fucked up both Dumbledore and Ministry were: You finally caught a core Voldemort henchman and a deep spy, and you didn't bother to ask him some questions? Hello Dumbledore? He was once your hardcore follower, why did he suddenly turn? Even understanding that question might save you from future similar tragedies. As for you Ministry, a core Voldemort follower would be a goldmine for intelligence, but you just locked him in a prison and forgot about him. How incompetent could you possibly get?
