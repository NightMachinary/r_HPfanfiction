One of the great things about the story is that its never morally black and white. You point to Bellatrix Lestrange as a great example of why they should use the death penalty. But I could just as easily point to Sirius as a great example of why they shouldn't.

What if the aurors who found Sirius - laughing in front of dozens of witnesses who had watched him murder 13 people - just killed him then and there and condemned an innocent man to die?

As Gandalf himself put it:

“Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.”

― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring
