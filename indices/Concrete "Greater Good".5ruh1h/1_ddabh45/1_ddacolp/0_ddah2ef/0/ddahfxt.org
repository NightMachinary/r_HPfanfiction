  Wanting to save the lives of your enemies is generally considered compassionate - not "fucked up".

This attitude has some merits, but it backfired badly in the fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Those murdering psychopaths already had compiled a decade long record of murders and tortures. As the story showed clearly, it was terribly wrong NOT to put Bellatrix and Co. permanently out of business when they had the opportunity. How many died or suffered after they were broken out of Azkaban?

Applying blanket 'mercy' to your enemies is dangerous, naive, wrong, and a GIGANTIC INJUSTICE to their victims.
