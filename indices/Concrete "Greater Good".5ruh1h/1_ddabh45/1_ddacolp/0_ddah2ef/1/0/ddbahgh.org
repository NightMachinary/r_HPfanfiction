It's not true though. In the Wizarding World, they have proof of the existence of souls and an afterlife. See: dementors and the resurrection stone. In such a case, where you know that the person in question has not just ceased to exist, then the death penalty is far less of an issue. In fact, dealing out death in war is far less of an issue. I would even say that the death penalty is better than life imprisonment in that case.

But what I'd really like to know is if insane people like Frank and Alice Longbottom are still insane in their afterlife.
