I think that, for bashing purposes, the concept of greater good has been both wrongly attached to Dumbledore and been corrupted in a mere excuse for evil. First, Dumbledore does not actively use the words "greater good" in the books; Second, the Headmaster, while appearing controlling, is only doing what he thinks should be done to save as many lives as possible!

I can see why it would seem cynic and unappealing to most, but put yourselves in his situation: You are a 116 years old extremely gifted wizard who has been for decades the one everyone went to, to have something done; one of the very few with the political clout to protect, the only one strong enough to stand up to Voldemort!

I rather think he did his best, and while he failed in many ways, he's only human and many readers fall in the same trap as many wizards and witches, to think him as a mastermind on "God-Cocaine" cit. Conneron
