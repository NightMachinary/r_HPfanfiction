I'm not making assumptions about you, but I've generally found that people who're concerned with Ron's attitude during GoF to be around the age of Harry during that book.

As I've gotten older, a bit of jealousy and anger on Ron's side of things - while unfair to Harry - has turned into much less of a deal breaker.

You can see JK's attempts to show that Ron still cares throughout this entire hormone-fueled temper tantrum. Like Ron (â€˜s unfortunately timed) checking up on Harry during his floo call with Sirius.

Coming from a primarily HHr shipper, Ron is a great friend.
