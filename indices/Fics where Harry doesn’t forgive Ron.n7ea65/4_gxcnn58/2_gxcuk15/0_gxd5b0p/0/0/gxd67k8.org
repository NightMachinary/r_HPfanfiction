Uh aggressive much when my words were don't even try that one Just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?” Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he didn't care --- at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.

Then, when Ron told him that he maybe wanted to practise for the new interview, Harry absolutely lost the control, and threw a badge at him.

“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger. “Should've realized you didn't want to be disturbed. I'll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.”

Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.

“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you're lucky. . . . That's what you want, isn't it?”

Harry and ron were both dickwads so saying harry was a dickwad and threw a badge at ron your literally excusing what ron does and thats the problem here your far too defensive for a 4 word response saying don't even try that one you ignore what the character you like says to fuel an argument 🤔 but idk man aggressive much it fuckin happened in the canon.
