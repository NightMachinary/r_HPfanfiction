Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near Harry's age at that time.. however, if I were ever to find myself in danger of losing my life in a tournament I hadn't signed up for and my friends didn't believe me, I would never speak to them again. Trust has to go both ways. I couldn't care less about Ron's jealousy, we've seen it at other times in the book. It's this specific instance of being selfish and abandoning Harry when he needed Ron the most, knowing full well that Harry hated his fame.. it's unforgivable
