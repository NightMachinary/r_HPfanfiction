If you are willing to install extra software you can use calibre with the ffdl plugin. It will download fanfics from a huge variety of sites and allow you to organise them in a library. From there calibre can convert the ebooks into pretty much any format you could ever need, enabling you to read them offline on your PC (or Mac or Linux machine), mobile phone (with apps like MoonReader+, Google books, iBooks or whathaveyou) or eBook reader of choice.

If you just want to store new chapters until you've read them (or collect them from email alerts to download later) I recommend using a read-it-later service with an article view feature. I use pocket for that.

If anyone needs the links to the pages I've mentioned please comment, I'm on my mobile right now and adding several links is a chore ;)
