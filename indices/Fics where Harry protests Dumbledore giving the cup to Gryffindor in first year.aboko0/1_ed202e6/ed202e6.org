You know, I know I've read about this before, and it made a lot of sense. Giving out lots of house points for saving the Philosopher's Stone is one thing, but letting Slytherin think they'd won, even decorating the Hall in their colours, standing up to announce the winner and /then/ pulling the rug out from under them? Jerk move, old man.

But I can't remember where I read it. Sorry.

Edit: Ah, there we go, it was in linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), chapter 36.
