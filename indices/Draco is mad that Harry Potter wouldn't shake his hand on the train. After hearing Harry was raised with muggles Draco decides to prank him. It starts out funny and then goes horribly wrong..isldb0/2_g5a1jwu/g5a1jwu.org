It was supposed to be a joke.

"Good morning to you, Lord Potter."

A stupid joke.

"What? A Concubine? What the fuck is a concubine?"

A stupid fucking joke meant to end the day it had started.

"Can Harry Potter control the school?" "Of course he can, he is the Heir of the Founders."

But destiny had a way to bite me in my delicious arse.

"Heir Malfoy, how goes the proceedings in Wizengamot?"

"I'm thirteen, okay?" I shout, naively, "Thirteen! For Merlin's sake. I'm not even old enough to have Butterbeer!"

Daphne laughs. "Oh don't play me like that, as if we don't know how you are seen going in and out of the Ministry with your father, my, you may as well be a lord yourself!"

And I just smirk, and incline my head, because everyone else is doing so, and it would be stupid to not do what everyone else was doing, even though I am fuming inside.

A strongly worded letter to father is certainly in order.

"Harry Potter found to be Heir of Merlin himself!" reads the Daily Prophet, "In a ritual that has been hidden from us ever since its conception, the Goblins have declared the esteemed Lord Hufflepuff-Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw, to also be an heir of Merlin!

"When asked, the young Lord had this to say, 'I spilt my blood and a golden quill wrote Merlin's name! How could it not be true?'"

It was at this point that I stop reading the Frog's eyelids they pass as newspapers these days, and contemplate the idiocy of this world.

Even a second year knows enough animation charms to make a quill write on its own. How could anyone be so--- oh yes, of course. I see it now. Poor potter. Such a terrible joke on my part, I must apologize to him deeply.

How could I forget that he has a mudblood companion.

Stupid breeds stupid, my mother used to say when she knew my father was away.

I get it now.

It was meant to happen.

So when I go into Gringotts with my father, and I hear him say "May gold flow into your vaults and blood drain from your enemies" in his slow, teaching voice, I just nod my head.

It was my mistake, and I must bear its burden.

Merlin is this world stupid, though.
