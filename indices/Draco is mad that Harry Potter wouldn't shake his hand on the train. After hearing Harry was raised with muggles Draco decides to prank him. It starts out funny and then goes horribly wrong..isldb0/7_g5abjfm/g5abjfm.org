YOINK!!!

I am either going to make this a thing on its own or add it as canon to the next thing I do that's set at Hogwarts. This is gold. I can even see Fred and George taking it to the next level and chastising Slytherin for their "lack of manners", even though they recognize it's a prank on Harry. Thanks for making me excited to write again.
