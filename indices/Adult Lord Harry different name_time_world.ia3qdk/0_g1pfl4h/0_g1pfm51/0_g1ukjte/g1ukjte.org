Thank you! I've seen Delenda EST and read the first few pages a long time ago, but I remember closing it because I was afraid it was going to be very angsty. I'm going back to it today.

I did read “Sum of Their Parts” but it's worth a re-read.

I hope there are more recs. I'm spending more time searching than reading the stories!
