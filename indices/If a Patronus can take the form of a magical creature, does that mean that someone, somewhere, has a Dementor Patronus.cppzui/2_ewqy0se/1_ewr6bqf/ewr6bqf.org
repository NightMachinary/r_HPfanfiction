The patronus would mirror what the other's patronus is/was. We saw this in HBP when Tonks' patronus changed to a wolf - the same as Remus' (a regular wolf, not a werewolf, as explained by JKR, though Remus didn't like anyone seeing his) and in DH when Severus' patronus was seen to be a doe, the same as Lily's.
