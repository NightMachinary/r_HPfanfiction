It doesn't mirror the other person's patronus. I guess it might in some cases, but it's not a general rule. We don't know Lily's patronus, and I doubt Remus's patronus would be a wolf as he hated his condition.

Patronus is a representation of your loved one/protector. Harry's is a stag because his father's animagus form was a stag. We don't know James's patronus either, but it was most likely something different.
