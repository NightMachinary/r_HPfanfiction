There is JKR stating your Patronus can change to an eteral love, so he is partially correct as it can become a representation of your loved one. He could also be correct in Harry's Patronus taking the form of his father, as Harry is shown to still love his parents dearly even in the epilogue.

Also your Patronus and Animagus form can be the same, but it's not always the case.

  *Your Animagus and Patronus animal can be the same*\\
  If a wizard never masters Animagus magic, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll never find out the animal they could've been. Another pretty complex form of magic, the [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/expecto-patronum][Patronus Charm]], has been known to mirror it, meaning the animal you cast to attack [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/dementors][Dementors]] could well be your inner animal too.
