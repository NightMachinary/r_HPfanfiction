"I await protector". Gordon Bennet, your English is as bad as your Latin. "*I watch for my guardian*". The *mea* is implicit.

The reason for Harry's patronus is not specified. The reason for Tonks' is, and that's explained as a rare event in HBP.

  That patronus is your loved one ... It's canon

Direct quote, please.

Matey, you're arguing with quotes from JKR, just don't bother. And yes, I know Google itself isn't a source, but given those things are common knowledge that JKR has said numerous times in interviews and the like, those answers being given as top "official" results does carry credence. Lily's patronus is a doe. James' is a stag.
