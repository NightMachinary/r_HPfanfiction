I don't keep up with every article on Pottermore and google is not a proof of anything. Lily, James and Remus's patronuses are not in the books. And where does Dumbledore say anything about Lily's patronus in DH?

  No it isn't, it's an expression of who you are, in the form of an animal.

Animagus form is an expression of who you are. Patronus is an expression of other people. Harry is nothing like a stag, Snape is nothing like a doe. Maybe Tonks has something in common with a wolf, but it's not why she has such a patronus.

I give you Lily, because it's plausible that Dumbledore recognises her Patronus (though it's debatable that Snape even knew it when he learned to cast the spell), but Tonks's patronus is a wolf because it represents Remus himself, not his patronus. And it doesn't make sense for James to have a stag patronus. He's arrogant, but not so arrogant to have himself as the person he loves most/his protector.
