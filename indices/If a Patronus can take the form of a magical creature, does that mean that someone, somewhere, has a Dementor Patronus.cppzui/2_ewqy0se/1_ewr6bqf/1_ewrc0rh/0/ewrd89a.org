  It doesn't mirror the other person's patronus.
#+end_quote

If it reflects a person - which it doesn't have to - it reflects in animal form who they are, which is to say it reflects their patronus and animagus forms (JKR has said that a person's patronus is almost always the same as their animagus form).

#+begin_quote
  I guess it might in some cases, but it's not a general rule.
#+end_quote

Said whom?

#+begin_quote
  We don't know Lily's patronus
#+end_quote

Yes we do, [[https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=lily+potter+patronus][it's a doe]]. Dumbledore said so in DH.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt Remus's patronus would be a wolf as he hated his condition.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin][Remus Lupin's patronus is a wolf]]. On the bottom paragraph of that page, it says:

#+begin_quote
  /Remus's Patronus is never revealed in the Potter books, even though it is he who teaches Harry the difficult and unusual art of producing one. It is, in fact, a wolf -- an ordinary wolf, not a werewolf. Wolves are family-orientated and non-aggressive, but Remus dislikes the form of his Patronus, which is a constant reminder of his affliction. Everything wolfish disgusts him, and he often produces a non-corporeal Patronus deliberately, especially when others are watching./

"Honestly, don't you read?"

#+begin_quote
  Patronus is a representation of your loved one/protector.
#+end_quote

No it isn't, it's an expression of who you are, in the form of an animal. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/patronus-charm][There is an article about it on Pottermore]], in which you can find the following:

#+begin_quote
  /No reliable system for predicting the form of an individual's Patronus has ever been found, although the great eighteenth-century researcher of Charms, Professor Catullus Spangle, set forth certain principles that are widely accepted as true./

  /The Patronus, asserted Spangle, represents that which is hidden, unknown but necessary within the personality./

#+begin_quote
  Harry's is a stag because his father's animagus form was a stag.
#+end_quote

Doesn't say that anywhere in the books or in any of JKR's other writings. Harry's is a stag because he's made of the same stuff as his father.

#+begin_quote
  We don't know James's patronus either, but it was most likely something different.
