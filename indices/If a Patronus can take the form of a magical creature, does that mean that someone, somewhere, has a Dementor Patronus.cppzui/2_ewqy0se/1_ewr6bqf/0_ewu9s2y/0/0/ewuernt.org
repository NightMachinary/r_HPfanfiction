I think you're reading a bit too much into my comment. You see, it's a joke, because his patronus is the female version of James's animagus form. It was intended to represent Lily, and his +creepy obsession+ "love" for her, but if you skew the perspective a bit you can see it as him representing himself as the female counterpart to James, meaning his hatred was actually to cover up the fact that he was a total bottom for James.

Very advanced humor, I know.
