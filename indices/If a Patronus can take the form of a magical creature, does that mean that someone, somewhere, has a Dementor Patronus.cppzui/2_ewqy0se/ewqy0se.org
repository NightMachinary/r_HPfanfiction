Why not? Patronus is not about the creature/animal itself, but the personal associations the caster has with it.

Maybe someone's Patronus symbolizes, say, their missing older brother, and a dementor plushy is all they have from him. Or that brother used to dress up as a dementor when they played as kids. So now they have this positive association that manifests as a Dementor Patronus, even though it has nothing to do with actual Dementors as a species.
