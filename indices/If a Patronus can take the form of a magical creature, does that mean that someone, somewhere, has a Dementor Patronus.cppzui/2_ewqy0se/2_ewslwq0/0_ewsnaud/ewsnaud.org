Dementors /are/ technically magical creatures. So are wizards (much like humans /are/ animals).

There are 3 (I think) creature classifications: being, beast, and spirit(non-being). The only one that can be a patronus are beasts. That's get a little murky when you look at centaurs and merpeople, though.

I also just realized that's why it's called Fantastic /Beasts/. Heh.
