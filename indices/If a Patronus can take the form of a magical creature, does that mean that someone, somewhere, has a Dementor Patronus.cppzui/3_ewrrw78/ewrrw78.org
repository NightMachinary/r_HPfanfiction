Even if a Patronus was classified as a creature, I don't think so. A patronus is associated with the caster somehow, and if your most prominent association is "depression" (--> dementors), then you wouldn't be able to perform a patronus anyway.

I don't know anyone who is majorly depressed and can feel (not act!) happy on command.
