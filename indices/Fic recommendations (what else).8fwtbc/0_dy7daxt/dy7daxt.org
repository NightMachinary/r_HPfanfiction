Linkffn(child of the storm) and it's work in progress sequel linkffn(ghosts of the past) is a massive crossover with mostly Marvel characters. Thor is Harry's father, which is explained in the story obviously. There are some minor crossovers with other fandoms like DC Comics, Stargate, and the Dresden Files, but the primary crossover is with Marvel Comics in general. The Avengers, the X-Men, Doctor Strange, all kinds of Marvel Comics people show up in this series. It's really long but it's my favorite Harry Potter crossover, if not Harry Potter series in general.

Right now the both stores combined are sitting at about 1.3 million words so you got a long ride ahead of you if you want to dive in. It starts in 3rd year and the second story is fourth-year. 3rd year is a lot different than Cannon and fourth year is starting the same as cannon with the Goblet of Fire and the Triwizard Tournament, but it's not going to stick to Canon except in the broadest of terms (i.e. Harry is forced to compete in the tournament). The work-in-progress sequel is right now at Halloween.
