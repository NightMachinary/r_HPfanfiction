I suspect you've come across these, but ...

Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

Linkffn(The Mind Arts) It is a work in progress and a bit of a rehash, but it's also one of the best and most interesting fics to be started in the last year. It has got quite a few typos, but it isn't unbearable.

Linkffn(Realignment) Again a work in progress, but seriously brilliant writing, particularly on the fight scenes.

Linkffn(The Lord in the Mist) Yet another work in progress, but definitely worth a look if you want something which is neither rehashing canon nor filled with the typical tropes. The author also has a good track record with finishing things.
