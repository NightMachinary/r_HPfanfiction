I'll explain it one sentence really. Tropes are popular for lazier writers who don't devote the time to explore the world building, of end up being used and explored upon for the plot. Examples of the former is in most Ice Queen stories. Examples of the latter can be found in Ashes of Chaos, and Prince of Slytherin. Both stories that have common "tropes" such as Wizengamot Lordships, but actually explore it further. There's a difference between saying there's such a thing as a lordship in your story, and not really exploring what it entails, compared to spending boatloads of time on it. This is where you hear the term "trope subversion" which is a big thing in stuff similar to that of Ashes of Chaos and Prince of Slytherin. Can a story be good with lazy writing? Yes, however it won't reach the sky like those that truly push their writing further and further.
