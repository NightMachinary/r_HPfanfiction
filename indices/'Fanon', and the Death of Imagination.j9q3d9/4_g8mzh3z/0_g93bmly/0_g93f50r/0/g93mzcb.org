That really doesn't make sense.

The assumption you made has no basis in canon since.

We have been show countless times in the books and mostly in the movies, wizards using the killing curse. Grindelwald followers were also using during Grindelwald's war. And of course the killing curse is gonna be used during a time of great conflict like Wars.
