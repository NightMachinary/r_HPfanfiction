I get your dislike for fanon and rereading the same formula but with maybe different situations, but I don't get it what you have against headcanon since that refers to a reader's interpretation and extrapolation of information that we get from canonical sources and accept it as the truth. For example my headcanon is that until Voldemort's rise Avada Kedavra was not that often used. Actually it's not even most Death Eaters' go to spell even though it could quickly and cleanly do the job (we get that from the books) because not everyone finds it so easy to kill and most people, no matter how dark, still want to maintain their soul intact. However, judging from the downvotes I got for saying this, it's clearly not a popular opinion with the folks around here.
