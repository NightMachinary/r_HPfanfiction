I would forgive fanon characters in exchange for more no-horcrux stories. There are so many interesting plots to be had, stories to be told if you pretend horcruxes never existed! But alas, people write the same old stories with the same old stations of canon, right down to the Deathly Hallows.

Show me a Voldemort whose immortality is due to him brutalizing a stolen genie and Harry needs Daphne's help to find a ritual of Arab magic to undo it.
