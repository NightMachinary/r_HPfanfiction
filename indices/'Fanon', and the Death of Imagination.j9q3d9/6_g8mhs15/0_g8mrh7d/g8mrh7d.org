Horcruxes are a yoke around the neck of the fandom. Sure, for explicitly canon-compliant stories there's not much of a way to avoid them, but mild AUs tend to be stuck with them too. The problem is that there are so few ways of dealing with them that aren't just minor variations on canon.

So I agree. Let Voldemort do something completely different in order to cheat death. Really change it up!
