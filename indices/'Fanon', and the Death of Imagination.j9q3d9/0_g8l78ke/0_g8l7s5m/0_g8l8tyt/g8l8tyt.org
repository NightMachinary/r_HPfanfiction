If someone is writing clichés, that's not good writing. I don't care how poetic their prose is. Tension, characterization, plotting... Clichés are just poorly written tropes. Poetic prose doesn't make something well-written if it misses the mark on those other points. Don't cede the ground that they have technically good writing. 'Their sentences are pretty' is just lipstick on a pig.
