I think this is a chicken and egg thing.

Tropes are efficient ways of describing characters and plot elements, but they should not be what defines a character, or plot element.

It is true that it's pretty much impossible to create a character who does not match some set of tropes, but that doesn't mean a writer should start at the tropes and use those to define the character. The end result will only really be the empty shell of a character.

Buildings are made of doors, windows, walls, etc, but you don't design a home by making a list of walls, windows and doors. You'd just end up with a pile of bricks, timber and glass. It's about how you arrange them and, importantly, it's about the spaces you create between them.
