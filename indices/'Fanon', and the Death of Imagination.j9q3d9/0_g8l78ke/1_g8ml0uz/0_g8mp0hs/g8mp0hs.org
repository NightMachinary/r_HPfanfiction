Tropes are devices to assist in characterization and plotting. They are not the characterization and plotting. Hero and villain are easily recognizable devices, which are then played upon by the writer. If they are not played upon, or the author just inserts various tropes without doing any narrative or character work, then it will be cliched. Of course, if you try to avoid tropes, it will also be a mess. Nobody is perfectly original, and that is fine.
