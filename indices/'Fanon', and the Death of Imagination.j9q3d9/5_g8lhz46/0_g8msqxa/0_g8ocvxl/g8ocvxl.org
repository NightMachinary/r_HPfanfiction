I mean you're right it's a numbers game. I utilise the search filters a lot rather than go by reviews/comments or kudos.

there are also some ships or characters that will generally bring some newness and are less tropey, but you definitely have to be willing to read a lot of less unusual stuff to find the gold.

I read pretty much non stop because I'm stuck in bed pretty much all the time with my condition, and I would say I come across a truly different fic maybe once a fortnight? I mean they're called rare for a reason. But they do exist and there are more that I've come across in this fandom than others I read in (because there's just more fic full stop)
