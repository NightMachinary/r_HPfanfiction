I'd love to see your collection come to fruition, as I'd really love to believe that you're right. However, I have read many millions of words of fanfic, over many years, and I rather doubt that there is a huge, hidden store of wonderfully original stories that has gone beneath my notice.

Or, if there is, then it is so buried amongst the numberless fics that it might never see the light of day.

The thing about fanfiction is that a lot of its attraction is in its familiarity. You don't need to understand and invest in a new set of characters, like you do when reading a new original series. Thus, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that even within fanfiction circles the stories that garner the most attention (and, as a result, are easiest to find) are not necessarily the most original, but the ones that wrap their popular collection of tropes, story elements and borrowed world-building into the most grammatically inoffensive package.
