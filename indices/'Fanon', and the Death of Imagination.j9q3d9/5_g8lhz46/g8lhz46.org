people wrote what they want to read. People write for different reasons, and a great many want to read really tropey stuff, because that's their comfort zone and they want to stay there.

But the hp fandom is huge and so many people have been writing fics for so long that there is a plethora of work out there. There are honestly so many great and unique fics in this fandom. I think you might just be looking in the wrong places, or you just have never experienced being in a fandom where there are like, seventeen fan-fictions written for the fandom. Ever.

I have been trying to put together a collection of some of the most unique odd ducks out there on ao3, but I suck at admin, so it's currently got like three fics in it I think.

In the end though, if you can't find what you're looking for the best bet is to write it and stop yelling about people not doing things that they're putting out there for free the way you want them to
