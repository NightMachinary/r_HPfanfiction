I don't mind fanon/tropes (I even have a few I unequivocally adore) but I do mind when it isn't fleshed out. Example: I like Manipulative!Dumbledore but I don't like being told that he is manipulative (I honestly don't even want to see the word), I don't want a cheesy villain monologue or his eyes twinkling menacingly while he is hoarding Harry's 25 gringotts vaults. I like when a writer treats a trope as if the reader has never come across it before, giving it a place in the broader story.
