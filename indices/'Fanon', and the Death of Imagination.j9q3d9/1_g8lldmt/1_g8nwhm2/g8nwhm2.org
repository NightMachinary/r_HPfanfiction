Another approach is to treat the given fanon as a running joke. In A Wand for Skitter, Skitter consider Blaise's fearing his mom offering him a drink to mean "not all fears have obvious meaning", while in Harry Is A Dragon and That's Okay, Blaise shows uncanny understanding of poisonous ingredients, have Bezoar in his pocket at all times, and even once brought bunch of mildly poisonous cupcakes for Harry to eat (who is widely known to be invulnerable) because he don't want his house elf eat them.
