We need a full Crackfic where Dumbledore snaps, decides to become a Villain, then realises he basically has no idea how to do that? So, he starts asking the Muggleborns for their favourite villains (because Wizarding Media is all 'Dark Lord this' and 'Dark Lord that' and that's a little bit close to home for him.)

Then the story is just Dumbledore trying out villain cliches and tropes and jotting down notes into some kind of manual for each. Mostly because I love the idea of a playful, humourous Dumbledore trying to pretend to be Dick Dastardly for a day. :D
