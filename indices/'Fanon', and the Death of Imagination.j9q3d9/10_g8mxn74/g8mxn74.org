I disregard all fanon. Just because a lot of people got together and perpetuated these ideas doesn't mean they're any more valid than any other fanfic idea. I don't even like most of it. Especially DAPHNE ice queen fanon. My latest Daphne in my Entwined Souls story is a cheerful and easygoing disabled girl. :) Also the adopted sister to my Girl Who Lived. :) :)
