JK thought it would be easier to tell the story if Harry was a moron. The only reason she had Harry not know what Death Eaters were was because she wanted to give exposition. Because a group of masked, cloaked evil men who tortured muggles, muggleborns and used Voldemort's mark needs exposition in regards to who they are.
