Cool, glad I could help. Storytelling is the family trade on my father's side, it ended professionally with my grandfather sadly. Still we always have jibber-jabbers when we all get together. Just sitting around telling bullshit stories with twists and turns no one else can guess.

It made working on an English degree, before running off to join the Army, both easy and hard. Short stories, song lyrics and poems are easily generated. Sticking to rules of writing was a pain.

Storytellers focused on gossip, learning tales, folklore and whatever was popular at the time. It's more public speaking than writing.

A well educated crowd will expect a story told well with dictation and eloquence. The common man wanted less rich tapestry and more a painting in words. One is woven with thousands of threads, the other through various sized strokes of color.

That's changed somewhat over the years but the core is still there. Rowling's used broad strokes and cleaned up the edges some with a finer brush. The broad strokes were still there though in her books.

Boy with troubled childhood gets saved by a giant who transports him to a world of magic. There he learns magic and makes two true friends. They have to overcome a great evil saving the magic world. This tests their skills and the knowledge they have gained so far. Harry and friends prove themselves true heroes who have grown this school year. Harry must return to the world of mortals at the end of school until next year.

I tell stories along those lines nightly to my kids. That was her story, she just had to fill in the details with broad strokes.

She told a great story, really she did. She just never wrote a book series, she wrote a series of stories she told. Maybe got off track, maybe it helped more, not sure, just needed to let it all out. Hope it helped again and glad the first post did!
