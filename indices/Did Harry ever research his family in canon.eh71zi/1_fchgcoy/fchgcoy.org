JK Rowling told us all a great story. She built a horrible world with more plot holes than there were holes in the book Holes.

Harry never looked into his family as it wasn't part of his story. Unless she needed to use it in some way.

An author builds a world, they look for inconsistencies and plot holes. A story teller plows ahead and just keeps building. So what if new information contradicts old? That part of the story is over, just keep telling the new parts.

Looking through the lenses of her being a story teller and most of the story issues make more sense.
