Hagrid worked at the school when James and Lily were students and then they were in the Order together, so he knew them and knew who their friends were. How would he know James's parents?

As for Hermione, that's putting too much stock into children. She's resourceful enough that she could have done that, and I would read some AU exploring this idea, but it's totally believable that the thought just never crossed her mind.
