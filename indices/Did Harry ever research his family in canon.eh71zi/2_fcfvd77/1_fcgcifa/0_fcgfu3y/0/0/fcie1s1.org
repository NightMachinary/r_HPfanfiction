Fleamont was in and out of Hogwarts before Hagrid ever got there, if the wiki dates are to be believed. It says he was born in 1909 or prior, so he'd get his letter in 1920 at the latest. Hagrid was there in the 40s, so it's not likely they met in school. With Euphemia it's possible since I can't find when she was born, though I doubt he would have gotten to know her well since he was expelled 3rd year.

I doubt many people alive have much info on Harry's paternal grandparents. They seem to have lead a quiet life and died peacefully.
