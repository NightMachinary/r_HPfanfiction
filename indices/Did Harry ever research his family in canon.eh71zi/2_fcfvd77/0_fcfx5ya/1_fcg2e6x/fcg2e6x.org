The Potters apparently had James late in life, so I can see them being a decade older than McGonagall and never crossing paths in any substantial way. Slughorn must have known Fleamont at least, but Harry avoided talking to him at all cost.

As for archives and Gringotts paper trail, no way a kid fresh out of cupboard uder the stairs is going to go asking for those. But I can see Harry post-Hogwarts piecing together his family history.
