There have to be ways though. McGonagall surely must have known his grandparents, regardless of what year you consider for her birth. Same for Slughorn. And there is no way there aren't books about Wizarding families, given how obsessed with heritage they are. /The Sacred 28/ cant be the only one, and even that one, I dont think Harry ever read it, right? The Ministry archives would have also been a possible trail to follow, he is The Boy Who Lived, no way they wouldnt help him. Heck, even Gringotts has to have had some financial records and such. Not to mention his parents lived next door to the most renowned historian in Britain, for gods' sake.

There have to be ways to piece together some info on his family, no way they would have completely vanished within a single generation.
