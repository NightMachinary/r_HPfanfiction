Even if there was no information and Voldemort burned down all the registries and record archives, that doesn't mean he wouldn't at least ask. He did come from the Muggle World, after all, where that information exists in abundance so the automatic thought of knowing the information isn't available wouldn't be there. Even asking and getting a 'no, that information can only be found in the family grimoire that burned down when wherever it was your family lived burned down' would be more emotionally-validating to a kid that's supposedly desperate to know his parents than never asking anyone anything ever unless someone is about twenty minutes from death.

I think realistically, the answer is simply Rowling's abominable worldbuilding coming into play again. "No questions! I haven't written the answers yet!"
