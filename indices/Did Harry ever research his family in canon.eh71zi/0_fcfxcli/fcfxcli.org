Harry, for some inexplicable reason, seemingly dropped pretty much any and all interest in the magical world and the history of his family (save for a few plot-related/convenient moments) as soon as book one ended. I mean, he didn't even know what /Death Eaters/ were until book four (!), let alone what his grandparents names' were.

As for who he could ask; McGonagall, his Head of House? Dumbledore, his Headmaster and (for some reason) guardian? Hagrid, Lupin through letters and during third year, perhaps even pick up a book in the library...
