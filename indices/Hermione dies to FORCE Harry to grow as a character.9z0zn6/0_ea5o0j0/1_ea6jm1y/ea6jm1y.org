I think Ron and Hermione should have had more lasting injuries/effects, Hermione through Dolohov's purple spell and Ron through the brains that attacked him in an already weakened mental state. Ginny could have broken something more serious than her ankle, and Luna and Neville could have gotten injured themselves, like Neville being hit with the cruciatus curse.
