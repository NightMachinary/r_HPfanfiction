Practicing spells inside a classroom and having mock duels with each other isn't the same as being in a firefight with those aiming to kill. Habitually studying spells is enough to get them killed, that's what it is.

Crabbe and Goyle Sr are inner circle Death Eaters - they're as valuable to Voldemort as Snape or Crouch Jr, and they wouldn't have gotten there without being useful. They're also veterans of the first war - they've fought and killed before. Against school children with moral complexes, they would win 11 times out of 10 if it weren't for the nerf.
