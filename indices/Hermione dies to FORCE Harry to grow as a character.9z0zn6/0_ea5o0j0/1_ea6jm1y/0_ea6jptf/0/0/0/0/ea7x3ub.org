  They're former terrorists
#+end_quote

You can call them whatever label you want, but that does not change the fact that they fought and killed in an actual war that went on for a few years. Calling them "terrorists" won't change that fact.

#+begin_quote
  The ones who aren't starved and insane are old and fat
#+end_quote

Uh, exactly which one of the Death Eaters is old and fat? They're not described as being young and in their prime, but that's no reason to assume that they're "old and fat" either.

#+begin_quote
  It's been more than a decade since most of them fought seriously
#+end_quote

It's funny that you use this against Death Eaters, but Molly Weasley is somehow exempt from this. Interestingly enough, Molly is the only one who's described as short and plump, but that doesn't affect her skills at all.

#+begin_quote
  they weren't keeping up their studies or staying in shape in the meantime. spend their days drinking

These are random fanon assumptions.

Even if these assumptions are true, adults generally have better physical capabilities compared to adolescent teenagers. Of the teenagers, only HP and GW are physically active, and only HG is good at actually reading up spells - but you can't cram the knowledge an adult would possess has into 5 years of intense study, that's just not possible.
