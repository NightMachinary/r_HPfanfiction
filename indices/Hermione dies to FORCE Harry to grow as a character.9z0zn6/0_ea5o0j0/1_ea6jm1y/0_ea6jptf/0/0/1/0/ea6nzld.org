You don't know if the Death Eaters were aiming to kill in OoTP? Wasn't the curse Dolohov fired at HG enough?

  Quite a stretch, considering the work Crouch, Snape, and Bellatrix have done for him. Dolohov, who was a follower of Voldemort in their school days, was still tortured for failing. Lucius, who loyally followed Voldemort, was still demeaned and humiliated for his failure. Crabbe, Goyle, Macnair, and their ilk seem to be farther down on the totem pole.

Not a stretch at all. Look at GoF - Voldemort doesn't summon every single one of his followers, he summons his closest ones. He specifically says, "My true family retunrs," where he's referring to his inner circle. Crabbe and Goyle were part of that inner cirlce, ergo they are (or at least were) very useful to Voldemort in the first war. They might not be as highly valued as Malfoy or Bellatrix, but they were right up there.

  We don't know that. As far as we know, only a handful of Death Eaters have killed

There isn't a single war where there have been no deaths on either side, the nonsensical approach to the second war notwithstanding. They were loyal Death Eaters to Voldemort, which means they would have taken part in raids, attacks and they would definitely have killed. It's not as if Voldemort was hosting tea parties and trying to get in power through charisma and politics. Same goes for all Death Eaters, not just Crabbe and Goyle.

The Death Eaters in Azkaban aren't all deragned either, despite what you think. Rookwood, Dolohov, Crouch Jr - none of these three are shown to be mad. Crouch Jr has one moment in the movies where he's distracted, otherwise he's capable of acting completely normal. Don't push Bellatrix's unhinged behaviour on the rest of them.

  Well the teenagers have their own strengths and advantages as well. They split up, which split the groups of Death Eaters, they were using guerilla tactics and hiding, and they had a head start. It's not like they won either. They only managed to hold out until help arrived.

You realise that whenever the children get hit with spellfire, the effects are not as damaging as you'd expect? Ginny gets a broken ankle. Neville gets a busted nose. THIS is what I meant by the nerf to Death Eaters - in a more realisitic fight, Ginny would have been hit with a curse that cleaved her leg off, and Neville would have been decapitated. Not broken noses or busted ankles.
