But we don't know that. All we know of the Death Eaters is that they're supporters of racial supremacy and followers of Voldemort. And it would have been an incredibly short war if all they were doing was running around, throwing killing curses at everyone they see.

  Crabbe and Goyle Sr are inner circle Death Eaters - they're as valuable to Voldemort as Snape or Crouch Jr, and they wouldn't have gotten there without being useful.

Quite a stretch, considering the work Crouch, Snape, and Bellatrix have done for him. Dolohov, who was a follower of Voldemort in their school days, was still tortured for failing. Lucius, who loyally followed Voldemort, was still demeaned and humiliated for his failure. Crabbe, Goyle, Macnair, and their ilk seem to be farther down on the totem pole.

  They're also veterans of the first war - they've fought and killed before.

We don't know that. As far as we know, only a handful of Death Eaters have killed and they're all deranged, unlike people like Lucius who are drawn to power and powerful people.

  Against school children with moral complexes, they would win 11 times out of 10 if it weren't for the nerf.

Well the teenagers have their own strengths and advantages as well. They split up, which split the groups of Death Eaters, they were using guerilla tactics and hiding, and they had a head start. It's not like they won either. They only managed to hold out until help arrived.
