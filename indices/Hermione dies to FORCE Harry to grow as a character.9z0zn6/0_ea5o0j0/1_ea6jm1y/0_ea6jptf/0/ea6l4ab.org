While rarely being showcased, all but Luna have been shown to be exceptional witches and wizards that habitually studied and practiced DADA for months. Aside from Dolohov and Bellatrix, I don't think it's stated anywhere that any of the Death Eaters are exceptional wizards or duelists, and it's not like the teenagers faced them head-on or that any of the Death Eaters were taken out in the process. And it's stated that Crabbe and Goyle are dumb as bricks, failing a class rigged in their favor, so who's to say that their fathers aren't as well?
