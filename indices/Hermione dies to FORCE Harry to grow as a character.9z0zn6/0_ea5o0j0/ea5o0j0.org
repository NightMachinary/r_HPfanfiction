Technically, the only one who should have made it out of the Ministry battle alive should have been HP, since the Death Eaters were specifically ordered to not kill him. That six teenagers managed to avoid getting killed by a group adult wizards who can kill without blinking, when said group of wizards is actively trying to kill them is just another one of the many nerfs the Death Eaters get throughout the series.
