Ron and Ginny are Weasleys, and therefore the lowest of the low. The Death Eaters ought to have given them the same treatment as Hermione, since the Weasleys are all blood traitors.

Luna, while a pureblood, is the daughter of a man their society widely views as deranged, so that's a bit of a stretch there too that they'd be asked to spare her.
