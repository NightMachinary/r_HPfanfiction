Yeah, this is a plothole.

Remus mentions that Andromeda and Ted Tonks are tortured for information on where HP and gang went, but this seemingly does not happen to the Weasleys, who HP is known to be great friends with. It doesn't make sense from the other side's perspective - if you want to spring a man out of hiding, a good first course of action should be attacking those he deems valuable. This never happens.
