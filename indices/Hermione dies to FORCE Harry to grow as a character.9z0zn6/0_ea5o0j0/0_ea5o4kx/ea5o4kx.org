Yep, and it's not even "Generic Mook Death Eaters like Crabbe and Goyle and Kid Malfoy" but actual top tier Inner Circle Death Eaters. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy at that. But even just one of the "Ministry Six" dying should have happened, and for this Prompt, i wanted it to be Hermione, so everyone realises "It's a war, stop pissing about with disarming charms and tickling spells and fucking kill your opponents". They didn't even have the exuse that the battle at the end of HBP had where they'd all had Felix Felicis and were relying on luckhax.
