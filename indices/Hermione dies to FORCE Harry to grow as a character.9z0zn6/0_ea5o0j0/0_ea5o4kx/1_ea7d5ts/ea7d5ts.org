I think the excuse was they didn't want to accidentally harm the prophecy orb. There's also the fact that for some reason everyone uses a wide variety of curses (the only reason for death eaters not to use unforgivables is to take advantage of silent casting, but that just means they should be using the strongest spell they can silently cast, as for the good guys it should probably just be stunners) I get it for Dumbledore vs Voldermort where they're both far too talented to actually get hit with any normal curse (Voldermort does try killing curses, he just stops when he realises Dumbledore is just going to block them with conjured objects or animated scenery) and resort to inventive displays of harder to dodge magic.

A fair number survived because they got taken out by something not instantly lethal and the fight ended fast enough to save them, which is OK I guess (it's realistic that they don't bother making sure they finish people off, since that's time not spent fighting those still standing)
