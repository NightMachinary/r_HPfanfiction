  Also, I'm not too sure about Bellatrix. She tortured Neville's parents to the point of insanity and then - kept them alive? Where in real life would this ever happen?

Probably the case of "Psychos were torturing them, were about to kill them before backup arrived to capture the Psychos" and Frank/Alice didn't get treated fast enough thus Insanity (In the real world, likely Comatose would be more realistic i suppose) (Why did no one ever try Elixir of Life or something, the Flamels would have probably helped if Dumbledore asked)
