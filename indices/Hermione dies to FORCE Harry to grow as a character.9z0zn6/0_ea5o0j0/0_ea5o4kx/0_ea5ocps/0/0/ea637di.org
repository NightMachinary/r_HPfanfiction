I think that's more a problem of how JKR unintentionally made the Avada the only spell that could be practically used in real-life duels (I think it was discussed on the HP sub a few months back). The only way that the DoM battle is plausible if we assume that the killing curse has its own set of problems when cast.

Also, I'm not too sure about Bellatrix. She tortured Neville's parents to the point of insanity and then - kept them alive? Where in real life would this ever happen?

And finally, you're right about how stupid it was to have Molly manage to defeat Voldemort's most powerful lieutenant. Here's a woman who stopped dueling after her first son was born (at the very least) and remained that way, without practice, for nearly three decades and now, out of nowhere, Mrs "Not my daughter, you bitch" appears, duels for hardly a couple of seconds and then actually KILLS Bellatrix. Wow!
