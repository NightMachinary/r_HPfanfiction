That people die in apparently.... sorry, which books for children have you been reading where there's at least one death a book? Seriously, we're have Quirrel in the first, multiple near deaths in the second, almost a trio of murder by werewolf in the third, Cedric died in the fourth, Sirius died in the fifth, Albus died in the sixth, and a whole slew of people died in the seventh and final book.

That is not material for children. Maybe the first 3 books could be argued that they're for children, but once the death tournament is introduced, it's not as kid friendly.
