I don't know how we got through them. Because the other day I got irritated when my nephew refused to even open a Harry Potter book because he got the bejeezus scared out of him while watching the CoS movie.

Now, I realize that maybe the series is indeed too dark for children and maybe we were just a bunch of kids starving for a well-written fantasy series.
