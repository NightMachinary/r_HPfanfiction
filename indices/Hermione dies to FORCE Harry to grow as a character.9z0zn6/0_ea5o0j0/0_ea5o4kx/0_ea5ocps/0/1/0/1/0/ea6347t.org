... may I have whatever drugs you are on? DH is not a coming of age story. It's a "I'm the Chosen One and need to stop the big bad evil from killing people I care about" story. Harry had to become an adult at age 14 when a fellow student was murdered in front of him, he had to become an adult when his friends were essentially being held hostage by adults that had no qualms killing children, he had to become an adult while sticking to his promise of feeding Dumbledore the poison that seemed to have him relive his worst moment in life. DH was Harry trying to survive and outsmart people that wanted to kill him. That's not a coming of age story.
