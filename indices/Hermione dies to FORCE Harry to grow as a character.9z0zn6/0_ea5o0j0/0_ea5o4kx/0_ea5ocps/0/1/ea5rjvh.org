First, wow there dude. Remember, this is a children's book. And I think killing would have been the worst choice they could have made. Each od Harry's friends are bargaining chips for the orb and more over, they are kids. What ddo seasoned DEs have to feaar them so much as to kill them without even playing. Its Harry's escape and destruction of the orb that labels their mission a failure. Voldemort doesn't give an ounce of shit about the others.

He gives so little shit that he doesn't even know who Neville Longbottom is in DH, you know, the substitute chosen one.
