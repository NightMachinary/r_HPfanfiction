Crabbe and Goyle Sr are basically as mentally deficient as Jr, Fiendfyre is off the tables as Harry has to live and the Prophecy too so all they'll really do is "Lolspam Avada" in a room full of cover like the generic Mooks that they are. It's the fact that the smart Death Eaters didn't manage to kill a single teenager that makes you wonder. Bellatrix could have just collapsed the shelves as Luna ran through, as she knew Harry had the right Prophecy, crushing Luna under the rubble and glass.
