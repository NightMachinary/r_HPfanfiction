The entire story is wrapped up. There's an end. I found it satisfying, because lots of things that didn't make sense do, and the end wasn't a deux ex machina. The Ender's Game tribute is loooooooooooooooooong. I think if it ever got rewritten and about a third of it was chopped out, it could be wonderful.
