Putting Bella into same state as Frank and Alice would not be poetic justice. It would be the hero's foible.

Whenever someone asks for this kind of stuff, I get the feeling they completely missed the point of the books. Harry Potter books are about staying pure to yourself, no matter how much the outside worlds wants to change you, about staying true to your ideals and figthing for them. There are only two instances canon Harry uses Curiciatus, on Bella and on Carrow. On Bella it doesn't work. On Carrow he is under heavy stress and the knowledge that two evil people practically defiled his home and then went onto spit on McGonagall's face in front of him angers him a great deal yet he stops after a few seconds still.

Both cases were used by JK to show Harry's emotional state, magical understanding and character.

With Bella it fails because even his GODFATHER's death doesn't give him enough anger and hatred to widh upon someone untold pain.

With Carrow it works because now Harry has seen what war looks like first hand and still, even with necessary anger mustered, he doesn't have it in him do actually cause damage.

I mean the main challenge Harry faces since his first year has been the same: there is no good or evil, there is only power vs. Doing the right thing even when its harder, period. It's what makes Harry a hero, the hero. That's why he's Voldemort's equal, because he is the opposite of Voldemort even when their stories rings so similar.
