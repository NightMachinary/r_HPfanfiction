On edit one: No one said anything about not killing, that is inevitable and I'm not against Harry taking a life in a story. I am against Harry being capable of murder and torture. There sre many ways to incapacitate someone without resorting to magics that would require Harry to give up on five years of character development.

On edit two: But that's the thing that tangibly separates Harry from Voldemort. From Olivander's words on expecting greatness, to hats advice that Slytherin would make him great, everything in Harry's life makes him afraid of becoming another Voldemort. That's one of the reasons he clings to the idea of being just Harry so vehemently. A character that well defined with his self imposed morality wouldn't just throw around dark magic like that.

Now, if you made his descend into darkness a gradual process, that would be believable.
