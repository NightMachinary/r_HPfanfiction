So, you throw an 'expelliarmus' (hope the other person doesn't use a shield), catch the wand (hope your expelliarmus is strong enough to bring the wand all the way to you and that you have good hand eye coordination) and break it (either by using both hands or a cutting charm or something) all the while trying to dodge other spells/people. Then you have to worry about whether the person has a cursed dagger or something (eg. Bella) or are werewolves or get a hold of someone else's wand (or carry extras).
