Hell even the disarming charm works proved you just break their wand after it hits. Now you don't have to overcome the natural mental blocks most people have when it comes to hurting someone else, even an enemy, without training or being a socio/psycopath. You still take them out of the fight, and they will probably have some issues mentally, in the short term, because of how wands are shown to be close companions.
