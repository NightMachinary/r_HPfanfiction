1. Incapacitating a more skilled/powerful oponent who is trying to kill you is a lot harder than killing them because you don't have control of the fight, your oponent does. In modern times it works because law enforcement is on average better trained and armed than average criminals, but even they have shoot outs where people die and police are forced to use lethal force against violent offenders (we'll avoid the racism arguments because that's a more complex issue). Stunners and magical binds are not going to win any group fights, and the DA pretty much only learned decent shield charms because Harry taught them and even those can fail.

2. Anything Harry does to incapacitate can be undone - 'ennervate' or other counter spells pretty much mean that the only incapacitate opponent is dead or seriously injured (and I don't see anyone having the time or the opportunity to go around providing basic medical aide to Death Eaters). By serious injury I mean cutting off a limb, preferrably their wand hand.

3. Some, like werewolves, can only be fought off with more powerful (and therefore more damaging) spells.

4. I'm personally not saying Harry and co. should be throwing around AK's like they're candy, but setting opponents on fire, cutting them up, those make sense to use. If you want him to transfigure people into inanimate objects until the end of the fight, then he needs to be motivated to study, doesn't he? Which means Hermione needs to go in order for Harry to take his academics more seriously.

5. It's not darkness, it's self defence. Voldie is separated from Harry because Voldie is a psychopath - he does not feel guilt for anything he does, sees no issue with killing and torturing random strangers, and cares only about himself. Voldie is also a narcissist and a control freak. Harry is none of those things and so he is not Voldemort - killing others in self defence will not turn him into voldemort or make him a murderer. In a gun fight, someone is going to die, and wands are a lot more dangerous than guns. I don't like evil Harry fics, but I want a realistic Harry, a soldier older than his years, not a 17 year old Ghandi who achieves world peace by commiting assisted suicide.

6. What character development? We have 5 years of an emotionally abused (if not worse) kid being implicitely told that nothing will get done unless he endangers himself and his friends. The root cause of the issues (the damage that childhood isolation and abuse has on people) is not addressed, we only have Tom turning into a terrorist and Harry being forced into a martyr role.
