I agree with you on first four points and that's what I mean by incapacitate. Take them out of the fire and if they die because Harry was heavy handed, that's okay. He'll grow with the experience. But I completely disagree Hermione. Without Hermione, he'd fall even further behind because in Harry's mind Ron is the bar for normalcy. I've reread the most of the books recently and realised just how much Harry panders to Ron's whims. To be honest, if JK hadn't done a great job of establishing Harry's loneliness before his friendship with Ron, or if I started on the books at midpoint like in from the third or fourth book, I'd suspect he's gay, not that I'd have mind. So I don't think its Hermione's help that holds him back ass much as his desire to always take Ron as his baseline. On the contrary, most of the times, Hermione is the one to be his support when his lack of confidence strikes.

I feel like you are far too hung up on the martyr point and that's really not accurate. It was Dumbledore's schemes that helped hin survive a second curse, something that had to happen for Voldemort to die. Yes, Dumbledore's manipulations to ensure it happened were underhanded not to mention borderline evil but they were necessary evil.
