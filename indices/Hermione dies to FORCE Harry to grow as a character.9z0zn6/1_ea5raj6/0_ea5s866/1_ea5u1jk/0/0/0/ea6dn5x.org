I just have a problem with children routinely putting themselves in danger while the adults are like 'good thing you were there, otherwise things would not have turned out well. Good job!' That's my biggest issue with the first two books, and I think they pretty much set the pattern for self-sacrificing Harry rather than use common sense Harry.

Harry would have been aware of how well Ron's brothers did, as well as how his class mates are doing just from socializing with them in class, so I don't see how he would only use Ron as a comparison. I freely admit I don't like Hermione, but even disregarding that, I have issues with her impact on Harry's academics. Mostly, it's because it is very obvious that she and Harry have different styles of learning (rote memorization vs hands on) but she kept expecting Harry to use her study methods to succeed. When he tries to use his own methods, she scoffs and nags about how he's not doing things properly or not following the teachers' specific instructions. She does that to other people, too, but Harry's childhood left him very vulnerable to that kind of influence so he listened more to her than other people did (except Neville, maybe). This then leaves him to choose between goofing off and barely passing or Hermione's style of very boring and exhaustive learning - as a pre-teen/teen, which would you have picked?

As for the first part of your reply as well as the martyr comment, your first post was about Harry not killing or using lethal spells because that would make him a murderer. If you've changed your mind, then why are we arguing about it? I want a Harry that fights back with all he has, but not one who goes psycho-assassin and throws unforgivables in all directions.
