  Putting Bella into same state as Frank and Alice would not be poetic justice. It would be the hero's foible.

Is there a deleted comment? No one talked about doing that to Bella, only about Neville and Molly tag teaming her and Neville getting the death stroke. Also, no one talked about Harry being callous or being grittier, we're only annoyed because Hermione's presence in later books either out right hampers Harry from academic progress (HBP book provides valid and useful brewing tips) or gives him an academic crutch thus preventing his character development. Also, especially in the movies, her presence gets in the way of Ron's character development and we end up with poor Ron constantly being accused of marrying above himself and ruining Harry and Hermione's great love story (not a fan of Harmony BTW). I get that JKR wrote her in as a savant or some such, but it's so obvious that she is there to primarily keep Harry and Ron from being forced to develop academic intelligence or logical thinking that her character is its own plot hole.

Edit: In a war, soldiers are not evil just because they use the same force as their opponents. What you said does not make a hero, it makes a martyr.

Edit: Actually, mental dead Bella and darker Harry were both mentioned, but not to the point where he is Voldie's new twin.
