I did suggest that, but as more of a SNAP Switch triggered lose control of yourself and give into the Darkness temporary insanity moment. Like what he tried but didn't have the will to do when it happened to Sirius who he only met a few times, if it was Hermione he might be pushed over the edge, and then regret it horribly afterwards, but there's consequences for Voldemort's side as well as Harry's (Hermionecrutch is gone, Voldemort's top Death Eater is mentally dead) and Harry gets over it eventually, but realises that it's really War.

Even Jeanne D'arc killed people in war , and she was literally Saint Martyr. Basically a realistic side where Harry actually shows negative emotions like Rage and Hatred rather than just being a moody teenager (If it wasn't a Children's book, would harry have told the Dursleys to fuck off at least once?, or would that be too OOC for him) when people he love actually die. Rather than Canon Harry "She's torturing me but it's K don't tell anyone don't do anything about it I'll just endure' way of dealing with Umbridge (who should have been executed post war)
