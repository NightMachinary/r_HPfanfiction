Umbridge and Mental faculties, well, she was a Neonazi in Wizard form, and literally ran her own Concentration Camps for Muggleborns, and "Half Breeds" later in the war, and actively tried to murder Harry with Dementors. Imperio'ing her before she sets her Inquisitorial Squad up wouldn't be a problem morally at least. Not like you'd get caught with how inept the Wizarding World is

Have them Claim it was the real Moody most of the time, but kept under the Imperius Curse by the Imposter, ordered to act normally, and that the only time the Imposter was around was to slip Harry's name into the cup and to turn the cup into the Portkey. It shows Moody as caught off guard, and the Imperius is probably really hard to dect if they're ordered to act normally sleeper agent style.
