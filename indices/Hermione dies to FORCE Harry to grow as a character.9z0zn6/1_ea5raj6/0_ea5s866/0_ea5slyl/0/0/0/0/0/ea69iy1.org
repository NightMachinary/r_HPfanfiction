  Keeping her under a powerful enough Confundus that she thinks everything is above board and going as it was before but she's actively not hurting anyone

Practically, that would have been well nigh impossible. The Confundus would have to be powerful and maintained constantly to ensure Umbridge didn't slip for a moment. And prolonged exposure would have almost certainly curtailed her mental faculties, causing another set of problems. And finally, you think the entire Slytherin house and her very own Inquisitorial Squad wouldn't notice when she weirdly began behaving out of character?

A good solution would be the Polyjuice but, like you said, only Sirius or Moody (or maybe, Tonks) would have the balls to do it.

  why didn't Dumbledore just hire the real Moody for the DADA professor so Umbridge was never shoehorned in?

Because that would have meant that the fact that Dumbledore and the entire Hogwarts staff hadn't managed to identify an impostor for an entire year would come out in the open. And with gross mismanagement like that, especially coming from someone like Dumbledore, it would mean that parents would be loath to send their kids to Hogwarts
