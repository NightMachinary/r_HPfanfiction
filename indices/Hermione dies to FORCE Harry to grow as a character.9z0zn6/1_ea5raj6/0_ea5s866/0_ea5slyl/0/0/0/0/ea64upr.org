Keeping her under a powerful enough Confundus that she thinks everything is above board and going as it was before but she's actively not hurting anyone? There are ways around it, they just require loose Morals. Not Imperius curse loose morals, but that would work too, it'd just be too OOC for anyone save for possibly Sirius and Moody by that point

On that note, why didn't Dumbledore just hire the real Moody for the DADA professor so Umbridge was never shoehorned in?
