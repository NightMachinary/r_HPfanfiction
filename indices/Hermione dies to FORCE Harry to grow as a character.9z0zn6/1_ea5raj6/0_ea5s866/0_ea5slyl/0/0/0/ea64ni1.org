See, now you're reaching. What do you think realistically would have happened if an adult, a.k.a McGonagall /did/ see those incidents?

Report to Dumbledore? But he didn't have the power to fire her. Report to the ministry? Fudge refused to believe a death eater's confession under Veritasium and you think he'd believe an allegation about how one of his most trusted officials, who he himself sent to Hogwarts and gave almost unlimited powers, was abusing Dumbledore's poster child? He'd probably say that Harry did it to himself. Or yell "Fake News", if we want to make it palatable to today's audience.

The only alternative was somebody attacking her in some way. Again what do you think would have happened if somebody did that? Yes, I know Hermione managed to get Umbridge attacked by a horde of Centaurs, but it was the result of a spur-of-the-moment idea (under extreme stress) and a miracle, really, that it happened the way it did.

Edit - Also, don't forget when the goddamn Minister of Magic, ol' Scrimegour himself, was presented with evidence of Umbridge's abuse (Harry showing his arm at the Burrow) - he did nothing. Umbridge was certainly not fired, let alone arrested, because she managed to get back to a powerful position under Voldy's puppet regime
