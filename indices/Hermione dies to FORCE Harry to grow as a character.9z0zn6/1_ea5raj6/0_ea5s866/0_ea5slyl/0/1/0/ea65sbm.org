Yeah, but we have seven books to see how Harry's particular reaction plays out, so it's not generalising to all victims of abuse, it's specifically about Harry. I'm just saying that he's not weak or stupid for just putting up with it, it's totally a plausible reaction for a child abused the way Harry was.
