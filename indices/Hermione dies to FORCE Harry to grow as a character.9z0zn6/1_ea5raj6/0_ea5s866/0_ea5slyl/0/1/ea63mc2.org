I'm honestly about 50/50 on this statement because an abused child perspective changes depending on the scenario and their own personality. Children are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. Generalising abused children into saying they act meek and do what adults say is quite wrong.

Some are loud, others replicate their abusers, some never bounce back, others become functioning, some end up meek and submissive, and others create a new life. I can tell you for a fact, I will never trust an adult in my life. I would sooner die than turn to an adult for something. That abuse never leaves you, no matter what. Sometimes you try and absorb so much suffering so others don't have to feel it, even if you don't mean to.
