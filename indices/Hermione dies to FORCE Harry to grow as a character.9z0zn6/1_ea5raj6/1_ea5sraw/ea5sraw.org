  It would be the hero's foible.

But, but, but the books would be so much better if Harry had just been the amoral extension of wish-fulfillment that edgy fanfiction authors want him to be! Some kind of perfect amalgamate of Thor, Lex Luthor, Iron Man and Arnold Schwarzenegger's [[https://youtu.be/NzvFNLAnYNw][Conan]]: Self sufficient and not afraid to pay brutal retribution to his enemies. It would be sooo awesome duuude! Friendship, love and mutual trust are totally useless. He should be studying Runes and Arithmancy during some kind "training montage" and then just build an awesome magical armor, allowing him to fight the Battle of Hogwarts all on his own, while his fans and admirers cheer him on from the sidelines! After all, the moral of the stories is that power is what truly matters, right? ... right?

PS: Is it very noticeable that I'm not too fond of what Super Hero Movies have done to the cultural meme of being heroic?
