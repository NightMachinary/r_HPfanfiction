I totally agree with everything you said but you missed that he should monologue more, because everyone around him might miss out on his superior reasoning otherwise.

And the magical armor is a good start but everyone knows that he can't be a true hero without a new wardrobe and maybe contacts so we can see his blue orbs sparkle like hardened emeralds that remind everyone of aardvarka kcadavera while he glares.

I'm sick and tired of this wussy Harry that allows other people to act like they're more skilled than him, they're just show offs and next time Herry hears they're in mortal peril he should let them suffer to teach them not to be insufferable know it allz.
