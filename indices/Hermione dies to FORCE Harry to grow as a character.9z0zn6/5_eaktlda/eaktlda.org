I liked book Hermione I just thought the portrayal of other classmates was a little off. So basically there's one student in the entire class who gives a shit, only one student who even reads the books? Whenever there's a scene and it goes something like “only Hermione raised her hand” I always think, “this is a school where you learn magic and non of these kids seems to have any interest in learning it”. Particularly the scene in Slughorn's first potion class, this is an NEWT level class and only one student knows the potions. That would be like only one student know compounds in an AP chemistry class, it just makes no sense.

Also I always felt like it would have been better if Ron filled the reader on more of the wizard world stuff. In GoF it should be Ron who tells Harry what the dark mark is, he lives in the wizarding world and he's not supposed to recognize the symbol of the most evil wizard ever. That would be like if someone drew a Swaztika and I was like, “woah what's that?”. One of my favorite Ron scenes in GoF was when he was explaining the history of Giants to Harry, because it makes sense he would know that because it would be pretty common knowledge in the Wizarding world.
