Thanks for the recs! Of those I've read Dagger and Rose (and loved it), as well as Escape to Darkness (really disappointed this one is abandoned).

I started The Awakening but I'm pretty put off by the romance angle right off the bat. I'm not necessarily opposed to some romance but this seems pretty forced.
