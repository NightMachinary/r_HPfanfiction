While I know of a number of Moody as mentor stories, none are >80k words and not abandoned, so I'll not mention them.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] has Dumbledore taking an active mentoring role. Similarly for Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] and Abraxan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire][The Refiner's Fire]] series.

Kmfrank's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]] has Grindelwald as mentor, but you won't like it (it's only 50k words and abandoned).
