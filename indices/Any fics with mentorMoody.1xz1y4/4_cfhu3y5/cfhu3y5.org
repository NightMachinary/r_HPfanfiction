[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter & The Last Avatar]] features a mentor-Moody, it's fairly long at this point and seems to be updated regularly. It's also a really good Avatar: The Last Air Bender crossover. Personally, I'm not an obsessive fan of the TV show, it was far after my time. That said I definitely think it works really well in this FF.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.
