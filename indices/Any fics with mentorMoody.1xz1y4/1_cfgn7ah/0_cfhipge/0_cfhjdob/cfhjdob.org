I too prefer longer fics, but I'd say its worth it. Afterall, I did spend the rest of the day reading the one shots.

There are some problems (e.g. sometimes stories are repeated with only minor changes), but for the most part they are worth it. Just remember to feel free to skip ahead if you're not liking a story.
