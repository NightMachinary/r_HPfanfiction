  (like, I would think that herbology and potions would be related, but that doesn't seem to be the case?

Think of it like gardening and cooking. Sure, one creates some of the products that go into the other, but that doesn't mean there's any cross-over skills.

Like, you can be a great gardener who only grows flowers/shrubs/trees/etc. Not edible fruits and vegetables. And just because you're a deft hand with a trowel doesn't mean you can fillet for squat, to say nothing of dealing with hot burners and stoves. Or just because you know the best fertilizer to grow tomatoes with, that in no way informs you of the best wine to pair with a bisque. Or what about any meats? Those are a big part of cooking but obviously have nothing to do with gardening at any point in the process. And vice versa.

Same with herbology and potions. Sure there's a bit of cross-over: the potioneer needs to know that her ingredients were grown/gathered correctly, and the herbologist may have some idea of what his produce is used for so he knows what to stock up on, or to accomodate any of the potioneer's requests. Overall though, they are very different fields and skills.

(Also, consider Gilderoy Lockehart. He seemed very unskilled at most magic, but was an expert in one specific field- obliviation (when not using a broken wand, that is). His skill there did not translate to other areas.)
