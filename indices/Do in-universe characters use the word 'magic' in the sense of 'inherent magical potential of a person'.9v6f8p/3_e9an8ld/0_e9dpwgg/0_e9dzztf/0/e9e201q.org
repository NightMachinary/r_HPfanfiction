Nah. it's just like any skill/talent/field of study in real life. Some people are better at some things, others are better at other things. Some people are really good at nearly everything, others not so much. If you're best at one thing then by definition I suppose you're weaker at other subjects, but only relative to yourself, you know? You could still be well above average in even your weakest subject. Consider Dumbledore, Riddle, or even Snape, who all seem to have been prodigies who excelled in multiple fields of magic, although they had particular individual strengths.

Sometimes there are skills that are cross-applicable to multiple fields- knowledge of musical theory will help when playing just about any instrument, but knowledge of how to /write/ music won't move your fingers to actually play a trumpet. Or one could be good at a 'meta' level skills- ie. Hermione was really good a buckling down and /studying/, rather than being intuitively good/skilled/interested in a certain subject, like Neville with herbology.
