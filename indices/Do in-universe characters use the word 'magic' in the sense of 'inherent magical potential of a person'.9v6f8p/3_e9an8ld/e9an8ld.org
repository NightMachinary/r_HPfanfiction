The HP has a very soft magical system in that we don't get a lot of information on the 'science' of magic - we don't know how magical power is related to age, effort, experience, etc. or whether being powerful in one type of magic would in anyway relate to or impact on other types of magic (like, I would think that herbology and potions would be related, but that doesn't seem to be the case? Also, DADA and charms, etc.). From reading the books, we just get the idea that witch+wand+knowledge of spell A = magic A
