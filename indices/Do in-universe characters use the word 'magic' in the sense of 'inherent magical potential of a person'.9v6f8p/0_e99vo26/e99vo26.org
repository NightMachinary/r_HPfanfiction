Magic, as it's used in the books, does appear to be both a tangible, grammatically uncountable substance (you "have" magic in the same way someone "has" water in their blood; that is, you can't say you have /one/ magic) and an intangible abstraction of skill (you "can do" magic). This is not just a Harry Potter thing, though, as nobody will missunderstand either usage.

Generally, however, the characters in-universe prefer the more specific terminology of "being" a witch/wizard than "having" magic. While I can't say for sure why this is, I speculate this is because magical creatures also have magic, while being a wizard is distinctly human, and wizards are generally racist/speciest.
