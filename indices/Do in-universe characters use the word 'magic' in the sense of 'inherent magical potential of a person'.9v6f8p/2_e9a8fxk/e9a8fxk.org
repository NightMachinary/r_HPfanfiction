I don't have access to my books at the moment, but there's one instance, when Dumbledore is taking Harry to the cave, that he says something of the sort about how Harry's magic probably doesn't even register (in reference to the fact that Voldemort's boat will only take one adult wizard across the lake) next to Dumbledore's own.

This scene is also the basis for a lot of fanon as far as power levels and magical cores. If anyone has the direct quote?
