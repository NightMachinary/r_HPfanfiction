I'm too lazy to look for it, but there is a scene where Dumbledore say something along the lines of "Tom's mind is as sharp as it was when he left Hogwarts", so it's debatable whenever the Horcruxe had a direct effect on his mind or not.

Also, Canon Voldemort is still pretty charismatic, far from the Crucio crazy manic we sometimes see in fanon (his discussion with Harry in PS, his monologue in OotP or even the Death Eater meeting in DH). The only time he truly "lost it" is when the Goblins told him Harry stole his Horcruxe, and that's kinda understandable considering the situation. I always liked to attribute the differences between Young Tom and Voldemort to his difference in situation. Young Tom was just a talented orphan of dubious origins, who had to charm people to do his bidding. Voldemort is at the top, and he know it, he doesn't have to keep any charade.
