Indeed. Tom Riddle is this supper smart, friendly, charismatic, do-no-wrong young man, that has everyone fall for him. Voldemort is pretty much the complete opposite.

It's easy to make the claim that making so many Horcruxes messed him up mentally. But he isn't the only discrepancy of this type in Rowling's work, so I'm thinking it might be more on her.
