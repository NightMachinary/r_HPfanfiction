The other canon method of immortality is the Philosopher's Stone. Dumbledore actually discusses this in HBP and it sounds like the stone would work if more horcruxes weren't possible.

  ‘Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,' said Dumbledore. ‘But there are several reasons why, I think, a Philosopher's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.

  ‘While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain his immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable.
