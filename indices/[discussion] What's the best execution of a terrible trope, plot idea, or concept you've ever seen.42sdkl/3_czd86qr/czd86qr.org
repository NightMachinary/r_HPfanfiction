The accidental magical bond was huge for a long time, and spawned many ridiculous fics. linkffn(Bond by Anna Fugazzi), however, is an excellent example of the cliche well-written.

linkffn(The Marriage Stone) is a good example of the Ministry mandated marriage law fic. Although abandoned, it does clock in at 381,000 words and 77 chapters, so there's plenty of material.
