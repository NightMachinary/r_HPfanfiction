Hey, no judgement. Just like I refuse to read anything, not matter how good it is meant to be, with Harry/Gabrielle or Harem. Some highlights of the marriage stone so you never have to read it:

- Pureblood history of sword fights and honour duels which makes sense.
- Severus is tattooed
- Severus has family who are not just 2D place holders
- A magical community beyond just Hogwarts
- Eldritch abominations
- Norse mythology
- Intelligent Dragons
- Harry becomes King of everything and isn't happy about it at all
- End of the world, which actually kills millions (at least) of people.
