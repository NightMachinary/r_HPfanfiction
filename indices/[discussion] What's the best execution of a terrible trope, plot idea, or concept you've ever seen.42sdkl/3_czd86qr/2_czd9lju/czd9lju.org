I think part of the success of the marriage stone, is that even though it starts off as a Harry/Severus marriage fic, it really isn't about that at all. I mean even the fact it is close to 400,000 words and Harry and Sev have barely gotten past heavy petting and it still doesn't feel like enforced UST shows how not just about their relationship it is. It has a rich background of culture and new ideas. It's a pity it ends with most of the world in an unrecoverable death like state, and no real end in sight.
