Not really, no. Being well written doesn't mean it's not cliche. I've never really been a fan of the whole idea of "taking a trope and doing it proper". You can sprinkle flowers over a pile of poo, but it's still fundamentally unchanged. I haven't seen anything written well enough as to make me forget that fact.
