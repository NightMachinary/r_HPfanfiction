Science fiction is a genre. Fantasy is a genre. Time Travel is a plot device that is used in multiple different genres like science fiction and fantasy.

Tropes are also often plot devices. More broadly, they are a "figure of speech" in narrative story telling which are recognizable to audiences. Some are big enough to create a framework for a story (like soul bonds or marriage laws). Some aren't. Some are used so often that they become cliches. Some aren't. Some are difficult to use well. Some aren't.

Do you really want to try to argue that there aren't any tropes in Star Wars? Lord of the Rings?

Shakespeare?

Please, don't pretend that there is some sort of "pure" sort of narrative fiction out there that has not been infected with the "curse" of tropes. They are everywhere, even if the authors aren't using them consciously, and their presence does not automatically mean that a story is bad.

What matters most is the skill of the storyteller.

Oh, and whether something is "cliche" or not depends on the audience. A cliche is not simply something that is overused, but something that distracts the audience because they are annoyed by how overused it is. So what you find distracting isn't necessarily what I or someone else finds distracting. And if you use something in a manner that is unexpected, you'll surprise the audience, meaning that it stops being cliche. That is possible.

Once again, what matters is the skill of the storyteller.
