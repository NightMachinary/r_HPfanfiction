Both Hermione and Ginny don't seem all that bothered by the idea of Molly using love potions, however, so it makes no sense for H/Hr or H/G shippers to bash her for that, considering Hermione and Ginny canonically react by giggling. Plus, we have no idea what love potion Molly used; while I still wouldn't condone using love potions of any kind, it's pretty unlikely that Molly was using amortentia or something almost as powerful.
