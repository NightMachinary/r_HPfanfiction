  If I remember correctly didn't Molly allude to using love potions on Arthur?
#+end_quote

It's only described that she made a love potion as a /young/ girl and that she, Hermione and Ginny were giggly about it.

  And she's a bit of a bigot as proven by her attitude towards Fleur in canon.
#+end_quote

Where are you getting this from? She's behaving like a typical mother who has trouble letting go of her son. She doesn't believe that Fleur truly loves her son and that as soon as the "we're in love" phase is over or when Bill is no longer handsome Fleur will dump him for the next best thing.

Molly is proven wrong after Bill got scarred.

Sometimes it would do you well to reread the canon books instead of relying what fanfiction writers say in their works or ANs.

As for Molly bashing, for me Molly bashing is pure Freudian. A fanfic writer have issue with their own mother and, with Molly being literally the only mother figure in the entire book series, bashes Molly as a stand in.
