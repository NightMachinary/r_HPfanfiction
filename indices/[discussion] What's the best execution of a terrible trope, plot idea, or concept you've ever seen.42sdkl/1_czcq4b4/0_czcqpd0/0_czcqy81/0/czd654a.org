I see a lot of H/G stories that bash Molly because she doesn't want Ginny to sleep with Harry at the age of 11, 12 or 13.

True, there are plenty of fics that just use Molly's mothering character as a way to create good conflicts, but there's still a lot of stories that just mindlessly bash her. Shame.
