Dumbledore being evil is very well supported character interpretation if you look at HP books from realistic viewpoint instead( [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment]] )

Problem is that there are hundred of plotholes in HP books (many listed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1624376/ARedHair]])

When you ask why Dumbledore did nothing in those points' Occam razor explanation is that because he is evil, or insane or completely incompetent of any combination of these. Best good Dumbledore fic to address these was that he took magical oaths that make him unable to do anything with DE as he took oath to never harm pureblood wizard...

Problem is that when most writes starts depicting Dumbledore as clever manipulative bastard which is easy to do they couldn't stay true to his character. So after mandatory shopping trip and showing Dumbledore manipulations (and in bad ff finding Weasley's stealing which is contrary to evidence as if it was case then Ron would have Nimbus 2000 from 'uncle's inheritance) writers couldn't come with decent plan for Dumbledore where he wins some tactical victories. Instead he becomes Albus Dolores 'I am supreme mugwump.' Dumbledore.

While I don't know many good stories where Dumbledore switches from clever to idiot in chapter 5 there are many good stories with evil Dumbledore. A prototype what evil Dumbledore should do is linkffn(Partially kissed hero) where DD has 13 horcruxes, people believe Daily prophet because it contains compulsion for it... Another notable one is linkffn(Harry Potter and sorting hat's gift).
