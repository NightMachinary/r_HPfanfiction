  When I see Dumbledore bashing I prefer the subtler "the road to help is paved with good intentions" way. Where Dumbledore may mean the best, but might not have the whole story or is too old to see a different way.

I don't think that's bashing though. That sounds like a valid interpretation of Dumbledore based on his actions in the books. Just because someone is painted over with a grey scale doesn't mean they're being bashed. Dumbledore bashing, to me, is making him a cartoon villain of himself, mumbling about the Greater Good, giving out laced lemon drops and usually stopped by those meddling kids.
