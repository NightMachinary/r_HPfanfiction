When I see Dumbledore bashing I prefer the subtler "the road to help is paved with good intentions" way. Where Dumbledore may mean the best, but might not have the whole story or is too old to see a different way.

Molly bashing often comes across as she's just in it for the money or to make her big Weasley family dream come true. There needs to be depth to it most times like trying to restore the house of Prewitt or Weasley.

Ron canonically deserves bashing in my opinion. However, that's because I feel he lacks character development. Linkffn(a cadmean victory) features some decent character development for Ron and Hermione both.
