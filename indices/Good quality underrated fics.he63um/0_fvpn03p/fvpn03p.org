I have no idea if it's really considered underrated or if I'm just not in the fandom loop enough, but I haven't really seen people talk about linkao3(Never Grow A Wishbone by ShanaStoryteller) too much. Warning, it is Drarry, but it's also an incredibly intriguing take on pureblood society, with excellent worldbuilding, and that's why I read it. Over 120k words, and completed.

Her other long HP fic is linkao3(survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller). That one's more popular, and perhaps it's not quite underrated, but it's over 350k words at this point if you want something long to get through. It's still updating without looking like it's going to be abandoned, and it's one of my personal favorites.
