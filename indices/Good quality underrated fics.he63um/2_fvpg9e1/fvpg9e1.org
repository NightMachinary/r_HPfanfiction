Starfox is pretty widely liked on here from what I've seen.

And I've seen international triwizard tournament a fair bit recently - I just read it last week and really enjoyed it.

As for reccs, I think James Spookie is an author a lot like Starfox in that it's generally well-written, but mostly been around long enough people don't think to suggest it that often. If you haven't read his stuff, my favorites are linkffn(legacy preservation act) and linkffn(things we do for love)

I also think linkffn(a different sort of bond by balder) is a really fun read, probably flies under the radar because it's abandoned though
