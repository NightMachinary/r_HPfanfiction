Controlling/manipulative relationships:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/][The Devil You Know]] - Similar premise to "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux" but with a more humorous bent.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7456444][Pianissimo]] - Extremely disturbing single-point-of-departure oneshot set postwar: Harry picked up the deformed thing-under-the-bench in Kings Cross. (Word of caution on the tags: the author labeled it as dub-con, but it really should have been tagged as non-con.)

More lighthearted:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7912882/][Dance with the Devil]] - In year 6 Harry forms an alliance with the scarcrux in order to collect and reassemble Voldemort's soul pieces.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13212984/][A Memory of Shadow]] - Harry befriends the scarcrux during the summer after 1st year.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] - fem!Harry is the personification of death and grows up befriending the scarcrux.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725/][Bound by Souls]] - A fusion with the universe of the /His Dark Materials/ series: Harry grows up with the scarcrux as his d√¶mon.
