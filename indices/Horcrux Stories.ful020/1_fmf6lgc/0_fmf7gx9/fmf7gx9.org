  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  “It's not wise for the living to make contact with the truly lost, Harry." Harry makes a terrible mistake while at Kings Cross Station and pays the price.

  '...The shadows had been there so long, they seemed to form patterns on his eyelids. The swirled and spun until Harry was dizzy with it, and he could not remember his own name...'The summer after his first year, Harry begins to have strange dreams of a terrible darkness. He is reliving the experiences of the horcrux trapped inside of him - and then he saves it, and it becomes his friend.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  When Harry goes to Hogwarts, he finally understands that having a dæmon is normal. Only, the wizarding world never anticipated that Harry's dæmon would be an 11 year old Tom Riddle. AU Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials.
