I've tried reading it a couple of times and I could never get past the part after Harry wakes up in Hogwarts for the first time and finds a bunch of notes he wrote to himself (I think that's what happened?). I just got confused as to what the heck was going on and couldn't justify continuing if I wasn't going to understand it, especially if the rest of it was going to be similar. I'm not an intelligent person, and HPMOR seems like it was written for people much smarter than I am.
