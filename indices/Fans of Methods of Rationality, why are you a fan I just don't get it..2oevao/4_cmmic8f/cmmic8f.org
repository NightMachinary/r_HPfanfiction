It tries hard. Most fics don't.

It has an actual original plot instead of a retelling of the canon plot.

It is written by an adult who is a fan of the kind of things I'm a fan of, and it shows. It stands in stark contrast to the usual angsty teen/young adult authors with some obscure point to prove about their lives that they're working out on the page.

Originality with a self-awareness of the reader's perspective and needs forgives a lot of thematic and flow missteps. It is higher quality than most fanfic; this is especially noticeable amongst the current (relative) drought of quality HP fanfiction.
