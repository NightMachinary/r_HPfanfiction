  It tries hard. Most fics don't.
#+end_quote

I'll give you that.

#+begin_quote
  It has an actual original plot instead of a retelling of the canon plot.
#+end_quote

The plot is pretty all over the place though and the author has a habit of dropping things and never mentioning them again or picking up new conflicts before resolving others.

#+begin_quote
  It stands in stark contrast to the usual angsty teen/young adult authors with some obscure point to prove about their lives that they're working out on the page.
#+end_quote

I don't mean to be insulting but only to the extent that it's an angsty adult trying to prove a point.
