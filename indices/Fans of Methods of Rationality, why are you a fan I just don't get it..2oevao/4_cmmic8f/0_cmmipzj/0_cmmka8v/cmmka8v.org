Yeah, it's been noted that MOR flows more like a sitcom than a novel. But I don't see why this is a problem, it seems suited to the fanfiction format. And anyway, it's still a WIP, dropped plotlines are only a problem if they stay dropped until the end and the author's promising everything will be resolved in the final arc.
