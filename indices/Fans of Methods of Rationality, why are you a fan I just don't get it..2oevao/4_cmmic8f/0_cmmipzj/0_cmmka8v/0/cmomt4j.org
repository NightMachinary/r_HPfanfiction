It's not sitcom like though, as someone else in the thread pointed out it's as if Friends was on season 7 but everyone had only known each other a week. The progression of events and characters is absurd in the time frame he has presented.

As for the dropped plot-lines I explained my feelings on this elsewhere but it's not so much a matter of putting something on the back-burner it's that as soon as something new comes along that interests him or he wants to talk about he moves on immediately. I'm not necessarily talking about massive story defining things but arguments that are never resolved because Harry just has to let everyone know about his new scientific theory he's come up with so everyone forgets that they were pissed at him and moves on because it's /rational/. As we all know 11 year olds are at all times.
