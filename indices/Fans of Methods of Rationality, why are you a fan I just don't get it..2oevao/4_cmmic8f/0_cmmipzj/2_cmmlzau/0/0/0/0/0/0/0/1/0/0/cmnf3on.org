And? I meant it, and it wasn't some sort of slam. Do you know what those words meant? You failed to restate my meaning back in any response, so I can only assume you didn't.

You said you didn't get the fic in the original post. I gave an opinion on it, giving explanations of why I thought that way. You disagreed, with a strong counter opinion on the story and no other information, after having said you didn't get the story. I pointed that out, you flipped the table.

Does that make sense now? Can you see why I think you are acting irrationally?
