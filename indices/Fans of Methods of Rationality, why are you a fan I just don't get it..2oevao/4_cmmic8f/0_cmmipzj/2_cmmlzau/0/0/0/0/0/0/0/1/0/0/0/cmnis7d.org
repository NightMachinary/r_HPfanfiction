  You failed to restate my meaning back in any response, so I can only assume you didn't.

Seriously? Look, I made the post to hear why other people like this fic you saying "It's amazingly well written" isn't going to suddenly make me think it's not a horrifically paced story with no resemblance of a coherent plot. Again, not agreeing with you does not equal not understanding your point.

  You said you didn't get the fic in the original post. I gave an opinion on it, giving explanations of why I thought that way. You disagreed, with a strong counter opinion on the story and no other information, after having said you didn't get the story. I pointed that out, you flipped the table.

No you gave an opinion, I said I disagreed and you went straight for the "oh clearly you aren't able to understand" rather than being able to comprehend that someone would disagree with you.

  Does that make sense now? Can you see why I think you are acting irrationally?
#+end_quote

You're right I was, rational would be to ignore you, which I will endeavour to do from now on, as you're clearly incapable of understanding basic human emotions (case in point; dementors) and so can't apply them to any debate and assume that everyone must be trying to be rational about everything. Not everyone in every story will do the rational thing and that leads for realistic experiences as peoples actions are affected by their emotion not just sitting and thinking about it rationally.
