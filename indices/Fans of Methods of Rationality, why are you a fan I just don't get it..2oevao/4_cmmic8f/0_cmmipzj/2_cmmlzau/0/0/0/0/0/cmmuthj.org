I stated my opinions in response to peoples claims about the fanfiction. Sorry if that's not how you would have done it.

I was looking for reasoned debate not an argument. This is something you seem incapable of without devolving into insults when you realise you won't convince anyone.

Also attention? Mate if I wanted attention I'd be posting in gonewild not HPfanfiction. If there's anyone looking attention it's the guy posting 10000 word replies that have almost no relevance to the debate.

As for you having success, if we go by downvotes you're definitely loosing every debate we've had. You're like the guy who scores an own goal in football then runs around the pitch screaming that they scored.
