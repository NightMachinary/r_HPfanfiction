You didn't state your feelings. It is a blank title-only post.

I stated opinions that were, apparently, different from your own...meaning you might be "wrong" in your feelings and opinions (to the extent that is even logically possible) if mine were better grounded in the facts.

Is that not what you were apparently looking for? Or are you just looking for arguments, or maybe attention?

It looks like I have a lot more fun arguing than you do, and more success too, which is why I ask if this is what you truly mean to be doing.
