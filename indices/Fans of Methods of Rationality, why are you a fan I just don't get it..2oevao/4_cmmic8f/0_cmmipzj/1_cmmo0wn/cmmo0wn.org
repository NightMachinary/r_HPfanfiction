These don't strike me as valid criticisms. I think it's a shame that they're getting upvoted because of the general kneejerk dislike of HPMOR. Those of you who upvoted it, please think about whether a dismissal, a falsehood and an /ad hominem/, respectively, are the types of fanfiction criticism you want to encourage here. If you had written a story and posted it on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] for feedback, you would presumably expect better than that.
