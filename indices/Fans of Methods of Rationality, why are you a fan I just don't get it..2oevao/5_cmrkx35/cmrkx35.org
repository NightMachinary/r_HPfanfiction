Its been 5 days, but this was still on the second page, so besides some of the other positive comments, here are a few I haven't seen mentioned:

- I liked Ender's Game as a kid because I could imagine myself in Ender's place and it felt /good/. Ender outwits his peers and the adults depend on him. I like HPMOR because I like to imagine I would take exactly Harry's approach if I was faced with a strange new magical world: analyze and exploit everything possible.

Addressing some common concerns:

- Canon-bashing. A lot of instances that look like canon bashing are actually subtly showing Harry's flaws. Harry dismisses Ron, later Ron helps provide Hermione the winning strategy in the battles. Harry questions how Hermione could end up anywhere but Ravenclaw, ignoring the fact that she spent time under the Hat and was likely considering Gryfindor like in canon. The issue is that initially it looks like cheap shots at canon and it takes many chapters later for the reader to notice Harry's mistakes (kind of like dealing with real life cognitive biases).

- Kids not acting like kids. Draco has been specifically trained to be able to act in a calculating and controlled manner. Hermione is just an extremely well-read kid (and has trouble keeping up with Harry and Draco as a result). For Harry, the current theory on [[/r/HPMOR]] is that Harry is Voldemort's horocrux, and has Voldemort's genius/underlying personality, but lacks his memories and has developed empathy from being raised in a loving environment (ironically for a story about rationality love is still a key advantage).

- Destroying the romanticism of canon: Yeah, I can see where you are coming from, but I think for all the romantic wonder it destroys, it replaces with enlightenment idealism and optimism.
