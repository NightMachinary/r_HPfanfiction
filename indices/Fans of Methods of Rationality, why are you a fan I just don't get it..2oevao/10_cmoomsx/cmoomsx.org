Am a fan because it's built on my kind of humor, and to date no HP story has entertained me quite as much. Author obviously shares a lot of my reading base, and plays the tropes right.

There are plenty of defects to pick at, but I've learned early on in reading fantasy that every book can be taken apart if your intent is to critique.

Loving fantasy is a lot about enjoying the good things and overlooking the defects. When coming at it with the right mindset, that story has a great deal of fun to offer.
