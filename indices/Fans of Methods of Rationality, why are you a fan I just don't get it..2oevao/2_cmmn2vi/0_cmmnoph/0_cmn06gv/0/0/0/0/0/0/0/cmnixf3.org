Sure, say the author introduces idea A. He makes a conflict between Harry and Draco to explain it to people. He then introduces idea B and has the conflict with Hermione. However, at this point he hasn't resolved the conflict from idea A because the only reason for the conflict was to introduce idea A to the reader and the conflict itself is largely irrelevant to that.

So by the time he's introducing idea M that everyone just has to know about someone who isn't on [[/r/HPMOR]] and pulling the thing apart is left wondering why Draco is still talking to Harry because he never really got over the conflict from idea A.

Also the idea of writing a first year fic falls apart when you have so much conflict in such a short period of time, it's just unrealistic.
