It's well written from a mechanical perspective: no spelling errors, no grammar mistakes, prose that starts a bit janky but smooths out quickly enough. It avoids most of the problems I have in fan fiction: uneven overpowering of characters, Harry being super special in ways that nobody else possibly could be, and so forth. There are over a hundred fics that meet this bar, I'm sure.

Hermione has her own motivations rather than just hanging onto Harry. That filter takes out the majority of the fics that met the previous criteria. In point of fact, most characters are written as intelligent people with their own motives.

It pokes fun at canon's silliness, which is amusing if you haven't read fifty fanfics that each point out two or three flaws, and it's not afraid of being silly itself. At the same time, it's serious quite often.
