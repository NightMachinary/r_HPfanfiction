  Admittedly that is not saying much given the low quality of fanfiction in general, but HPMOR still doesn't deserve the hate that it gets.

I think the authors attitude goes a long way towards it. There are few other authors that regard themselves in such a high light and it's grating. Even the way he pokes holes in canon isn't done lovingly like most fics it's very "can you believe this idiot thought this was a good idea? My way is much better...btw donate more indirectly to me and i'll update quicker".

I agree with you about updating the thing, I said further up ITT that the whole thing would probably work better set in Hogwarts University where the characters could be more mature without it being unrealistic.
