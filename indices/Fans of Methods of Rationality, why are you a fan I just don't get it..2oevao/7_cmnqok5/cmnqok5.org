When I first picked up Methods, I couldn't put it down until I had reached the final chapter. I have had that with more fanfiction, but none as deeply and profoundly as with Methods. I've followed the HPMoR reddit ever since, and I read new chapters on the day they've come out. I dislike the recent few chapters, but I am still insanely curious how it will all end.

A lot of things come together to make me like Methods. I like science and intelligence. And a big pet peeve is this ridiculous notion that you can't use science in the magical world. In canon, you have all these ancient science ideas, completely outdated. Basically, all the wizards are just stamp collecting. They look at things and make lists of when what happens. They know what ingredients make what potion, but you get the impression new potions are made by just throwing random stuff together until you find something that works. Which is still science, but in a very brute force way.

Methods basically just calls the magical world out on its inefficiencies and its horribleness. Trying random things is not as smart as testing a hypothesis. Dismissing children when they raise concerns, just because they're children, is not a smart thing to do. Throwing people in a prison where they will be tortured every single day by dementors, is actually an insanely evil thing to do, and the whole magical world deserves to burn for allowing it.

I love Draco's upgrade so he is actually trying to plot and manipulate. I like how Harry basically treats him as a child raised by nazis; not anymore evil than Hermione or he, but simple exposed to racist ideas his whole life. How Lucius is a loving father. Because nobody is the villain of their own story. I love the whole arc of Draco's redemption.

I love Hermione's upgrade in her self-reliance. How she is faced with two people of her intelligence, and how she responds by stepping up her game and becoming a serious player. I love her whole arc of being thrust in the role of damsel in destress (by plot), and her fierce determination not to ever become anything less than a hero as big as the boy who lived.

I love Quirrel's upgrade into somebody who is actually scary. Voldemort in canon had power, but was dumb as a bat. This evil is smart, manipulative. And worst of all, actually persuasive.

I find the writing funny, and thought-provoking. I like the descriptions of actual science, and the philosophical musings on rationality. I like the consistent world building, like time turners being used everywhere. I think there is some very well-written sentences/paragraphs that I enjoy rereading multiple times. Like the realisation that Dementors represent death instead of depression, and what that means for the patronus spell. Or the wizengemot hearing.

I can't quite recall that many examples from the top of the head... which I'm kinda happy about. : ) It means I should probably reread the whole fanfic again soon.
