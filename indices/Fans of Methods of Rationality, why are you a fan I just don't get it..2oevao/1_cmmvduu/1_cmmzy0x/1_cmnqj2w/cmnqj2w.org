Regarding the "deconstructive approach to magic", I'm not quite sure what that exactly refers to.

To clarify, therefore, I do like fics that explore magic in-depth. I'm just not a fan of the particular way that MoR does it. I think there are a few reasons for this:

Firstly, there's the issue of explanation vs. description. While I love fics that /describe/ magic in a lot of detail, making it seem complex, difficult and real, I'm not a fan of /explanations/ of magic. Explanation can mean two different things here, either explaining magic in terms of other things, or explaining the one true fundamental nature/source of magic. It always reminds me of the ancient Greek metaphysical systems like "the world is made of water". No matter what explanation you give, it will always feel too simple.

In this sense I like magic to be reminiscent of science in that we have no real ultimate answers, and that many of our answers are incompatible with each other or clearly false in certain respects. A wizard should not be able to explain what magic is in a paragraph, or even a chapter. Wizards should just be able to describe human-made theories of how various items of magic work, and maybe speculate as to some ideas about the nature of magic.

Secondly, I dislike the MoR treatment in terms of research methodology/the nature of magical theories. I'm not a fan at all of an empirical approach to magical theory or a mathematical approach to describing magic. There should be few, if any, equations for magical theory in my view.

This connects to the way in which I think HP magic is heavily concept based rather than concerned with physical quantities. Consider the way, for example, that a magical law prevents you from creating food from nothing with transfiguration, but you can create animals with it. /The human concept of food is magically real./ Similarly, a job position is magically real, as are words.

In this sense I think that wizards involved in magical research are kinds of "conceptual engineers" and that their work should accordingly be like that of philosophers and literature critics rather than scientists. Magical theory is thus less about discovering and explaining "how magic works" and more an act of creating a narrative that describes magic so as to capture some essence of it. Spells can be created on the basis of these narratives and so they have a sense of reality, but they are basically created by humans. In essence I see magic as a way that human fictions can override reality. As such I consider magical theory as essentially pluralistic: there is no single correct magical theory, no "magical truth" but rather many different, equally correct, ways of viewing magic.

Different narratives will have different advantages and disadvantages depending on what they focus on. For example, Voldemort favours a narrative that sees magic as essentially inert, mechanistic, and able to be mastered with all variables within the control of a suitably skilled wizard. Dumbledore prefers a more "mythic" or holistic view of magic which takes into account such obscure ideas as the power of moral certainty. Neither approach is more correct than the other -- Voldemort achieves many great magical feats with his narrative of magic, and also he recognises the power of Dumbledore's narrative in GoF when he said that Lily's sacrifice was an old magic that he should have anticipated. But Dumbledore's narrative ultimately prevails in the story, because Voldemort repeatedly fails to give it due consideration and acts on the sole basis of his own ideas.
