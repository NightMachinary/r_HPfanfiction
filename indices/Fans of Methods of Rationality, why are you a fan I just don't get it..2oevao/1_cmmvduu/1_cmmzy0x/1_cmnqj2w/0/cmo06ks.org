  Firstly, there's the issue of explanation vs. description. While I love fics that describe magic in a lot of detail, making it seem complex, difficult and real, I'm not a fan of explanations of magic.

This is what I meant by deconstruction. Nuts and bolts. I understand that this can take the, well, /magic/ out of things. If all the criticisms of HPMOR leveled here were of this sort, I would never rear my ugly head to defend it, because I get the argment. Unfortunately most are character assassination or just factually incorrect (below in the thread - "leaves plot threads hanging" or whatever ... why don't we let him finish the story first...).

To me, on the other side of the coin, the attempts to explore magical theory while being (nearly) entirely true to canon are the most fun part of HPMOR. The author has been handed a bunch of bizarre and often arbitrary rules (food/animals e.g.) and has his protagonist deal with them, learn them and rationalize them. It's unique. Others interpret it as "trashing" canon, but I think it's actually a really cool homage to canon. Instead of changing things that JKR came up with that don't make a whole lot of sense, he attempts to reason out a way it could all be cohesive.

Yeah, that's less in the spirit of the original books. But fanfiction in the spirit of the original books has always been less fun for me, because whoever writes it is invariably not as eloquent as Rowling.

  In this sense I think that wizards involved in magical research are kinds of "conceptual engineers" and that their work should accordingly be like that of philosophers and literature critics rather than scientists. Magical theory is thus less about discovering and explaining "how magic works" and more an act of creating a narrative that describes magic so as to capture some essence of it.

I agree and if I ever wrote a story, this is how the Unspeakables and so on would operate in the background. But I can still appreciate a damned interesting attempt to put science and magical theory together (especially as it's now clear that the end of the plot is going to revolve around that, so what seemed like digressions and authorial inserts in chapter 20 are now foreshadowing for chapters 105-115).
