I meant tripe in the sense that it's simply not a criticism of the story.

  But this really isn't why I don't read LessWrong. I just don't like his stories that much (not enough to overcome my dislike of him and his antics, at any rate).

/This/ is a criticism of the story, or at least a justification for not reading it. I've had dozens of interactions with Yudkowsky and never felt belittled or offended (often the opposite). I'm aware in the past that he's clashed with DLP and maybe others, but I've interacted with DLP as well and you'll excuse me if I default to taking Yudkowsky's side until I learn some details. I do not regard DLP highly.

However, and this ties to my main point, I still read stories that come from that forum, if they're good. You make good points about Crichton and Card -- I would certainly never give either of them money so they could spend it immorally -- but I was trying to express the difference between moral standards and literary standards. Morally, fuck those two. With regard to literature, I'm not going to /buy/ their books but I've read several by each. That I didn't much enjoy them was a function of the writing, not the spectre of the author's jackassery.

The overwhelming problem with entangling morality with what you read is that [[http://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Paul-Johnson/dp/1470887568][you can do it with /anyone/]]. There's also the illogic of picking up a book by someone you've never heard of, reading it, enjoying it, finding out the author is a rapist, and then deciding you hate the book.

  LessWrong is, like it or not, the de facto spokesperson for and authority on fanfiction--show me another HP fanfiction writer who gets written up and promoted in The Atlantic. When LessWrong's comments evince apparent disdain for JKR's source material, it's not just "some obscure writer somewhere" but the one who would speak for all of us. I don't like him with that power; I don't trust him with that power.

Can't really comment on this. I will go on record as saying there is no power implicit in speaking for a loose community of fanfiction authors. As far as the possible cease and desists, I have been told by reliable users that Yudkowsky has permission from JKR's legal team to use canon in the way that he has (indirect fundraising, you might call it). Additionally, I am aware of the various jabs at canon in HPMOR. They're probably my least favorite part, for what it's worth, but tons of other fanfiction authors do the same. I don't think it betrays a disdain for JKR's books; he seems to enjoy the universe enough to have written 750000 words in it. Indeed as I said to Taure elsewhere, picking apart the canon plotholes and trying to find a consistent way to make them all work seems more like an homage.
