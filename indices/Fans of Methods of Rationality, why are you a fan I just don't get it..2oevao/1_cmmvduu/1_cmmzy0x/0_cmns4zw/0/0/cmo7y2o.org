Most of my criticism of the story would mirror the comments of [[/u/Taure]], though probably less eloquently and I probably read less of the story than he. I didn't see the point with my post in repeating what's already been said (especially since it's not really well aligned with the topic of the thread anyway).

  I will go on record as saying there is no power implicit in speaking for a loose community of fanfiction authors. As far as the possible cease and desists, I have been told by reliable users that Yudkowsky has permission from JKR's legal team to use canon in the way that he has (indirect fundraising, you might call it).

If LW or his readers were to make a serious attempt at marketing print versions of this most popular story in the fandom (and this actually has happened, though this was found to violate the Lulu.com TOS and was swiftly brought to a halt), then this would risk bringing down the whole fanfiction enterprise, much like how the HP Lexicon was crushed once they started trying to make money off Rowling's IP. If this worst case were to come to pass, then hundreds of millions of hours of collective human effort could be winked out overnight due to the actions of a solitary individual. To me, that's power.

Edit: reword.
