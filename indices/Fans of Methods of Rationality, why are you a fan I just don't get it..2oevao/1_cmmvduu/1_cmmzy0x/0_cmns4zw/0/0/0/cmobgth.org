  Most of my criticism of the story would the comments of [[/u/Taure]] [+1], though probably less eloquently and I probably read less of the story than he. I didn't see the point with my post in repeating what's already been said (especially since it's not really well aligned with the topic of the thread anyway).

Those were pretty much all fair criticisms. Although I wouldn't call any of them dealbreakers ... great fanfictions are few and far between, so I can't imagine anyone not jumping at a chance to read one that is long, going to be completed, grammatically perfect, and generally funny and interesting. Many people criticize HPMOR and then turn around and recommend utter crap. I understand high standards, but not the baffling inconsistency I see a lot here. Regardless, it's nice to finally read an intelligent critique of the story that doesn't revolve around misapprehensions.

  If LW or his readers were to make a serious attempt at marketing print versions of this most popular story in the fandom (and this actually has happened, though this was found to violate the Lulu.com TOS and was swiftly brought to a halt), then this would risk bringing down the whole fanfiction enterprise, much like how the HP Lexicon was crushed once they started trying to make money off Rowling's IP. If this worst case were to come to pass, then hundreds of millions of hours of collective human effort could be winked out overnight due to the actions of a solitary individual. To me, that's power.

It's not his fault he's the most popular author (or close). He /may/ be the only one whose profile is high enough that attempts to monetize would result in catastrophe ... but I doubt it. And I doubt that this hypothetical attempt would have the endgame you think it would. JKR seems very welcoming of fanfiction in general. If the widespread smut communities haven't cratered the whole thing, one fanfiction trying to make money won't either. At worst I imagine she'd have HPMOR removed from major websites, press individual charges, something like that. I don't see Yudkowsky having the power you ascribe to him.

I don't remember this, unless it's the thing where some hard copies began popping up on the west coast? I think they were distributed to children, free, to encourage interest in science or something, but I don't have any details. Might be different. But given that Yudkowsky knows the line he is walking with the JKR legal team and has reached out to them in the past, I find it /very/ unlikely he would do anything to jeopardize his status. His readers ... that's a different matter. People without a firm understanding of copyright law routinely bring printing copies up on [[/r/hpmor]] and are routinely disabused.

Anyway, [[/r/hpfanfiction]] likes to demonize Yudkowsky for asking for donations specifically for fanfiction, as if all other fanfiction authors are on a higher moral plane. The reality, of course, is that Yudkowsky would have had to long since abandon the project he started /specifically to attract interest to AI research etc/ if he couldn't prove to his employer that it had a tangible benefit. "Has popularized MIRI" isn't tangible, but money is. Since we want the story, and he presumably wants to finish it but understands his job is more important, donations to his (nonprofit) organization seem like the ideal solution. I've never really understood the antagonism there.
