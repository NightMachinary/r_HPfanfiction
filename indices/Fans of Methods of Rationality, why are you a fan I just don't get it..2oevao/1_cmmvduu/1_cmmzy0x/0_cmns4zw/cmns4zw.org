  Pers' criticisms, unfortunately, are the usual meaningless tripe I see often.
#+end_quote

I've personal experience with the author's behaving unpleasantly with respect to criticism. I fail to see the logic of why my experiences should be automatically discounted as "meaningless tripe," whereas yours are somehow germane to why I don't enjoy reading LessWrong. /I/ find the author unpleasant to deal with and choose not to interact with him, including reading his story.

Fanfiction, with the expectation of readers leaving reviews (something I recall LessWrong was rather shameless about back when I followed his story), is more interactive than traditional fiction. If I'd merely wished for the one-way author-to-reader infodump, then I'd pick up a book and in the process get a much more polished, higher quality story.

  I additionally can't agree with the "don't like the creator don't consume the content" approach because it turns your moral standards into your literary standard, which doesn't make any sense. Personal choice, though.

Consider Orson Scott Card, who uses the cash from his books to support his strident opposition to homosexuality and marriage equality, including his serving on the boards of lobbying organizations whose stated purpose is to stifle gay causes in Washington and elsewhere. Buy /Ender's Game/ and you tacitly support these causes, making this a moral choice.

Another example: Michael Crichton probably did more to muddy the scientific position on anthropogenic climate change (as well as other important social and scientific issues of his day) than any other writer. He did this by pretending to authority he did not possess and using said authority to counter the concerns of legitimate scientists. Why was this one man, who did no work whatsoever in climate science and had no scientific background in the field, given such a privileged position, even testifying before Congress? Because a lot of people bought his technobabble books. This apparently made him in their eyes an authority (much like how Tom Clancy is continually tapped for panels on international relations and military force). Again, consumption of an author's pablum has moral implications.

LessWrong is, like it or not, the de facto spokesperson for and authority on fanfiction--show me another HP fanfiction writer who gets written up and promoted in /The Atlantic/. When LessWrong's comments evince apparent disdain for JKR's source material, it's not just "some obscure writer somewhere" but the one who would speak for all of us. I don't like him with that power; I don't trust him with that power.

Specifically, when LessWrong makes statements that threaten the tenuous truce between traditional publishing and fanfiction with respect to violations of copyright law (and the attempts over the years by various parties to make money directly or indirectly from his fanfiction certainly raises its profile), this can be potentaily dangerous for the community. It would take only one salvo of Cease and Desist letters from JKR's lawyers to essentially wipe out HP fanfiction from the various archives.

But this really isn't why I don't read LessWrong. I just don't like his stories that much (not enough to overcome my dislike of him and his antics, at any rate).
