This is a good post. I only agree with one of your criticisms, but I acknowledge that all of them (with the exception of the cash cow; I think you're misapprehending what's happening) are reasonable.

In particular, if you don't like the deconstructive approach to magic, HPMOR simply isn't for you.

Pers' criticisms, unfortunately, are the usual meaningless tripe I see often. I've had a couple dozen interactions with the author and never been treated without respect and politeness (and he doesn't use /ad hominem/ arguments). I additionally can't agree with the "don't like the creator don't consume the content" approach because it turns your moral standards into your literary standard, which doesn't make any sense. Personal choice, though.
