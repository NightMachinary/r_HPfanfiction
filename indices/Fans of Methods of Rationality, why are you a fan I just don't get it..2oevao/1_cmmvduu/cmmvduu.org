As a contrast, why I don't like it:

1. The writing isn't good. In contrast to some posts in this thread, MoR is not written "professionally". Yes, in terms of technical writing there are few if any errors. But good writing is a lot more than an absence of errors. MoR is full of characters monologuing or having extended tangential conversations. Brevity is a key part of good writing, and MoR lacks it.

2. The pacing is terrible. This is probably the worst aspect of the fic. It just goes on and on, meandering here and there but without any overarching plot structure. Some people raise the defence of "it's episodic like a TV show" but no, it isn't. Even episodic TV shows have structure. MoR isn't like Friends, MoR is like an alternate idea of Friends where it's season 7 and they've still only known each other for a week.

3. I don't like the magic. This is largely personal, I suppose, but I hate the nerfed temporary transfiguration, the complete reinterpretation of Dementors as representing death rather than depression and decay, the Sorting Hat, etc. It's just so much less romantic than canon, so much more mechanistic. It loses something in the translation, I think. I also rather dislike the abuse of "loopholes". This ties in with "mechanistic magic", I suppose. Magic only has loopholes if it acts mechanistically. I prefer to think of magic as capable of closing its own loopholes e.g. if you try to use Felix Felicis to brew more Felix it'll backfire.

4. It's disrespectful of canon. While I can accept that fanfic going a different direction with magic is a matter of personal taste, this is something more objective. MoR doesn't just say "Hey, wouldn't it be interesting if Dementors were creatures of death", it says "Dementors must be creatures of death, the idea that they're creatures of depression is ludicrous". In doing so it's making itself out to be a superior kind of canon to that which JKR wrote. Not only is this insulting the source material, it also means that MoR opens itself up to all sorts of argumentation regarding canon compatibility, because it's now making claims to be a superior interpretation of canon events than JKR's.

5. The kids act like adults. This doesn't need much explanation. The fic fails to make the distinction between intelligence and maturity.

6. It's a mess of different ideas. MoR reminds me of Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart, where the author just shoved every single idea they had into a single fic, regardless of thematic unity or how they relate to the plot. MoR is like an ideas document, a fanfic sandbox.

7. Thematic clash. Voldemort sending his horcrux into space is the perfect example (which is also an example of bad pacing, in that you've basically set up a villain who can never be defeated). Is it logical? Yes. Does it fit with the feel of the HP universe? No. There's a reason why wizards haven't gone to space despite having all the magic you'd need to do so, and that's the simple fact that combining space travel with a semi-medieval semi-Victorian society is the literary equivalent of wearing pink and green.

8. The author used it as a cash cow. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the story per se, but it still makes me somewhat sick. The author promised accelerated chapter releases in exchange for monetary donations. Yes, it was to a not-for-profit organisation, but it was a not-for-profit that the author has a financial interest in, given that they pay (paid?) his salary. Given how the fandom feels about authors holding chapters hostage for reviews ("I'll post the next chapter when I get 20 reviews!"), you can imagine how a lot of people felt about asking for money. It's just unacceptable.
