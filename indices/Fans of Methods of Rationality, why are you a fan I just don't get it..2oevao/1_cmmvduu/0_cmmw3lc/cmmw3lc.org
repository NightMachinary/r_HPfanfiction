For me, I'd add (risking downvotes, I'm sure):

1. The author presents himself as a pretentious douche with some of the thinnest skin of anyone who's supposedly an adult. In the early days of the fic, I recall leaving honest reviews only to receive hostile replies, presumably because I wasn't part of Yudkowsky's cult of personality. (Honestly, I do find the whole "I'm smarter than you" bit tedious, the kind of thing done by those who would edit their Wiki pages to include SAT scores in lieu of actual accomplishments and who apparently don't interact much with other people in their day jobs.)

Because stories are inevitably a reflection of the narrator, I find that I just can't enjoy them when I find the author unlikable. I won't read John Ringo or Michael Chrichton because they suck/sucked as human beings. After meeting GRR Martin, I can no longer enjoy Game of Thrones. I suffer enough "plug my nose and read this shit though I despise the authors" in my day job, reading scientific papers by a few of my colleagues/competitors. I don't need to compound the woe in my free time. It could be the greatest writing since Billy Shakes, but I won't touch a story by JoeHundredaire, Kinsfire, Bobmin, Perfect Lionheart, or LessWrong.
