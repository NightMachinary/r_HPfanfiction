Holy shit I had no idea Crichton was so bad about climate change. I literally googled "why michael crichton was a bad person" and the first link was [[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2008/11/05/203302/michael-crichton-worlds-most-famous-global-warming-denier-dies/][a very well written article]] on his climate change denial. Such a shame.
