I respect that viewpoint, I really do. For me, it's the /Ender's Game/ conundrum. I /loved/ (love?) Ender's Game when I read it as a teenager. Since then, basically everything I've read/heard/watched about Orson Scott Card has made me feel very ambivalent about liking that book.

It's a classic debate - can you, should you separate the author from the text? To what degree can stories stand on their own?

I've gone back and forth on it many times. I can't fault you for taking the other side. I think there's a degree of immediacy that comes into play: I can know, intellectually, that Card has some opinions I don't share and is kind of a d-bag in the way he chooses to express them. If I'd written Card a letter and gotten a sulky, pretentious response, I would no doubt find it much harder to like /Ender's Game/. Might not be the most logical thing ever, but...

Anyway. I don't have strong feelings about MoR. It was something like the fourth or fifth fic I ever read, back when I was getting into fanfiction (about a year and a half ago). I laughed at some of the jokes, I thought the premise was interesting, but it didn't feel anything like the books and many of the characters felt a little too stiff, a little too long-winded. I neither love it nor hate it.
