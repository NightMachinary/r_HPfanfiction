I'm a little bit late to this, but I'll chime in.

1. I maybe be slightly biased, because it's the first fanfic I ever read. It's hard to account exactly how much, and in what ways this effects my view of it, so I'll just state it as it is--since it's the first one I read, I may not be objective. I've always been a huge fan, and I'd read the Harry Potter books dozens of times, so a fresh take on HP was incredibly enjoyable.

2. Actual intelligent characters. I like smart heroes, but an author cannot write a character very much more intelligent than himself or herself. With presentation and narrative trickery you can get a bit of a boost (or at least a character whose smarts pass suspension of disbelief so long as you don't think too hard, like Ender Wiggin or Sherlock Holmes), but most of the time you wind up with something like Artemis Fowl. One of the basic rules to good writing is "show, don't tell". This also applies intelligence as much as anything else, but a lot of writers cop out and resort to having a character that speaks a lot of languages, or is good at math, or invents something impressive, or whatever else. Basically, some device to tell the reader that the character is supposed to be very smart. I've always preferred smart heroes to powerful ones, and I've always hated irrational heroes. I've put down multiple novels in disgust when the actions of the main characters are egregiously, unjustifiably dumb. In HPMOR, when characters have dumb moments, but they carefully justified.

3. It inspires me to become a better person. Am I as smart as Harry seems to be here? No. Do I think I can become so? Yes. My understanding is that HPMOR is written as an introduction to rationality, and I believe that rationality is a good thing (at the very least, a good thing for me). HPMOR has put in words many vague feelings I've had over the course of my life, and has also nudged me in the direction of new ideas that, at least, promise to be interesting to think about.

4. I don't mind it being preachy. I've read and enjoyed quite a bit of Terry Goodkind's the Sword of Truth series, which started as fantasy and eventually devolved into Ayn Rand fanfiction. I feel like Yudkowsky has got nothing on Goodkind. This, at least, espoused something I can agree with after thinking about.

5. I really like the analysis of magic. I like analyzing things in general, and I think HPMOR did it pretty well; a good portion of it is so far unexplainable, but by god, Harry is going to try anyway. Also, some portion of it is explained in sufficiently general terms to keep it interesting.

6. With regard to the pacing that some have mentioned, I found it fine. I can happily read a wide variety of pacing, so maybe it's just me.

7. At least part of this is "I like it because I like it". I often have a hard time justifying why I like things, whether it be guilty pleasure music, a movie, or a book. I can't explain to you in any detail why I like Star Wars, but I do anyway. I feel that it's unfair of me to omit this, even though it's not a very good reason.
