  At one point, HPMOR does acknowledge this, and attempt to justify it a bit:
#+end_quote

That is /terrible/ justification. That's another instance of the author assuming his universe takes presedence over canon. In canon none of the main characters act out of the bounds of reality for their age, in MoR they all do, from day one, regardless of magical background or not.

  I also don't quite agree that they aren't old enough for the intelligence that they amass

Totally fair enough, it's just beyond the bounds of reason for me and I can't stand it.

#+begin_quote
  (or people in their early 20s that behave like 11-year olds
#+end_quote

What about full grown adults who do everything an 11-year old says to them?
