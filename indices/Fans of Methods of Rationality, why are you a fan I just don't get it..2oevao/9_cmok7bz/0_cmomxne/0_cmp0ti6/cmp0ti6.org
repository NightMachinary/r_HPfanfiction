  They may be intelligent but they are not mature enough or old enough for the intelligence and knowledge that they amass over a stupidly short period of time
#+end_quote

At one point, HPMOR does acknowledge this, and attempt to justify it a bit:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness, and if you looked at the difference in maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it was clear that Muggles were smothering their children...
#+end_quote

I also don't quite agree that they aren't old enough for the intelligence that they amass--I knew a guy in middle school and into high school who was probably on the same ballpark as HPMOR!Harry (although below his level, because Harry is fictional and can get away with being larger than life). Coincidentally, I looked him up the other day, and he's co-authored a paper with Yudkowski.

In the end, writing overmature or overintelligent characters is a flaw I'm willing to overlook, because I don't want to read a story about 11-year olds that actually behave like 11-year olds (or people in their early 20s that behave like 11-year olds, like the Wheel of Time).
