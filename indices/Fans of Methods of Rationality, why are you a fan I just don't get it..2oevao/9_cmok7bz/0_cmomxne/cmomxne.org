  Actual intelligent characters.

They may be intelligent but they are not mature enough or old enough for the intelligence and knowledge that they amass over a stupidly short period of time, if it were set in Hogwarts University with a 20 year old Harry I could stomach it easier but I see your point.

Every other one of your points I can't disagree with, I see how that could be appealing and if that's what you like then fair enough. Thanks for that, you're one of only a few people to actually give a decent set of reasons for liking it without jumping down my throat for not and it's exactly what I was looking for.
