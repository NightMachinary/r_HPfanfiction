Hmm. I'll bite, despite the fact that you didn't really hold up your end of the bargain by, for example, listing /why/ you don't get it. I'm familiar with most of the common complaints (at least the ones on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]), but still. I'm about to write like 500 words. The least you could do is write 15.

1. HPMOR is the /only/ piece of fanfiction I have ever read that could legitimately pass for professionally-written. Plots (within the context of the serialized "tv season arc" format he uses) are created and resolved, with the requisite amounts of drama and conflict [NB: I say this with the caveat that the story is unfinished, but I have confidence that all the plot ends will be untangled]. Every /single/ character is consistent, acts intelligently and interestingly, and has background. The emotion is real, the humor is (mostly) funny. The grammar/sentence structure/nuts and bolts are absolutely impeccable. The amount of effort that is put into the writing process would put HPMOR in the top ten fics ever written even if it was a generic post-OotP rehash.

2. But it's not. Yudkowsky can flat /write/, and the story is probably the most uniformly original ever written in fanfiction. I'm not really sure how it wouldn't be.

3. The entire plot is /solvable/. All plot details and pieces of foreshadowing (of which there are dozens) will be tied up by the finale. [[/r/hpmor]] has spent the last 3-4 years guessing at what will happen in each chapter, where the plot is going, etc. There are a lot of smart people on that subreddit (in fact I'm pretty sure at least one of our current theories vis a vis the ending is mostly correct) -- but the author still manages to throw us for a loop pretty often. This, plus the fact that story has no (or very, very few^{)} [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Balls]], gives it that satisfying feeling peculiar to so-called rationalist fiction -- you never feel like you're watching a shitty horror movie ("don't split up!" "don't go outside in the dark" etc. Characters act as you would, and occasionally even think of things you didn't.

4. It is by far the best "theory of magic" fanfiction of all time. As a bonus, the author is a scientist who discusses any and all field-specific details he uses on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]], to make sure they're accurate. Sure, HPMOR is so brilliant as a story that even if the experimental angle was removed (Harry's attempts to learn why magic works, and team it up with physics) it would /still/ be the best fic I've ever read. But the scientific method, all the great Harry-Hermione conversations, his attempt to win over Draco using reason -- perfect. And everything Harry does is what any precocious muggleborn with a deep interest in science would do if they learned about magic.

5. Yudkowsky is very clear on the departure points for the fic and sticks to them (often so subtly it takes us at [[/r/hpmor]] a long time to notice), which helps a lot in forming a cohesive narrative -- which would otherwise be a concern, because the story is extremely long and published in serialized format. He also knows in advance all major plot points and how HPMOR will end, which is vital to the fic making sense (this rule applies to all fiction, with very rare exceptions).

6. Yudkowsky puts [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/inexploitability][thought]] into what he's doing, and in the process makes points about fanfiction that have never even occurred to me. [Additionally, his [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][nonfiction]] is brilliant. There's a lot more where that came from.]

7. Yudkowsky interacts with his readership on facebook, lesswrong and reddit all the time, keeps us minutely apprised on the story's progress, goes to meetups, even incorporates small reader ideas into the narrative occasionally. As a result I have absolute confidence that he will finish the story, which is refreshing.

And when you throw in the fact that the author had never written any fiction over ~10 chapters before he dove in, and he did so only to drum up interest in rationalism, futurism and his work ... yet he still wrote the most popular fanfiction in history ... it's pretty damn impressive. Honestly HPMOR is barely fanfiction -- it only borrows the characters/settings so that Yudkowsky can work from established anchors (see the link above on inexploitability) and therefore make his point more efficiently.

^{there} are a few, but they're intentional
