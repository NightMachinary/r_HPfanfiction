1. You've clearly missed a lot of fanfiction. Whilst MoR is well written grammatically and the like it's structure and plot leave much to be desired.

2. You're right that it's not generic but that doesn't make it good. The original concept was fantastic but the more he wrote the more he added to the story to try and push in all these ideas that he had and the views he tried to convey to people and imo it doesn't work.

3. See here's why I think it's so well liked, correct me if i'm wrong, but every time a chapter comes out fans must spends hours poring over it and debating with each other what everything means and about the 3 new ideas that were introduced? That I can see being enjoyable, who doesn't love a good theological debate? The issue is as a self-enclosed story his ideas aren't conveyed well, there's just a mashup of things the author wants to tell people about and show off his knowledge on.

4. Agree to disagree, the charm of Harry Potter for me is the magic is self-enclosed and as another commenter pointed out, self-correcting. The author reduces the magic to a scientific experiment about rationality that doesn't fit in a universe where one of the key themes is the absence of logic and the natural laws of physics.

5. Again agree to disagree, if he has actually planned the whole thing out he's a much worse writer than I give him credit for.

6. See above.

7. This is just him stroking his ego to me but i'll get to that.

My reasons for disliking it that I haven't already mentioned are as follows:

A) The idea that everyone and everything in his universe is rational and logical and all can be explained thusly and in doing so ignores emotion. In canon Draco is a bigoted racist, try going up to a member of the KKK and convincing them black people are alright using logic, they'll beat the shit out of you because humans are not rational all the time. The same issue is posed with Voldemort's space horcrux, he's now truly immortal. Job done the story is no longer interesting not to mention he went against his canon prejudice against muggles because it's rational.

B) He writes children as if they are adults. Not a fault just of his but certainly glaring when reading the story.

C) Like you said it's barely fanfiction and he only writes it to make his point.

D) His arrogance is overwhelming, other people have given first hand evidence of the jackass when he's dealing with people who disagree with him. The entire thing just reads like a manifesto for his self-believed brilliance.

E) The pacing is just terrible and affects the characters equally as poorly as it does the plot.

F) The prick asks for money for faster updates. Pathetic and against the spirit of fanfiction.
