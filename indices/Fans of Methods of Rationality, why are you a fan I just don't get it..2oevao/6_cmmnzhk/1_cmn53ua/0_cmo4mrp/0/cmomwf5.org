  I don't think he was doing this. My impression is that he was shamelessly asking for donations for his organization, but not shamelessly asking for money in return for faster updates. A small but important distinction.

He asked for people to donate to his organisation and in turn he would update faster, as someone else said his rational being it would show his boss he was generating interest in their work and therefore he would be given time to continue writing it. So basically he's using it as an add for a company that pays him.

  I get the same feeling! I don't mind reading a series of rationality lessons thinly veiled as a fanfiction, but it will never reach the level of truly great storytelling.

Yeah that's basically how I feel, the science is interesting but i'd honestly rather have read it as a series of one-shot essays than try to cram it into a coherent plot.

  Yeah, I think the fanaticism of the community is a big part of this fic's success.
#+end_quote

This is pretty much what I was looking to find out in this thread tbh, I didn't understand the community behind it and now that I do I think it makes more sense, it also explains why people are so fanatical about it.

#+begin_quote
  Which brings me to my last question: Do you have any recommendations?
#+end_quote

As much as I hate Severitus I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance by Green Gecko]] although it's been a while since I read it. It's a bit cliched on a re-read but being 9 years old it pretty much defined the genre and inspired most of the fics I can't stand to read. It's also one of very few fics that Harry has a realistic amount of money in.

You listed most of my usual recommendations. :P

Is Natural 20 that hard to get into if you've never played D&D though?
