  HPMOR is the only piece of fanfiction I have ever read that could legitimately pass for professionally-written.

How unfortunate. You apparently haven't read Prince of the Dark Kingdom. And if the Wheel of Time can get published, the Sacrifices Arc probably could. There are probably several of better quality than HPMOR, and if you restrict yourself to comparing the first few chapters, there are many.
