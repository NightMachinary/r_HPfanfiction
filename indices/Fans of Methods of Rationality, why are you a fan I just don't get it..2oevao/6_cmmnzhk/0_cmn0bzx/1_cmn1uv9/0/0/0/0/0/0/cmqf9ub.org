Well, except that he's the only one who notices Azkaban is immoral. You seem to be saying we shouldn't listen to children because we shouldn't listen to children. I am saying, listen to intelligence, morality and, I'll grant you, experience. Perspective, maybe. Harry has perspective in HPMOR; most wizards don't, because of the unenlightened society in which they grew up.

That's one of the best ideas of the story -- that nearly any muggleborn should have the necessary perspective and probably quite a bit of the knowledge to see through the medieval murk that pervades JKR's world. It's true.

HJPEV is not put in charge of anything. He has a lot of good, unique ideas and eventually becomes someone who is listened to, because of necessity. That may not be realistic, but I wish it was.
