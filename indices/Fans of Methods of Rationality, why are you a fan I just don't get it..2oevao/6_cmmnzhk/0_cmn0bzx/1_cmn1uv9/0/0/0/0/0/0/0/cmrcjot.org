"Half of us only sleep soundly in our beds at night knowing those creatures are guarding Askaban"

"And the other half of us are something something appalled, scared because they'll turn to Voldemort instantly"

Quotish from Dumbledore to Fudge in Goblet. It seems much more likely in canon that it's a case of people not liking it but not being able to do anything ala the NSA/Guantanamo.

  You seem to be saying we shouldn't listen to children because we shouldn't listen to children.

No i'm saying in most cases children do not have the perspective needed to understand complex ideas.

  Harry has perspective in HPMOR; most wizards don't, because of the unenlightened society in which they grew up.

No many wizards are muggleborn and have exactly the same perspective Harry does, MoR doesn't really address this.

Again this is only really applicable if you take MoR and make it canon, we must assume there are reasons for certain things in canon that are there for an actual purpose rather than just "oh aren't wizards barbaric" like MoR makes out.

There is no necessity though. Only what is created in MoR.
