  And don't try and tell me you'd treat a twelve year old the same as a twenty four year old, because no matter how much we'd like to - we wont.

Speak for yourself. I treat intelligent people intelligently, or strive to. Thing is, yeah few and far between are the 12 year olds who cut muster**. But that's one of the departure points of the story. Every great story has one suspension of disbelief (who said that?), and in this one it's that the protagonist is also a child prodigy. (A pedant will point out that magic is the suspension of disbelief, but that pedant will not have read the link to Yudkowsky's blogpost on inexploitability that I posted above.)

  And it's very hard for anyone to take him seriously within the novel - you see throughout the story, even when it'd be logical to stop this, there is still some condescension from the adults towards him.

Dunno how long it's been since you read HPMOR, or how far you got, but the exact same thing happens there. He wins over his elders; they don't yield to him immediately (caveat: Dumbledore sort of does, because of his concept of the "hero" in the "story" -- but again, that comes from canon). I would also point out that basically none of the children in canon act 11. Maybe Ginny. They don't really start acting their ages until like 15, when they take a giant maturity step backwards and all get really angry for no reason.

I just now got why you could get "accusatory" out of my (brief) response. To expand, he's not the target audience if he doesn't feel that children who are intelligent should be respected and encouraged, because that feeling would be anathema to Yudkowsky, who would take it as a given of any "Idiot Ball-free" universe.

**Ever read Neal Stephenson? He wrote a brilliant and annoying 12 year old, albeit a minor character, but one who was treated like an adult when he earned it -- and no one got angry.
