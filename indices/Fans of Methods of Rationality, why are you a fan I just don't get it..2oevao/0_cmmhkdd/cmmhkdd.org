Because it was the first fic I ever read. So even if I were to go back and reread it, and found I didn't like it nearly as much as I remember... It will always be the root cause of my talking to you people.

Edit: Also because I liked the jokes early on, and the Troll scene made me legit angry at the world. The worst was that said troll scene was the last chapter at the time.
