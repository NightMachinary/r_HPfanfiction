“Family isn't always blood. It's the people in your life who want you in theirs. The ones you accept you for who you are. The ones who would do anything to see you smile, and who love you no matter what.” *punches him in the face*

"Well then /I have no family/!!!" *sad puppy face* "My father...." (dramatic pause) "...never pays attention to me."

[Flashback montage to Draco complaining nonstop about "POTTER!!!" to his parents: while being lovingly hugged by them, while playing Quidditch together, while on his birthday surrounded by presents and friends, while they are shopping at Diagon Alley holding his hands, while they're having breakfast, while they're at a Death Eater meeting, while having tea with Voldemort, while Narcissa knits a hangman noose, while Lucius interrupts her knitting and throws the noose into the fireplace, while Lucius is happily being arrested and Narcissa is begging the Aurors to take her with them, while visiting Lucius in prison and he's banging his head on the walls]
