Haha sorry, it was supposed to be humorous-ish. I just had this image of Draco visiting his dad is jail to complain like "can you believe Potter had the audacity to /abandon me/ and not come to Hogwarts this year??? Perfect Potter with his dumb scar and his stupid important mission" and Lucius is all "I thought I finally had some peace and quiet from this BS"

Draco: "you never pay attention to me"

Lucius: "I know exactly how many times Harry Potter cut his hair in 1995 because of how much I pay attention to you, but go off, I guess"
