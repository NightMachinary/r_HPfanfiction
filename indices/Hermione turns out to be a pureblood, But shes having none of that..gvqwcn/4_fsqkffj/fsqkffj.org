I'll only accept this idea if Draco, who has spent his whole life as a sad only child on the Malfoy's vast but empty estate, is emotionally desperate for a sibling which makes Hermione the answer to his prayers. He spends the rest of the books following her around like a lovesick puppy trying in vain to apologize for his actions and profess his brotherly love for her no matter how many times she loudly rejects his offer of family and kicks him down one of the moving staircases.

Bonus points if in the process of standing up for his sister against those who still disparage her Draco becomes the wizarding world's greatest crusader for Muggle/house-elf/werewolf/nargle rights. This is what finally wins over Hermione, except that it's not sisterly love that she develops for her brave white haired knight but lustful teenage romantic love. Draco then spends hours repeatedly throwing up after his sister's declaration of forgiveness and chaste kiss turned out to involve a lot more forceful tongue and pelvic grinding than he'd expected between siblings.
