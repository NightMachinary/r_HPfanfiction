HBP.

I can excuse the "monster in the chest" or OOC behaviour of Hermione and Ron (she's hormonal and jealous for the first time and he finally got the attention he wanted for his whole life).

But the rest of the plot moves like the 5th book didn't happen, like Harry didn't lost his godfather several month ago, like he didn't get two know that Dumbledore hid information about the prophesy for all that time and condemned him for long miserable years, etc.

No one cares about those things and that there's the Darkest Lord with growing support and powers outside the Hogwarts walls!
