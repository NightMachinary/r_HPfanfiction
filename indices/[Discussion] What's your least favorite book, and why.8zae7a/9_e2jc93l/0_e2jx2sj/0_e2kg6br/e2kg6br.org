I think you're inferring a LOT of things here that I can't see at all.

1: James was neither ignored nor belittled; he was chastised for worrying his brother, and then he went off on his own for a bit, then he was hugged and told to give Neville his parent's love, which he didn't appreciate. There's NO evidence to support he wasn't Harry's son, so that's just taking it all out of thin air.

2: Harry never sought redemption for anything that I could see, so I don't see how he could do it through Albus Severus.

3: Lily appears to be a perfectly normal little girl. She complains that she's too young for Hogwarts and argues with Hugo over Hogwarts houses. Nothing that really says she's trying to keep happiness in an unhappy family or anything.

4: Very little real interaction between Harry and Ginny, though Ginny seems more in charge than Harry is. Ginny scolds James, Ginny assures Albus they'll write to him, Ginny reassured Harry that Albus will be all right. Harrty mainly just tells Albus about the Sorting Hat, and insists that Albus and James aren't allowed to share a bedroom. If you mean the "Ginny let Harry do everything he wanted" thing as in "Harrty clearly picked all the kids' names and Ginny had no say" like a lot of people have complained, there's no real evidence for this either.

Thing about the epilogue is that there's no real substance to it. You can't really deconstruct it because there's hardly anything there. You could certainly infer or make up a whole lot of things, but there's nothing in the text that supports it.

For example, if I was going to make an angsty fic based on the epilogue that "proved" that the characters were all either deeply unhappy or had turned into total villains, I could claim, with just as much validity:

1: James regularly torments and abuses Albus, to the point of nearly driving Albus to suicide twice, but Harry and Ginny just tell Albus that his brother is just "having a laugh."

2: Lily is actually the oldest of the kids, but she's a Squib who will never go to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny have tried to cover it up; they have modified everyone's memories to make them think Lily is younger than she really is. For ten years now Lily has "only had two more years" until she gets to go to Hogwarts. She's almost twenty and still thinks she's nine.

3: Neither Rose nor Hugo are Ron's children; Hermione doesn't even know who their father is because she likes to go out at weekends, feed love potions to random Muggle men and have wild, unprotected sex with them, after which she erases their memories of the whole thing.
