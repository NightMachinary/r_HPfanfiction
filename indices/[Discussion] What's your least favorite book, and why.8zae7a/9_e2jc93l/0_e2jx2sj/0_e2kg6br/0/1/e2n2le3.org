Ya that first one does use contextual evidence that could be possible, but I don't buy the possibility of James not being Harry's son. It doesn't makes sense to me based off a two minute blip in their future lifes to suggest that. There isn't much go by in the epilogue to really say for sure anyways, so no judgment from me on that. However I will add, if we wish to go that route it could be entirely possible for James to not be Ginny's son, because the epilogue doesn't say she gave birth to him. She is the one that chastises him and not Harry anyways. I don't buy that either, just to clarify, just adding my thoughts.
