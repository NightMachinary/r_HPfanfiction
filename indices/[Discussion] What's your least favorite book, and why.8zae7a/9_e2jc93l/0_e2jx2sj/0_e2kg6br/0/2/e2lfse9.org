It is insane and utterly laughable, that was the point. ^_^ There are a lot of things that could be inferred by the epilogue, but which the text doesn't actually back up at all.

No, I DON'T think James has nearly pushed Albus to suicide; his relationship with Albus seems more reminiscent of Fred and George's with Ron -- merciless taunting and teasing that occasionally goes too far, but isn't actually malicious. But if I'd read the epilogue already having decided to hate James, then his treatment of Albus could easily be seen to back up my "he's scum" opinion.

And I think it's the same if you read the epilogue having already decided that it's flawed and in need of "deconstruction"... you're going to find something that you feel build up under your notions, even if it's not actually in the text at all.

As for your Word of God... I think I'm going to have to ask for a quote here, because I can't find any JKR quotes about Harry naming his son after Snape and Dumbledore out of guilt. On Twitter she named the reasons as "forgiveness and gratitude," which don't have much to do with guilt or redemption.
