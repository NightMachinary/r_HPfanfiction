The only part of DH that I've re-read is the Epilogue, when I was planning a deconstruction of it, so I noticed:

1) James was either ignored or belittled, his appearance was never described, and it was entirely possible he wasn't Harry's son;

2) Harry sought his own redemption through Albus Severus, and holy cow, were things adding up;

3) Lily just wanted everyone to be happy, and man, was this just sad;

4) Ginny was letting Harry control/do anything he wanted, and JKR made this far too easy.

I ended up not doing the story because, as I said, it made me sad.
