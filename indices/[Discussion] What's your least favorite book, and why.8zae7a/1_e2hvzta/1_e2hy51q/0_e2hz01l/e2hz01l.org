The epilogue works, it's just... a bit cringy and anti-climactic. Albus Severus Potter... I nearly dropped my book when I read that the first time.

The thing JKR really needed to do to make Ginny and Harry work better is show Ginny /even once/ thinking of Harry before herself.

I /really/ think that the Christmas scene in OotP was the thing that ruined that for me. That was a situation tailor made to allow Ginny to swoop in and save Harry for once. But instead, we have Hermione cancel a vacation with her parents whom she only sees for a few weeks a year to come and save Harry. Even /Sirius/ didn't really help him in that situation, though to be fair after Azkaban and his Grimmauld imprisonment, he probably wasn't mentally equipped to be that person.

But instead of the scene that could have forgiven so many sins in the Harry/Ginny romance for me, when given the chance, Ginny basically just tries to guilt him for ignoring her.

It was very frustrating, but I didn't realize /how/ frustrating that scene was until HBP came out and it became clear that JKR was going to make Harry/Ginny happen */no matter what/*. Prior to HBP, I thought to myself, /"Surely JKR wouldn't have given so much of the scenes that showed shared understanding and companionship, that showed two people really coming to understand how to support one another to Hermione instead of Ginny if she's going to make the crush in Books 1 and 2 come full circle."/

HBP was so frustrating to me because it is /obvious/ that JKR knows how to write good character interactions with a rare level of talent, and it is also obvious that she knows how to depict deep and complex emotional and mental companionship. I just expected that to be /part/ of the eventual teenage romance that would happen, since it was a part of every other book before.

HBP was only so frustrating because JKR had shown herself to be so talented previously. I wouldn't be mad at a less talented author for a book like that, because you can't expect more from a less talented author. It's the same reason that I don't expect certain levels of care and complexity from fanfic authors... most simply don't have the experience and/or talent for that kind of expectation to be fair.

But I feel like that was a fair expectation of JKR because of how clearly talented and accomplished she was at that point.
