Your second comment really clarifies things for me. I've said before that the way to (partially) fix HBP would be to drop the Dean subplot and have Harry's interactions with Ginny in OotP be the start of their romance. It would make the "breakup" subplot a lot more compelling, too. But of course, doing that would require JKR to actually be thinking about romance when she was writing OotP, and she clearly wasn't.

That said, I don't think the epilogue /doesn't/ work. I know many people would have preferred if she'd left it open, but it's still believable that it would work out that way as the books are written. (And I think it still would be if you cut out the "chest monster" and kept Harry's and Ginny's relationship at the OotP level through DH.)
