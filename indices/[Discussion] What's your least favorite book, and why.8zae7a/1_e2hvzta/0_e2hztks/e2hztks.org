Yes, so much this! I've been through the stages of grief, and you do /not/ recover that quickly. Dumbledore saying it was mature of Harry irked me. No, it was OoC. Harry mourned more for Cedric than he did Sirius.

Also, as an author, you have to let the ending adapt to the story. Yeah, I have the ending of my story planned, I know how I /want/ it to play out on the way there, but am I going to keep it entirely the same? Probably not. I get to know these characters as I write, and they might not be the same people at the end as I first imagined them. (Sorry if this sounds rambling...)
