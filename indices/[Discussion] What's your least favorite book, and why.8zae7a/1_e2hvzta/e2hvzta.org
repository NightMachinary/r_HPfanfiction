HBP and it's not even close. I'll pull parts of two recent comments I've made in this sub to give the details of my answer:

  However, HBP was such a DRAMATIC shift in tone from OotP that it felt, at least to me, like it was more of a left turn. OotP was dark, and it was gritty, and it was emotional. It had powerful moments of characterization and emotion, and it showed incredible depth to many characters in the books.

  HBP simplified a lot of things. Sure, it's teenage romance which isn't exactly suave, but the descriptions of Harry's "feelings" were gag inducing. (Christ, please keep the dragon inside Harry.) After the incredible depth and emotion of OotP, HBP which started only a few weeks after Sirius' death showed Harry essentially shrugging it off. He had none of the expected inner turmoil over losing Sirius that people expected, and the only real inner emotions the book went into was the awfully written romance between him and Ginny.

  It also kind of dulled what was supposed to be the emotional fulcrum of the whole series: Dumbledore's death. The rest of the book had been so childish and annoying that reading the last few chapters it just didn't feel like I was actually invested in the story in the same way. I read Dumbledore's death in a much more detached way than I did Sirius', and basically thought "Oh, well I suppose that will make Book 7 a bit different."

  JKR didn't take any time to give Ginny the proper depth either. She essentially played the part of the uterus for the stories. If JKR had wanted to make that work better, some of the roles she gave to Hermione she should have given to Ginny, like the Christmas scene in OotP. In fact, after Hermione cancels her vacation and makes sure Harry is okay, Ginny basically tells Harry, "hey, I'm one of the only people in the world that can uniquely relate to your fears of being possessed by Voldemort, and I wanted to explain this to you all along, but I was annoyed that you were being broody and ignoring me".

  Like... seriously?

  In my mind the main reason for the dramatic shift in tone from OotP to HBP was how JKR had been writing the series.

  When JKR first came up with the idea she started making copious notes and outlines. By her own admission though, the very first thing she wrote narratively was the epilogue. It's one of the reasons the epilogue is so cringe worthy.

  Props to her for knowing where she wanted to go with it and end up, a lot of authors don't.

  She knew the main plot elements of the books before writing it all out, however JKR's real talent always was and always will be character-driven stories. For the first five books, it seems obvious to me that she was hitting all the plot points she needed to, but inbetween the plot how she handled the characters was much more "what works best" and "what would this character do or say right now".

  But she finished OotP, looked at all that she had written, and had a moment where she realized that she was now getting rather far from the epilogue she had written in the mid 90s. The characters had taken on a life of their own and they didn't want to fit the ending place she was headed. (Not just in pairings, in other ways also.)

  She could, of course, have thrown the epilogue away at that moment. But instead she decided that she needed to "correct" the direction things were headed in. It's why HBP is so ham-fisted. She was for the first time really forcing characters that she had been mostly giving freedom to in the previous 5 books.

This perspective on HBP and how it was written is one that JKR has basically shared in interviews since the series has been completed. She /knows/ this is what she did, and she knows why she did it. Again, that's fine, this is still one of the best collected works of fiction ever.

I actually quite liked DH, but I don't read it that often because that means reading HBP.

Outside of the OBVIOUS answer of HBP, my answer would have to be Chamber of Secrets for many of the reasons listed in an earlier answer. That book isn't quite as frustrating from a character perspective, but is just grating to read through at times.
