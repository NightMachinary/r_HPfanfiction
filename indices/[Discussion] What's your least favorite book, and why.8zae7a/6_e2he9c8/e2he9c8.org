Chamber of Secrets.

On a narrative level, this book is easily the worst in the series.

- Even next to its predecessor, it feels too out of sync with the wizarding world established later on, including all the characterizations.
- The entire situation feels incredibly contrived for the big reveal of Ginny being the one opening the chamber.
- Dobby's powers were written expicitly to provide fore shadowing.
- The arrival of Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, plus the basilisk fang being on hand, are possibly the biggest deus ex machina in the series, possibly next to the whole mirror situation in DH.
- Sixteen year old Voldemort has this incredibly elaborate plan that he gets away with, but his endgame is almost laughable comparitively which is out of sync.
- Harry not being able to attack the shade, but the shade can pick up his wand and cast spells.
- The phoenix has all these incredibly convenient powers, many of which would be useless in other situations. If Fawkes had a bunch of useless abilities too, like say, the ability to detect the presence of chocolate, it would have at least not been as big of a deal.
- This book portrays the younger Weasleys in a worse light than in all the other books, including Ginny. Sure, they are kids. But they also lived their whole lives together. The entire Ginny-crush feels contrived to give an excuse to why this girl is suddenly quieter and withdrawn.

As for HBP. I agree with some points about it, particularly with the idea that Harry seems to still be wandering aimlessly through life. On the romance...I think Harry deserves something of a pass considering his less than normal childhood and understanding of relationships. Not to mention /they are sixteen years old/. Magic doesn't make you less hormonal. Shit, Dumbledore was gearing up to travel the world with a kid who had been kicked out of another school and was spouting diatribes about domination and the natural order of things. James spent six years obsessing over the same girl, who wasn't interested till later.
