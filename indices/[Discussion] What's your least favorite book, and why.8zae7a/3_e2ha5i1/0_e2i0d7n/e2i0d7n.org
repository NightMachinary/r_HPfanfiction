I have such mixed feelings about HBP.

On the one hand, it includes a lot of the "slice of life" Hogwarts stuff that I had always craved. On the other hand, it included it at such an inappropriate time in the series: innocence was for the earlier books, and HBP should have been a ramping up of the war.

And to add insult to injury, most of the slice of life stuff took pains to stress how much Harry was struggling with magic. Just to rub our noses in the fact that the hero's journey hinted at in PoA-GoF was not happening.
