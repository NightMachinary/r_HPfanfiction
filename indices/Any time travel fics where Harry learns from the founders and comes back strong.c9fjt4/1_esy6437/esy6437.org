The closest fic that meets your description is probably linkffn(Harry Potter: Wizards at War). Warning though, I would say this is not a great fic by any stretch, merely that it fits your description.

There are also several fics where Harry or others meet portraits/horcruxes/etc. of the founders such as A Cadmean Victory, but they usually do not involve time travel. You may also be interested in some reincarnation fics as well, but they generally involve Salazar Slytherin reincarnating as Harry or Hermione and becoming Indie.
