I prefer something in-between. I'd like for Harry to get stronger, but not significantly so. If he gets too strong, it messes with the dynamics of the trio imo. The thing I liked from canon was that Ron and Hermione were never really sidekicks. They never needed to hide behind Harry or be told what to do. There were even occasions where Harry was saved by them.

Canon!Harry wasn't really an 'everyman' to me. By the seventh book, Harry, and the trio in general, were holding their own against death eaters. They really only struggled against the most experienced ones (Bellatrix, Dolohov, etc.).
