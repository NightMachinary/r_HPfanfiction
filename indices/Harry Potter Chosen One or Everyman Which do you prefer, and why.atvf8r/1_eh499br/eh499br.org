The Everyman thing usually ends with the villains being comically incompetent when it comes down to fighting. It also involves a lot of Deus ex Machina and even more dumb luck. We've all read the Atrium battle between Albus and Voldemort - there's no way an everyman can last a minute if Voldemort decides to actually use even a tenth of the magic he used in that fight. In canon, the series ended had Voldemort's intelligence and ability being nerfed down to Crabbe and Goyle levels.

The Choson One works better, if only because you're not giving the villains a huge handicap.

Besides, having the potential to become Voldemort's or Albus' equal does not mean that Harry is their equal when he's a teenager.
