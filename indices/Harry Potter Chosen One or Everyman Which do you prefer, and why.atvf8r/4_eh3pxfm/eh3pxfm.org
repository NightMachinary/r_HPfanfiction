I would have loved to see Harry develop into a powerful wizard (or typical Chosen One) by the time of the 7th book, if only to see Harry performing incredible feats of magic from his own perspective and the extensive process of him reaching that point. One scene in the books that will always stand out is the battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Ministry, and having a version with Harry doing something similar at the Battle of Hogwarts would have been a joy to read (in the end it still could have been the elder wand trick that won him the duel). Now, it's difficult imagining Harry in canon being capable of such magic, but it would have been incredible if done right.

But at the same time, having Harry be The Everyman by the end of the story was incredibly powerful in its own right (and might have been the better choice). Seeing that in order to defeat Voldemort, it doesn't take a powerful wizard like Dumbledore and some complicated magic, but simply an extraordinary individual willing to sacrifice everything to save those he loves, is some deep stuff. Harry was the Chosen One in a way--his death being the key to Voldemort's defeat--and not needing to level him up to some Wizarding God in order to show that is a testament to JK Rowling's work.

Though I do agree that I think Rowling was torn between the two up into the 4th/5th book. It's the 6th book with Harry struggling with silent spell casting and magic in general that we see her really embrace The Everyman.
