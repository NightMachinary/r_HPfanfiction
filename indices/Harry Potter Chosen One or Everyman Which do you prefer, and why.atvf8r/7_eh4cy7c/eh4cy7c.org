I despise "Chosen One" narratives, but in Harry's case I think it worked mostly because he was always less formidable than his reputation. Sure, he pulled off some impressive stunts when he had to, but he was never the Great Invincible Saviour-Hero that the public hailed him as. It was one of the few things I actually found interesting about him...

That is actually something that Harry has in common with Dumbledore. Both have a reputation of being more than what they actually are, though since Harry's the main character this duality's a lot clearer.
