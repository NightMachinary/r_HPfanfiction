If I had the choice it should be a bit of a split, 70/30 Chosen one over Everyman, this kinda creates a third selection best described as a Badass. To me Harry should always be depicted as a tough and strong person. But Badass Harry should be someone taken seriously by both sides. He should been seen as the next Moody, some one who is considered powerful and dangerous but not godly like Albus.
