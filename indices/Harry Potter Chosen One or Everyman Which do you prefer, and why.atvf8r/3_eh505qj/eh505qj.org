Quoting Enembee's profile from ff.net, which I think summarizes everything for me:

#+begin_quote
  "The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation."

Harry Potter the actual series seems to rely for its popularity at least partially, (I think) on the fact that Harry is /not/ special. In fact, he's Dumbledore's puppet, especially in the last book where it feels like the entire sequence of events has somehow, improbably, been set in motion by Dumbledore who knows /precisely/ what will happen even after his own death.

I think most readers find it easier to sympathize with a character who has very little in the way of special talents. (Even his "capacity for love" seem pretty run of the mill.) Characters who are super hard-working and/or very talented are not much like the average person, and so many people have trouble projecting themselves in their place and aren't very interested in reading about them.

When a character is enough of a cipher and sufficiently mediocre, though, it's insanely easy to see yourself able to do the same things (even if you yourself aren't particularly mediocre), and as the story is told almost entirely from Harry's point of view, well, this makes it pretty easy to see yourself in the story.

That said, my own tastes are pretty different.

In canon, as skillfully as it's written, Harry isn't a player in the events at all. He's a pawn in a game between Dumbledore and Voldemort, with neither particularly much free will nor particularly much character growth.

Or, as Enembee hints, what you're promised at the start of the novels is a bildungsroman about a wizard who starts as a child but ends being able to defeat a powerful evil opponent. You're given a strong hint that Harry will struggle and grow and eventually be capable of overcoming Voldemort. Instead, what you get is the PoV of someone whose only real hope of winning is that Dumbledore did a good enough job predicting and manipulating the utterly unreasonable series of events that he clearly somehow set up before his death in book six.

Although I really enjoyed canon, it wasn't because this was a particularly satisfying result, at least not to me.

I like seeing people who are competent. Not superpowered, not gods, but smart and hard working and willing to make some effort to succeed. It's also nice when they have troubles, when they have flaws, but they pull themselves together and struggle forward anyway.

So, one of the things I like in fan fiction is seeing my itch scratched: to see a Harry who is a hero and not Dumbledore's wind-up toy, which is to say, seeing a competent Harry, a Harry who, through long and very hard work mixed with some talent, manages to go from being a child to becoming an older teen powerful enough to be an actual player in the events. I want a real coming of age story.

I thus prefer fan fiction where, instead of being led by the nose and being unremarkable, Harry instead (not easily and not quickly, but eventually) grows into someone who is capable of overcoming Voldemort on his own.

(Sidebar: there's a very real sense in which I find Snape and Hermione the most compelling characters in canon; Snape certainly has the most interesting plot arc, though it's underplayed. He's done something pretty much no one else could have done (acted as a spy for years, deceiving Voldemort all the while), sacrificed incredibly deeply to atone for his misdeeds, and yet, at the same time, he's tragically caught up in a past that never was, mourning an unrequited love decades after it became hopeless. And Dumbledore doesn't help him get over his unreasonable attachment to a destroyed friendship and unrequited love, he instead uses Snape as a weapon. Snape's a /really/ interesting character, and quite underused in canon.)
