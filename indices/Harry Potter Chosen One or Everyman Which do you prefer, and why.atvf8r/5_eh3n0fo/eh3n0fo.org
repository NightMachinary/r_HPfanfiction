Everyman. Hands down. This is probably a side effect of reading a lot of fantasy as a teen, but i am really sick and tired of the chosen one theme. It always feel like polot conenience, and in my opinion cheapens the sacrifices of the protagonist. Because they are destined to fight the big bad there was only one option.

Which is probably why I stopped enjoying HP halfway through book 5, and stopped reading after a few chapters of book 6.
