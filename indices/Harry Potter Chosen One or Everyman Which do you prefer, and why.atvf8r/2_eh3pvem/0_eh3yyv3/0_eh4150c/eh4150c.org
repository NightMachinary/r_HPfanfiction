  Up to book three Harry as an everyman works.
#+end_quote

How? Harry is put in situations where an everyman has no business coming out on top, and he DOES come out on top, through a shitload of plot armor (fight against the basilisk), fateful interventions (Fawkes, mommy's protection) and inherent power (repelling 100 dementors), neither of which fits everyman narrative. Harry is really in no way ordinary. Well actually everymen are often plot bulletproof, but that's bad writing imo.

I guess you could have written the first three books with Harry as an everyman, but they'd have been pretty different. The actual books certainly don't fit.
