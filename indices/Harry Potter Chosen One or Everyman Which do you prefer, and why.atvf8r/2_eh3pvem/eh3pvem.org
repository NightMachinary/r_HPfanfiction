For Harry Potter, chosen one works better. Chosen one is basically a justification for plot armor, and everyman Harry has no business doing what he does every year with just a bit of luck as justification.

In general I deeply dislike the chosen one trope, but everyman in a heroic context is even worse. You can't be fucking both at the same time, they're in direct opposition and together they make characters incoherent (like Harry going from great feats to idiocy depending on plot requirements).
