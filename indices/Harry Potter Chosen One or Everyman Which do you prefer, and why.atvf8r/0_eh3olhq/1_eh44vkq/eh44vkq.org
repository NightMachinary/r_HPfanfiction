This is where I stand, no question. It's not difficult when reading the books to take some of Harry's narration as truth, but honestly he has a pretty skewed perspective of himself and his own abilities. I see the question of 'how powerful was Harry, really?' come up quite a bit, and the consensus usually seems to be that he was a pretty average wizard who was capable of defeating Voldemort simply because the prophecy predicted itself. But I don't think that's true. There are endless interpretations of the prophecy at this point, but to me it seemed pretty clear that it was made in the first place /because Harry was coming into existence./ Harry is, in fact, quite a unique person (the prophecy simply provides him with tools to help him along the way, e.g. Parseltongue, a psychic/soul connection to Voldemort). He's got a huge heart and a remarkably calibrated moral compass despite all the horrific trauma he goes through (something Dumbledore stresses often in his attempts to convey to Harry that, yes, the power of love is actually A Thing), and apart from that he really does seem to possess a lot of raw power.

Like OP stated, Harry produces a solid form patronus at the age of thirteen, something Wizarding adults are always to quick to point out as extraordinarily impressive and surprising. Despite the perception of Harry as an average, perhaps even lazy, student, he achieves high marks in all his O.W.L. exams that require magic, even passing Astronomy after witnessing Professor McGonagall being attacked during the test - his only failings were Divination (self-explanatory) and History of Magic (which IIRC he collapsed half-way through due to the vision about Sirius Voldemort sent him). There's even a scene at the beginning of book 5 where he performs wandless magic (when the Dementors are attacking and he's dropped his wand, he says 'Lumos' and it lights up even though he isn't holding it). Everyone from Dumbledore to Hermione to Viktor Krum believes that Harry is a skilled, clever, and talented wizard, in spite of the fact that Harry himself has trouble believing this:

  Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

  "You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?"

  "Yes, Harry," said Hermione gently, "but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said [...] Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang."

  "Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit."

It's also not a fluke that the most obviously powerful wizards in the series are 50/60+ years of age (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Slughorn, McGonagall, etc.), and explains why students who show early promise like Hermione, a young Dumbledore, and yes, Harry, are considered so exceptional. It takes time and practice to develop and cultivate a wizard's innate magical powers. Harry /was/ training and being proactive in books 5 & 6; he was at Hogwarts getting an intensive magical education, he co-founded and taught and led Dumbledore's Army, he personally went up against Death Eaters and came out on top, he was decisive and assertive in making his political standings apparent to the Minister for Magic and making it clear he wasn't going to be used, he received lessons from Dumbledore imparting important information about Voldemort's history and activity and psychology. We didn't see the boot camp-like training regimens of fan fiction, but that doesn't at all mean Harry wasn't growing into his role of the 'Chosen One.'

He was very young, sometimes I think people forget just how young, and he wasn't afforded the time to grow into a wizard who could have matched Voldemort blow-for-blow in a duel (though I believe he did, later in life). In fact, I was just thinking about this today, about the final battle between them and how cool it would have been to be able to see Harry win in a spectacular duel like that. But, at seventeen, as skilled as Harry was in Defense and dueling for his age, he knew he couldn't have done it, and he relied instead on his instincts and precision ability. The scene in DH of Slughorn, McGonagall, and Kingsley dueling Voldemort simultaneously and failing, and then Harry stepping up and finishing the job with one expertly-aimed Expelliarmus that reflects Voldemort's Killing Curse back onto him, to me, is like that scene you get where there's a big archery competition, and the contenders are doing their best, slinging as many arrows as they can, and then up walks this kid, who takes one shot and splits the arrow in the center of the bullseye straight down the middle.

Because that's what he was born to do.
