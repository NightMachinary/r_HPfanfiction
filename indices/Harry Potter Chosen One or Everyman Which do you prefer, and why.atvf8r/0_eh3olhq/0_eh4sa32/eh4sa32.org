JKR obviously wants the Trio to get all the accolades, and thus writes good adult guys as basically useless idiots. Where you can excuse Dumbledore's behaviors in first three Books as typical children's book shenanigans, his behaviors in Book 6 amount to total criminal negligence and incompetence. Heroic deeds by other students get skimmed over in a few paragraphs and completely ignored in Movies.

But she doesn't want to write the Trio as competent either. They have no coherent strategies whatsoever and only reacted to whatever their enemies threw at them. Tactically, JKR goes all in the “good guys don't kill” trope and prevents the Trio from putting any of those sadistic genocidal terrorists permanently out of business. As a result, they can only win through literary weapons such as Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope. Bad guys have to be dumbed down to room temperature IQ for them to even have a chance.

In the end, it doesn't really matter whether Harry is written as Everyman or Chosen One, getting rid of tired literary tropes is the key.
