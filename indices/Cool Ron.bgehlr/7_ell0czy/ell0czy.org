Well, you are reading weird type of fanfiction stories, because he is usually rather interesting character in most canonical stories. Trying almost anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], for example. Or I just read now linkffn(13170637), where he is a main hero (and Slytherin) and so far it looks rather interesting. And yes, I hate ALL bashing stories and Weasleys and Dumbledore are the most common punching bags of too shallow authors.
