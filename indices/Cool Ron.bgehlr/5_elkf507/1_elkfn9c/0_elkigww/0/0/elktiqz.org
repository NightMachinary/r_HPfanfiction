Oh sorry, I've forgotten about the Hermione/Snape aspect of A Game of Chess. It's a time-travel fic and so far Hermione/Snape has only been vaguely mentioned in the a few chapters, referring to an adult Hermione and Snape's marriage that took place sometime post-1998. It hasn't been addressed yet in 1994 (Goblet of Fire), the year to which Ron time-traveled to.

An important thing that I should've mentioned is that the author stated that the fic is an exercise in using problematic/challenging tropes, Snape/Hermione being one of them. Here's what the author said in one of the AO3 comments:

  We'll eventually reach a discussion in the author's notes, but the Hermione/Severus pairing is, in and of itself, one of the problematic tropes. I could reconcile it so long as they were both of age. Hermione here [in 1994] is definitively not.

Here's one of the meta discussions that take place at the Author's Notes of every chapter (one of my favorite aspects of the fic):

  Today's problematic trope is time travel romance. And whoooboy is it problematic to the nth power.

  In this scene, Hermione is fourteen and Ron is in his twenties.

  It's complicated by the fact that Ron loved her when he was also fourteen, and that Hermione has always been 'the one who got away'. Ron's love does spring from a place of the two of them growing up together and being through a war together. It's real, and untainted by moral quandaries.

  But now Hermione is a child, and Ron is not. She is not the Hermione who grew up with him - she still is growing up. She is not the woman who fought at his side: she is not a woman at all.

  It's really unfortunate (and creepy) how many time travel stories don't merely sidestep this moral question with flimsy justifications but rather behave as though it is not even there.
