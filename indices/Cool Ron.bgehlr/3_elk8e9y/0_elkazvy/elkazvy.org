You're already my FUCKING FAVORITE. I haven't read this one yet though because after "Lady Thief" and "Patron" I can't stomach Harry or Hermione being paired with anyone else for a little while. I will add this to my list for when I recover though.

Ron's depiction in "Secret of Atlantis" is actually pretty good too.
