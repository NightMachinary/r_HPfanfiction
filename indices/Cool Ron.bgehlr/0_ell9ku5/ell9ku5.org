The thing with Ron is that he is one if the few kids that is actually described as an actual Teenager in the books. He's emotional, aggressive, a little bit perverted, lazy, clumsy, gluttonous, highly insecure and at times very selfish.

While Harry shows a bit of a childish side, he's way too humble and mature, mentally due to his upbringing as an unwanted element. Not to mention Hermione who was always described as the 'mom-friend'.

Ron had the most... Stable childhood out of their entire circle of friends and he ended up being the most normal teenager as a result which doesn't really endear him to a lot of fanfic authors, which is a shame because despite all of the crap that happened between Harry and Ron, he always remained loyal to Harry in the books.
