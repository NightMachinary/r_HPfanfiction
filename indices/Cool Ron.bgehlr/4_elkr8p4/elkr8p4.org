It's a very long story and Ron is admittedly a (significant) secondary figure, but in the Spacebattles thread/stories [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And The Shipgirls]] ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][part 2 here]]), Ron's chess skills have led to a situation that has inspired him to be currently on his way to becoming the greatest (Scotty-level) naval mechanic/engineer in the UK, and he's still only in his third year of Hogwarts!

Warning, /very/ long read.

Note - Percy gets his chance to shine too. Who knew that he was (possibly) a Pharaoh reborn...
