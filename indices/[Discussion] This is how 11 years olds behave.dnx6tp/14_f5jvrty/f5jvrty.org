It takes a skilled writer to write children as children. Not even children can do that, because they'll want their characters to say and do all kinds of things that children won't. Even JKR didn't often keep the characters true to their ages.

It's not shocking that the most common way to portray child protagonists in an arena of amateur writers is them behaving like little adults.
