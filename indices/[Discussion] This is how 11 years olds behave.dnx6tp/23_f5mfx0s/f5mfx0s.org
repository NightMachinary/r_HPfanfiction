Give me the political 11 year old mastermind (note: There were people like that once! Look at old royal/noble families! Those had their kids educated about politics etc. and they did kind of act like that at times (not all the time, they are still kids, too after all!)) any day...I don't much care for kid problems ("Oh I have acne!" - Sorry, but I don't care! Go brew a potion against that or something and let us get on with the story!)
