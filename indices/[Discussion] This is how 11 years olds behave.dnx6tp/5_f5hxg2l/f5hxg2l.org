I'd correct that this is how 11 year-olds who were raised in the modern Western world behave. 11 year-olds in a hypothetical world where they were raised and trained early to speak eloquently and play at politics may behave differently. They may hide their playfulness because they were taught so. They may appear formal and calculating because they were taught so.
