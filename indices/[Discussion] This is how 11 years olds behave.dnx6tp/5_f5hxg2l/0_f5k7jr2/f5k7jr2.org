All you need to do is look at kids who are being forced into business or very serious study of the arts or whatever. They act so differently from a random neighbor kid.

I grew up playing outside and just being a carefree kid and later in my life i got into the game "Go" and had a friend of the family whose kid was a piano prodigy.

The kids in the piano crowd were usually SUPER serious and so intense about music, though some would still be childish sometimes.

As for go i got very good, best in my state, and got to travel and meet some entire families who were deep into it as well as a guy who sold his business to microsoft and was working on another one while training his kid to learn how to do that.

The kids from all of these things acted much more like the serious, politically plotting, grown up acting kids from stories than many seem to think.
