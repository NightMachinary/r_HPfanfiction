High class kids a hundred years ago would/could act very different to how kids today act, so i can tolerate the politics if its done well. Not to mention that deeply traumatized kids (child soldier for example) act in totally another way too.

But its best if its a well done mix, if its done badly like in prince of slytherin at the start in can ruin a fic. ( dont get me wrong, pos is amazing, but the first 10 chapters or so are terrible)
