That's what I prefer to do. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165448/1/Dance-of-the-Moths][In my au]] I have witches and wizards maturing faster than muggles, and Hogwarts starting at 12 instead of 11. My first year characters are about 14/15, developmentally, which leads to way more interesting storytelling. Trying to accurately portray the worldview of an 100 year old limits you to an almost absurd degree. You have to be a writer of Harper Lee's caliber to effectively write gripping drama from the perspective of a child, and I'm certainly not one.

The worst thing someone can do is to try and take a middle road between portraying a first year's mind realistically or in an unrealistic (but more interesting) adult fashion, and have romance-based plots with eleven year olds. I've only seen that done well [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1137958][/once/]], and that's because the point of the story was to have a flufy, innocent, they-don't-entirely-realize-it-yet childhood romance.
