I feel like you can write the unedited style reasonably well because it makes people sound more human. Obviously, it would destroy the effect if you wrote a grand speech with many filler sounds, but for regular teenage dialogue, especially around the topic of dating, it is perfectly fine to use cut off sentences, repeat words due to the character's nerves and so on.
