I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't really mind the political kid stuff. Is it unrealistic? Yes, of course. But do I find the political maneuvering and considerations interesting enough to be able to ignore the lack of realism? Yes, even more so.

I don't particularly want to read about /actual/ 11 year olds having an uneventful year, which would be kinda boring and, well, juvenile.

I'd definitely take some sort of Slytherin House of Cards set in the Wizengamot with adult versions of our beloved characters doing political maneuvering. But without that, I'm willing to stretch credulity for the sake of a mildly intriguing plot.

Maybe would be harder to do if I/friends had kids of our own though, to be fair.
