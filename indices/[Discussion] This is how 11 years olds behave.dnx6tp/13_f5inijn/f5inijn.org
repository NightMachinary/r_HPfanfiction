Well obviously I'd prefer adult characters being all political, but since reason aged-up aus aren't as popular, I'd rather not see the petty things real 11 year olds get up to, and I don't particularly want a canon rehash either. Like that video was cute, but not cute enough that I'd want to read 50 chapters of something like it. Making the kids act like adults brings more tension to the story. What really bugs me about the politicking stories is that they tend to be an excuse for Harry to be super edgy, nobody can match his abilities, sometimes not even Dumbledore.
