Yes I agree with MOST of your points for example that fart jokes will be forever, but not the sluggishness or anything like that, because if you're eleven and you've just been told that MAGIC is real I think I would already be going wherever I need to, probably Gringotts first and then I'd have dragged my dad and my mom to the book store and then Ollivanders and then tried to do every spell in the book or something and then maybe went to the other stores pretty grumpily and gosh I pity madam Malkin because I would not have been able to stay put for more than a second

Otherwise I agree with you
