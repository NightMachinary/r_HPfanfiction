  Yes I agree with MOST of your points for example that fart jokes will be forever, but not the sluggishness or anything like that, because if you're eleven and you've just been told that MAGIC is real I think I would already be going wherever I need to, probably Gringotts first and then I'd have dragged my dad and my mom to the book store and then Ollivanders and then tried to do every spell in the book or something and then maybe went to the other stores pretty grumpily and gosh I pity madam Malkin because I would not have been able to stay put for more than a second

  Otherwise I agree with you

I did not mean that sluggishness would last forever, more that my nephew has hit that point and it is a prime example.

I see that example used a lot. “If I was magical, I would do x and y without delay!” and I have to wonder if people give the same enthusiasm to their current schoolwork. Yes, you have magic, but you still have to attend school. You cannot go off and gallivant around, learning all obscure spells day one. You have seven years of schooling to go through. I gave school about 20% effort. I think I would do the same at Hogwarts, magic or not.

However, we also need to factor in students that would know magic exists. Because that sense of wonder is gone from pure-bloods that have grown up around magic.

I see posts complaining about Harry and Ron not wanting to go to class/do homework because MAGIC! But, at the end of the day, that is their version of school and not everyone likes school. Same context here.
