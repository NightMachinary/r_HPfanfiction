I do put /almost/ the same effort to school that I would to learning magic

Yes, but as I said, I would most likely either be scared to death by magic or would do what I said in my other comment, AND that's not even factoring in the fact that if magic was real, almost the only way that the Harry Potter series type magic was real would be if J.K Rowling herself was a witch and the book series was actually an autobiography of Harrys life. That's just because of the millions of possibilities, but lets just talk like it is and we don't know anything about magic yet because you're a muggleborn/muggle raised and professor Mcgonagall or someone else came and told you about Magic, what is the most likely thing to do? For me it would be to ask to prove it so I would be sure it's not a prank, when I'm assured it is real I would probably tell them I want to go to the school and then go to my room to think about the shock of my life that I just received. Then I would probably look over the list of stuff needed and wonder hoq they work and what could be done with them

And even if you are a purenlood, in my opinion its still a pretty cool thing, because they can finally DO magic and they've never been (lawfully) allowed to do that

There are still going to be those that are total lazy asses about school and would probably sleep the time in the hogwarts express and had forgotten almost half their books and stuff home or something

And I don't understand how the kids at hogwarts always had their books with them to classes, like at my school it's just normal for teachers to say ”go get your books, you that managed to forget them again” at the beginning of a class
