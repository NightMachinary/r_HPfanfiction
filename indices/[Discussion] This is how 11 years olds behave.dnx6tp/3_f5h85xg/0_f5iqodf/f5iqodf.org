I feel like a lot of people gloss over this fact and either wave it away or see a video of eleven-year-olds behaving â€˜normally' for a few minutes and assume that is how all of them act. My nephew has yet to learn swearing and offensive racist terms -- or he is smart enough to not say them near adults -- he has long since used sarcasm and mastered the art of sluggishness. Ask him to do something and he will drag his feet for an hour as he does it. We would be 50,000 words in and still in Diagon Alley if we used legitimate eleven-year-olds.

Most pre-teens here talk like they are on the internet. They say bruh a lot, use autism as the new gay, use gay as in gay, are openly racist and quite petty with it. Even if we go back a few years, it was still the same over-the-top offensive remarks designed to get a rise out of people or to seem cool. The giggling after swearing, the muttered racist remarks, and the loud and unashamed declaration that something -- or someone -- is gay.

The upside is that boys still seem to just lose it when someone farts. I guess that one will always be relevant.

I feel like authors need to 50/50 this. They can be decent politicians as I expect most uppity people to have learned manners, greetings, et cetera, but not so in your face about it. No, an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy should not sway into the Slytherin common room and have all them boy to his every whim as he is a Malfoy. In canon, that family fell from grace quite rapidly, even under the reign of Voldemort, who often used these pure-blood traditions as a vocal point in his reign.
