My five year old recently learned the word "shit." He asked me what it meant, and I said "poop."

He laughed uncontrollably for about five minutes, /it means POOP?!!/ and then said "I'm going potty! I have to shit!!!"

And burst into more laughter as he walked to the bathroom. I heard him in there laughing to himself as he took his little shit, too. Haha.

So yeah, poop, fart, butt, penis, boobs, etc--no matter the age, body humor will always be funny.
