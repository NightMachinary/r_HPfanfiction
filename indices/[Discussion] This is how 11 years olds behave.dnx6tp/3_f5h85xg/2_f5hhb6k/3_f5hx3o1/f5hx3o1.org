I'm not talking about my friends, I'm talking about the hordes of school children I see on public transport, who "sing" along rap tracks along the lines of (Your mother) Has gone through everything, sauna clubs, nude clubs. She has been sucking before I started rappingor lazy bitch, go to the gym and turn your behind into a (proper) ass just to give to rather tame examples. Because ghetto rap is the kind of music that's popular at school, since it's something children aren't supposed to be listening to. It has been that way when I've been to school and it hasn't changed much, other than that people wouldn't have dared to sing along in public back in my days because German rap was still a new thing.

And yes, such language is offensive, but that's the whole point. You use it when you WANT TO insult someone. An adult might go for a cheeky insult hidden in a compliment, but when you're just out of elementary school, you are rather limited in your verbal arsenal and therefore just use a combination of all the bad words you know.

Edit: fixed the spoilers. Why does every website has to use a different spoiler system?
