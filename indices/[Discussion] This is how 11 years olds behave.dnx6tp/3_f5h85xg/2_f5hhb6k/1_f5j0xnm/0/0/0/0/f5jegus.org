I understand completely. A lot of kids just learn things through imitation, so they pick up on what adults are saying, know that it's an "adult" thing to say, and use it themselves. That's it, for the most part. Think of it like how little kids don't have a strong sense of what is right or wrong yet, so they can be incredibly kind and compassionate but also cruel and sociopathic because of it.
