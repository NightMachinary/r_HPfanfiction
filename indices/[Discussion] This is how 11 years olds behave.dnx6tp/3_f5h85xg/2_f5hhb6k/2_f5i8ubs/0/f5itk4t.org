My circle friends is in their early twenties, and well, the one thing that's changes is behaviour in public. In private, the banter is still about doing the mother of someone else and insults about ones heritage (I'm half Polish, so I'm stealing the cars. The Ukrainian is in the Soviet mob and so on). We have a gay bloke, and he calls everything gay and uses faggot as goto insult.

The thing is, we all know that we're just dicking around. There's a big difference between telling someone random that he looks like he'd suck a dick for a tenner with the intent to hurt their feelings and having some fun with your mates. Context matters a lot, but getting that across in writing is incredibly hard.
