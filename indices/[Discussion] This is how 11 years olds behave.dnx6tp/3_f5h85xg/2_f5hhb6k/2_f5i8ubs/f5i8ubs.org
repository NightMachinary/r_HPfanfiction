What a charmed childhood, lol.

After 9/11 the one Muslim girl in my grade (5th grade, so a year off from 11) left because kids were chanting/screaming yakkity-yak, bomb Iraq at her (among other reasons) and we definitely called each other "gay as in stupid" for a /while/. A lot of us wised up maybe...14 years old? But 11-year-olds can be pieces of shit.
