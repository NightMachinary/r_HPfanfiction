Efficient! :( That's very bad. Yes our schools and areas must just have been different then! People at my school actually stuck up for openly gay students. In my last year of schooling a transgender girl even came out and got help from a few other girls with donating dresses and makeup and stuff! Maybe it is because I live in a smaller city? So everyone is nicer to each other because they see each other way more often?
