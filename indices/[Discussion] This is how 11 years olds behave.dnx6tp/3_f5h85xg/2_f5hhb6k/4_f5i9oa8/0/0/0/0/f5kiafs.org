  Maybe it is because I live in a smaller city? So everyone is nicer to each other because they see each other way more often?

Being in a city likely makes a difference, although I'm inclined to believe it could just be an issue of time. It's been a long while since I was a middle school student and the public's treatment of LGBTQ issues in North America has changed a lot in the interim (I can't speak on other parts of the world). In Canada civil marriages weren't allowed nationwide until 2005. Three years /after/ that, down in California, the electorate /voted/ to /eliminate/ same-sex marriages. These are relatively recent things. So to see the attitudes towards the LGBTQ population that are present in media now stands in stark contrast to what was occurring even just a decade ago.
