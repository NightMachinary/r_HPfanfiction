That's a very different experience than what I was around. We had people get harassed at school just because they were openly bi. I can't even think of a single instance in which a gay male was out until during university, likely due to the social stigma of being openly gay in my area at that time. When some students at my high school formed a chapter of GSA, none of the boys wanted to show up because of the stigma of being labeled as gay. The members of GSA would be openly and regularly ridiculed by a significant portion of the student body. I feel like that kind of treatment isn't tolerated anymore at schools (though as I'm no longer a student I can't actually comment on that).
