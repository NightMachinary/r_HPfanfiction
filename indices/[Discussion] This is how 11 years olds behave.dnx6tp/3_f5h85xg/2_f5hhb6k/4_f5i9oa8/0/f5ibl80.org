I am not saying nobody did it, or I never saw anybody do stuff like that occasionally, but I personally never did, and I never knew anyone in my classes that did. And the rare kids that did were always disciplined for it! A boy got suspended for calling me a dyke when he found out I was gay, for example. And he only did it again like twice before getting pulled out of school. So maybe my school was just not that bad as others? Or less tolerant of that kind of bullying crap?

People talk about stuff like this like it was rampant racism or homophobia in the halls, but my school honestly just rarely saw that kind of stuff! It was a tight ship. :)
