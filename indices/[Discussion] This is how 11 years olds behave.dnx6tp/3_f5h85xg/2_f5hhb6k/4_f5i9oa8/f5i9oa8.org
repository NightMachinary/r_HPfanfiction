  I never used terrible language like that, and none of the kids i knew did either.

Then consider yourself lucky and blessed that nobody from your cohort was like that. I'm not sure whether it was a product of time or just location, but the 11 year olds I encountered when I was 11 in my part of North America could be rather mean when the adults weren't looking. Racism and /especially/ homophobia was very common in the area I grew up in, common enough that even many adults didn't think that homophobic statements in public were wrong (public racist statements were frowned upon by adults, but what was said behind closed doors...ugh). Video recordings via phone weren't big back then, but if people had recorded even a tenth of the stuff that was said, most of the kids in my school would've been run off the internet in this day and age.
