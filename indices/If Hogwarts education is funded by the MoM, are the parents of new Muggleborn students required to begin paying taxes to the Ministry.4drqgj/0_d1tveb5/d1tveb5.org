Muggleborns grow up to become tax-paying members of society, and we can assume that the proportion of muggleborns to magicalborn children usually stays stable. Like most taxes, you're usually not paying specifically for yourself, but for the generations above and below you. In the same way new migrants to the UK are automatically entitled to the NHS and education, despite not having paid into it before. The intention is that within time they'll become contributing members of society.
