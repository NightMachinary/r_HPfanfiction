Yeah, I didn't think so either for a long time. But there you have it.

Of course, we still see students having to buy supplies (robes, cauldrons, wand, books, etc) so it must just be things like teacher salary and room & board that are covered by the Ministry.

The redirection of muggle taxes is interesting. Maybe the MoM sets up a shell school in the muggle world and draws funding from the government for the enrolled Hogwarts students? It would have to be done with help from the muggle government or some frequent obliviating and watching for people snooping at the paper trail.

(Note: I respect JK's right and control over her stories, and I'll accept what she says is canon. But I hate learning about canon over a tweet. It's cheap and sad for an author to add things after the fact as they become topical. Even if it brings attention to a worthy cause. End rant.)
