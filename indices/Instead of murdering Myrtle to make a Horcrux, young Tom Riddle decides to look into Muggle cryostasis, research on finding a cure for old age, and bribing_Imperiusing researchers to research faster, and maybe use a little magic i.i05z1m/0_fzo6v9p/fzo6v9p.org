While this is an interesting prompt, how and why would researchers be researching slowly? As in they just give up their own lives to commit to research? Or just start doing experiments except they're done at 2x speed? Are all their years researching just condensed into a neat 5 minute montage by some magic that Tom does?

I dont need to immortality, I need answers.
