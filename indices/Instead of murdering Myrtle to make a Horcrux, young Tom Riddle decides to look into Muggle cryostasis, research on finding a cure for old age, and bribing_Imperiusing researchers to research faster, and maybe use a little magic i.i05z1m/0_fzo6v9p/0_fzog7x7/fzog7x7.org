Maybe the researchers are limited by lack of funding. Imperius some people and they no longer care about funding.

Confund researchers who are researching something else such as dinosaur bones into contributing to gene research. Not enough money to hire them? Imperio!

Sciences colleges suck? Imperio some good researchers to do the teaching, then imperio the graduates. Maybe even use a Pensieve or something to copy and insert memories of years of training into imperio'd researchers.

Or he could steal the Philosopher's Stone and make gold to fund it all.
