I always thought a gryphindor death eater would be pretty damn deadly if you went by stereotypes.

No ulterior motives, no worries about image, just pure action. He believes in the cause so damn much that he can justify any action, any evil done in the name of his beliefs. One who believes himself a hero.

That or Hermione the Death Eater. That would be cool if done right.
