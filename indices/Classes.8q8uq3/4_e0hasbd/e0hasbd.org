Durmstrang seems like the kind of school to teach Warding to me. My reasoning is that the school is obviously in a cold climate (possibly northern Finland, considering the boat in GoF) and seems like a tough place to live. To me, Warding feels like a discipline of magic that requires some power.

I'm not sure where I ever got this from - it may have been the books - but I thought I read somewhere that Fleur was one of the best at Enchanting. This seems like it could fall in line with the more 'delicate' feel of Beauxbatons.
