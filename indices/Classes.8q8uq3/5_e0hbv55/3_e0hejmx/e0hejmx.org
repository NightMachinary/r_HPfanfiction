Some historical reason, lets not go to the school that produced Voldemort for example. Loyalty to a school, one of the child's parents might have been to a school other than Hogwarts. A personal dislike of the staff at Hogwarts. A chance at international connections. Feeling Dumbledore can't prioritise education with all of the other titles he holds. Disliking the house system, maybe the parent was a Hufflepuff and wouldn't wish being a duffer on his worst enemy. Job taking the parents abroad mean they're relocating away from the UK.
