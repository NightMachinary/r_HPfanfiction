I don't see no reason why they wouldn't have basically the same core classes (beyond the fact that Durmstrang has Dark Arts in place of Defence Against the Dark Arts); it's not like foreign schools don't have the same old History, Maths, P.E., etc.. You could play around with the electives, I suppose; for instance, it wouldn't surprise me if Beauxbâtons had a Magical Literature class, and the suggestion that it would offer Alchemy more prominently because the Flamels are Beauxbâtons alumni is a clever one.
