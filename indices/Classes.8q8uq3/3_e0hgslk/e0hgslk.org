OWLs and NEWTs appear to be the international norm.

Given this I would expect most of the core courses are similar or nearly identical.

There may be some variations (ex. Beauxbatons may have a specialization on enchantment, Uagadou may teach an advanced form of transfiguration called transmogrification, etc.), but the main fields are probably similar.
