I figured out a schedule for my Durmstrang!Harry story. I decided to have it a bit more orderly with a set schedule, and with extra teachers so there isn't 100 students in each class. I figure most of the classes would be more or less the same, with some cultural/regional changes.

There were 4 "core" classes in Potions, Charms, Defense, and Transfiguration, as those would be the chosen main magical disciplines. And then each of the core classes would have subclasses/electives, and electives would start from second year and be in 2 year blocks, so you'd have a 2-3 elective block, 4-5 elective block, and 5-6 elective block. That meant you could take a 2-3 elective at sixth year if you wanted, and some electives only had a single block you could take.

For example, Enchanting and Spellcrafting would be two charms electives, with enchanting being available starting from year 2, while spellcrafting being just year 6-7.

Potions would have things like Herbology, Alchemy and Monster Biology as electives. Transfiguration would have Conjuration and Human Transfiguration as electives. Defense would have cursebreaking, monster hunting and duelling as electives.

In addition, there were non-core classes which were stand alone classes, like astronomy and history, as well as standalone electives like divination. And, since I wanted to make the school feel more real, I added in courses like Math and Literature. Those course are all similar to muggle courses, except they would have a magical slant to them. Some of them can have their own electives as well, such as international politics as a history class.
