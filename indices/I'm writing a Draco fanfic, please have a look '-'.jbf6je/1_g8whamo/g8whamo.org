Hey there. Its a nice start. Just so you know dialogue is written with quotation marks in English

"I can speak freely," Martha said.

You are using hyphens.

Also just as a general note try to only explain one detail per sentence. You mention that Charlotte's room is huge (which is a pretty weak descriptor try something like cavernous) and the cozy rug.

The general rule is that if its not relevant to the story you probably don't need it or if you do don't just say it. So unless Charlotte is summoning an 8 foot demon in her room its size not relevant to add. Alternatively if you feel like you want to increase your skill, you can use details to emphasize a scene.

For example

Charlotte could feel the plush fringe of the carpet against her cheek as she dug under the bed for her doll. She remembered falling asleep with it two nights ago but hadn't seen it since.

Now this is irrelevant to the story and unnecessary, unless its used later. However, if the chapter would end with Draco pushing her onto the floor it works because at the end you can write something like.

And as she cried her fingers tangled in the shag of her rug. The purple threads poked through her fingers, making her wish it was Draco's hair instead.

As you can see we mention the rug only because we go back and use it later. There are some scenes that exist for wonder. (Like the yule ball or Halloween feast.) But it shouldn't be your whole story.
