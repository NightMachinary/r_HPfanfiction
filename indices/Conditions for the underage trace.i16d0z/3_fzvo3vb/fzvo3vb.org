The Trace is a charm that (by like of better terms) attach itself to the underage witches and wizards, and undo itself at their 17th birthday, when they become adult by Wizard standards.

According to the informations given by Dumbledore in HBP, the Trace can only detect if a spell is used in proximity of a minor, and what spell is used, but not who used a spell. Because of this, each Muggleborn get assigned a "territory" inside which he is considered responsible for any spell used (unless an adult wizard take the responsability for it, like Arthur Weasley probably did when he went to get Harry in GoF). Magically raised children are ignored by the Trace, since the Trace would also pick any spell used by their parents (and the main objective of the Trace is to maintain the Statute of Secrecy anyways).

Because of all these factors, we don't know how the Trace undo itself. Does the spell has a countdown which is set to reach 0 at the kid 17th birthday? Is the spell linked to some administrative document and undo itself at the 17th birthday? Or is there some change into a wizard's magic when he becomes an adult?The only thing we can guess with some certainty is that the spell is not linked with the "physical" age, because it would then mean that it would only take an aging potion to cheat the Trace. If anything, it probably use the same mechanism than the one used by Dumbledore for his Age Line in GoF.

As for Harry, we don't know when the Trace failed, since he spent his birthday at the Burrow (a magical household where the Trace is ignored), and in near proximity of Ginny who was still a minor and under the Trace. All what we know is that he didn't have the Trace on him anymore when he started camping with Ron and Hermione.
