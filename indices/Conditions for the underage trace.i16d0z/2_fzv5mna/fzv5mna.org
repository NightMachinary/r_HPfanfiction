I've always thought of it as a charm that was created by the ministry, and it's so difficult to undo that even Dumbledore couldn't manage it if he tried. The charm basically attaches itself onto every witch or wizard in Britain when they're born. It knows a certain date (their 17th birthday) as the date to dissipate, so it doesn't really matter what the wizard's physical age is. If the underage wizards takes a permanent aging potion or something (lol idk if that exists) they still wouldn't be able to get rid of it.
