My take on it is that the trace is a nation-wide ward that registers cases of underage magic (defined by the MoM archives, so the real or mental/soul age isn't important, what counts is the date of birth defined on the birth-certificate and the seventeen years age gap) the ministry workers have the job of finding this occurrences, cross-referencing with the know underage wizards in place and sending the letters, the trace also have a “ignoring” function set for when there is an of-age magical in the area, so as to not give false-positives when there is a tutor teaching during summer or when the child is at Hogwarts learning in class/library/wherever. The trace also must have an alert to give more importance for cases where there are muggles around.

The reason the trace can't be set to monitor someone after their seventeenth birthday is actually because it would be forced to monitor everyone who did magic over the said age, thus it would simply give too many alerts to be reasonably investigated to find out who did what spell and where, even more so as it would have to turn off the function to ignore the alert when there is an of-age magical around, thus creating even more alerts to be investigated. In the end it would just not be worthy the effort.
