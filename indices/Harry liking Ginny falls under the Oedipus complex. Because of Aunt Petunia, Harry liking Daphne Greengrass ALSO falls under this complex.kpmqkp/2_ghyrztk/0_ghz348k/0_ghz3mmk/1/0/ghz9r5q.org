You say that Lily has zero time for anyone's shit but she herself says that she has been making excuses for Snape for ages and none of her friends understand why she hangs out with him given his DE association. Sounds like she put up with a lot of shit until he finally attacked her.

I'm also not sure how she provided a break from Harry's stress, he doesn't remember her and when he does it's her horrifically screaming and begging for his life.
