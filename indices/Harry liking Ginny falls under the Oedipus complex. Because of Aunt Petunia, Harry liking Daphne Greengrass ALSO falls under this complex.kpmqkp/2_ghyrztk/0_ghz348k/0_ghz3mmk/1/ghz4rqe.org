This WAS just a joke, but Ginny and Lily do have a lot more in common in the narrative; they both have zero time for anyones shit, were brilliant in their respective subjects and both filled a wholesome, "break from the stress" role in Harry's life, etc.

But I'm not arguing Harry DOES have the complex, nor am willing to die on the hill that Ginny and Lily are similiar (mostly repeating others arguments), I'm just drawing the fun comparison between Lily/Ginny and Daphne/Petuina
