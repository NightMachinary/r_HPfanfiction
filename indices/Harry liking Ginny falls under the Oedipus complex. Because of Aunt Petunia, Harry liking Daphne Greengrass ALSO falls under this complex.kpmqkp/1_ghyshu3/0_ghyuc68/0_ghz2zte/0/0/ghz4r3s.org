A little. I was more contending the notion that Petunia was in any way Upper Class. She grew up in Cokeworth, in the 1960s and 70s. A fictionalised industrial town in the Midlands, near Spinner's End, where Snape lived. That is not Upper Class. She's far too knowingly pretentious to be so. No amount of â€˜new money' will make you upper class. She's a middle class pretender. A social climber.
