When Harry Potter walked into his kitchen, he knew something was instantly off. It wasn't his years of Auror honed skills nor was it his overworked gut telling him there was a problem. No, it was the fact that a small human who looked a great deal like himself was standing by the sink looking extremely guilty.

“Gin,” yelled Harry exasperatedly. “Al has somehow managed to de-age himself!”

The boy flinched.

“What?!” Ginny's voice shouted sounding eerily like her mother when Molly used to yell at the twins.

“What are you talking about Dad?!” exclaimed Al from upstairs.

“James, Lily are you two playing a prank?”

“No Dad” two voices answered from different parts of the house.

The wards were still up and everyone seemed alright. It was only after making certain his family was fine that Harry began to examine the boy in more detail. As he did so the rest of his family came down to see what had happened only to come to a dead stop at the sight of the young boy who seemed to shrink even more on himself with the addition of four new people. With every second of examination Harry could feel his trepidation spiking. Ragged, overly large clothing check. Bruises and scrapes check. A too thin look as if malnourished check. Broken wire frame glasses check. Messy hair that can't be tamed check. Then hair caught it, the briefest glimpse of a jagged red scar in the shape of a lightning bolt on the boy's brow.
