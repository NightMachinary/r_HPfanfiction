Double Back - Long, but incomplete and likely abandoned. A fair bit of bashing.

The Peverell Legacy - It's complete, even if it isn't marked as such. There's just, like... a never ending epilogue? I guess?

That Universe Over There - It's in-progress and getting regular updates. It's also hysterical, as expected from any fic with "accidental world domination" as a tag. Young 'Harry' is a she, named Ivy. It's ridiculously amazing.

A Brand New Start - It's complete. It also has a bunch of well-hated tropes, like prongslet, and dude calls himself Hydrus instead of Harry. Oh, and the author uses shit like "the dogman said" on the regular, which is... interesting. It's a fine read, just be prepared to roll your eyes a bit.

The Crownless King - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23382799][LINK]] - I forgot one! This is crack, written for COVID. Also: Adult Harry is insane, and that and his toilet paper hoarding skills are half the fun.
