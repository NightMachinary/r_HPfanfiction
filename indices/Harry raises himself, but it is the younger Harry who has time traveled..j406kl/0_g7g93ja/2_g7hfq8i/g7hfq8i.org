Also I really hate the idea of Harry time travelling because he wished he were loved n ends up with teenage or at the most some 20ish Marauders n Lily. Maybe that's just me because I don't like reading the Marauders era fics, but the connection that Harry needs with a family won't be there with them. Lily and James may like the kid but they wouldn't actually Love him as much despite knowing who he is.

But travelling to a huge Weasley family is something that would totally work. You bet that Molly is gonna take him under her wing as she did og Harry.
