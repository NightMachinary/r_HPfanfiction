I think it would work with "already parents" or "about to become parents" Lily and James, but there is a war going on, and their time is running out even though they may not know it (and it is not as if kid Harry has any knowledge that could truly help them). - He would be simply safer in the future than the past, and if he did not specifically wish for his parents maybe crazy magic like this may take that into account.
