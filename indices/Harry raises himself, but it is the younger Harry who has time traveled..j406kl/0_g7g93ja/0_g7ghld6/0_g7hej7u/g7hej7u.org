Adult post war Harry going head to head with Voldemort again? Yes please. Especially now that he's capable of fixing it and knows how to too.

Of course, I feel like there's no way he's going to allow an Avada kedavra to hit little Harry. It was fine when he was sacrificing himself, and even tho it IS still him, he's young and kid and he isn't even sure if that would even work now considering Voldemort now doesn't have Harry's blood.

This gets more interesting the more I think about it hahah
