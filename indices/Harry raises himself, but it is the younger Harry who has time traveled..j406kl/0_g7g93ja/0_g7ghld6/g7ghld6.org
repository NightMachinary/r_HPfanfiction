:o That last part could be great. Like if because there's a new anchor in the living world, it yanks Voldemort's main soul out of limbo and into the living world again! :) Total accident and unintentional, but now Voldemort is back AGAIN. And now adult Harry can even deal with him on a more even footing! :) After all his Auror career time and stuff.

Maybe even a plot twist on the prophecy about how it never specified WHEN Harry would be Voldemort's equal, or that neither can live part wasn't too specific either. That it meant in the future, not the seventh book.
