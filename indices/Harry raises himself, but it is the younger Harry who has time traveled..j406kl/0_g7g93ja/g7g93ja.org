Sounds great.

I think young Harry will have a big surge of accidential magic brought on by a wish to be "sonewhere he is loved". As Harry is loved by his family he makes later on his magic sends him forward in time. - Insert magic-babble explanation about how/why this somehow did not change the time line. -

You could even have some drama happening if you don't want just sweet slice of life. Young Harry is still stuck to a part of Voldemort's soul, after all.
