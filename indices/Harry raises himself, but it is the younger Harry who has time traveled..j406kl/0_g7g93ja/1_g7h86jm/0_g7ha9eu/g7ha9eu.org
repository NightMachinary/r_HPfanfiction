Somebody in the comnents/reviews will ask at some point, so even if you go with "I have no clue why, it's just happening this way" you'll probably do better to acknowledge *this* in some way within the story. - Also, Hermione would definitrly try to figure out how the hell this is possible if you keep her in-character, so you might as well give sone kind of "explanation".
