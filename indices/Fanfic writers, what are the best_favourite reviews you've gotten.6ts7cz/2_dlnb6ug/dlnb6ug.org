  Wow, some updates knocking on my door! You don't need any praise to lighten up your day do you? It's pretty hot out right now, and I do live on a hill. I don't get many solicitors these days you see. I think I have some praise around here..I'll be right back. Ahh yes, well, unfortunatly I don't have any money, you can tell the girl scout matriarch to shove it, that her cookies have no hold over me! NO HOLD YOU HEAR! O-oh, sorry about that, hehe. Those blasted girl scouts, always after me hard earned dough. They'll learn there lesson to never mess with SMITTY THE BAKER who's also Italian! So about that praise. I know you only needed 3/4 of a cup of praise, but here's a full cup. Just cus I like you. A lot. Now don't get to weird on me now. Make sure you use this praise responsibly, and stay off the drugs. If you randomly come across the Johnsons, you can tell them and there big red house, with their stupid striped corvette that their daughter and her friends from up the street are NOT welcome at my doorstep! I almost got in trouble with the police last year, can you believe it?! Why last Halloween, they had me throw candy at their preteen selves! They demanded I throw candy at them! Dressed as pixie's and slutty cats, what man could say no, I tell you, those Johnsons...(True story about the preteens though, I was just joking around, but they got really excited. They really did force my hand, and have me throw candy at them...Ahh memories, I even got to cockblock this one edgelord guy with his date, good times, good times)
