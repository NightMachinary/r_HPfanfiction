Eh, it depends. Magic is very powerful, and a lone wizard vs a lone gunman it comes down to who gets the drop on the other. Assuming they both know, the wizard would probably win in most cases assuming similar levels of skill and preparation.

However, it would never be a lone gunman vs a wizard in a war against muggles. It would be thousands of muggles to every wizard, and there are more than just guns.
