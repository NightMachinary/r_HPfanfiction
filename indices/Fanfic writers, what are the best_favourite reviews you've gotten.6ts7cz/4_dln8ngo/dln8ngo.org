If by favorite, you mean, "most insane and hilarious" I think this one wins.

  Well... A strange chapter...

  The reunion, OK... But then, thanks to Alastor, we see how it's absolutely impossible that Dumbledore don't know Prewett's real intentions, nor Harry involvement with the British army, thanks to Harry "home shield" and the fact he have a mitary weapon (obviously saw by Alastor eye)...

  And the part of Petigrew? The Weasleys see how the rat transform into a man... and they attack him without any thought!? They know NOTHING about him and they attack immediately? The man could be imperioused, brain damaged, without any memory, or ten other explications... The attack has no sense!

  The training in magic combat and "air combat" it's totally logical... Probably the quiddich players will be much better and stronger, as they train physically and fly often...

  And then, "brainwashed Harry" making gun propaganda!... Oh, dear!... No, >Harry. Guns aren't "brilliant tools". Guns, in adults hands, are murdering machines, in child's hands, are only a premature death wish.

  Obviously Harry don't know EVERY YEAR, more than a hundred children kill themselves in gun related accidents (800 adults), 20.000 children are wounded, and 75.000 persons are wounded or killed?... Why, all this deaths? EEUU, a gun armed country, has a homicide rate of 4/100.000... Any European state, with very few guns, 0.7/100.00... Harry. Guns don't protect your loves ones, guns will kill them.

  And, not, Ron. Gun will not make you safe. Aurors have guns? Not. Why? Not because they don't know, (a lot of Wizards are muggleborn), but because guns are totally useless against wizards... As simple as that...

  PLEASE, DON'T PROMOTE GUN USE BY CHILDREN. PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY...
