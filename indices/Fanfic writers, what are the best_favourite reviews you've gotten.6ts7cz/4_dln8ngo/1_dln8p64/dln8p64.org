For "helpful and nice" I have to pick this one.

  Great chapter!

  The best part is watching all of the students interact with their Dragons. You made them an interesting part of the story. They even have their own personality traits that match up to their temporary owners.

  Percy was also hilarious in this chapter. I like the way Percy can verbally spar with Fred and George without getting offended so easily. In a down to earth, working class family like the Weasleys, it's good to have someone in the family who is a bit more refined. But Percy isn't the snob JK Rowling made him to be in canon. I appreciate that about your writing. Everyone is different, but remain a close family.

  Keep up the good work!
