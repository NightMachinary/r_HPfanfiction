Here's one I got a while ago that started out good, then took a bit of a turn.

  As I read this "Its all coming back to me now" became a reality. "Potterverse" after "Just Friends" like a sequel. There was a prequel as well. Ginny's relationship with the egomaniac Healer. Did the sequel not take place in like an interview with Ginny in the apartment they share overlooking the bay --as I remember. Something like that anyway. Its amazing that I remember this much as I am long retired after 45 years in business then 7 years masquerading as an English lit. Prof. The number 80 is certainly part of my bio. Your skills as a writer are obvious right? Why else would this ancient Academic wannabe remember your stories at all? Why else when I internally cringe at stories, like yours where Ginny has a relationship with someone other then Harry.

So far, so good, and then:

  Generally you write with such skill, imagination,integrity and good taste--Why the profanity? It serves no purpose other then to demean you the writer and your characters. You are assuming that the Magical World is as profane as the muggle world has become. Why??? Isn't it just as probable that with their limited exposure to the muggle world and their almost puritan morays that they have somewhat maintained the moral high ground ? Isn't it better to assume the best when the choice if fully yours? Remember--It is your choice . This and other web sites are filled with smut and comic book quality drivel to more then satisfy the prurient interest of the intellectually challenged. You are meant to soar with eagles.

So, I'm meant to soar with the eagles, except when my characters have potty mouths.
