Bear in mind that this was posted on a chapter on my story after it had been on the site for over /seven/ months. I'm not sure why this person saw fit to bring it up, as if I hadn't noticed or even really cared. I didn't post my work to appeal to the largest portion of users on the site, or the lowest common denominator, or whatever, and I frankly don't give a rat's ass about whether the pairing I chose is popular or not.
