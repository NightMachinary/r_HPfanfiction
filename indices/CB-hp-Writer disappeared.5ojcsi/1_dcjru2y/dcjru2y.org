Some of it can be found on fictionhunt. I know for sure that HP and the Halfblood Auror ([[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7746111/1]]) is on there and i believe Rebel and The Chosen is as well.

I'm not sure about the shorter ones. I tried looking for 'What everyone missed' because i wanted to reread it but couldn't find it...
