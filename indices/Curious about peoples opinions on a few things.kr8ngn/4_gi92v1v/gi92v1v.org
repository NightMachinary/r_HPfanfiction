  What's your opinion on Snape and how he's portrayed in stories
#+end_quote

I despise Snape, but I also despise the way he's written in fics. As someone said earlier he's way too angsty in ff. His eyes are dead, yes, but that made him cold, cruel, and caustic. He's also not stupid.

  How many do you think Voldemort killed?
#+end_quote

Personally? Not that many. Had murdered? A good bit.

  Do you like stories that improve the education at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

No. I have yet to find a story that didn't make the school less whimsical and magical for the sake of muggle safety standards and education. There was even a thread on here asking what we'd improve and the suggestions were very muggle. Eck!

Neither.
