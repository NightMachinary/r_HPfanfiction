OMG thank you. As someone who /loves/ Snape, it really bothers me when he acts like a total moron. It's especially troubling in SSHG fics -- they are two of the most intelligent people in the series but somehow love makes them stupid. Petty and jealous and lashing out at those closest to him? That's on point. Stupid? Not so much.
