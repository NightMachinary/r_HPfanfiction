Snape is the most compelling character in the series, and that's why all my fics are Snapefics :)

"Kill the spare" suggests there could be a LOT of killings just because they were too close or in the way.

YES. I try to write Hogwarts this way. A place of magic and mystery (abandoned classrooms and hidden passages and forest critters and secret artifacts and on and on) and educators who are passionate about their subjects.

Wrist holster with a little magical assist so it only takes a tiny flick of the wrist to quickly draw and securely sheath that wand.

Edit: For real with the downvotes just because I like Snape... At least I didn't make you read an essay titled "Why Snape?" and got on with answering the other questions in this /opinion/ post. Don't y'all ever get sick of reading why Snape is such a piece of shit ad nauseam? Jeez.
