Hm, I dislike Snape in canon. I don't see anything inspiring about his character, anything worth admiring, and I'm always surprised why so many people seem to love him. In fics (at least those that I've read), Snape doesn't exist most of the time. He is replaced by fanon Snape - less intense, less cruel, smarter and more understanding than he was ever portrayed in the series (or just bashed if the author doesn't like him).

I don't think I ever read a fic where Snape's portrayal made me believe I'm reading about Snape and not an OC who resembles him and use his name.

How many people Voldemort killed? Do you mean personally? If so, I don't think he had killed as many as people like to believe. The wizarding world isn't big, and even in the series, we don't get lots of names of people who were killed by Voldemort himself. I'm not saying he was a saint, far from it, but I believe he let his minions do the job for him, while he took care of those he had found truly threatening, or who had "hurt" him personally.

Stories with the goal of improving Hogwarts usually fall flat. Some authors seem to think improving Hogwarst mean to bash Dumbledore and the rest of the staff. Hogwarts has many problems, but I prefer the imperfect version of the school, over the "improved" I have seen in fics.

No wand holsters :) and if I have to choose, I would go for a hip or thigh. A wand pinned by something on the wrist sounds rather uncomfortable. It's a piece of wood - it would cause more trouble and pain than it's worth. I mean, stick a ruler against your wrist and see how comfortable it is :D
