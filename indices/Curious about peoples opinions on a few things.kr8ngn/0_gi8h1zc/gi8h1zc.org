1. Snape is a petty and vindictive man and I'd honestly describe him as pathetic. I'm fine with that but not the trope where he finds out about Harry's home life and does a complete 180 which is very unlikely.

2. I'd estimate that the number of wizards in Britain to be around 1000 considering that there is around 300 kids at Hogwarts on average per year. To be honest Voldemort probably killed more muggles and death eaters then wizards since he only personally killed when they were an important figure opposing him (Rufus Scrimgeour for example). The number of kills including muggles and wizards range in the hundreds considering he had enough corpses to make an army of inferi to guard the horcrux locket.

3. I don't really understand that question

4. We already know arm holsters exist because Grindelwald had one in FBCOG (we couldn't actually see it because he wore a coat, but he summoned his wand from within his sleeve so I'm assuming he had a holster of some sort). I'd say arm holsters are more effective because you'd be able to draw your wand much quicker then having to physically reach to your hip and retrieve your wand, plus I doubt you'd drop it after enough practice.
