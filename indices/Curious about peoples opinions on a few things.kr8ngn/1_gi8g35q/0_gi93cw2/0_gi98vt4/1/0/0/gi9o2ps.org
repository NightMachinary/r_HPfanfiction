No worries. Not badly stated at all. This is the most interesting conversation I've had in a long time with someone who doesn't like Snape. So thanks for that. The complex ambiguity is what /makes it fun!/

And we seem to be on the same page with how the Occlumency lessons were a disaster in every way. Whether or not Snape took any pleasure in being awful to Harry, they should not have been forced together for those lessons in the first place.

I'm with you on the Marauders too. Every character had their flaws. That's what makes them so interesting! The utter toxicity of Sirius with Severus is why I've dabbled in shipping that pair. Even the often-wholesome Lupin/Tonks... I see shipping Lupin and Tonks being /very/ similar to shipping Snape and Hermione, and I've got them double-dating in one my fics lol.

I have to wonder if you'd like the versions of Snape I write, which are generally canon-compliant but often EWE because I like the idea that he survives and mellows out. I cannot link my most compelling fics due to breaking the rules of reddit and this sub... Since you like monstrous Riddle you might like the tragic dark angsty Snape in my one-shot /My Whole Existence is Flawed./ There's also a fluffier post-war Healer Snape in my 5-chappy /Fridays I'm In Love/ ... My [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][AO3 profile]] has everything I've published including these. I will absolutely /not/ be offended if that's a /hard no/ but I figured it doesn't hurt to throw it out there :)
