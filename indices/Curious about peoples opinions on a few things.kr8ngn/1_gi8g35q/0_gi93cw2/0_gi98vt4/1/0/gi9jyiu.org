Eh, that's fair ! My first post was posted pretty fast to begin with, just for the pleasure of giving my opinion haha. And while my second was more reread since someone took the time to respond, it's late here and my English isn't the best. So, I know that when I say he bullied a whole generation, for example, it wasn't the literal whole. He probably also gave the silent treatment to most students, if they weren't standing out like Hermione or poor Neville, say, and some went unscathed.

(And it's funny that we have such different experience of fanon character because I read him more often being such a weird snob having tea time with Narcissa than being angsty).

I do agree that the whole Occlumency thing was a whole mess, from start to finish. But I still feel like he was being needlessly cruel and unhelpful the whole time. And maybe he didn't take pleasure in it as much as I think---after all, he made clear that having to be in Harry's presence was the bane of his existence haha. But he's also an adult. An adult that knows exactly what Harry is going through. So, his ressemblance to his own father shouldn't be into question, you know?

(And it's true that it was another level of stupid to put the spy on this task if Voldemort could see that much? I always knew it was stupid to put them together to learn something where obviously trust would be needed while they equally disliked each other. But that part is just as mind blowing. Dumbledore's plans are... something else).

And even if we find a way to excuse his whole treatment of Harry from the moment he felt like a newborn and his father could be killed to his very last breath, it's not like he's only awful to him. We see it more in detail with him, but he's still a thoroughly toxic person that shouldn't have been left into his position at Hogwarts.

But again! It's fiction! My reading is just mine and isn't gospel. I change opinions on a lot of things (though I still haven't about Snape haha). And I don't condemned or judge anyone who likes his character. (I mean I personally love to read about Riddle in all his monstrous glory.)

I feel like it also plays out on what we all imagine is going on behind the scenes. And since we obviously all imagine different things and lives for the characters, we will obviously disagree in our understanding of them. (And nothing bad in it, diversity is good and all that).

And I don't disagree about some of these fics, either. Writers in this fandom are some of the best. They truly are champions when it comes to save characters from the canon narrative shortcomings. From Draco going on a truly redemptive path to Remus and Tonk being just better characters altogether, fandom is GREAT. And I'm sincerely happy you all have these great fics where Snape gets the glory he doesn't have (and gets botched) in canon. I'll find fics where Snape is a saintly saint taking care of every abused child under the nose of the mean heartless headmaster more infuriating than any sincere attempt at showing him as a Byronic hero (or whatever type of hero you want to show him as). In the end, as much as I've written off Canon Snape, i still try to stay open minded about his fanon versions (with obvious exceptions).

And, yeah, I'm sorry because it feels like I'm rambling stupidly and I'm not even sure anything I'm trying to say can even come across (let alone intelligibly). But I really, really, hope that I didn't come across as judging your liking for such or such character or anything. Or that it wasn't possible to read him this or that way. Because I consider your version of Snape as legitimate as mine, for example. And I'm also biased, obviously, since I don't like him. But, truly, I'm only ever mad when it's trying to show him as such a nice goody two shoes. Just like I get mad when Remus is shown as an angel when, for me, he's nothing at all like that. Or, even Sirius, who I love!, but becomes truly infuriating when he's this womaniser who only jokes and is never cruel in words or actions. So, yeah. I hope my comments, as messy as they were, didn't come off in any way that could spoil your fun or anything. It's just a personal opinion, badly stated at that, and I'm truly not looking out to spoil anyone's fun.
