I love Snape to bits, yet I agree that he's likely just as guilty as any other Death Eater from the time before he turned spy. I see his canon redemption as plausible but unsatisfying, and that's why I turn to fanfic to fill the gap.

However, I'm a little concerned about your insistence that Snape takes pleasure in bullying/torturing Harry. We see the entire series from Harry's point of view and do not know what he was feeling most of the time. Especially this moment here:

#+begin_quote
  spent the Occlumency Lessons taking pleasure in torturing Harry even more
#+end_quote

At that point Harry is still grieving for Sirius, upset at the tyranny of Umbridge, frustrated by the Ministry's denials, and generally acting even more angsty than fanon!Snape. Since Voldemort is likely to cross-check whatever he sees directly from Harry with whatever Snape reports, I find it shocking that Snape was tapped by Dumbledore to give these lessons at all, and I'm amazed Snape was able to keep his cool for as long as he did with Harry being a nosy hothead who looks just like one of the people who made Snape's past miserable.

So if you want to take a more objective view of Snape, a good first step is to stop assuming he /enjoyed/ his role as the petty git. He was under intense pressure to keep Harry safe while keeping his cover, and I rather suspect he was having a boatload of traumatic flashbacks with the uncanny resemblance to James Potter. For an Occlumens who can go up against Voldemort, that better explains why he would remove the memories he chose to remove during those lessons.

Which just makes me admire him more, to have that kind of self-awareness. A git, maybe, but a brilliant git ;)
