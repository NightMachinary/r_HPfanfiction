He sticks to the plan after Dumbledore dies though. Like a lot of your points are ignoring that he legit comes around to the side of good. I don't see how you can be sympathetic to Draco and Narcissa but not to Snape, though I def agree Regulus and Slughorn don't get enough credit.

And yeah, Snape isn't AS good as the others who stuck around, but that's kind of irrelevant, and the vast majority of people didn't actually fight anyway.
