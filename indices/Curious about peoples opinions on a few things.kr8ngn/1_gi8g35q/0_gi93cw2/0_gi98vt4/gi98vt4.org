No? That's no excuse, in my eyes, at least.

If he didn't become a spy, Dumbledore wouldn't have cared for him and he will have become a fellow prisoner of Azkaban. That's a pretty big benefit to/for himself. If there wasn't the threat of Azkaban, I'm not sure he would have stuck with Dumbledore (but, to be fair, he will have sought out to avenge Lily's death in some way---so, perhaps it would have been more “productive” in the end).

I also have a very different view of his relevance as a spy as is most common on this sub. I don't see how he's supposedly in extreme danger from then on. On the contrary, he's living a rather pampered life in Hogwarts, knowing that he has Dumbledore's protection. He's a guilty man who gets handed more chances than even innocent ones (Sirius rotting in Azkaban for a decade, Harry living through hell from the moment he's dropped in Petunia's street...).

And I know that people like to imagine him as a very successful spy during the second war, but we're really not shown that at all. He's not very useful to the Order, he even worsen the morale at a crucial point. And I feel that if he truly wanted to help, he wouldn't have spent the Occlumency Lessons taking pleasure in torturing Harry even more, and would have taken the time needed to actually teach (but then again, that man wasn't made to be a teacher). Who knows how that year would have ended if Harry had tools to actually fight back against Voldemort.

And I don't think that if at the last minute Bellatrix decided to be a spy to get spared Azkaban/to bargain someone else life, without knowing that Voldemort would ever come back, she'd be awarded the same leniency. Especially if she then spent decades bullying children for the hell of it.

Hell, even Regulus who saw his error and died trying to stop Voldemort isn't shown the same mercy.

So, sure, very tragic. He died, too, in the end. He will have died in Azkaban or by his master's hand anyway. His contribution is meagre at most, and his legacy is his fucking over a whole generation of children.

I mean, I have less difficulty having more regards for Narcissa lying to Voldemort's face (selfishly), or Draco in the end, than I have for Snape, who freely and consciously made all his terrible choices. Even Slughorn comes of as more heroic, less despicable as he is and he's the perfect incarnation of Slytherin.

(Also, it's war, they all risk their life. It doesn't somehow excuse his awfulness in times of peace. The literal children he bullied took stand against adult wizards and fought for what they thought was right and it wasn't done for anything else than believing in a cause. They could all have fled, dropped out of school, go to any other school. But they stayed. They fought. They fought wizards with so much more power and knowledge and experience they could never dream of gaining. They lost lives. They saved lives. They're heroes. They're the reason the “light” side ever won. Compared to that, well, Snape doesn't stand the comparison. At best, he decided to risk his life to avenge himself and Lily, if we want to be generous. But he's never the bad guy who saw that the dark side was bad and decided that the light one was good. He saw the dark lord take something he wanted and decided to try his luck with the other powerful guy to get his personal revenge. He is never shown having changed ways.)

But it's also only my opinion. Which isn't worth much or more than anyone's else. And if anyone wants to read him as a hero he isn't, fair enough. I've complained about the fics where he serves as the magical Child Services (and you probably agree that it's as far as his canon self as can be, I assume) and I still read fics where he plays out this role. Sure, it doesn't please me the most, but if it's how some people want to show him, I'll just pretend it's an OC and carry on and I'll leave kudos and comments and all such.

I feel like these points can be debated as nauseam, but if you've read canon one way, you won't be swayed to reading it to the contrary (and I'm saying that for me, too, because I know that after all the fics I've read where Snape is a pseudo saint---like, whatever the contrary to bashing is---I've still not changed opinions on canon Snape, so, shrugs). These debates are a lost cause (and, to be fair, some of the poster here have a much better handle on the English language and a better knowledge of canon and fandom than I do and would be much more interesting to discuss this with than with me haha).
