Oh, I so love to give my opinion of things.

I truly, sincerely, despise Snape in canon. I don't feel/read him as a redemptive hero. He's as bad as Bellatrix or any other Death Eaters. And instead of getting out of the repercussion of his illegal, murderous activities through money and lies like Malfoy, he got out thanks to Dumbledore's convoluted plans. Just like Karkaroff, he doesn't have the backbone of Bellatrix or Crouch Jr. either, and thus hides from repercussions by acting as if he didn't do anything and a lot seem to just go with it. Beyond everything (and I believe before even becoming a DE), he's a truly bad person. He's just awful. And I don't care what convoluted explanations of spy work people can work out: he is a man who take joys in bullying children to the point of becoming their greatest fear. He isn't a hero. No one forced him into becoming a DE or into taking pleasure in bullying every child who stepped in his classroom. (And, no, there is no way he is a good teacher, let alone the greatest). So I just don't get how he's constantly whitewashed in FF, just because he loved Lily. Big deal, really. Lot of people probably loved her at some points (Harry probably would have adored her if Snape didn't relay the prophecy and play into her death). I hate how he's shown as this great man who checks out every kid for abuse when in canon he's literally their abuser. I mean, most of the time he's even shown as being a better man than Dumbledore (and I don't like Dumbledore. He literally raised Harry for slaughter, but he's still leagues above Snape in the morality playground). It is never shown that he ever regretted being a DE. This is the man who only asked for Lily to be spared and was OK for her husband and newborn child to die. He isn't the one and only DE who somehow didn't partake in all the criminal, murderous activities of their gang. He isn't innocent at all. And, no, his age doesn't spare him of the consequences. Especially when he uses his second chance to be as awful as he can to innocent children. There is no Snape redemption, there is no evolution. He's still a petty, nasty, awful man stuck into the mentality of a teenage bully.

I don't feel like his canon persona even works out. It's always him acting in shadows as the magical Child Services, constantly going against Dumbledore, of all people. When he never ever cared about anyone but himself.

I feel like Voldemort must have killed a lot of people. As TMR, he spent a summer just killing his whole family in cold blood while framing it on his victim. He totally moved on from Myrtle's death even with her ghost literally haunting the school (and I do believe that it was somehow accidental, but, really, I've accidentally killed bugs and felt guilty for weeks afterward, I wouldn't cope if ghosts were involved). So, yeah, he's got a happy trigger (I think that the phrase?). And the whole splitting his soul thing must have accentuated this trait. That and his dramatics, his madness and the fact that the DEs and their own murderous tendencies probably egged him on even more. (And that would explain why people were so terrified decades later and why whole families disappeared). (See, that's also why I believe Snape got as much blood on his hands as any other DEs. He's truly nothing special that would explain how he got to be in, but somehow not partake in the murders?)

I truly love the different looks on magical education. It's probably what I love the most about the stories staged in different schools. Or why I love time travel stories, too. The look through the ages, through different headmasters working through thoroughly different societies in such a short time period : so interesting. And while I feel like Dumbledore wasn't the best headmaster (and that McGonagall was very far from perfection), I also feel that, beyond Harry and his adventures, it all comes down to the repercussion of war on their society. So, yeah, bashing isn't truly interesting on this point. I'd rather people show us the details of clubs, chorals, any after school activities than lose time trying to dismiss any headmaster.

I always felt like holsters were natural on the arm (after being introduced to the very idea of holsters to begin with). But this week I've read through a fic from which I only remember Harry's holster being on his thigh. Holsters were sold to fit different body parts, depending on preferences. But Harry being clumsy and always running through life defying adventures, felt like thigh was better and more innocuous than wrist. A very curious thing.
