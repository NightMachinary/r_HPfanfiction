This is my personal favourite written by Abrus: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11113127/1/What-Every-Teenager-Should-Know-About-Drugs]]

It is a Snily so you either love it or you don't, but the writing style is entirely unique and it's still one of the very few fics that I've read more than once because of how unique it is.
