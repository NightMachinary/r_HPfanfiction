Linkffn(1399984) This one is the first fic that made me cry, it's really sad but it has a lot of layers.

Linkao3(285498) It's a series with a lot of good works, they're kind of sad but if I have to chose a feeling is more melancholy than anything else. The best ones for me is "the kids who chose themselves", "no place like home" and "the heir of something or other"

Linkao3(14016627) "Paranoia and puns" is really good, one of my favorites short works. This one is more happy and just makes me feel good. How they portray Cedric is so good and sweet, it just makes you smile
