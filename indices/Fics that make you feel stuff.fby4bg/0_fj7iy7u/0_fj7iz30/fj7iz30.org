  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.
