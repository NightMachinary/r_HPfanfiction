This left me in an emotional mess. If you are iffy about the first few chapters, I'd keep reading because everything is not what it seems. The warnings listed are accurate though. The way the plot is constructed is mind blowing and it's a real emotional roller coaster. The ending was poignant and was on my mind days after reading it.
