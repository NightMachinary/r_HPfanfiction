A small minority of abnormal individuals exist in society with powers that are beyond that of ordinary humans. Some are aware of these individuals, many are not. Many are ostracized by the majority, often from fear. As young adults, with their gifts manifesting, they learn that not only are these kids fundamentally different than the rest of the world...they are /better,/ and thats why they were tormented by everyone else (in other words, every teenager's dream).

These teens and young adults are often collected and educated at a special school for 'gifted students' with a wise and powerful professor. But others disagree with the status quo, thinking those who cast them out deserve not tolerance but to kneel, to be destroyed even, before these gifted individuals. They are often lead by one singularly powerful individual with a strong connection to the professor and school he manages, an individual with a painful past and a charismatic presence.

If you haven't guessed, it's the X-Men. A bit on the nose really, but this always stuck out to me as the sort of story Rowling was going for.
