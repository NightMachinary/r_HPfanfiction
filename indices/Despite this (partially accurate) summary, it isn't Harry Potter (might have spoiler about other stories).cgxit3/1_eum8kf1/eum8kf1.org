A boy who never knew his father gets rescued from his squalid living conditions by his future mentor, who tells him that he has supernatural powers.

He spends the better part of the following decade being trained in the use of his powers, but he grows up to be a rebellious young man, showing curiosity in the forbidden side of his powers. Ultimately he turns against his mentor and chooses evil, losing most of his humanity in the process and transforming beyond recognition.

Years later he manages to triumph over his former mentor, but his days are already numbered since there is a new Chosen One about to end his reign of terror...

No, this isn't Voldemort's backstory, but Darth Vader's.
