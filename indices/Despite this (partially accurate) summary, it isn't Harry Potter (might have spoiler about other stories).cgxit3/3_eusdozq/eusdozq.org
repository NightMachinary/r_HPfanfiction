The hero of this book series is a magical child who learns magic in a school that is a castle. They become close friends with two other kids there, and get into a rivalry with a snobby rich kid. The snobby rich kid is favoured by the hero's least liked teacher, who is strict, scary, and always wears black. Said horrible teacher is not /actually/ evil, though.

People in the magical world fly on brooms and use their flying skills not only to get from A to B, but also for fun and challenging activities. So, brooms can be pretty important. At one point the hero's broom gets broken, and at another point in time a broom they are using for one of those "fun and challenging activities" mentioned above starts playing up, trying to throw the hero off, because it was jinxed.

There are several books dealing with different adventures the hero has while growing up and advancing their education.
