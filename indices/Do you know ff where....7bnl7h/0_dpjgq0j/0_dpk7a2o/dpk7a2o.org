Something about that fic just rubs me the wrong way.

I think it's just that Harry, after dealing with the war, gets transferred to a new dimension where his parents are still alive - great. He can be with them and be happy and whatnot.

Why does he have to deal with previous-Harry being a spoiled ass, and making up for it to everyone?
