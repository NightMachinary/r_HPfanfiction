Ron and his family don't hate the Slytherins at all. In the books it was Hagrid who said all dark wizards are Slytherins not Ron.

Ron does dislike Malfoy for obvious reasons and he would probably not trust a random Slytherin immediately, but Ron hating Slytherin is pure fanon. In the books Harry is shown more biased against them than Ron.

Edit: There is one line i recall where Ron speaks of being sorted into Slytherin the same way Draco spoke of being sorted into Huffelpuff at the clothing store. Another line in the second book, after he finds out that Salazar Slytherin started the pureblood supremacy thing. Thats mostly it i think.

  "What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." "That's the house Vol---, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?" "Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

  “I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home. . . .”

edit2: There is not a single mention of "Slimy Slytherin" in canon.

There is one mention of Stinking Slytherin and thats something Harry says.
