  “You're worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”

The stinking part is about Slytherin. Having gone thru all mentions of Slytherin, i must say that Slytherins are totally arseholes to him tho, so Harry kind of has a point.

Funnily enough Harry doesen't think Slytherins are out to get him because they are evil. In GoF he mentions that Slytherins are arseholes to him because he keeps beating them in quidditch :P. Still he still disses Slyths more than Ron does, but that just shows that Ron hating Slytherins is pure fanon.
