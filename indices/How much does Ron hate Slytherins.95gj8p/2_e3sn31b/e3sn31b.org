Not much. Its important to point out that when this trope comes up, its usually when the author has an axe to grind so they make Ron look horrible/bash him. Same thing with Hermione being a stuck-up know-it-all.

The thing is, these plot devices are usually written from what I've seen as a way of occupying space in an otherwise vacuous plot till X point where the main conflict occurs. Again, same for manipulative!Dumbledore. None of these things are accurate, but they can be turned to suit an author's particular biases or story idea quite easily

To paraphrase someone else, our contempt for others only demonstrates how narrow our own views are.
