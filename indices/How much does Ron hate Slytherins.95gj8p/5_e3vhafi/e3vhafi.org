In general, Ron has no belief in Slytherin - he does not believe cooperation is possible in Order of the Phoenix. This is, of course, after four years of Slytherins constantly picking on him and his friends while spouting racist remarks.

I don't think Ron would have said one word to a Slytherin if Malfoy would have left them the hell alone (except for the Chamber Polyjuice thing).
