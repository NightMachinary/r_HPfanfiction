Ron's pretty much indifferent to all of them besides Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who he goes out of his way to avoid. There was a part in the Half Blood Prince when they're walking by the room of requirements and the little Slytherin girl (either Crabbe or Goyle under the influence of polyjuice potion) drops and breaks her scales, which Hermione fixes and Ron makes no comment about besides, "I swear they're getting smaller."

I think a big reason for the fanon belief of Ron hating Slytherins is because he hates all of the Slytherins he has to interact with. Aside from the aforementioned, there's Pansy and Millicent, who bully Hermione; Snape, who bullies non-Slytherin children; Voldemort, who is Voldemort; Bellatrix; and so on. Has Ron ever met Andromeda? If not, I don't think he's ever had a positive interaction with a Slytherin.
