Asians as a whole don't look all alike (you can probably differentiate between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean genotypes to some degree), however, it seems to me that within those groups, there is much less diversity than within comparable white nations (say France, England, Germany). Largely only one hair color, one skin tone, one eye color, and more uniform facial features make it more difficult to distinguish between them. Also, there's the high degree of collectivism and historic low development which has usually meant uniform hair and dress styles, making it even more difficult...

Eh, not sure where I was going with this, take it as it is I guess, lol
