I went to uni with a couple of Korean guys who everyone said looked exactly a like (they also both had the same very common Korean surname). They would always tell people they were racist for saying they looked alike and claim they looked nothing alike...which was fine...except they were identical twins who just liked to mess with people. Maybe you should have Asian Weasleys as well because Fred and George would so do this.
