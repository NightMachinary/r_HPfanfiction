TBH, in the UK (so, where most of these fics are set...) we don't tend to talk about "bequests" or "bequeathing." It might be said once in the will - as in "I Sirius Orion Black leave the following bequests to Harry James Potter/bequeath the following to Harry James Potter."

But Harry wouldn't then talk about his "bequests" or what he was "bequeathed." If you're speaking colloquially about getting something in a will, you'd say it was "left to me" or "I inherited it." So it really gets on my tits when Harry is saying to Hermione or Ron or whoever "Sirius bequeathed (or bequested, if the person writing is particularly irritating) me Grimauld Place." No, he'd say "Sirius left me Grimauld Place" or "I inherited Grimauld Place from Sirius."

People don't tend to talk in legalese in their private lives, and those who do sound like gits.
