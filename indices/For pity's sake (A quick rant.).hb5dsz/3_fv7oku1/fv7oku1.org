Even with the proper verbiage that's an awkward sentence. A tip to all beginning writers, read what you write out loud. It might make sense in your head but if you stumble when you say it others will likely stumble when they read it. Your English professor probably didn't care if you sounded strange in an attempt to reach the word limit for an assignment as long as the basic point was sound. That doesn't work as well with storytelling.
