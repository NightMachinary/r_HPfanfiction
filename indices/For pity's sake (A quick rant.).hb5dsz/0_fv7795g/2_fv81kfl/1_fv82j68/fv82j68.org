Or, like, their tails?

I'd say if parselscript exists, then it was a human invention by Parselmouths in the past. And if so, then it either isn't part of the gift or a weaker part of the gift, as snakes don't write.

A Parselmouth might be able to learn it quicker, but I don't like it when it's an equal part of the language. Additionally, I like it when Parseltongue has words that don't have a true meaning in human languages, which humans can't really understand because of the species difference, but parselmouths can, that makes the "parselscript as encodings" more plausible, as any learned parselreader wouldn't be able to get the true nuance of the thing they are reading. Additionally, that would add an element of "first language" to parselmouths (the notion that every parselmouth's first language is parseltongue, to the point that they think in it), which I like.
