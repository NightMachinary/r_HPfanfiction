Don't forget to explain why the language of /snakes/ would have a script, and what it would likely look like. I rarely see these points addressed.

Since they have no hands, snakes must write in parseltongue using eitter their fangs, and you'll have the symbols look like a bunch of points, or their tongue, and the script would look simillar to cuneiform, I guess. That's just me having fun, anyway.
