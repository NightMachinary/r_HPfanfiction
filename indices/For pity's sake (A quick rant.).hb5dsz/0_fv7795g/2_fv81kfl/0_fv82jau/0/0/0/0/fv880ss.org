Well, he was alive at the back end of the tenth century, from a part of the world then under the rule of what by then had become the Caliphate of Cordoba since the mid 8th century. He was from a high enough status family to actually have a surname - surnames were far from universal back then, even in the lands where they were a thing - and the opposition of religion to magic was even less universal back then than it would be at the height of the witch-panics of the 15th-17th centuries. It's by no means certain that he was a muslim, but it /would/ give a convincing back-story to a name like "Slytherin" /and/ an origin story for the values of Slytherin house. It's quite easy for the 'greater jihad' - ie self-improvement, to put it in modern, non-theological terms - to be read by later, non-muslim minds as 'ambition' and a chap from a minority people wracked by conventional and guerilla warfare with the caliphate going one way and the Franks coming the other would certainly value guile over brute power.
