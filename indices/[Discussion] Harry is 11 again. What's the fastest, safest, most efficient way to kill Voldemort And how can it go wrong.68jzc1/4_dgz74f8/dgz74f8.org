Hmm...you know, the thing is, outside of Indy!Harry plots that rely on the assumptions that a) Dumbledore is some big chessmaster who would wipe Harry's mind given reason to or b) the Unspeakables department of the MoM would try to kidnap Harry if they knew he was from the future or such, there's actually pretty much no reason at all /not/ to seek help from him.

Here's a thought; instead of just Dumbledore, what about other adults Harry trusts? Like say, the Weasley parents, or Hagrid?

Granted, if 'boarding the Hogwarts Express for the first time' is where Harry goes back to, that removes his first opportunity to tell Hagrid, and makes Dumbledore (or McGonagall) the first someone he can reasonably tell. There's definitely plenty of proof in the form of Things Harry Shouldn't Know Yet that he can use, like knowing about the Order of the Phoenix, Voldemort's true identity, the Horcruxes...

Anyway, things that can go wrong...you've already listed a few significant ones, like the horcruxes being moved, death eaters acting differently, etc...but another thing might be Harry's own well-being; how would he reconnect with a native-timeline Ron and Hermione when all of the shared experiences they had are gone and the most recent strong influences on Harry's life and personality are totally different from theirs? What about bonding with other students? What about the Dursleys?

That's a thought, 17 year-old Harry stopped considering #4 Privet Drive his home; after all, the Dursleys fled it and he had places to be in the magical world. What happens when that mentality enters his 11-year old body? That could be another complication.
