I have a corollary question: assuming you're Harry working out this plan and can control the parameters at all, at what point would you /want/ to be put into your younger body?

Before the letters even start showing up?

After getting a wand?

Right after the Sorting?

After getting the Cloak and seeing the Mirror of Erised?
