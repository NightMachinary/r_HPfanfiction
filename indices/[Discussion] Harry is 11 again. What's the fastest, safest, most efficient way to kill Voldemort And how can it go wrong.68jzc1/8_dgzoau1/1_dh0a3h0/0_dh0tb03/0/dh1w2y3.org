"Legal means" is the problem, is it? Canon Dumbledore isn't very fond of breaking the laws, except for the direst of situations like when he was about to be captured. If he could, he would have screwed Lucius and the "Imperiused victims" over and over in canon. Maybe he could, but his moral didn't let him do so.

But of course, it's the author's AU, he can make Dumbledore behave anyway he wants.
