You have some valid points but I disagree with the first one. The one with Lucius is kinda tricky.

Dumbledore can't prove, nor tell anyone (he doesn't want to anyway) that Lucius has the diary as well as what the diary actually is. Besides, he either doesn't have enough power, or is unwilling to discredit Lucius publicity. If Dumbledore could do that, Fudge would be much less of a pain in canon.

Lucius knows that Dumbledore can't prove the existence of the diary in the first place, so no sweat of him. Even if he was shaken and decided to get rid of the diary, there was no reason to think he would give it to Dumbledore. Most likely Lucius would find a way to dump it on one of his enemies again, which may make finding the diary become the hardest of them all, since Ginny was only ten at the time, no Hogwarts for her.

If Harry and Dumbledore were lucky, Lucius would plan the diary on Ron. Or he could just go to another enemy of his. Given who Lucius is, I'm sure he has a lot of those. At that time Lucius only knew that it was a dark artifact, not the fact that it had something to do with the CoS, so there was no restriction on which enemy he had to give it to.
