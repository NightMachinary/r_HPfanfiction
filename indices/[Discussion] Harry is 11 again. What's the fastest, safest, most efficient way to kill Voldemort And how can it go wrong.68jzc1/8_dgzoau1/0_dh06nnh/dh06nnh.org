  You destroy all of the above by tossing them through the veil in the Department of Mysteries.

Complication: the Veil doesn't destroy anything. It moves the items into a far-off realm. Now you cannot kill Voldemort.

  The locket. This is the hardest one. Harry has no idea exactly where the cave is.

The locket was in Kreacher's care by 1 November 1981, so that should be one of the easy ones. It only spend a few days in the cave.
