- The diary. Dumbledore just tells Lucius that he knows he has it and that he better give it up if he wants to maintain his good reputation. Lucius agrees. No sweat.
- The diadem. Dumbledore goes to the Room of Lost Things and searches until he finds it.
- The ring. Dumbledore goes to the shack and searches until he finds it.
- The cup. This one is a little more difficult. I think that Dumbledore is probably capable of breaking into Gringotts, though.
- The locket. This is the hardest one. Harry has no idea exactly where the cave is. It will probably take months of research at the very least to figure out just where to go. While there, I still think Dumbledore insists on he himself drinking the potion. Hopefully there are no lasting effects.

You destroy all of the above by tossing them through the veil in the Department of Mysteries.

Complications:

- Quirrel. I think Dumbledore would want to give him a second chance, but at what point do you tip off Back-of-the-Head-Voldy that you are onto him?
- Ron and Hermione. Harry will have to assume he's stuck in this timeline, so he's going to want to make sure his friendship with Ron & Hermione develops, but that will be hard. There will be fewer opportunities for adventure, and the troll-in-the-bathroom incident likely won't happen again.
- Ginny. At what point is she old enough that Harry can make a move on her without feeling creepy?
- Harry's scar. Is there a way to extract the bit of Voldy's soul without Harry having to die? If not, then do you let Voldy resurrect himself using Harry's blood?
- Does Dumbledore give Harry house points for sharing everything he knows? If not, does that mean Slytherin's winning streak continues?
- Pettigrew. I assume you transform him back into a human and make him stand trial. Sirius Black is free and is legally Harry's guardian. This means the Protection he had at the Dursleys' will break. So if Voldy does regain strength, Harry is a lot more vulnerable.
- Snape. Is Harry cool with his boy Sev, or does he maintain his distance so Snape can still be used as a spy if need be?
