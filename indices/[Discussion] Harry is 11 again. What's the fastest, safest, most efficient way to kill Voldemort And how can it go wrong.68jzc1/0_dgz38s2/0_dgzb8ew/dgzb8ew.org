Probably the best choice yeah... but then you'll immediately have to shift PoV because the story clearly can't be about Harry anymore. He's a child (or at least in the body of a child)... there's really nothing he has to do anymore, except maybe get shot by a killing curse or touch Quirrel at some point.
