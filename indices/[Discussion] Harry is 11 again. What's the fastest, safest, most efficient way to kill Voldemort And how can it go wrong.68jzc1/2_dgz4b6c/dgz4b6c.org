I'm one hundred percent sure that Dumbledore would believe that he was from the future as soon as he told him. He wouldn't even need to provide any evidence, I just see Dumbledore accepting it the minute he said it.

After that, Harry would tell Dumbledore where all the Horcruxes are, and they and the Order would quickly gather and destroy them. The Diary might be a problem, but if Dumbledore was to tell fudge that there was a dark object inside Lucius Malfoy's house, then he'd probably send some aurors there. Fudge was an incredibly weak willed person, and as long as Dumbledore didn't mention that Voldemort was involved, he'd probably follow along. The diadem wouldn't really be a problem as long as they gathered all the horcruxes first then destroyed them.
