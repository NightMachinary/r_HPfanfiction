As I see it, the player wouldn't have that many choices --- especially if they start already boarding the train.

*Option A:* Go to Hogwarts, decide to trust Dumbledore: The risk here is that you don't know what's Dumbledore's true personality like, and how he'll react to having a time traveller on his hands. If you /do/ decide to entrust in him though, I believe swift plan of actions should be choosen. So:

- find a professor on the train (or a prefect if there are none) and ask them to contact Dumbledore and tell them that Harry Potter urgently needs to meet and speak with him before the Sorting ceremony starts;
- upon meeting him ask him to read your mind and to use Veritaserum on you if necessary. Present him the rest of the plan, and proceed with it if he's ok with it (or change it however Dumbledore wishes, since you're almost completely under his control now);

  - warn the sorting hat to not do anything stupid and to act as it was in canon;
  - once the ceremony is over, quietly move Ron into Headmaster's office and confiscate the rat;
  - (once Quirrelmort is inside the castle premises and can not Apparate away) contact a group of qualified Aurors and ambush him. Kill him, or capture him, if VD can't escape as a spirit until the host is dead. Or design some spirit-capturing trap before engaging him. Maybe also arrange for him to first cast a single AK at Harry, depending on Dumbledore's opinion on this matter;
  - get the Diadem and maybe also the ring;
  - organise an emergency meeting with Fudge (and maybe an unspeakable), show him the horcruxes, make him greenlight an ambush on Malfoy Manor;
  - open the hidden room that stored all the dark artefacts. If it's not there, use Veritaserum on Lucious, get the diary;
  - tell the Minister about the Sirius \ Pettigrew issue, show him the rat, make him exonerate Black;
  - depending on how the inheritance process works between old houses and with the goblins, either temporarily free Bellatrix to use her to withdraw the cup or just kill her and wait until the control over the vault passes to Sirius;
  - Once Sirius is free also procure the locket and the ring (if not already taken by now);
  - destroy all the horcruxes, put Lucious and the two Bartemius Crouches in Azkaban, +give Umbridge to centaurs as a gift,+ etc, the end.

*Option B:* Go to Hogwarts, decide to not trust Dumbledore:

Prerequisites:

- you'll have to somehow either destroy the Sorting Hat, evade getting sorted by it, or manage to deceive it --- maybe Imperio some other first-year while you're yet on the train so they'll somehow destroy the Hat? Not very likely.
- you'll have to somehow both protect yourself from all the mind-readers and also do that in a manner that will not be suspicious to them. Not very likely.
- you'll have to convicingly act like a first-year student 24/7 for 9 months (not very likely).
- you'll have to make the events play out very close to canon at least until you get your hands on the diary (not very likely).

*Option C:* Escape from the train\Hogwarts:

- this plan fails if Dumbledore and the whole magical community have no means of detecting where Harry Potter is (not very likely).

*Option D:* Escape from the train, quickly contact France or some other country, defect to France. Then correspond with Dumbledore and Co. while staying out of their reach and all the crazy assassination plots.
