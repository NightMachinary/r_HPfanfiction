In Option B, you disregard the very real possibility that the Hat is bound not to reveal the secrets it learns. I see it popping quite often in time-travel fics, and it's very reasonable. The usual reasoning behind it is that the "Dark" families like the Malfoys would not send their children at Hogwarts to have their oh-so-incriminating minds read if the Hat could just tattle to the headmaster, so a sacrifice was made by the Founders for the sake of the new generation getting a good education. In this case, the worst-case scenario would be the Hat deciding that your time-travel plan is worthy of Slytherin, and thus Sorting you differently than it did the first time around.

By the way, this might sound naive, but you also fail to consider the possibility that the Sorting Hat might simply be benevolent and shut up if you convince him it's for the best.
