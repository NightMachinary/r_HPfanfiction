  possibility that the Hat is bound not to reveal the secrets it learns. I see it popping quite often in time-travel fics, and it's very reasonable.

  possibility that the Sorting Hat might simply be benevolent and shut up if you convince him it's for the best.

I disregard these because I can't be sure that they are more than just a possibility, and so can't allow for my plans to be relying on them.

The difference is between a plan that you're writing for your story's character (where you can hand-wave away inconvenient obstacles, like the Hat's mindreading, for the sake of advancing the plot in your designed direction) and a plan that you see yourself developing if you yourself were that character --- without any [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist][Doylist]] means of influencing your environment.

Another interesting thing is that the universe would likely react more benevolently to a more trusting and straight-forward character and react more severely against a distrusting one. Imagine, for instance, Dumbledore's reaction to only finding out that someone was from another universe and the same Dumbledore's reaction to also reading in this SI's mind that they were planning to destroy the Hat, imperio a student to do something, etc. The first SI would likely be seen just as an unfortunate victim of chaotic magic, while the latter would be seen as a sociopath or something like that. The more negative reaction isn't guaranteed but it, as a possibility, is also there.
