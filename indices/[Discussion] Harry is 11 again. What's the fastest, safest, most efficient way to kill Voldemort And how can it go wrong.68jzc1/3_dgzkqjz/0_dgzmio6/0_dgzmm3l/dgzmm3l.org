It was NEVER specified in canon that Fiendfyre was this powerful and uncontrollable. A major piece of evidence was that no Muggle villages or towns were ever destroyed by that spell, despite it being a Death Eater's preferred weapon/spell.

There was only one sentence by Hermione describing its effect. When Crabbe unleashed it later in the RoR, it was contained in that room and the Castle never burnt down because of that.

Therefore, readers and fanfic writers have SIGNIFICANT leeway in interpreting the effects of Fiendfyre.

I'm going with the assumption that a wizard of Dumbledore's power was strong enough to use and control it.
