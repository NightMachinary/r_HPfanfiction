Lack of evidence is not evidence of lack. Just because we don't here about Fiendfyre damage, doesn't mean there wasn't plenty of it offscreen.

Crabbe's Fiendfyre stayed in the RoR because through the Room's magic it sensed that that's what the people in the room needed.

That said, the above doesn't prove that my interpretation of Fiendfyre is correct, it only shows that it's plausible.

But irrespective of what the "actual" effects of Fiendfyre are, from a fanfic perspective, you can't use it as a consequence-free way to destroy horcruxes; it makes for a less interesting story.
