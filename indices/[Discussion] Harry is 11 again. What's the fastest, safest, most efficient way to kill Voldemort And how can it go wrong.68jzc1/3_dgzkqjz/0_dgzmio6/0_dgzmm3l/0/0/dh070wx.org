  Lack of evidence is not evidence of lack.

It is, actually. Why don't you respond to people who email you asking for help moving millions of dollars out of their country? Because you lack evidence for their claims.

Lack of /proof/ is not proof of lack.

  But irrespective of what the "actual" effects of Fiendfyre are, from a fanfic perspective, you can't use it as a consequence-free way to destroy horcruxes; it makes for a less interesting story.
#+end_quote

You can, in fact, use it that way, and you can do so without it marring your story.

For instance, in /The Problem with Purity/, Hermione offs Voldemort without much trouble. But the central theme of the story was romance rather than the conflict with Voldemort.

Alternatively, if defeating Voldemort is the major point of the story, you might put enough barriers between the protagonist and obtaining the horcruxes that using fiendfyre to trivially destroy them doesn't detract.

It's a good maxim to prefer things that make it harder on your protagonist, but you can take it too far.
