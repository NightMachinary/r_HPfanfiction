Advance/future knowledge is the ultimate power or Deux Ex Machina.

A time-traveling Harry should have it EASY crushing Voldemort, especially if he decided to trust Dumbledore. My battle plan for Year 1 is:

Let Dumbledore and Snape in their plans right from the start. So instead of playing out the 'time line', a better and far less risky solution would be to capture Voldemort, force him to spill all his secrets, obliviate him back to infancy, douse him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.

Other Year 1 actions should include:

- Capture Wormtail and free Sirius Black
- Buy a few Goblin made weapons, open the Chamber, use Harry's Parselmouth ability to control the Basilisk, and imbue those weapons with its venom. They didn't necessarily need Gryffindor's Sword.
- Send anonymous tip about Barty Jr to Amelia Bones, that should get Jr kissed and Sr locked up forever in Azkaban (as payback for Sirius)
- Having established credibility with the Barty Jr tip, send another one about Lucy's secret stash under his drawing room. That should net them the Diary and Lucy's extended vacation with dementors. Force Narcissa to sell out Lucius for Draco's sake, and confiscate significant amount of Malfoy assets.
- Next, Dumbledore worked a little politics to have Lestranges compensate Longbottoms. That would get them the Cup.
- With most Horcruxes and Lucius gone, they now had some time to enjoy Hogwarts a little bit and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- Harry, Sirius, Andromeda, and Longbottoms should control large amount of resources by now and would influence Fudge to behave better. Getting rid of Umbridge should also be easy, or if they were more pragmatic, use her as their 'attack dog'.
- They could further invest their money in tech stocks just to maximize future returns.

Speaking of the Shack, just burn it down with Fiendfyre.
