Also, while I think of it: We know that the magic of the world of Harry Potter is/can be incredibly subtle, and that the protective enchantments on Hogwarts are both ancient and incredibly powerful. It is not only plausible, /but likely/ that it is the protections on Hogwarts that led to all the "coincidences" that kept the Basilisk from actually killing anyone.
