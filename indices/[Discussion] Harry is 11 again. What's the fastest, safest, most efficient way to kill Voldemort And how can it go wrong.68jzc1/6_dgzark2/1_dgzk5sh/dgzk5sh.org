  e.g. Releasing Sirius embarrasses Fudge. Fudge is largely controlled by Malfoy. Malfoy is the guardian of the diary, and his wife is heir to the cup. Embarrassing/exposing Malfoy is embarrassing for Fudge. Pissing off Fudge leads to Umbridge, and a decrease in Dumbledore's power.

Bringing down Lucius Malfoy would be really easy with future knowledge. His secret stash under his Drawing Room would be enough to send him off to Azkaban for decades. With Malfoy out of the picture and Sirius in, Fudge would be a lot more reasonable. As for Umbridge, she would do ANYTHING to stay in power, so she could actually be used as an attack dog by the 'good guys'.

  Bellatrix Lestrange: She's super evil. She also has the cup. If she (and her husband) dies, there's a reasonable likelihood that her vault would pass to Narcissa (see 5). If Voldemort ever came back, she is a valuable piece for him to have on the board, and one I'd want to get rid of ASAP. If she gets to go after Voldemort, she's worse than Pettigrew. Getting her out to get the cup is a huge risk, getting the cup without her permission is a huge risk. Basically, the cup is a bloody nuisance.

Not difficult at all, just convene the Wizengamot and make Lestranges pay compensation to the Longbottoms, and the Cup would be there.

  his one is kind of tricky, because it's linked to the Voldemort one. Without Pettigrew, how and when Voldemort regains his body is an unknown. But you need Pettigrew to get Sirius out and acquitted, and you need Sirius out to get into Grimmauld Place. Dumbledore needs Harry to stay with the Dursleys.

If they could trap Voldemort's wraith, why bother giving him a body back? If they couldn't, Voldemort would most likely still be found in Albania. So if they wanted to give a him body back, just send Snape off to do it. Voldemort would then be EXTREMELY weak in his Humonculus body, and that would be the perfect chance to neutralize him (first pump him with enough Veritaserum to get his secrets, next obliviate him back to his infancy, then dose him with Draught of Living Death, and finally lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard). Now they gained some breathing room and could work on Harry's scar more leisurely.

Also, Harry ABSOLUTELY didn't need to return to the Dursleys. Once Sirius gained control of 12 Grimmauld Place, just slap a Fidelius Charm on it with Dumbledore as the Secret Keeper.
