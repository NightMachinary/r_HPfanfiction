Part of the thing is, the wizarding world is twisted and corrupt. His secret stash under the drawing room wasn't enough to send Lucius to Azkaban. We know this because Ron told Arthur about Malfoy's secret stash. I can't find the quote- but I seem to remember that a fine is all that comes of it. And Malfoy is still in a position to get have Dumbledore removed as Headmaster and to have the minister arrest Hagrid. It's also an indication of how the Wizarding World works- Hagrid, who is actually innocent, goes to Azkaban for weeks. Lucius Malfoy, who is actually guilty, pays money and gets away with it. Plus, we know that Sirius's house has a lot of dark artifacts.

Umbridge is a bigot and a sadist. She may not be a Death Eater, but she has a genuine disgust for muggle borns, children of mixed parentage, magical creatures and beings. She doesn't want power- she wants to dominate these groups, and she wants to cause pain and distress. She does well when those in charge also want those things. As long as there was someone else to be an attack dog for, she would be. She's not lawful neutral, she's lawful evil.

"Not difficult at all,"

Well...I mean, it can be as difficult as you like. For example, a civil suit is in some ways a negotiation. It would become obvious quite quickly that they were after something specific, and it would become obvious that the Longbottoms didn't want it for themselves. Plus, it then becomes likely that someone can report that Dumbledore is trying to get his hands on something in Bellatrix's vault. If that gets back to Voldemort, the gig is up. Meanwhile, they're going up against Lucius Malfoy, who has enough political capital to take on Dumbledore. He can certainly take on 11yr old Neville and his Gran, who is rather too forceful to be sympathetic or subtle. Plus, Draco and his two bodyguards are still at school to make things unpleasant for Neville to try and force him to abandon the suit.

Nobody knows if you can trap Voldemort's wraith. Voldemort in a homunculus body is still strong enough to kill Frank Bryce, and torture Wormtail. He's strong enough to torture Quirrell as a wraith. He's not harmless, he's just weakened. He can still use legimancy, and one presumes, occulamancy. Plus, Snape is a valuable piece- he's a great duellist, a skilled wizard and potions master, he protects the students from the worst of the Death Eaters and he acts as a spy. Sending him to Voldemort that early, risks losing him.

Basically, the joy of fan fiction is that you can make the conflict level as high as you like. It can be impossible to get things done, or you can get it all done before teatime. There can always be problems. You can usually get around problems.
