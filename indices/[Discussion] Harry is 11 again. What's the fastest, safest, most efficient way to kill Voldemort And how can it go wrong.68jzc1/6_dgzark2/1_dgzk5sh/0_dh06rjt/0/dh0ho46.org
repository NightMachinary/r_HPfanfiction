  Part of the thing is, the wizarding world is twisted and corrupt. His secret stash under the drawing room wasn't enough to send Lucius to Azkaban. We know this because Ron told Arthur about Malfoy's secret stash.

You are overestimating Malfoy's influence. When he was captured after Year 5, he rotted in Azkaban for almost a year until Voldemort broke him out. Ron never told Arthur about Malfoy's secret stash until it was way too late. If Dumbledore pushed this issue early in Year 1 personally, the outcome couldn't be more different.

Also, I mentioned that Bones already got a successful tip about Barty Jr, so the credibility was there.

Fudge was just elected to Minister in 1991, so his position was far less entrenched than, let's say 1995. In canon, Dumbledore's own position had been severely weakened by 'a series of very unfortunate events' from 1991 to 1995, so the balance of power should have shifted to Fudge's favor by that time.
