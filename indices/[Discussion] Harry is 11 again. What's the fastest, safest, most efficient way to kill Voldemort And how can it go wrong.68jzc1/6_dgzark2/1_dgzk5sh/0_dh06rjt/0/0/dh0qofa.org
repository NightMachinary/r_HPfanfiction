No I'm not. The circumstances are entirely different by Yr 5, and the crimes are entirely different. We know that Sirius's house is full of dark artefacts and we know there is a shop in Knockturn Alley that sells dark artefacts. One might assume that having a stash of dark artefacts is something that is very common amongst a certain brand of old family. It's the legal equivalent of being found with a couple of grams of coke, a bag of joints and some illegal fire-arms. A man like Lucius Malfoy is not going to prison for that. If he can't get a fancy lawyer who can use Lucius's influence and promises of largesse to get him let off entirely, then he's getting a fine, maybe some community service. He didn't even go to prison for being a Death Eater, the first time! It does achieve the goal of having his stuff confiscated though!

In Year 5, Fudge has doubled down on a 'Voldemort is not back, why you lying'?' position. At the end of Yr 5, it has been proven to be false. Voldemort is back and flaunting it. Fudge is humiliated, his credibility is in tatters. Lucius Malfoy was found in the Ministry (Stan Shunpike got 6mth for attempting to break in), as part of a gang of Death Eaters, doing Death Eater stuff, destroying priceless artefacts and research, with actual facts Voldemort. It's completely different to owning a bunch of dubious stuff.

Plus, after refusing to see Voldemort's return for so long, now it's undeniable, he has to Do Something. And an easy thing to do is punish the Death Eaters he's got. Especially his dear confidant, because he cannot be seen to be soft on Death Eaters.

Then again- as I say. You can make your own conflict levels in fic, and you can decide how the dice will fall. This is just how I interpreted canon.
