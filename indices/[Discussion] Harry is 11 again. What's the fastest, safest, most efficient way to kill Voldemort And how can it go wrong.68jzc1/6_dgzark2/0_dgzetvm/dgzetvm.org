  That curse, tho? Is it avoidable? Does it mean someone has to die to get the ring?

I was under the impression the curse only got Dumbledore because he actually put the ring on. Presumably if you just went straight to whacking it with the sword then it would be destroyed much like the locket was in DH.

But the sword is obviously a new problem -- it hasn't yet been infused with basilisk venom, so short of willingly going head to head with the beast you would need to use a different method of destroying the Horcruxes. Although I assume that killing the basilisk (or at least removing it from Hogwarts) would be on the agenda in any case.
