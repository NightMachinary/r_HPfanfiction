Just an inventory, when Harry is eleven the horcruxes are: Diary: Malfoy Manor Diadem: Hogwarts Locket: 12 Grimmauld Place Cup: Bellatrix Lestrange's Vault Ring: Gaunt House Scar: Harry's Head Voldemort: Inside Quirrell.

And these are the difficulties with destroying them all in the first year:

1. Voldemort is at Hogwarts. If he gets wind of any horcruxes being destroyed, he can just leave Hogwarts and go make more- e.g. Nagini. He may also go and move/check on the other ones. If he leaves Hogwarts then it may be some time till he's found again.(It takes another three years in canon.)

2. Harry is only master of the cloak (and then, after xmas.) Dumbledore is still master of the Elder Wand. The ring still has a deadly curse and is in the Gaunt House. Plus, Harry's parseltongue is kind of useful. Getting rid of Harry's scar isn't really possible at this point. Do we even want to know what happens if Harry's scar is the last remaining horcrux?

3. That curse, tho? Is it avoidable? Does it mean someone has to die to get the ring? We don't know, but we know that if triggered, it's irreversible and incurable. It's reasonable to want to leave getting the ring until you're sure you can afford to lose Dumbledore, or try to make sure that whoever you make get it is disposable. (And we know, Snape is actually surprisingly useful!)

4. Bellatrix Lestrange: She's super evil. She also has the cup. If she (and her husband) dies, there's a reasonable likelihood that her vault would pass to Narcissa (see 5). If Voldemort ever came back, she is a valuable piece for him to have on the board, and one I'd want to get rid of ASAP. If she gets to go after Voldemort, she's worse than Pettigrew. Getting her out to get the cup is a huge risk, getting the cup without her permission is a huge risk. Basically, the cup is a bloody nuisance.

5. The Malfoy's are at the height of their power and prestige. Breaking into the manor? Tricky! Breaking into Bellatrix's vault, whether it's owned by Narcissa or not? Tricky!

And here's the problems with waiting till any of these things become more favourable:

1. Not changing stuff is boring and frustrating, and also, that's kind of what canon is.

2. When you change stuff, it has consequences down the line.

e.g. Releasing Sirius embarrasses Fudge. Fudge is largely controlled by Malfoy. Malfoy is the guardian of the diary, and his wife is heir to the cup. Embarrassing/exposing Malfoy is embarrassing for Fudge. Pissing off Fudge leads to Umbridge, and a decrease in Dumbledore's power.

e.g. If the order never reforms, or reforms too early, Tonks and Remus never fall in love. Bill and Fleur never meet. Luna hasn't started Hogwarts yet, so never gets her friends. Neville never gets to channel his inner goddess and be awesome.

Also, there is the straight up problem of everyone he knows is six years younger, which means Ginny is still a child, Hermione and Ron are still children. Relating to your best friends when they're six years behind is difficult. Relating to any eleven year old when you're seventeen is difficult. That changes stuff too.

So here are the chains of dependency for the easiest and quickest route to victory:

1. Diary: Easiest- Wait till the summer of 2nd yr, and let Lucius slip Ginny the diary. Quickest- Send Mr Weasley an anonymous tip about the compartment under the dining room floor in Malfoy Manor, so maybe he can search early. If this happens, Dumbledore needs to be involved, because we need a way for the diary to be confiscated and delivered to our heroes. This is riskier- a search may not find it, and if anyone gets wind that someone's looking for it, something unpredictable might happen.

Diadem: Easiest: Wait till Volde-Quirrell is gone and just go get the bloody thing and give it to Dumbledore. Quickest: Just go get the bloody thing and give it to Dumbledore. Volde-Quirrell might get wind of this and move the other horcruxes/make more though.

Locket: This one is kind of tricky, because it's linked to the Voldemort one. Without Pettigrew, how and when Voldemort regains his body is an unknown. But you need Pettigrew to get Sirius out and acquitted, and you need Sirius out to get into Grimmauld Place. Dumbledore needs Harry to stay with the Dursleys. So these routes take about the same amount of time, it's more a kind of 'choose your adventure'.

1. Have someone tell Sirius to escape, destroy the locket, and let Pettigrew run off to Voldemort. This happens earlier, but in a somewhat similar way.

2. Take the rat to Dumbledore, have Sirius released and Pettigrew imprisoned. This leaves Fudge annoyed, Pettigrew unable to get to Voldemort, no one sure where Voldemort is, him a shade with uncertain powers, and Sirius as a wild card on the board.

Cup: Quickest: Maybe trade sword for cup? Have a bank heist just like in canon? Basically, take it from Gringotts without permission. Potentially pissing off Goblins, potentially pissing off Malfoys and also the Ministry of Magic.

Easiest: Just have Neville sue the Lestranges and ask that he make the cup part of the settlement. He's the potential-boy-who-lived too. Poor lad deserves a part in it.

Ring: Quickest: Just send someone we don't like to get it and then nick it from them when they've been cursed. Easiest: Figure out what the curse is, protect from it, retrieve ring.

Scar:

Once you've got the ring, LOL! SURPRISE ATTACK. Your wand is mine now. Or. Harry is still master of the Elderwand from the other timeline?

Dunno. Basically, I have a lot of thoughts on the subject! :D
