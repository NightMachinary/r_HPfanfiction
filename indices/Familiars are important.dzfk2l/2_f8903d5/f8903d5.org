I know a handful of fics that deal with that as a concept, but frankly they are all terrible (and I'm being generous).

More specifically, I think there are reasons why this idea isn't particularly common. For one thing, there aren't 'familiars' in HP anyway. Fawkes, Nagini, Hedwig, Crookshanks, etc. are all /pets/. Their masters own them, in so far as one can 'own' a magical creature anyway (although that is admittedly somewhat nebulous with Fawkes as we do not know yet why he sticks around).

A bigger issue though is that there is already something akin to a familiar as you envision in HP: the Patronus and to a lesser extent the Animagus transformation. The Patronus form embodies an aspect (or aspects) of the caster: Harry's stag represents nobility, family and distance; Hermione's otter embodies inquisitiveness and curiosity; Ron's terrier is loyalty and sociability (read: man's best friend); Dumbledore's phoenix is distant, otherworldly and powerful. Throwing in familiars to HP adds something awkward to the world, and few authors have the breadth of planning/thought needed to work out the implications of such a change.
