There was a fic i read once where kids get their familiars when theyre pre young and when they do, they have a certain colour to them (gold, silver, bronze) and depending on ones familiar u have a rank. Harry in the story has a gold snake (?) and is ranked very high, which is uncommon for a half blood. Draco has a silver dragon (?) and ron has a bronze one (cant remember what). From what i remember, it was a harry & draco friendship w slytherin harry.

Lemme know if you want to read it! Ill have to go digging aha
