Hmm. The only other fic where only Lily survives that I can think of is linkffn(Anything's Possible)

Admittedly, I have not made it all the way through, but the short is that Lily survived somehow and shows up after HBP at the Dursleys house during the summer. Harry spends the rest of his time trying to figure out whats going on.
