I liked the concept of magic being alive and all. Can't say much on the story itself without spoilers. But basically it's a good Tom Riddle and Evil Dumbledore and dark magic isn't Evil kind of story. Characters are not so prominent -except the main characters - to really comment on it. It's a bit rushed to be honest, would have been a better story with more depth and details. It's as if the author was in a hurry to finish it. You can try it if you want. /shrugs/
