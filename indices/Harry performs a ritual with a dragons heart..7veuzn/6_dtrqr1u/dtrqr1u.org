There is a fic where Hermione is actually a [n elder?] dragon (they can take human form).

It's an HHR, and to give HP the power he needs, he and Hermione do this ritual where they rip out half of their hearts and exchange them.

This results in HP gaining a dragon-form and becoming quite powerful.

It is abandoned, though.
