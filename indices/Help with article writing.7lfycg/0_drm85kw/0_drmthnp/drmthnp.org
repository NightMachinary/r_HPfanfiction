That's REALLY good, content-wise, but a little too personal.

Rita Skeeter uses exclamation marks only sparingly, and she would never write "I" to refer to herself in an article. More likely she'd write something like "special correspondant Rita Skeeter informs us that..." and so on.

Also, she wouldn't directly address the reader in a newspaper article, especially not to ask questions; she'd be more likely to phrase the question as a statement. Such as "one must ask oneself whether Harry Potter would not do better to re-examine the motives of his so-called friends."
