Well, I wouldn't recommend it otherwise, but read the Daily Mail. I once stumbled across an article that was so mean-spirited that I actually thought this journalist must have been the inspiration behind Rita Skeeter. Can't find the article anymore, but I think the author was Jan Moir. She comes up with lovely articles like [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3903730/JAN-MOIR-Harry-s-tragedy-No-sane-girl-marry-him.html][JAN MOIR: Harry's tragedy? No sane girl would marry him]]:

  Cupid, get out thy lute and prepare for a royal pluck. Love sweet love is in the air once more for dashing Prince Harry, who has been linked to a sultry American actress called Meghan Markle. [...]

  He is a playboy prince with a glint in his eye, but Dirty Harry could easily turn into Seedy Harry if he is not careful. For time is not on his side --- and already the royal shutters are rolling down on his window of opportunity.
