It's kind of tough. I've taken a stab at it myself a couple of times and I've never been quite satisfied with the results. I try to think of someone just being so eager to tell you what they've got to say that they're totally breathless. Imagine you're sitting with this person at a table in a crowded cafe gossiping about a friend and she keeps looking over her shoulder as she tells you things that she really mustn't, but she simply can't help herself, darling!

Also, read a lot of tabloids to pick up the language and rhythms. It really is a different style of writing.
