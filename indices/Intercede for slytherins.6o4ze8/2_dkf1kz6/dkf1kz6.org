In Pet Project linkffn(2290003), Hermione steps in to stop a younger Slytherin from being bullied by people from other houses, and there is an ongoing arc of changing attitudes towards Slytherins, including having some joining the DA. The story is SSHG, but only really towards the end. It centers around a growing mentor/student friendship between Snape and Hermione and has some very enjoyable magic in it, as well as a Dumbledore who is painted in shades of grey without it veering into bashing. The Slytherin-vs-everyone else issue is examined quite a bit.
