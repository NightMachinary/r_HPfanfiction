All the free death-eaters spend the last ten years getting settled into a comfortable life. The might regret that the Dark Lord had failed but they also know that they got of easy the last time. They know that round 2 of the war will once again come with a lot of sacrifices and effort, they are once again subjected to the torturous whims of unstable villain, they now know that their Dark Lord had already been defeated once and might be again, and they know that if they lose in round 2, then there is no way they can escape easily again.

So I think it's quite understandable that most of his followers are a lot more resigned now than they were before. Its also quite possible that they heavily romanticised serving him, forgetting the torture and humiliation and focussing on their dreams of domination. It's a general human phenomenon to romanticise one's past.

And they didn't support another dark lord because there was none. Wizards like Grindelwald, Riddle or Dumbledore are only a few in each generation. They would need a wizard of absolute top tier who was willing to subscribe to blood-purism and was ambitious enough to take on the world. That's a /very/ strict filter.
