Simple. They don't want another War, they want to /win/. They wish Lord Voldemort would just /win/ already and take over the world with them as the new aristocracy, and they want him back for this purpose. But that doesn't mean they like the whole "cold war where we're his disposable mooks" prelude to the Great Victory one bit. They just grin and bear it as best they can for the sake of the brave new world they hope he'll build. Hence, when you ask them, "do you wish Voldemort would get another shot at taking over the world?", they're all for it, but when urgently faced with the prospect of Voldemort being back for them right here right now, they're not quite as giddy.

The reason they couldn't put their money behind some other bloke is that there is no other bloke available. Lord Voldemort was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of an /absurdly/ powerful and intelligent sorcerer willing to further their ideals. There are other magic-prodigies, and there are other bigots, but there's not a lot of crossover between these two categories because the Wizarding population is too small for that to happen. If they'd tried to elect Malfoy the new Dark Lord or something, he'd have been beaten in an afternoon by the Auror corps, even if he'd had access to all the resources of Lord Voldemort, because he's just not personally good enough at magic. They could maybe have gotten /somewhere/ by hiring someone of slightly lesser, but still impressive skill, like, say, Bellatrix, but sooner or later Dumbledore would have shown up and swatted them away.
