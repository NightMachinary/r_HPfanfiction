Yes. Absolutely. Without a doubt.

There are only a few notable Death Eaters: Rosier, Snape, Dolohov, Bella, Rookwood, and BCJ. Bella and BCJ aren't turning on him. I can't say much about Dolohov as we don't know anything about him, but I'm inclined to believe he was just as insane as Bella and BCJ. So that leaves Rosier, Snape, and Rookwood. 3 very Death Eaters who, depending on their age, are about equal to McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn (who Voldemort toyed with) and a slew of above average to mediocre ones.

I mean, these are the same group of Death Eaters who tried to run when Dumbledore showed up in the DoM despite having all 3 aurors down and Sirius dead.
