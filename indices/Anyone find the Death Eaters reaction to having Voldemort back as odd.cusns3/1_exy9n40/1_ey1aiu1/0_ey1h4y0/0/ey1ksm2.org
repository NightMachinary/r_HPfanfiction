  And died for it. They can't beat Voldemort collectively or alone

I dispute both sentiments. Like you see with organised criminality, when the incentive (and risk) to stay a criminal are lesser than those of switching sides, many people will consider it. I doubt Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to hide a few defectors, and fighting the war entailed the very real chance of dying (to either a homocidally mad Dark Lord or Aurors, Order members). He offered it to Draco, who -- by any modern understanding of law -- was undoubtedly guilty of attempted murder among other things. Furthermore, we saw three competent people battling Voldemort, at least for a while (near the end). Yes, he overpowered them, but would he have overpowered five? Seven? Ten? Doesn't seem like a foregone conclusion. They could, at the very least, have destroyed his body. They didn't exactly know about the Horcruxes after all, which in my mind should've pushed them to betray him even more.

  They weren't all wealthy. They got away with it because they told a lie no one could prove.

The first I'm aware of, and I didn't try to indicate otherwise. But look at how Lucius, with a few threats and some public standing and influence manages to sack Dumbledore and chuck Hagrid in prison through Fudge. When push comes to shove, the institutional resilience of Britain seems very weak. I suppose Rowling wanted it to be a nod towards the Weimar Republic, but that only gives further credence to my opinion that determined and ruthless men could've exploited the system far worse and far earlier than OotP.

  Who says they didn't try? By all appearances Bagnold delegated a lot of power to Crouch Sr and Dumbledore

I agree with this at least. Dumbledore had a lot more pull with the government than any one person should've had. But that doesn't exactly contradict my claim. It's only a second side playing corruptionist, even if their justification is undoubtedly more humane.
