  Voldemort isn't even shown to be particularly good at planning or, let's face it, leading
#+end_quote

Except that time he planned a kidnapping so well he fooled Dumbledore. And that time he lured Harry to the Ministry. Him being outsmarted by Dumbledore for the most part doesn't mean he didn't plan well.

  That's why I propose that, in the real world, his Death Eaters would've abandoned him long before the end
#+end_quote

And died for it. They can't beat Voldemort collectively or alone and, as we see, he knows how to track people down.

I don't disagree, though, but it wouldn't be because he didn't endear himself. It would be because they'd realize he was for self and not for the cause, which is pretty much how Regulus' story ended and what Lucius was truly loyal to.

  The state of the British political system made it abundantly clear that a few determined, wealthy people could basically get away with murder
#+end_quote

They weren't all wealthy, despite what fanon wants us to believe and they didn't get away with it because of money. They got away with it because they told a lie no one could prove. The imperius curse ends only if it's thrown off or if the caster dies.

  if Malfoy and the others really desired a conservative shift in society, they would have considered working for that after the Dark Lord's fall. They didn't though. They did, at most, push back a bit or flaunt their wealth and influence
#+end_quote

Who says they didn't try? By all appearances Bagnold delegated a lot of power to Crouch Sr and Dumbledore had far more power and influence than Malfoy with OOTP being the lone exception.
