I don't buy that.

I dare say the Death Eaters, especially Rookwood, Rosier (standing in for the first gen Death Eaters), and Malfoy (who ought to be intelligent enough if you ignore the movies), had to have known that Voldemort was never going to share anything with them at any point in time. There would never be a 'happily ever after' with a Voldemort-type person because for someone like him, there's always the anticipation of the next enemy. Riddle was afraid and spiteful, that's his entire persona.

That type of person is wholly incapable of building lasting peace of any sort, and one of the major logical shortcomings of Riddle as a character is that anyone intelligent ought to have seen that. Worse, Voldemort isn't even shown to be particularly good at planning or, let's face it, leading.I don't deny that people could still follow a sufficiently charismatic (or powerful, since that is an aspect that doesn't translate well to the real world) person, but a sadistic sociopath like Voldemort would always passively nauseate even his staunchest supporters. This is also why the comparison of Voldemort and real fascist leaders falls short; they at least -- their megalomaniac and dilusional tendencies notwithstanding -- could show real empathy, even love for their subjects at times. That's why people followed them. It's easy to subject to another if you feel like that person shares something with you in return. The only thing Voldemort ever shared was his mark. All right, I admit people might still think that was a great honour, but by all accounts, it freaking hurt for the most part. But why did it? Because of its magic? Maybe. But it also fits perfectly with how Voldemort appeared thoroughly incapable of positive emotions at some point.Voldemort never really did anything to endear his subjects to him. That's why I propose that, in the real world, his Death Eaters would've abandoned him long before the end.

I also don't buy into your other argument. The state of the British political system made it abundantly clear that a few determined, wealthy people could basically get away with murder. Malfoy alone is so ridiculously influential throughout the majority of the books even though his only office is a token post that you get the feeling that with a few people at his back, he could've easily made Fudge into even more of a puppet.

People put too much emphasis on the entire Dark Lord nonsense.If Malfoy and the others really desired a conservative shift in society, they would have considered working for that after the Dark Lord's fall. They didn't though. They did, at most, push back a bit or flaunt their wealth and influence.

I think it all falls apart a bit too quickly with Voldemort out of the picture. If his regime was winning, why did it make such a big difference when he was out of the picture? The only conceivable answer would be that he was holding it all together, that they, indeed, were all his faithful Death Eaters, an army of thugish, mediocre yes-men and sadists.I like the irony in that, but I also feel some amount of doubt that people like that could've conquered a somewhat established government. You can't have both: either they're mindless drones, or they're influential elites (or a mix). But the way they act seems to suggest that they happily switch between both states at Rowling's convenience.

Tl;dr: I think the Death Eaters and Voldemort were mostly plot elements for Rowling, no matter how much she tries to fix this retrospecively, and their movement doesn't seem like much more than a bastardised, hollow echo of historical personality cults.

Rowling's first two books were basically fairy tales. Their take on morality and plot design are fairly basic. That's not a bad thing or a shortcoming, but people really should stop overanalysing what few lines we have about such topics.
