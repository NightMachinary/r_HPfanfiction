In addition to the other reasons mentioned above, I also think that they are more stressed by his return because suddenly any Death Eater who was anything less than 100% loyal is under close scrutiny and could be turned on by Voldemort at any moment.

If you go back to his return speech in GoF, you'll notice that he starts off by mentioning "a stench of guilt", scolds the Death Eaters for the fact that hardly anybody tried to find him, and then uses the Cruciatus curse on the first person who begs forgiveness. Later on, certain Death Eaters would have seen how angry Voldemort became after learning that Lucius inadvertently threw away one of his Horcruxes.

So I think most Death Eaters are initially pleased at the prospect of having him back, but when he actually is back, there's reason for concern because the realization sets in that nobody is safe, not even among themselves.
