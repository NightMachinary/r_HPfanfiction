Most of the Death Eaters we see in canon are veterans of the last conflict. They were young then and far more willing to bleed for a cause. The ones who escaped Azkaban then spent fourteen years enjoying wealth and, to one extent or another, power. Its not that unrealistic that a bunch of people who followed a lunatic in their youth, and who enjoyed the concept of having him back when it was just a concept, would be less than thrilled by the reality of it. They got older, slower and less willing to suffer for their cause. The ones in Azkaban remained exactly the same as they were mentally because their limited experiences gave them little to no room to change even beyond their insanity.

Just imagine a bunch of "rebels" who caused shit in their teens and twenties, then went on to experience no consequences for their actions and even lived lives of luxury reacting to their old leader trying to get the band back together in their thirties and forties.
