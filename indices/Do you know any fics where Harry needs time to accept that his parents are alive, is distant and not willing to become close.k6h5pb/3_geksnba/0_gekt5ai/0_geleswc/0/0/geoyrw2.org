I agree completely! There's just no reason to write that into a story at all. Like two parents can't handle two children so they ship one off to a relative so they will have two children to raise. It's just a gateway to have a badass angsty protagonist that can tell all the 'bad guys' (meaning more often than not the Potters, Dumbledore, Weasleys etc) exactly where to go. It's making the good guys bad with no real thought put into it. No effort or originality. Like I said, I can only imagine the people writing these things are too young to understand how ridiculous is. There is no sense at all.
