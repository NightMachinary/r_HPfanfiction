I've seen fics where authors also try to reason that behavior. “James and Lily really try to pay attention to Harry, but as the BWL requires has more immediate needs, they just... forget their other son and have to be constantly reminded of his existence.”

If those fics were written with a goal of making sense, then their authors failed spectacularly. James and Lily, people who were ready to do anything to ensure their child's survival, are suddenly giving their son to the Dursleys, all because -- they have another child?
