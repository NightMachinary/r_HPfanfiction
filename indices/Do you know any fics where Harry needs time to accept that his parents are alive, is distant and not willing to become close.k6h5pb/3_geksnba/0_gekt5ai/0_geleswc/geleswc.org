Like what is likely about that. So ridiculous. These people died protecting their child but now they are just going to blindly ship him off to their neglecting relatives and for no reason at all. He has Lily's blood after all. So the 'blood protection' argument doesn't seem to fit. I think those kinds of stories are written by angsty teens or something because they make so sense whatsoever.

They show Lily and James Potter as blind sheep following an idiotic Dumbledore orders blindly.
