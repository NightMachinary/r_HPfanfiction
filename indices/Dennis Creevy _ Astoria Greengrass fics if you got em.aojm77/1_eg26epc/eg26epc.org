That's an interesting pairing!

JKR said in [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/J.K._Rowling_PotterCast_Interview][an interview in 2007]] that Astoria is two years younger than Daphne, which is why she's usually portrayed as younger than her sister

So she'd be closer to Dennis than Draco in age

I'm currently writing a multi-pairing one shot..... this has given me an idea :D
