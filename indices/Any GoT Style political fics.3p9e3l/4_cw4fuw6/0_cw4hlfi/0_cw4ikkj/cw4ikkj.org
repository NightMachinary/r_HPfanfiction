The summary does say "in the style of the French Revolution." Though, to be fair, using veritaserum is probably a good bit nicer than what was often done during the Revolution and subsequent Terror. I think the Veil is probably nicer than the guillotine, too.

Regardless, if you feel that there's lack of intrigue at the beginning and that bothers you, then it is coming. Probably not as extensive as GoT... but it's not as long, either.

If it's the violence and attitudes of the revolutionaries that bothers you, then that's not really going away. But it's also not too unreasonable, either. The French Revolutionaries were, once again, worse. The story is, if anything, a mild glimpse at what might plausibly happen if the muggleborn in Britain launched something akin to the French Revolution, then like the French, were threatened by other European governments that are run like Britain was and see the revolution as a theat to their own systems.

Sure, it's not always pleasant to look at, but then again neither was the French Revolution if you look at it too closely. The American Revolutionaries had advantages that made things easier for them than it was in France, yet alleged and actual royalists were still treated badly.
