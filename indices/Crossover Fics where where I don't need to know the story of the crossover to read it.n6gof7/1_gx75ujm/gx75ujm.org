Some of the best crossovers do just that. It takes the canon character and uses them as the audience substitute to explore the new fandom. Here's a few I've enjoyed. Be warned I'll include some of my own.

Linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) HP/SW

Linkffn(Wand and Shield) HP/MCU

Linkffn(Enter the Dragon) HP/Shadow run

Linkffn(A Wand for Skitter) HP/Worm

Linkffn(Denarian Renegade) HP/Dresden Files

Linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) HP/Sw

Enjoy.
