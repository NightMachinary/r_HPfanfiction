That would be a sad series because I think that, considering how much Ron liked her at first, Hermione would instantly combust or be devoured by demonic birds the moment she opened her mouth. Also the floo flames that Sirius uses to talk to Harry in fourth year turn into a portal to hell that drags Harry in the moment he throws the "Potter stinks" badge towards Ron's forehead.
