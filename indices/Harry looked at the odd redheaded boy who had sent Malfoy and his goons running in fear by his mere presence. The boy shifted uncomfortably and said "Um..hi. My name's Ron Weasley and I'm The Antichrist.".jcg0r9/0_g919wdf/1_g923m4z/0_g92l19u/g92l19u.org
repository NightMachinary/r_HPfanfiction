Harry looked around in bewilderment. Due to his rather famous title, he was (very begrudgingly) becoming used to the stares and whispers he received walking into a room, so, though he had always thought it would be welcomed if it ever happened, he was quite befuddled by the complete lack of notice given to his arrival in the Great Hall. Even SNAPE hadn't paused his (perfectly terrible, as always) day to glare at him! Everyone else wouldn't have been a cause for concern---the singular benefit to living in close proximity of the Weasley twins was that he could still hold out hope that one day they would do something spectacular enough to take every nosy pair of eyes off of him for a while, but SNAPE?? No, something was definitely wrong. He noticed that the Slytherin table was particularly amused while the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables looked particularly disturbed, with Ravenclaw falling somewhere in between while simultaneously conveying intense concentration (that happened no matter what emotion any Ravenclaw was feeling, and the ability to create such an impression had remained one of the great mysteries of the Wizarding World for centuries). Our poor confused protagonist noticed all of this in a passing glance, until his eyes abruptly stopped on one Hermione Granger, and the squinted organs suddenly reflected something akin to the feelings of a cornered rabbit. 3.... 2.... 1.... “HARRY JAMES POTTER! HOW DARE YOU TRY AND LEAD ME TO THE DARK SIDE! I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HIS SERVANT ALL ALONG, AND YOU... YOU... YOU DECIDED TO TRY AND GET THE POOR BOOKWORM INTO YOUR DASTARDLY SCHEMES! I THOUGHT YOU WERE A REAL FRIEND!” Harry simply couldn't comprehend the words being screamed at him by a sobbing Hermione, who promptly turned around with a sad swish of her robes and ran out the hall. The half-angry, half-scared mutters rose in pitch, mysteriously containing the sound of a dull roar while still being surreptitious enough to be classified as mutters. Harry turned to the Head Table, hoping for---reassurance? explanation? SOMETHING---only to be met with a sea of glares, and worst of all, the Disappointed Lack of Twinkle. Harry quickly averted his eyes to avoid becoming a sobbing mess (externally, at least---internally, he was already more than halfway there), which was standard procedure for a DLoT recipient. And just when he thought the morning couldn't get any worse, Ronald “Ron” Bilius Weasley walked in. The reactions varied---the Slytherins were a sea of mild-to-“turned into a ferret”-level irritation depending on the year, while all other tables had a mix of hate and intense terror. When Ron clapped Harry on the back and announced that he was feeling like having extra bangers that morning, the renewed disgust pouring from about 3/4ths of the hall finally made something click in Harry's poor overtaxed brain. He had no idea what it was that Ron said, but he could guarantee that it would make more trouble for him than for anybody else---Harry Potter Luck was truly a bitch. Rather than face the outpouring of hate his dyslexic best friend had undoubtedly managed to create with his latest word mix-up (though the fact that he got Hermione with it was making Harry wonder... on second thought, his life was miserable enough when the things Ron said WEREN'T true), Harry chose the best option he had: he walked to one of the stone walls and banged his head against it as hard as he could. If he did it enough times he could get himself into a coma and dream of a better world for a few months, right?

Oh also, no disrespect to any dyslexic people or people with any other learning disability, it's just that that was what the og poster prompted.
