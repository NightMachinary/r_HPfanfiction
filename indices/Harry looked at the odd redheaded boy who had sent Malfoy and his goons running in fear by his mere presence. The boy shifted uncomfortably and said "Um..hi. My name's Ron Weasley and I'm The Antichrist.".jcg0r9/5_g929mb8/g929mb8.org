The train was crowded by the time he arrived to kind of strange boys helped him get his trunk into storage right before the train departed the two older boys took off in the opposite direction saying some thing about,” ronniekins Having already found a compartment So they could go sit with the lee Jordan.” The older boys actually kind of pushed harry in the opposite direction, Not physically but verbally at least offering up information that there were a few first years in empty compartments on the opposite end of the train.Before walking off both of them discreetly looking over their shoulders not that hairy noticed the twins offering up discreet smiles to one another before diving in to their new plan for the first prank of the new term. lee had said he had a surprise for them in the letters over the summer.

Harry not wanting to stand for the rest of the journey listen to the not so subtle hint from his. The Weasley twins And started walking towards the back of the train. He heard whispered from almost every compartment,” Harry potter can you believe it”, “I've heard he's in our year”, “ Yeah but we've got Lucifers spawn as well don't fancy sharing a dormitory with the likes of that.”

The Whispers coming from relatively only have four compartments Made Harry walk a little faster skipping over places he clearly could have said. Instead he kept moving until there was nothing but silence in the last car of the train a full six compartment set empty, Harry had checked he didn't want to sit alone, But he didn't wanna listen to gossip, He checked the second to last compartment and found a redhead who wasis a little hunched over on himself and holding a corn beef sandwich.

​

There was no noise coming from the compartment outside of the boys almost aggressive chewing his mouth slightly open. Harry broke the silence with an inquiry,” Mind if I sit here mate everywhere else it full of gossip or Unsettlingly quiet. I don't fancy spending the train journey staring at the wall.”

The ginger boy looked at him for a moment and swallowed quietly whispering, “ yeah mate not exactly packed full is it.”

​

The boyhad looked at Harry but not really examined him when he answered so when the black haired boy Set down across from him it didn't quite register until a second later and The unidentified ginger Blurred it out,” Bloody hell you are Harry Potter” Followed by “ You shouldn't be sitting with me. You're a hero .” Before a moment later,Does any normal 11-year-old does the ginger said,” Do you really have a Lightning bolt scar.”

The rapidfire questions Made Harry laugh a slightly awkward chuckle, Before answering each in turn, Pulling up his bangs to show his new companion, And then laughing at his shock a bit embarrassed and asking why he thought he was famous or a hero he was just hatry after all. Ignoring the statement about him not sitting there because of some unknown reason.

​

The ginger seemed to not notice the minor vision, And he filled Harry in On his famous scar, And his celebrity status it was all quite baffling especially, the So called adventure books Ron sister Ginny Was obsessed with according tthe boy, Harry spent a good five minutes explaining he had grown up in Surrey Not taming dragons in the South Pacific. It had been quite an enlightening conversation sprinkled with a minor interruption, From the trolley witch who didn't seem To pleased to be there Until Harry had purchased most of her selection, The woman ran off before tossing his change at him. Harry had cast a look of confusion at Ron. Where the ginger boy Just sighed and said, “ That always happens, cause of my dad I'm cursed, everybody thinks I'm the Antichrist cause Im the six son in a family of ginger wizards, Hellfire is supposed to run through our blood, My dad was a sixth son of a sixth son. So according to tradition I am the living embodiment of Darkness, I suppose you want to move carriages before we arrive at our destination.”

Harry not wanting to lose his first friend on his new journey simply looked at the boy in front of him and said, “ So I'm not the only one who's famous Then .” And proceeded to release a new chocolate frog before snatching it just moments before the beast reached the window and sweet sweet freedom. Harry suppressed a grin at Ron's Baffled expression and proceeded to bite the frogs head off. The Very Epitome of 11-year-old nonchalance, Ronald just stared at him for a second before bursting out laughing holding his middle It was a good moment Before the young ginger wizard finally settled wiping away tears. Harry got the impression, Louise we haven't laughed like that since he was a small child. The potter boy chose not to mention it and instead tossed his new friend a New chocolate frog.

​

The rest of the journey was Spent discussing everything from Quidditch( What do you mean you don't know what Quidditch is Potter), Too Harry explaining the finer points of the function of a rubber duck, A rather novel experience for the Companions. They had just started discussing the concept of television, When the compartment door slid open and a brown haired girl rather nosily Stuck her head in, And inquired about any toad sighting That might have occurred. After a negative she still pushed her way in, Informed them Ron had dirt on his nose, She watched The failed spell attempt that startled Ron's pet rats Into hiding inside his robes, Before the girl posted about knowing magic and repairing Harry's glasses. before marching off With a nonchalant,” You had best Change into school robes We are nearly at thestation.”

​

Before the bossy girl walked off, Harry cast a look at Ron,The shock clearly evident from his expression,” The Weasley just said sighing,” That's the second person today that wasn't afraid of me. You're the first two I've met since Christmas that didn't scream and run away at the sight of me.”

​

HaRey not knowing what to say Just shrugged, Before Ron Offered up,” That girl was really bossy.”

​

Harry Just laughed and said, “ Yeah mate.” In solidarity, Having come to the same conclusion.

Before both the boys Decided to listen to the girls Advice and started getting ready for their arrival at school.

​

Both boys tapping the wands their pocket Or pinching their own arm discreetly, Both not quite believing they had managed to find a friend on the journey.
