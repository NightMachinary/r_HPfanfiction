Well I can certainly understand how they became friends then, you know what I can totally see the twins teasing Ron mercilessly, Just to show their little brother that he's nothing but their younger sibling to them. That they aren't Afraid of Ron like other wizards just to give him some sense of normalcy. and I can see Hermione Just kind of being raised not very Religious by Her dentist parents And just kind of laughing at Ron while being a know it all but not being afraid of him at all. Ron and Harry bonding over being infamous and famous for two very different reasons. This would give a new layer to the golden trio epic friendship.

I kind of want to write a one shot about this is it all right if I do, It would be crack?
