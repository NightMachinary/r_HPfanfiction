I don't think it would change much. Showing favoritism to Voldemort's greatest enemy in front of a class full of children of his servants wouldn't have helped much his cause as a spy no matter how good you are at Occlumency. Also I don't think there can be worse treatment while remaining within the bounds that the school will tolerate (I had teachers worse than Snape and they got away with a lot of bullying boys and girls alike in an age when mobile phone cameras were not that common) than what Snape already inflicts on Harry.

My personal opinion is that he'd mostly ignore her. He wouldn't feel so compelled to be as cruel with her as he would with the spitting image of James, especially as he'd be regretful about the way he treated Lily. However I don't think he'd be very fair with her either and would still make snide remarks when she fucks up her potion.
