I think there would be some change, possibly because he won't have the fight or flight instinct associated with James, but I don't think the majority of his behaviour would change.

He still started teaching when there were students who saw the NEWTS incident happen. He probably learned to teach through fear in order to get obedience through that. The kids younger than me who saw me abused by the older kids don't respect me now as a childcare provider, they certainly wouldn't have respected me a few years after --- and they only got flashed my underwear, my bullies never publicly took them off. Soap in the mouth though? Yeah, old favorite.

He's also got to keep his position with the Slytherins in good standing for the return, and after the bullshit added points in year one from Dumbledore, three days after it happened...

On top of everything you have Dumbledore watching that he doesn't get “too comfortable,” as it were, and he would have made sure that Harriett or whatever her name was, wouldn't be close to Snape. The plan to keep Snape as a spy doesn't work if they're close. Year six and year seven require that distance.

I also don't think he'd want to spend time with the living proof that James's kid lived and Lily didn't. Yes, it's her kid, too, but I think people assume that would make it easier.
