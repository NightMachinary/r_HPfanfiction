I disagree. Between from the incredibly awful formatting for speech, the 'everyone's-an-idiot-especially-Ron' plus 'everyone-thinks-Harry's-a-witty-genius' tropes that are not only boring but also incredibly overused, and the fact that there are at least half a dozen idiot balls in the first chapter alone, I'd rate this as a very poor story overall.
