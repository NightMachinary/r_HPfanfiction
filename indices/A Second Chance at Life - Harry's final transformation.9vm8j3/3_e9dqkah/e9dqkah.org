I did enjoy the series, but I don't think of it as a Harry Potter fanfiction. Harry Potter as Rahkesh feels more like an OC to me and the world depicted takes some elements from JKR's books but its mostly original.

This is not a criticism, but if you decide to read this series (which is very good), don't expect an HP fanfic because you're reading a Rahkesh fic.
