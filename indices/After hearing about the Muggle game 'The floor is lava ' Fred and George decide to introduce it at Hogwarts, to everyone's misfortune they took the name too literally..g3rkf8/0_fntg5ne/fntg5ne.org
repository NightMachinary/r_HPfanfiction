Harry's face was red and he was sweating profusely. As soon as she moved he deposited the students down and she had to help him pry their hands off so he could go back in. She hated it. He was the only person insane enough to summon his broom as soon as he saw the Common Room filled with lava and go rescue students that were stranded.
