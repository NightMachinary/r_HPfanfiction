Serverus pops another wide-eye solution and offers one to Minerva. She yawns. Considering how much a cat sleeps on a normal basis perhaps turning into a cat wasn't the best idea, but at least she's not hurt. He gathers her up in his arms, outwardly grumbling about having to carry her around /again/. Internally he's looking forward to teasing her mercilessly and barely holds back a chuckle when she starts purring and kneading his arm.

Quickly coming to his senses, Serverus re-mounts Potter's broom, continuing his search of the dorms. He finds no other living creature; Potter did his impromptu job well. Albus would probably give the boy another award in services of the school. He returns to the corridor, empty save for Filius and Pomona, ready to help if someone else was found. They, too, were a bit drowsy having heard the phoenix's lullaby but they hadn't received the full force of it like he and Minerva had. The three heads of house, plus the unwitting fourth, made their way to the hospital wing to check on the Gryffindors.

Potter, Creevey, and the orange fluff monster were the worst off, but they would be free to go in a week. Both boys were suffering from magical and heat exhaustion, their bodies pushing the limits to survive. How long had they been in that smoke filled inferno? None of the conscious Gryffindors were talking to him, seeing as they thought he was holding their head of house captive or some such nonsense. She merely entangled her claws into his robes whenever he attempted to lay her down feeding more blackmail to the non-feline heads.

Poppy diagnosed Minerva and Serverus with moderate smoke inhalation from before Fawkes cleared the air and dehydration. However, cat-Minerva was being more obstinate than even the bat was normally so Poppy recommended Serverus taking her to his potions lab to treat her and himself away from prying eyes. The students were too busy gaping to focus on healing. Filius followed Serverus through the floo. Poppy had Granger and the Weasleys to play gopher for her so Flitwick offered to assist Serverus, besides, Pomona had gone to the greenhouse to pick a get-well-soon bouquet of catnip and he wanted to be there when she delivered it.
