Suddenly, there is a flash of fire in the air, brighter and somehow... purer than the surrounding flames. With a keening cry, Fawkes the firebird appears, and seems to gain immediate control over his element. The fires, which had been licking at the room's stone supports, quieted down as though struck, shying away from his currently fearsome form. A mighty beat of his wings, and most of the smoke in the dormitory is cleared by a blast of scorching hot air.

He glides over to Minerva, who had been trying her best to stabilize the girl, and pushes her back. Landing on an obsidian outcropping, he lowers his head, and three almost glowing tears fall what is left of her burned forehead.

Pheonix tears are a miraculous substance. They can only be given voluntarily, not forced out of the animal, which is uncontainable by anything other than another phoenix. They cannot be stored without losing most of their potency, and they are the most powerful if the phoenix itself feels sorrow while shedding them.

The healing process was as fascinating as it looked to be painful, but the phoenix did not seem willing to allow that to be so - he began to sing, unlike anything they had ever heard. Serverus had to grab onto one of the unburned supports and shore up his occlumentic defense, the unnatural drowsiness quickly overwhelming what he always maintained passively. Minerva managed to shift into her animal form to avoid stumbling, and the healing girl's screams quickly faded as the phoenix song sent her to sleep despite the pain.

Once she'd quieted completely, the phoenix landed on one of her arms, clasped his talons around it, and both vanished in an explosion of fire.

Instantly, the surrounding heat seemed to realize the departure of its elemental master, and bolstered upwards.
