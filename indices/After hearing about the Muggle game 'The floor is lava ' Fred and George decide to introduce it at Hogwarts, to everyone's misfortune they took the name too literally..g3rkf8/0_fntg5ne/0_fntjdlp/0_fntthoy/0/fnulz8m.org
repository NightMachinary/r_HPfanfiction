A horrendous crash is heard by all. Stone is popping and groaning, wood is sizzling, a scream echoes from the girls' dorms. Professors McGonagall and Snape start that way, transfiguring the lava into obsidian along the way. They find the girl among the wreckage of a lava-fall. She looks like she was the entertainment for a Death Eater meeting, she probably wouldn't make it for long. Despite not flying much since the'91-'92 school year, Snape summons Potter's broom to reach the girl. Minerva is obviously the better transfigurist of the two whereas Serverus and Poppy are the best healers. Pomona not far behind with her herbal based healing. Snape's specialty is field healing thanks to his time among the Death Eaters. They'll need all hands on deck for this poor girl. She isn't even recognizable anymore.
