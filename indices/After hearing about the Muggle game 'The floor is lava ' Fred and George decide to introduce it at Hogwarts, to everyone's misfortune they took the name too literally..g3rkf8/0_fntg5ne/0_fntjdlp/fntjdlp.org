She heard the sound of people rushing towards them and looked down the corridor to see Headmaster and the other Professors rushing towards them with Ron leading the way.

Before any of the Professors could say anything Harry came zooming back. He had Dennis Creevey on the back of his broom holding on to him. Harry was flying with one arm and was clutching.. her beloved Crookshanks with his other. She had forgotten about him completely. The twins were dead. She was going to kill them. She heard a scream and looked on as Harry swayed dangerously. For a heart wrenching moment she thought they were going to fall and die. But then they stabilized. She looked up and saw Headmaster with his wand out and pointed at Harry. Professor Dumbledore had saved them.

She felt relief flow through her when they finally crossed the entrance. Harry let go of the broom and fell. Ron barely managed to catch him. Part of his sleeves were burnt off and she could see a really ugly burn. That was what happened. Madame Pompfrey was already waving her wand frantically over Harry as Ron held him. Dennis still had not let go of him and she could see Crookshranks digging his nails into his uninjured that was still securely around him. Harry's face was twisted in a pained grimace as Ron supported his weight while glaring murderously at the twins. The twins were struck with looks of horror on their face as they gazed at Harry's injured arm.
