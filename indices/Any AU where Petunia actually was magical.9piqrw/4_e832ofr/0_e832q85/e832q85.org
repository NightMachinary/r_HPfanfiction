  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia Evans has always lived in her vivacious older sister's shadow. Plain, fretful, and unremarkable, she resigns herself to a bitter existence as Lily's resentful follower. In spite of this, it is Petunia, not Lily, who is the witch. All she can do now is attempt to make some sense of the sudden absurdity of her previously well-ordered world. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Marauders, and a war on the horizon all conspire to make this rather difficult. (A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).
