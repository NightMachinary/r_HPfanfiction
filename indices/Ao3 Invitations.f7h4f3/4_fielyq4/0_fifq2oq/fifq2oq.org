Ao3 allow authors to lock fics so only registered users can access them. That's always been an option, but more authors are locking their fics recently due to outside sources scraping the site.

The invitations get you an account so you can register and read locked fics (and save bookmarks and all the other fun stuff you can do on the site). I'm out of invites, but there are plenty of people still offering them up in the comments here.
