Yeah, I figured. I just saw this getting tossed around on Tumblr and the Ao3 "comment of the day" account was posting about it, too. Like I said, if anyone wants instant gratification... :)

I'm also finding out that some people had no idea that there were "locked" fics, so I guess the info is still good for some.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ
