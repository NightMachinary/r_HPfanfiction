Well, I haven't really read much next-gen but linkffn(The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aged Thirteen and a Half; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot) were quite good.

Apart from those, while it's not next-gen I highly recommend the linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) series, always my go to for some lighthearted, funny fics.
