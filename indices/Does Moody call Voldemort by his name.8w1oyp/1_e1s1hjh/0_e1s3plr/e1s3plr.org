That's a very interesting theory. But seeing as my story features Mad-Eye prominently speaking to Order members, I can't really expect him to keep saying 'Voldy' again and again as it becomes quite laughable and does not lend seriousness to what he says. Somehow, I vaguely remember he refers to him as 'Dark Lord'. Not the impersonator Crouch Jr., but the real Moody. Or should I just let him call him "Voldemort"?
