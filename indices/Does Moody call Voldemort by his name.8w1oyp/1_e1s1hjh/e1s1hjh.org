If I recall correctly, he actually said "Voldy".

My theory is that he doesn't want to give in to the cowardice of avoiding the name, but his paranoia and knowledge of dark magic meant he never quite ruled out a Taboo Curse even before Voldemort himself put it in place, so he chose "Voldy" as an alternative that still showed his courage /while/ avoiding any ill effects.
