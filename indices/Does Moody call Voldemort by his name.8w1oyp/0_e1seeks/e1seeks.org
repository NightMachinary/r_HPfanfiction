I'm struggling to find multiple examples, but in the one example I could find, he doesn't.

From Deathly Hallows, Chapter 4: The Seven Potters

  ‘All right, all right, we'll have time for a cosy catch-up later!' roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped the sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. ‘As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offence to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already. What he's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. ... So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We're choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.'

EDIT: In this chapter, Moody also delivers the semi-famous line, 'Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can't split himself into seven.'

EDIT2: OK, I just found an example in Half-Blood Prince where Moody calls him 'Voldemort'. When Moody is showing Harry the photograph of the original Order, he says, 'That's Dorcas Meadows, Voldemort killed her personally.' So JKR may have had Moody saying 'You-Know-Who' in Deathly Hallows so that there wasn't a plot-hole, i.e. 'If the name was jinxed, why didn't Death Eaters immediately appear when Mad-Eye used the name?'
