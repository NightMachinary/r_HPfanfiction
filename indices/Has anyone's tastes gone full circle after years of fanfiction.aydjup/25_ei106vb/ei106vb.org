I can't stand fics where goblins are super helpful with their secret magic. I used to enjoy them, once, but it started getting ridiculous when from three drops of blood the nasty little creatures could tell the godparents, bindings and spells placed on him, various blood inheritances, metamorphmagus gift, every single vault he is heir to and their cash down to the last knut.

I have this image in my head of goblins being a magical creature (with what magic they have being related to the working of metal and protections) and only keeping the gold of the wizards because they were forced by treaty, so they try in every way possible to be as rude and unaccomodating as can be. Basically Gringotts is where you take your money and take it out, full stop. The goblins don't invest for you, they don't manage your portfolio and ward your homes etc.
