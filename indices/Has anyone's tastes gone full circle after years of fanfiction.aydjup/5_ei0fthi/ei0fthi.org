Maybe post-war stories? I'm going through my Favorites and Follows in order of date added, and I'm not seeing many topics that I left and then came back around to. Sort-of Reading-the-Books, but that's mostly because I wrote one of my own.

What's much more common for me is that there are a number of tropes that I'll suddenly take interested in about once a year. So every so often, I'll think, e.g., "I want to read a Fem!Harry story. Are there any good ones I've missed?" On average, however, my tastes haven't changed since I got over the Super!Harry stories when I first started reading.
