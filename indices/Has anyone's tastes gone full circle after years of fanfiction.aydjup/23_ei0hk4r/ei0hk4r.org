Yes and no. I sometimes would go on a binge on a certain trope or genre, then get tired of it, then revisit it a year later. But my core preferences and understanding of the characters have stayed more or less the same. I'm still sometimes in the mood for a fun tropey indie!Harry romp, but those have been never a big part of the fics I read in the first place.

And the Diagon Alley shopping scenes are the best part of those fics, you heathen! I want to know all about Harry's new multi-compartment trunk with a library, three-bedroom apartment and a time dilation option. I want detailed descriptions of those shiny dragonhide boots and dress robes of the finest Acromantula silk. And, of course, all those priceless Occlumency, Runes and Dark Magic tomes Harry bought for ten knuts each in a secondhand bookshop in the Knockturn Alley! As soon as Harry actually boards the Hogwarts Express though, I tend to tune out. That is, if the author didn't run out of steam and abandon the fic at this point anyway.
