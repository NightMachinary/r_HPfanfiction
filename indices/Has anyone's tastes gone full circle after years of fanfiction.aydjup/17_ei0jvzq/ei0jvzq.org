It's not so much as "go full circle" as "a certain mood". There are some fics I love, but I have to be in a /very/ specific, yet hard to define mood for. There's some fics I can read whenever, over and over again, and there's some that I've tried and I just can't.

I'm not sure my tastes have changed, but what I read from day to day (in any fandom really, not just HP) depends greatly on what kind of mood I'm in.

I do go through phases in my writing more than I go through phases in my reading. There are some horrorificly written trope-fests that I wrote in the early days that I refuse to revisit, but there's other's I've come back to, to try and.... idk, improve them? Make them less trope-y? Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't!
