Nope.

I've always enjoyed time-travel fixits and post-Hogwarts canon compliant stories, whereas I only liked the likes of Synik in the beginning, and I can only stand the Black family in small doses nowadays. (I also used to be neutral towards Harmony in the beginning, while I'm nov very likely to avoid a fic for simply having =Harry P., Hermione G.= next to each other on the character roster.)

I haven't started reading a new fic in ages, though.
