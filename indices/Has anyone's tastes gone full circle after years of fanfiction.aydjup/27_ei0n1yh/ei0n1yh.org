Sort of?

I used to really like the shitty Indy!Harry and all its nonsense, then had a phase where I avoided it like the plague, and now I want Indy Harry in moderation. Something tells me the only way I'll get that is if I write it myself (and that's not going to happen, because I'm a lazy bum).

I also used to like muggle-wank, but I know want to read fics where wizardkind dominates and/or eradicates muggles.

I also liked the Harry taking on Emperor Hadrian's name, but now I insta-close the fic if I see Hadrian anywhere.

I skipped Diagon Alley shopping and Gringotts stuff back then, I still do it today.
