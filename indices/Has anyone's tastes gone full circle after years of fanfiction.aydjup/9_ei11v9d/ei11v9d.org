  I still skip over the Diagon Alley shopping scenes, though

Yeah, I always get immensely dissapointed when I actually read them. The Diagon Alley in Philosopher's is chuck-full of important setups: Quirrel, the stone, Harry's wand, Hedwig, Harry's fame etc.

Fanon Alley trips are either spent doing pointless "smart" purchases or exclusively in Gringotts using bureaumancy to unlock Harry's magic potential and make him rich beyond belief.
