My answer is no. I started out reading canon compliant missing moments, and I'm not interested in those anymore.

Furthermore, I doubt I will ever go back to some tropes I had enjoyed before, among them:

- Dumbledore/Ron bashing
- 11 years old Harry lecturing adults
- 11 years old politicians
- Harems

On the other hand, I have begun enjoying more Voldemort centric fics that don't portray him as a totally compulsive-obsessive monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]]. The latest one shot by White Squirrel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222805/1/Blitz][Blitz]], linkffn(13222805) is certainly very intriguing if someone can expand it into a full story.
