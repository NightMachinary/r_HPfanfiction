Exactly the reason why I wasn't too into those fics. The "cartoonishness", or lack of depth or motivation other than "cleanse the mudbloods!" or "gibs me all da power!" is what late stage Voldemort suffered from in the books, and also doesn't really work for me in fanfic. Especially as many Voldemort do-over fics delete all his flaws (pride, arrogance, paranoia, ego) and pass it off as character development.

It makes him indistinguishable to a late stage Dark!Harry. I also strongly prefer Voldemort that write him as a person, not a plot device or Gary Stu.
