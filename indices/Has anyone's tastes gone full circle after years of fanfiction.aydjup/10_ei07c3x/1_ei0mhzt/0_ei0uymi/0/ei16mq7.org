Voldemort has no giant, overarching motivation but his own self-aggrandizement. He doesn't want to purify the wizarding world to protect pureblood pagan culture. He doesn't care about werewolf rights or dismantling a corrupt Ministry. He doesn't want to overhaul the Hogwarts curriculum and remove all of Dumbledore's Light-biased agenda. He doesn't care about politics at all.

  "I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple. I have excellent contacts at the Ministry."

  Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. "I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away.

He's a selfish control freak who wants to be the most powerful person, and be acknowledged as the most powerful person, to feed his enormous ego and sense of entitlement.

Voldemort having a political agenda is not OOC, but Voldemort /believing/ in a political cause is. If he had one, it would only be as a tool or charade to gather power and supporters. This is how he comes off as so hypocritical about hating muggles and muggleborns, while being a halfblood himself, and inviting non-humans and muggleborns into his camp. To him, there's no such thing as right or wrong, only power, and those to weak too seek it.

In fanfic, Voldemort can support pretty much any agenda without being OOC, whether it's centaur rights, muggle equality, and educational reform, but it has to be a disguise to conceal his true selfish motivations. He's not altruistic and has no long-term vision for the wizarding world.

Dunno if you want recs or not, but that's what I consider a Voldemort whose motivations are in-character. But unless the story itself is written from his PoV and we see inside his head, none of that is shown, and therefore he will come off as a flat and one-dimensional cartoon villain. The problem is when fics are told from his PoV, and he's still a one-dimensional bad guy. Then that's just bad writing.
