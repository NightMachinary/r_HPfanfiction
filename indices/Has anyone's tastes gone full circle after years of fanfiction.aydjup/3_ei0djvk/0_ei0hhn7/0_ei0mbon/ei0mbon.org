linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage) is a pretty good one, although it becomes increasingly dense as the story progresses.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is excellent for about ten to twenty chapters before it gets too dense to continue as light reading.

linkffn(The Katarn Side) is a very well-done crossover that has had a good bit of thought put into it, and it never really becomes too dense.

linkffn (Little Guy by Clell65619) is light and fun, but gets into the farcical fairly quickly.

linkffn (Raised By GLaDOS) is one of the few first-person stories I've been able to get through the first chapter of.
