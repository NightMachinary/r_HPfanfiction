For me, it's Harry Potter crossovers. When I first started reading Harry Potter fanfiction in the early aughts, I read a lot of crossovers, but as I read more, I found a lot of them were very badly written.

Now, I've started reading crossovers again and I'm enjoying them more, because the overall quality of writing for fan fiction in general has improved greatly.
