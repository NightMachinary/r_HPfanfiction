Hey, I resent that. I was bashing HPMOR before HPMOR was cool.

I don't think my tastes have really changed, though I've become pickier. Fic with Ron-bashing no longer appeals to me, the unhealthy relationship dynamics that pop up in a lot of fic because they're written predominantly by teenagers bothers me more now that I'm not a teenager myself, and if someone calls Hermione Mya/Mia/any variation thereof I instantly close the tab.
