I recently went through my collection and deleted a bunch of fics that I saved to read later, and most of them were ones with weird relationship dynamics. I can understand if teenagers are into those kinds of stories because they have a naive or underdeveloped view of what healthy relationships should be, but it isn't for me. I also hugely respect the authors who write those fics, are aware of what they're writing, and add big disclaimers on their work to declare that they know they're writing terrible stuff, but it's a kink they like to work through in fiction and they don't recommend it for IRL.

Self-awareness gets big points, even if the work itself isn't to my taste. And that's exactly why Perfect Lionheart, Sinyk, and Noodlehammer fics are so unpalatable to me.

What about "Mione"? It's canon!!!
