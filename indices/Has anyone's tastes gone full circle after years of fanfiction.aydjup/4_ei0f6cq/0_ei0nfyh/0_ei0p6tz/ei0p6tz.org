"Mione" is +such a cancer+ so prevalent I'd be reading like 0 fic if I were to be picky about it, but I generally nope out of fic that have people more than Harry/Ron/close friends her age calling her that.

Yeah, I get that some people just have a kink/fantasy about certain relationship dynamics and fic like that get a pass. Sometimes I get the urge to read fic for a certain dynamic that I would severely look down upon IRL, so I get that.
