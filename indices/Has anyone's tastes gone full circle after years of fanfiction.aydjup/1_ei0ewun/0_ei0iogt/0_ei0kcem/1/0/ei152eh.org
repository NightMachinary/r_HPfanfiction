That's why it's considered self-indulgent, bad writing. And leads to wish-fulfillment Mary Sue protagonists instead of well-rounded human beings.

The writer writes what they /like/, instead of what is useful to the story. They describe thousands of words of Harry ordering custom Acromantula silk robes, dragon skin shoes, nutrient potions to cure his malnutrition, a custom Basilisk skin arm holster for his wand, but it's all window dressing.

It's similar to extended clothing descriptions that appeal to the /author,/ but not the reader.

  I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow.
