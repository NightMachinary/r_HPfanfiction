Not exactly, I've found that fics that were super trope-y that I used to enjoy are just eye-rolling cringe fests now. I've sparingly looked for fics with a realistically super-powered Harry that are long enough to justify how strong he gets with enemies that are also on his level because I still enjoy an epic fight scene but I've read(well I feel like I've read) everything good in that regard. So now I just go back every so often and re-read my old favorites. I really wish Miranda Flairgold would have finished her series though :/.
