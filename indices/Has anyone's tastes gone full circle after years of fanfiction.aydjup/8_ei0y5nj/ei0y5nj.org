Does reading WIP progress fic count? When I started reading in about 2004, I read everything, on every site. Then I wised up after being burned too many times and ONLY read complete fics except for my favorite authors who I could trust to keep posting.

But now a dearth of completed fic that I have not read (or that appeals to me in ANY way) has lead me to reading WIP fic again for the first time in years.

Also, I was a Harry/Ginny fanboy when I started (thus my author name GinnyMyLove) but then quickly turned to Harry/Hermione...and on to basically every other under 30 female in canon...plus Harems. I love harems.

But now I've come back around to getting a warm fuzzy from a decent canon compliant H/G fic full of fluff.

Mostly because there are no good harems completed since the last time I checked my list. Even okay harems are hard to find, let alone GOOD ones...and I've read most of the bad ones too just to round myself out.
