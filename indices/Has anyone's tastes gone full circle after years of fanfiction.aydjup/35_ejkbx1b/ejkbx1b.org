Well, power-fantasies (Harry beating a trained terrorist in a straight up fight isn't all that realistic and him standing up to Voldemort if he doesn't spend his school-years training in private for years and having the element of surprise (as Voldemort doesn't know Harry trained) isn't realistic either and neither is him fighting Dumbledore without a hefty leg up, like a surprise disarming charm which gives him the unbeatable elder wand (as long as the user is aware and doesn't want to the elder wand, if its loyalty has been won, will probably help them face even stronger/better trained people without being easily overwhelmed!)) are fun to read (some might call them a "guilty pleasure, but I kind of enjoy them without any guilt, so they are just a pleasure for me :) )

Otherwise I've not switched back! I was into Harry/Fangirl (Ginny) at first, but now I tend to avoid that pairing especially since that character is such a non-entity in canon (we don't even know how she does in class or who her friends are other than "Loony" (seriously, she needs therapy, but nobody is telling her that! Especially the other damaged character, Harry!)) and also linked to the Weasleys which I stopped liking (Molly is a bad mother who had too many kids to really love them all equally (Ron got the short end of the stick here!) and it also impoverished her family, especially since she doesn't even start working once all kids have left for Hogwarts! Selfish woman!)
