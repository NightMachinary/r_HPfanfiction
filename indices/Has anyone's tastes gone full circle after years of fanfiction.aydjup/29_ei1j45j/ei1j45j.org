For the most part no, the stuff I hated early on (bashing, edgy and angstyHarry, slash, etc) I still hate. Good writing is the thing I care about the most and I'll read almost anything if the writing is good.

Also if an another feels the need to write their own Halloween 1981 chapter to introduce their story you better believe I am skimming it at most.
