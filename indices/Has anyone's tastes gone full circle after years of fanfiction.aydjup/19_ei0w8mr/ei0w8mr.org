So I'm more character led than trope led. When I was younger I loved Sirius Black and the more brooding hero stuff I could get the better.

Now though it's Ron or the Weasleys- that's it. Not really interested in Harry and never have been. Hermione is cool and I've read some good stuff but Weasleys and Weasley brothers is my jam.
