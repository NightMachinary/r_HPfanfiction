I find it interesting how everyone absolutely hated self insert fics, but now some of the most interesting reflective fics come from self inserts (talking about fanfiction as a whole). Ditto with OC's being added to the story. I guess enough time has past that readers are interested in seeing someone new added to the cast and see how things change.

I used to hate song fics in the early 2000s, but now I kinda like them so long as only a small bit of a song is added and not the whole thing. It can really add to the mood if done right.
