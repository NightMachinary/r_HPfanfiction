I guess everyone has gotten so used to minor "name only" characters like Susan Bones and Daphne Greengrass being major characters in fanfic, that having a straight up OC is pretty much the same thing, but without the baked-in house designation.

It's also a matter of writing quality, too. If you're reading My Immortal level fics, of course the OC's will be wish fulfillment Mary Sues, and the SI's will be self-indulgent fix-its who steamroll all the canon characters with their prior knowledge. But the better written will fics avoid that.

Since the early-2000s, songfics are also considered plagiarism or against T&C. I know that fic-hosting sites like Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity will delete songfics if they have more than a handful of lyric lines.
