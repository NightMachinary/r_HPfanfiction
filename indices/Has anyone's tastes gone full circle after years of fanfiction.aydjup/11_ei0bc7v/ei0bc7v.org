Not exactly. I'm more likely to step away from a fandom for 5-10 years and then come back with the same tastes I've always had even though the fandom has evolved. (The elevating of Daphne Greengrass to a main character was a surprise to me when I dropped in this last time.)

But I still have a strong taste for MWPP and still love some stories I loved 15 years ago.
