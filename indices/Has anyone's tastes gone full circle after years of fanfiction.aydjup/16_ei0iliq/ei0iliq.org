I have always liked such a broad selection of fics that I don't think it was ever a circular cycle for me. I simply bounced around to what I felt like in the moment.

That said, there are certain fan fic styles that I started off hating and now I actually enjoy. But I have not left the ones I previously enjoyed in the dust.

For me... ALWAYS... Quality writing and depth/structure will trump the subject matter 9.9 times out of 10.

Even things I hate reading about (like "canon style" Ginny/Harry matchups) If the writing and depth/structure is there, I am usually sold.
