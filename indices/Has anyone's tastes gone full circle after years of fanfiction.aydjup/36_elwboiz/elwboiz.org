I still read powerful/clever Harry fics (I want a Harry that could end up Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort powerful). I generally try to avoid pairings. I'm less of a fan of Hermione than I used to be. She's never really criticized in Canon, which she honestly deserves. Ron, if you can ignore the stupidity of wearing a Horcrux, I like as more loyal. I feel like making him the Snape could have gone interestingly. Ginny is fine so long as she grows as a character. No seer Luna. Avoiding intentional Dumbledore bashing.
