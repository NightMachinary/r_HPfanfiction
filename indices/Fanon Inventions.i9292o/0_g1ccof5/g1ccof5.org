Some fanon inventions are preferable to me than canon:

- Ancient Runes is needed for enchanting items
- Arithmancy is needed for developing spells
- "Ward" sounds way better than "Magical Protection", and simpler
- Tempus and Warming Charms exist
- Lucius Malfoy should be in the Wizengamot
- Lily used blood magic to protect Harry. As long as Voldemort killed her, the sacrificial protection would be activated. It didn't matter whether Voldemort offered her a choice or not. I actually dislike this part, because it's just another one of long chain of lucky events that brought down Voldemort. Why can't good guys be proactive and ruthless at least for once?
- There is no Time Turner. Most fics featuring time turners either get abandoned in an overcomplicated mess, or rehash that frustrating timeline. Also, no time turners => No Cursed Child!
