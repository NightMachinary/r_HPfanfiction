As many said around here... Harry is 14 and has no time to process what's going on. Also he has a piece of cloth in his mouth. I am more surprised that Pettigrew didn't rationalize that himself. Or maybe... just a thought so please don't kill me... before his first fall, Voldemort was pretty good to his followers. It was the madness and frustration accumulated over the years he spent disembodied that made him so nasty.
