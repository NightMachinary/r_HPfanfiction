Not really. There aren't a lot of people who are very nice to Harry to begin with and he spent a good portion of his life surrounded by people who absolutely hated him and did anything they could to make his life miserable, meaning Harry gets attached to people who are nice to him faster than other people would. Also, not as relevant, but I do think that they would have been actual friends (not best friends or anything but still close) if Cedric had survived.

Edit: just want to clarify, I'm not discrediting the Weasleys or Hermione. I fully recognize how important they were to Harry and I'm glad he had them! That being said, beside them and Neville (and later Luna and kind of Dean and Seamus), Harry doesn't have a lot of friends or know people his age who like him for being just Harry (not the BWL). Also there are a bunch of people like Draco who hate him and his friends and he has people trying to kill him every year.
