I mean calling Cedric a friend is kind a stretch, no? I agree with the general idea "he just saw someone get killed and was freaking out" but at the risk of pedanticism, friend is a bit too strong a word.

They clearly respected each other and acted friendly and nice, you know Cedric being a Hufflepuff and all, but I don't think the two ever spoke for more than a couple lines.
