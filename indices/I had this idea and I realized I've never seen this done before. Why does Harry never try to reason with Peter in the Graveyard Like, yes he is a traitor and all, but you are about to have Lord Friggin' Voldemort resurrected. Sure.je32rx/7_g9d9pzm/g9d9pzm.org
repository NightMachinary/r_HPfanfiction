There is a fic (dont remember the name) where something like that happens. Harry arguments with Pettigrew until he admits he has no choice and chops the hand (unwillingly given) and later press his wrist on the knife t√¥ give blood (willingly given). Kinda works cuz when voldie ia back he has a weaker body due to a botched ritual.
