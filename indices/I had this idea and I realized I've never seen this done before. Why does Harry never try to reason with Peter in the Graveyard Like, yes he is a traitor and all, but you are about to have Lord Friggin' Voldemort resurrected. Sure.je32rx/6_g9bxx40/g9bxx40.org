In-world, thinking and reasoning isn't exactly Harry's strong suit. He's a hothead, not a manipulator. He's more likely to just get angry and throw spells at something than talk it out, especially in the later books.

Also, he'd probably be too emotionally invested in hating Pettigrew to think of it. Generally, most people aren't exactly inclined to talk to or trust the murderer of their parents, especially as children. His reaction to Pettigrew in book three was "murder murder murder!" then "Put him in Azkaban so he can suffer the Dementors!" and anyone reacting that emotionally to someone isn't a person who's gonna think of persuading that someone to change sides. Remus and Sirius might try it (more likely Remus than Sirius) but Harry almost certainly wouldn't. That's my guessed assessment, anyway. YMMV. :)

Doylistically, Rowling needed the scene to happen that way, so she made it happen that way.
