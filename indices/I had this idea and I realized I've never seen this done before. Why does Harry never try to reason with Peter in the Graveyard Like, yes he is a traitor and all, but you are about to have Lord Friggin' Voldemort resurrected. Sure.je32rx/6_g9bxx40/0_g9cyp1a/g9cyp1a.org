In world, he's bound and gagged, so he couldn't say much beyond "you!",

Reasoning is actually one of Harry's strong suits and we see it each book. It's pretty much all he does in DH. He isn't more likely to throw out spells. He's usually angry in those moments, yeah, but he also listens, either because he's forced to or because he wants the whole truth, which is usually the case.

But this is exactly what he does. He hears Sirius out in PoA, going as far as to knock Snape out to get the truth. He watches Snape's memories. He has an entire conversation with Voldemort, in which he offers/taunts him with an out.

  His reaction to Pettigrew in book three was "murder murder murder!" then "Put him in Azkaban so he can suffer the Dementors!" and anyone reacting that emotionally to someone isn't a person who's gonna think of persuading that someone to change sides. Remus and Sirius might try it

Remus and Sirius were rolling up their sleeves as they prepared to kill Peter. Harry prevents it by suggesting suffering in Azkaban was a better alternative to them being murderers. In DH, while Peter has a hand around his throat, he talks Peter into hesitating to kill him.
