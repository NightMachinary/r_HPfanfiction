There's the possibility he /said/ he did it out of fear, in front of Sirius and Remus. And yeah, maybe he actually gave up the secret of where James and Lily were hiding out of fear of what would happen if Voldemort found he was holding that secret.

But his actions kinda point to maybe he didn't join Voldemort as a spy in the first place out of fear. Maybe he really believed in the cause. And James and Sirius didn't really treat him the best from the very short memory we saw.
