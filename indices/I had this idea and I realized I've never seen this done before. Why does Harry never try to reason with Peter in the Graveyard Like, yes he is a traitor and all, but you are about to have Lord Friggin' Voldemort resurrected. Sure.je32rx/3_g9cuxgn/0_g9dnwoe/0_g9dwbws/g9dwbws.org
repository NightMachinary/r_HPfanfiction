Remember they explained how Peter liked having strong people protecting him.Once his cover was broken he could have feared being hunted down for revenge or BC he was Sirius' only ticket to being proven innocent so it's highly possible Sirius Would have wanted to hunt him down. He might have thought sticking with Voldemort then would give him protection...
