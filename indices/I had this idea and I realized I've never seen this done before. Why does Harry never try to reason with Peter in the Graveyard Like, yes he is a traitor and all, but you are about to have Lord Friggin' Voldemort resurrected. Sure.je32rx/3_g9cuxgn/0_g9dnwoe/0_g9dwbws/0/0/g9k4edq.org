See I wonder if he actually knew how much he'd have to look after the dark lord when he first went looking for him or for how long.. And once he did find Voldemort, he couldn't exactly leave him after realising. He probably thought Voldemort would still rise again even without him and when he did he would not be happy with Pettigrew for abandoning him.

Plus they found Barty pretty early on after Peter joined him so Voldemort would have risen sooner rather than later after that. Besides that, do you think the Mr I will kill my father for you, you are my everything, death eater would be happy after finding out Peter left his Lord?

I think as much as Peter was afraid to be with Voldemort he was more afraid of the consequences of leaving him.
