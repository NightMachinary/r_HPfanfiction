Yes, that's definitely the canon-friendly explanation for what he did. But when you think about it, there was more than a year that he was the one protecting Voldemort. He had no protection for himself during that time- just when Sirius would be the very most enthusiastic about hunting him down, too. Pretty brave of him if his only motivation was his cowardice. Plus he was restarting a war by resurrecting Voldemort- a war he eventually died of, and something you'd think a pure coward wouldn't be fond of doing.
