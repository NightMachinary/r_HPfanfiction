Hmmmmmm, there was that one where a big group, I remember at least Luna, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, maybe Ron, (I think even Hanna Abbot or Susan Bones, and more people??) where they come back and go around murdering everyone they hate in "accidents" because they're a bit unhinged from PTSD from the war....... don't remember the name of the fic, though. It's very well-known.
