For Hagrid, more than anyone else, you can read it out loud and see if it sounds right.

Fred and George like to derail conversations into something more amusing. They like to build on each other's premises, but they don't finish each other's sentences as often as people think. They are often mock-formal in the way they talk, particularly to each other.

McGonagall. Don't worry about the accent. Just write her as stern without being mean and you'll be fine.

Seamus. Same thing. Ignore the accent. Just write him as kind of an idiot. Like a perpetual 12-year-old who knows he likes girls and does like girls but really he likes explosions and laughing when people accidentally hit themselves in the balls even more.

Moody. The advice from [[/u/achille-talon]] is good. Write him like a pirate without nautical slang.
