McGonagall doesn't really speak in a Scottish brogue in canon, does she? I know many fanfic authors make it so that she slips into her accent when she's upset, but as far as I can remember, she has never done that in canon.

As for Fred and George... Well, the only advice I can give you is don't fall into the twinspeak trap where they speak in turns and finish each other's sentences. I'm pretty sure that only happened once in the books. I'm not sure if they spoke in unison all that often either, though they did do so a lot in the movies.

EDIT: To be clear, when I say canon, I mean the books. The movies are more supplementary material to me.
