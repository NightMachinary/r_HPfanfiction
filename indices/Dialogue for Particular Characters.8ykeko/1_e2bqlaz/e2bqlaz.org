Listen to how they speak in the pictures and audio-books (or otherwise pick an actor somewhere whose voice and accent you think would fit); then once you've written a line for them, read it in your head in that voice. It's a neat trick and it helps.

As to specific advice:

- Someone already linked [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/swissmiss/HTWHD01.html][this]] helpful guide, though for my part, I find that imagining the movie version speaking mostly deos the trick;

- Fred and George's manner of speaking can be summed up in one word: "banter". They speak fast, cheerfully, and cram in as many wisecracks as possible. Mark: they do /not/ do the twinspeak thing, nor speak in unison, for the most part; rather, they have "mock-conversation" to check on what the other is thinking ("I think this is most peculiar, brother mine...“ --- “As for me I'd say it's downright odd, George, old chap").

- McGonagall's accent is not written in canon, and should not be in fanfiction either. She has only a hint of a Scottish accent for the most part; writing an accent phonetically gives the impression that it's very thick, which works for Hagrid, but not her.

- Avoid phonetic accent again, lest you lapse into cliché. I'm sure there's a dictionary of interesting Irish slang you could use somewhere online, but /don't/ overuse it; Seamus deserves better than to be turned into The Irish Kid Who Says Irish Things.

- Moody speaks roughly, with a few shorthands, but nowhere near the levels of Fletcher. Inasmuch as he gets vulgar, he won't do so with particularly recent insults, since he's most certainly over 70. An easy trick is to make him talk like a pirate (without overdoing it). "Yer a damn fool, Auror Wilkins, if ya think this broom'll catch a flying Dark Lord, I'll tell you that!"
