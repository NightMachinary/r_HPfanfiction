Well, if you reread the scene fake-Moody doesn't just transfigured him, he THROWS him down the corridor. It stated in plain text during the scene that Malfoy was actually injured, but it was glossed over.

I think she got upset less because he was using Transfiguration as a punishment, and more because he could have literally killed a student. Like, I'm not sure if you realize just how fragile small animals are, especially ferrets. Their backs are incredibly easy to break because of how long they are.
