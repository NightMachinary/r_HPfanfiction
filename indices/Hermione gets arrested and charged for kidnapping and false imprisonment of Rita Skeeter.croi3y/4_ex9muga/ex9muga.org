I mean, I agree that Hermione's bad actions get glossed over (attacking Ron for kissing Lavender, imprisoning Rita, etc.)....but it's pretty minor to the rest of the stuff JK glosses over in the course of the story.

1) Hagrid is in prison, briefly, for allegedly accidentally killing a student (and people still think he might have been guilty!)---and yet he works at Hogwarts.

2) Snape was literally part of the magical neo nazis and people know--and he works at Hogwarts!

3) Draco nearly kills a girl and lets in a bunch of killers, and serves no prison time.

4) Narcissa lives with Voldemort and is at least an accessory, and serves no prison time because she lies for Harry.
