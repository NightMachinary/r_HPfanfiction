True. When I was younger, I didn't like Ron. Older me thinks he's one of the more realistic characters. I always find Harry insanely selfish in some ways despite being so selfless in others---Naricssa lived with Voldmort, knew full well what her husband was doing, knew that there were prisoners under her house (and it's heavily implied that Fenir is a rapist)---but hey, she deserves to get off because she lied and said Harry was dead? She doesn't deserve live in prison or anything, but some punishment was needed. There's been a couple of good fanfics which tackle the issue---I think one was where muggleborns, including Dennis Creevey and Hermione, basically become vigilantes of sorts and confront Harry at one point about how he didn't think about how others actions (like Narcissa) affected people but himself. Wish I could remember the title...it was abandoned.
