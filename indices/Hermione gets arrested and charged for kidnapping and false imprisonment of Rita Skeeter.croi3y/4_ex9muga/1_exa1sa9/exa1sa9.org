I think it's mostly because Hermione was heavily liked while we read the series, but as adults, we look back at her actions in disdain.

Hagrid bred a fire crab and a manticore (A class xxxxx creature!) and exposed them to children, along with leaving class xxxxx monsters in a forest next to a school. Hagrid probably deserves heavy prison time.
