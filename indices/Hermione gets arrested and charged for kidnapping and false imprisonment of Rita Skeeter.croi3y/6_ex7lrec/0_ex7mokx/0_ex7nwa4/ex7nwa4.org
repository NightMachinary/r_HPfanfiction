Ok. Hermione definitely needed a wake-up call after fourth year . Every year she does something wrong;setting her teacher on fire,drugging her classmates,the whole Scabbers thing,holding Rita captive,disfiguring Marietta,siccing the birds on Ron etc. People use these as examples of her "ruthlessness" but they really make her an unlikable self righteous harpy IMO
