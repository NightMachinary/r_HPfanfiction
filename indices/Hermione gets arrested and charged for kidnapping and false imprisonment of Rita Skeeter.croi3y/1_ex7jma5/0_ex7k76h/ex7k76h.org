But on the other hand, you can't make a citizen's arrest and then tie them up and throw them in your car and take them home. That's what Hermione did. She caught Rita in the hospital, but she kept her around in the jar for like, what, a few days, and then she took her onto the train. So...yeah. That invalidates the arrest and just turns it into kidnapping.
