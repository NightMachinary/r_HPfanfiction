Sure, but she can just as well claim that she's making a citizen's arrest of an illegal Animagus who's spying on private citizens using her form. I'm betting that Skeeter probably has a bunch of dirt on all of the most prominent people in their society, coz that's the kind of skeevy person she is, and I doubt that she'd have a whole lot of people who'd back her if her illegal use of her illegal Animagus form comes out, especially since not registering as an Animagus appears to be a criminal offence.
