So you're exposing magical Britain to Simurgh...Hedmurgh...would she be anything other than the antagonist? The Simurgh is no ones friend, and really not even it's own entity. It would mean that people would start randomly going nuts causing mass devastation. Worse than the imperious, because their is no coming back once Simurgh has taken hold. Any old Mr. Joe Wizard might be going about his day, then suddenly enact a detailed plan to destroy those closest to him and then cause untold havoc in the muggle world until he's finally put down. Maybe a short oneshot with wizardkind scrambling to find out the source of the mayhem, ending with Hedwig soaring over the wasteland that was Britain.
