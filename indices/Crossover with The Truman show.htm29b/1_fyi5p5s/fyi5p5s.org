I've been playing with one in this vein. Harry was an orphan boy and the world is hanging on his every adventure as the abused child of the Dursley clan.

But then, the Actors playing the Dursleys was some time off from their roles of more than a decade to take other jobs, and the Chinese and Americans have both started their own versions of the story, cutting into the BBC's profits on the show.

The world-famous Producer/Director comes up with the 'Magical Boarding school' angle and casts himself as the Headmaster. Hermione and Ron are both youthful 16-year-olds playing 11 and are more interested in retaining the roles for the inevitable Movie version than getting along with Harry when not on camera.

The big drama of the first year will be the worldwide search for the actor to play Voldemort, and the letter-writing campaign to have the big bad be a woman.

Harry, being a bit of a dimwit, is going to actually have magic, because he was convinced that he did by the Hagrid character, causing the show to win multiple awards for special effects.
