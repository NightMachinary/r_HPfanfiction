Omg, that would be so fucking sad. Tom Riddle would be the producer (and Voldemort's actor) trying to keep him trapped, and only by defeating him would Harry be allowed out of his living nightmare. Because that's what it ended up being to Harry, a nightmare. He was emotionally abused for 10 years, then thrown into a world of "magic" that ended up being one trauma after another. Only to find out the one thing that kept him going (his loved ones), were all payed actors and not even real.

The slow realization that it was all fake would be triggered in his sixth year when he sees an extra that looks exactly like his "dead" godfather. They'd try to finish the script anyway, Harry being forced to play along on the slim chance this was actually real by raising the stakes.

More people keep dying, and when Harry "kills" Voldemort at the end; he sees him still breathing. So he walks over to the "body", and starts beating it. By the time the crew managed to pull him off, Tom Riddle is half dead and the world sees this 17 year old boy struggling in the hands of security dressed as Deatheaters hysterically sobbing and begging to be let go from his unending torture.

Of course this sparks huge controversy and eventually law enforcement gets involved, they get Harry Potter out of the set and into the real world.

Cue months of being treated in a psych ward, actors coming in to help him differentiate what was fake and what's real. Everyone got the cold shoulder, until his real parents were brought in. He nearly kills them when they were brought in, they were the ones that sold him into the circus into the first place.

The world sees the horror that was behind the cameras, and the mentally unstable teenager that was left behind.
