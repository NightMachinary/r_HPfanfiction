To be fair, I love the idea of a viking/norse inspired magical Scandinavia. Having a viking chief-like headmaster, runic magic as a key part of the curriculum and creatures from Norse mythology and Nordic folklore makes far more sense to me than Karkaroff and Durmstrang and the love of the Dark Arts. Besides, no offense to JKR, but if she thought that the Nordics would be happy to share a school with Russians, she's a bit off the mark. Especially Finland, with their history with Russia, has good reason not to want to share school with Russian students.
