By viking descendants do you mean people descended from vikings or people who descended from Harry who also happen to be Vikings? Because a fic where Harry goes back to viking times and becomes a badass viking chief and just has a shit ton of kids and either finds a way back in the present and brings his fam with him or is immortal(at least immune to aging) and shows up a few minutes after he disappeared originally along with all his Viking family sounds cooler to me than Harry leaving to Sweden and bringing back magical pewdiepie and his swede homies.
