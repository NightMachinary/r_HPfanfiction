While my idea is probably not what you were imagining, it's definitely something.

Alright, so --- I'm from Iceland, so I'd know the language and the culture. Plus, if we're talking folklore or whatever, there's this one story about a giant worm that I'd love to pair up with the giant squid.

Oh well, on to my idea --- despite stereotypes, we don't act like vikings, but still, I'd write about an OC that'd go to Hogwarts from Iceland, and the OC would be incredibly alike to, uh, some stereotypes; as in wearing only wool jumpers and the weird hat that's called ‘buff' in Icelandic --- only eating fish, lamb and licorice --- living in a grass house (I have no idea what it's called in English but if you google ‘torfbær' you should find some images on what I'm talking about.)

The OC would be rather blunt, lazy, extreme (challenging someone to a fight to the death over something small (edit: tehe, a holmgang!) and unable to pick up on social cue's --- and honestly just life in general.

By the way, if you didn't pick up on it while reading my not-so-quick description, this fic would definitely be a crack.
