Your idea made me smile. Dude it's a prompt it's supposed to give you an idea to start writing anything that comes from it is awesome it doesn't have to be exactly what I have in mind that's why the prompt is it's open to interpretation by whatever writer comes across it. And your idea sounds Hilarious I'm primarily a crack writer myself. And if you choose to continue with that idea I would definitely read that story.

Thanks for taking the time to read my prompt and I love the incorporation of the OC the blunt lazy character sounds like it would fit in interestingly with the story premise this sounds like a fun read if you want writeto it I would definitely read it
