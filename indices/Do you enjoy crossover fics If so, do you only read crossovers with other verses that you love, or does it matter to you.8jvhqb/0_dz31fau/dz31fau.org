I enjoy HP characters visiting other verses, but have less interest in characters from other universes visiting HP's verse. Those tend to take away the agency of the HP characters without actually introducing new plotlines (for example, Naruto goes to school with Harry, easily solves all their problems, yet the plot stays exactly the same for seven years). Though that's a problem with any overpowered insert, not just cross-overs.
