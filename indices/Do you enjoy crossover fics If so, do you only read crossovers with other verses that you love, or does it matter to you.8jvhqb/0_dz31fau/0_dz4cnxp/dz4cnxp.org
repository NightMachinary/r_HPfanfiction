oh yeah Harry Potter going to the Narutoverse works really well not the other way around tho, I really Enjoyed Uchiha Fukurou until I lost interest when I realized I hadn't been updated in years and Auryn while it still was up.

Also, Harry Potter/Stargate works really well because both universes are extremely compatible one of the best examples is Crumpets aren't my style
