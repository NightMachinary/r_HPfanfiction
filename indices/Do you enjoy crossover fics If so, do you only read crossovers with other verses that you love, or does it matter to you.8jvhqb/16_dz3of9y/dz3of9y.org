I really just enjoy HP characters crossing over into another place/universe/whatever, but I'll read any kinda crossover if the summary catches my eye. I didn't know jack about Mass Effect other then playing 30 minutes of the first game but I read a HP/ME fic and loved it so I went to play the games. Now I love those too. For me it helps me find other stuff I might be interested in.
