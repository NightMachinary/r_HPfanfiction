I watch for new quality crossovers as closely as I do new regular HP fics, and I've enjoyed a few of them. I won't touch a crossover unless I know the other fandom, though. If I do know it, I keep an open mind, but I've found that some fandoms mesh with the Potterverse much better than others. For example, the Avengers/MCU meshes with Harry Potter surprisingly well, while I've found that Star Trek usually fits quite poorly.
