I am a big fan of crossovers. I read all kinds of them, both with series I know and love and series I don't know. For example I have never watched supernatural, but I have read so many crossovers with the series I kind of know what happened in the series. YOu can find many crossovers where you don't have to know the characters beforehand, and they are usually some of the best fanfictions around.
