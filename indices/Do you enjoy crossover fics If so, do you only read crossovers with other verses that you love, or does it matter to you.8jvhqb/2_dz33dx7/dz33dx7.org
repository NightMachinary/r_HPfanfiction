I love crossover fics. Easily some of my favorite stories have been found when dropping Harry into another Universe.

I would read a crossover fic about a Universe I'm unfamiliar with as long as it's well written. I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] before I read/watched GoT though I've seen it since. Then I've read a few Sand Man Xovers and Star Wars fics that make use of the animated show characters that I've never seen.

So it really just depends. Mostly, you often get a pretty competent and confident Harry in crossovers and those are the ones I gravitate to.
