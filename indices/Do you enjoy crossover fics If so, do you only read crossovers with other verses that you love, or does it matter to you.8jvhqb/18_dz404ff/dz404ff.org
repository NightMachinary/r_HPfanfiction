I love crossovers, they're what I read the most and I love crossover pairings as well. I usually like to read crossovers between verses that I love or I know at least a little bit about, but if the fic looks interesting enough then I'll just google the characters as they're introduced. I've actually been introduced to a couple of new fandoms this way because the story and what I saw on Google was interesting enough for me to start watching a few episodes.

The magic in Harry potter gives a lot of ways for Harry to accidentally fall into another universe or time and those are the crossovers I like best. I don't like it when the other characters go to Hogwarts, they usually follow the Harry Potter plot and having the Crossover character "fix" everything.
