Depends on the Crossover. Harry having the Sharingan and learning spells at a glance could be awesome if you at least make him practice every spell he learns. Something Crossover being "The Power he knows not" would be more interesting and less Deus Ex Machina than the Hallows were. Best crossover I read lately was Harry getting Pokemon in the Triwizard tournament.
