I'm a big fan of HP/Mass Effect crossovers, but that's mainly because I like the idea of a wizard being thrown into a futuristic sci-fi apocalypse, especially one that has a loose system of magic (biotics).

I think the reason I do read crossovers is to see Harry interact with characters completely unique to their own universes, as well as deal with situations in a way that those canon characters would never be able to. It adds a bit of freshness to what could be a stale genre.
