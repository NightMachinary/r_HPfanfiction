Crossovers are my bread and butter... They are literally all I write... :o

One of my many WIPs include a crossover between Harry Potter and my rewrite of Sarah Jane Adventures (It's also kind of a crossover with the Librarians) where five of the main characters of Sarah Jane Adventures (Luke, Maria, Clyde, Rani and Sky) find themselves inside the first book. They have to make sure it stays on-plot without giving too much away. They also don't have magic, but Maria and Rani own the Water and Air totems (Based on the Zambezi Totems from Legends of Tomorrow) respectively, so they have a limited magic. Luke and Clyde don't have anything, but Sky can feel the vibrations of the magic (Hogwarts has a background hum to her).

There's gonna be a bad guy they have to defeat who wants to trap them in the book by causing it to go off-plot.

I haven't written much of it, other than the first paragraph which has them arriving at Hogwarts.
