Well-written crossovers can be really, really good. So long as it doesn't involve some kind of weird anime, and it looks well-written, I'll probably read it - I've actually discovered other fandoms and works that I otherwise likely wouldn't have found or looked into through reading interesting-looking crossovers with HP - stuff like Worm, Chronicles of Amber, Abhorsen, Labyrinth, and the Dresden Files.

It's refreshing to find HP fanfiction sometimes that isn't a retread of the books, or yet another cackling evil Dumbledore story, or weird gay porn.
