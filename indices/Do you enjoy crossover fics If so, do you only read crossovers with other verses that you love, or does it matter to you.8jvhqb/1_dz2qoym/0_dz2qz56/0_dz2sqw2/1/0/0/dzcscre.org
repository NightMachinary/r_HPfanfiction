I'd say it has aged about as well as, if not better than, TNG. The special effects can look a bit cheap sometimes, practical or otherwise. But the cgi can still look good, especially in the later seasons/spinoffs. IMO the cheapness of the practical effects from that era of Sci/fi is what makes me love the shows so much, makes them feel more grounded, don't know why tho. For the story, I guess it's just a matter of opinion. Re-watched all three shows recently and I can't say I remember anything that broke my suspension of disbelief, so I consider that a win. Would still defo says its one of the best sci/fi franchises ever, and a solid recommendation.
