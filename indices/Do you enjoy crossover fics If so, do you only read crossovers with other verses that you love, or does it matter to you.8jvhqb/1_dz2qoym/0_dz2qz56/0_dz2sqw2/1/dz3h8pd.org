Honestly, as a massive SG1 fan, I would really recommend giving the show a proper watch. It's long sure at 10 season, 2 spin-offs and 3 movies, but the whole franchise never really dips in quality except arguably mid season 3 of SGA. It really is up there with the other syfy greats like ST and SW. But only if you can handle the disappointment of ending on a cliffhanger that will never be resolved.
