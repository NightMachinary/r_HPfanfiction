I love crossovers. They are literally the only thing I read 99% of the time because I always have problems finding new things to read that I like in this fandom most of the time. There are some that go together so well in some contexts with certain points of the HP universe.

Like my current favorites HP/Game of thrones <3 <3 <3 , HP/Jurassic Park Universe, HP/Pokemon, HP/Elder Scroll series especially Oblivion and Skyrim and HP/Walking Dead. Since i love MOD!Harry i read those a lot and certain bits can mesh well with almost any fandom. I even like some of the HP/Star wars fic.

It literally doesn't matter to me what the crossover is. I get introduced to other fandoms I can enjoy that way. It's the best way to explore and find something new to love about the Harry Potter universe.
