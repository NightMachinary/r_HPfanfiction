I think hp magic meshes really well with other universes. I just think that the magic traditions went down different paths of development. Like the force and HP magic. Modern Hedi and sith just don't use foci and concentrate on the pregognition and wandless magic. Hp has the pregognition too, but less developed(how do you think they dodge buldgers while riding a 100mph vekile in a three dimensional playfield or hole trying to score points.) and the wandless magic like levitation and force lighting are just not practiced (jedi undergo years of training). Dark side of the force is unfocused dark magic(both corrupt). In addition in the old EU we see things like sith alchemy and other supernatural things that could fit in the HP verse.
