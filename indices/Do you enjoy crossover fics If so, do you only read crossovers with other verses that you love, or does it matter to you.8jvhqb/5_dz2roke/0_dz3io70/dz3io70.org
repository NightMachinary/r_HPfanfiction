I don't know about the world of HP itself, but HP magic provides a great vehicle for throwing characters into other dimensions. Lots of powerful magic that can be paired with drastic mistakes to make unintended consequences. For example, breaking the time turners /just/ right, the Veil being an actual gateway, unstable rituals, etc.
