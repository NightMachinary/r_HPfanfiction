I'm not big on Harry Potter crossing over with other fandoms. The world doesn't mesh well with most other fictional worlds in my opinion. For some reason, I just love Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossovers though.

As a rule, I stay away from anything thing that crosses over with more than two fandoms. Multiple crosses are always a mess.
