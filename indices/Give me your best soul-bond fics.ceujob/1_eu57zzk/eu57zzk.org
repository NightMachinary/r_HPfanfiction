[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/][The Bonds of Blood]] is my favorite serious take on soul bonds. It explores the problems that might arise if two preteens were stuck sharing each other's thoughts and had to stay close to remain well. linkffn(5435295)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] is my favorite soul bond crack fic. The starting premise is that Harry's soul bond to Ginny gets displaced when he travels back in time, and things work out hilariously not how he expected. linkffn(4905771)

Personally I love the oneshot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12636345/1/Soulbound][Soulbond]] because of the heartbreaking way it shows the emotions of the characters. In my opinion it has some great writing, but it is slash (with no smut) and the characters are more like OCs who have the canon characters' names, so that may be a turnoff. linkffn(12636345)
