If you don't mind incest its a soul bond between Harry/His Twin sister/Gabrielle.

I am not able to explain it properly but basically Harry and his Twin latched onto each other to survive the abuse thrown at them by the dursleys and later the school since they didn't match what the students perceived the potter kids would be, they wanred out going, Gryffindor heroes, instead they got quiet, withdrawn and loyal to each other Hufflepuffs.

The two potters latched onto each other for affection and because of that a broken romance between the two happened.
