After a fashion. Not in Made From Common Clay though, I was confusing the two fics. I ment A Discordant Note.

All three fics have a very unique kind of soul bond. Not just the stereotypical ‘now we're man and wife' kind. In The Queen Who Fell To Earth it's a bond through dragons, and it's a harem fic. In Core Threads it's not really sexual at all, and in A Discordant Note it's having to do with divinity. I don't really want to say more, ‘cus I'll spoil stuff.
