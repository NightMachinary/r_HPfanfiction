Same. I actually never gave Isolation a try because i really don't like the ship. And yeah i never read non-Harry centric fics either. I really love the character the way he is. But staying in character also eliminates any crack fics which i can read. Always need to check that what i am reading is well written.

Just like you, i have given MOR a try many times...but just can't get through it. Never went past the first few chapters. (I am going to get downvoted for this) but reading it makes me cringe.
