I've seen isolation mentioned twice in the last 24 hours. Maybe on other fan fiction subs? I seem to remember enjoying it more than I expected. I'd no idea it was now at the top!

HPMOR was one of the first fanfics I followed, and it has a special place in my heart. It's written exactly the way I think. I'm a coldly rational Vulcan, according to some. My 14 year old daughter can't get into it.
