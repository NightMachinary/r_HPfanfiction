Honestly, what you like in fanfiction is going to be specific to you. I'll start reading just about anything (unless it has tags that I know I'm not up for) and if I don't like it after a while, I stop (unless someone has given me a really compelling reason that it gets better at a specific point).

I read a lot of MOR. Like at least 60 chapters. It's still not for me.

Isolation is a classic Dramione fic. It hit at a very popular time and has had a lasting effect. Is it the best Dramione fic or even the best romance fic? I would say no. But what's great to me may not be what you want out of a certain type of fic.

That was a super long-winded way of saying, try a few chapters of anything that seems interesting or is recommended, but don't feel bad for giving up on something that you're not enjoying - it's not required middle school reading. Literature/fanfiction/art are subjective and it's about what will work for you (but don't limit your options).
