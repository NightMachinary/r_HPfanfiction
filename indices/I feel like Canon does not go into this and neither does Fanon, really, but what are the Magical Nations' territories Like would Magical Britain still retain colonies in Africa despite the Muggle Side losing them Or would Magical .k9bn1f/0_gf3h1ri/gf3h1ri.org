Yes, the administration of the Wizarding World seems to differ from the Muggle world. For example, Transylvania has a Quidditch team (according to book 4), while Charlie Weasley works with dragons in Romania, and Hungary also appears as an independent entity in the Cursed Child. These three entities were never independent at the same time in the Muggle world.
