Obviously JKR didn't say very clearly one way or other, so we are free to believe what we want. One is that Magical nations just follow the fate of their Muggle counterparts. Simple, and it makes a lot of sense to me.

Or they got stuck in 1692, but it won't work. With the proportion of 5000 Muggles to one wizard/witch (which is roughly how Rowlings number seem to turn out), you get some nations certainly under the level of self-sustaining number (200 Czechs, and that was one of the biggest states in the Holy Roman Empire and one of second class bigger nations in Europe), so there has to be some kind of whole-Empire Magical unification.
