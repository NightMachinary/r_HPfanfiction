Magical Borders are a fun thing to worldbuild with. Really the fun thing is to just decide whether you feel the wizarding population would go along with the muggles or not. Split and unify countries as needed. My favorite is the creation of the United Nordic Commonwealth, a magical country whose territory is composed of the muggle countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, whose magical populations opposed the Christianization of their lands and began a slow separation from their muggle counterparts centuries before the start of the Statute of Secrecy.
