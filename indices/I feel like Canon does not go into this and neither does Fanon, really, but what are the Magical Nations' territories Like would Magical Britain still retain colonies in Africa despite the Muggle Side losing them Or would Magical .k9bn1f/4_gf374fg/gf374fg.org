I think government can be different from muggle counterparts. So nations in wizarding world can contain more than one muggle nation. And muggle nations can contain more than one wizarding nation.

That being said, UK has like 20k wizarding population in HP... Surely closer to 10k a couple of centuries earlier. No way they control their territory and other across the globe with that. I guess wizarding nations would be domestic.
