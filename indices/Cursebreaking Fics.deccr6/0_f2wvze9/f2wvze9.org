I've written two stories centred on Curse-Breakers. The first focuses on squib Petunia raiding tombs for Gringotts with Bill Weasley (and dealing with the war, and raising her nephew), the second is the sequel, focused on Harry, Ron and Hermione having become Curse-Breakers after Hogwarts and searching for Atlantis.
