Yeah, I let people shame me into feeling like I had to view Snape as an irredeemably vile and stalkerish character or else I was a vile person by default, but I finally had to admit I just didn't see it that way. When you stop and think of it on a more human level it's a more complex and depressing scenario than just some stalker who didn't get what he wanted. Also, the role of a spy who is on both inner circles of two opposing groups is a whole other level of mind fuckery. Snape just had a really shitty run of life, and sure a lot of it was from his own bad decisions, but that doesn't mean he can't ever feel remorse for ruining what was most important to him.
