While I've never applied the "gay" idea to this thought, I've always been a bit sad that more people don't give any weight to the role that true friendship and guilt would play in just royally fucking someone in the head for the rest of their lives. It doesn't have to be romantic, there are other psychological reasons for someone to not be able to move past something. The whole "Snape was an incel" movement is flawed in my opinion. Feeling like you killed the only family or friend you had is far worse mentally than most people might be able to imagine, and doesn't quite equal the same thing as feeling upset that you didn't get to bang a person before they got married and/or died, or being angry that they picked someone else and not you.
