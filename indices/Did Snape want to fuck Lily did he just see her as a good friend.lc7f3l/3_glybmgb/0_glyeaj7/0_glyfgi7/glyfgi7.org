Mostly because of the way he never got over Lily's death. I always thought if he had a crush on her or if he loved her that he would eventually get over her loss. But if he thought of her as a sister he would always mourn her loss. But I'm probably being an idiot. I'm autistic so most normal human behaviors are extremely confusing to me. I know most people seem to think he was hopelessly in love with her, and they find it romantic that he never moved on, but I can't see him being that irrational. But that's me and I'm thoroughly weird.
