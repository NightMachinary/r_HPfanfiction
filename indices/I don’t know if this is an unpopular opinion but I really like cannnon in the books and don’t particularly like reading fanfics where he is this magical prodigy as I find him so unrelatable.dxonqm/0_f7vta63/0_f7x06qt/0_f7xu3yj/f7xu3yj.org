Maybe it's the disconnect of book 6?

It was my least favorite of the series. It's like Harry was dumbed down. For 3 books before that one he has been training. In 3 he learns the pantronus because of the dementors. In 4 he learns to survive. In 5 he teaches others how to fight. What does he do in 6? Takes trips down memory lane with Dumbledore and ineffectualy spyes on Draco. If he was proactive about it he could. Have found him in a month with the magical map that can see everyone in most of the castle and can see through polyjuice

For me book 6 Harry contradicted a lot of Harry's character from before
