  Have found him in a month with the magical map that can see everyone in most of the castle and can see through polyjuice

The Map can't see inside the RoR. That's why he had to employ Dobby and Kreacher. And he staked outside the RoR/hidden things. He just couldn't get inside and didn't know the RoH even existed until around May.
