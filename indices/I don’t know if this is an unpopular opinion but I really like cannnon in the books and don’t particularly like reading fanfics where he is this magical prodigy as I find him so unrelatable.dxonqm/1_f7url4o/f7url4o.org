I don't need Harry to be a super genius or a prodigy, but I also don't want to read "close to canon characterization as possible" because, to be honest, few of those have actually gotten it right. Either because they don't truly know what Harry is like in canon and/or because keeping close to canon requires a canon level idiot ball. Forging the Sword is probably the best of the bunch, but even that's a training montage to improve the trio.

But also why must a character be completely relatable to enjoy them? I adore canon Harry. I relate to him being a lazy, antisocial, sarcastic little brat. I don't relate to him being a wealthy, magical Jesus with a Jesus-esque capacity for forgiveness and love. I love Bellatrix. No part of her is relatable to me. I can't stand Hermione, but I relate to being a condescending know-it-all with large front teeth. Really all I'm asking for is well written and Harry centric.
