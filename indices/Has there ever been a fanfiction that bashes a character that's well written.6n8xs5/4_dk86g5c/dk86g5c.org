There really aren't any good bashing fics, because bashing is by definition over the top senseless hatred on a certain character.

I'm guessing what your looking for is more like a character being seen in negative light by the MC and thus having their faults be far more noticeable and relevant. Perhaps slightly exaggerated but still keeping it at reasonable levels.

Fics that come to mind like that: linkffn(11446957) and linkffn(6254783) In them you can see that authors are trying to get rid of Ron and Hermione but also tries to keep it somewhat plausible and realistic.
