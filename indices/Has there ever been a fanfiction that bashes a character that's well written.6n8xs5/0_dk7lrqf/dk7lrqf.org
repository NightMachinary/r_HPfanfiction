If I remember right, Core Threads linkffn(10136172) may count, some very light bashing of Ron, but it's more that he's just a kid with the maturity of one that wants to be friends with Harry at first, than anything else.

Also it could be considered bashing of Dumbledore, very loosely, in that he goes from slightly offbeat into full on insanity, but still somehow competent.

I think that's the problem really, bashing of characters that is written well and still makes them feel like real people to some extent is subtle rather than right in your face, so much so that it hardly counts as bashing at all.
