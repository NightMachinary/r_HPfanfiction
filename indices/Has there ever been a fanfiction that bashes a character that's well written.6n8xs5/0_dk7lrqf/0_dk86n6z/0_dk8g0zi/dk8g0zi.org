  The insane Dumbledore is not inconsistent with canon
#+end_quote

He speaks far less, and he hides a plot device in a cabbage instead of, you know, giving it to anyone or doing anything about it, probably making fun of the snitch thing, amping it to 11.

That's inconsistent with canon I'd say.

I thought it was bashing his offbeatness at the very least, or rather it at least could have been, who knows, you/I'd have to ask the author to know for sure.
