In the early books (which are the time frame for /Core Threads/), when does Dumbledore speak a lot outside of the "Dumbledore Explains It All" scenes? His start-of-term speech in /Philosopher's Stone/ is literally four words long. And I don't think the "hiding MacGuffin in cabbage" thing is unthinkable for Canon Dumbledore, though that's of course a debatable point, as long as no actual risk was incurred by putting in the cabbage. And chances are there were quite a few protective spells on this cabbage, just in case. I don't think it's essentially different from the Stone-in-Snitch thing, or from putting Baby Harry on the Dursleys' doorstep without even knocking as though he was a bottle of milk or something.
