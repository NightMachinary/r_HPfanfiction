In canon Harry hates Snape and Malfoy, but Malfoy and Snape aren't bashed, because JK Rowling doesn't hate them. Bashing has nothing to do with a story and everything to do with an author projecting.

You can make traditionally liked characters into antagonists. You can make the protagonist just not like someone. You can do all of this without bashing. You say you like well written bashing, but that is an oxymoron. Bashing is an indicator of poor writing. Either the author couldn't handle proper characterization or they're just using a character, or the narration as a mouth piece to voice their opinions. Both of which are bad writing.
