Well, if you define "bashing" as "without merit", then you aren't going to be able to find an example of bashing that has merit, are you? But that's not an argument, that's a tautology.

If you define "bashing" as "exaggerating or distorting a canon character's faults, often to the point of parody," then you're still leaving room for enjoyable fiction that uses bashing. Personal taste in fiction is all very subjective, not so?

So to answer the OP's question: sure, there's all kinds of well-written parody that uses "bashing", but from the way you've asked you don't seem interested in parody. I guess it comes down to how much you dislike a given character's set of canon traits to determine how much exaggeration you can tolerate and still enjoy an otherwise well-written story. Kind of hard to gauge that from your question.

Me, for example, I dislike canon Dumbledore a lot and find a lot of behavior from canon Ron, Molly and Minerva annoying, so I can tolerate quite a bit of "bashing" of those characters if the writing is good, the other characters are solid, or the plot is interesting or amusing. Your tastes appear to be different, which is fine.
