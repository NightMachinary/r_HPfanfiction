I mean, the best list overall is probably this ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c97t8l/harryfleur_all_of_it/]]) as there hasn't really been much since that.

Personally, I'd say my favourites are When A Veela Cries, His Angel, A Beautiful Lie, The Lie I've Lived, Allure Immune Harry, Ingenio ab Artifex, Mistakes and Second Chances, Harry Potter and the Scienra Cwena, Deprived, and The Half Blood Romantic.

Heart and Soul is alright, but the sudden Christianity and incredible amount of redundant verbiage really switches me off it. One of those fics that could be half the size and be bettered for it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul]]
