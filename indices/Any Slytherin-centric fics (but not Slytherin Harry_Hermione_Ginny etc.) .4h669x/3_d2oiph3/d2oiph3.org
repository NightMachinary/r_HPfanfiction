Did anyone ever actually write that plot bunny where Montague was picked as school champion by the goblet of fire? I really wanted to read it.

Also, linkffn(Hogwarts houses divided) has one of my all time favorite slytherin characters, and then there's a flashback where she gets sorted into slytherin. Very possibly my favorite single scene in all of fanfiction. This fic spreads its attention around to all the houses, though, so I don't know if it's what you're looking for.
