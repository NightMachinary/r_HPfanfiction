This, hell I don't even ask that you don't have the stations. Just that if you are going to use them, don't write them. I can't remember the names, but I do remember enjoying several stories throughout the year that just skip over that, and only write about the changes. Chapter 1 would be in first year a bit, maybe ending around Christmas, and then chapter 2 might be during year 2 with like two lines of text stating something like "Harry was enjoying his first night back at Hogwarts, looking forward to his second year. Hopefully without Quirrel, this year would end on a more typical note" and that is it. Just a 'Hey this still happened, but you know how it went down, I am not going to bother wasting our times'
