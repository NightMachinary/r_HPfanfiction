I'll confirm that those are mine. I also have two HP/Avengers crossovers (a series, I'm early in working on a third) and I've written (yet to publish) an HP crossover with the 1960s Batman TV show. And they're all FemHarry.

I'm pointing that out because it relates to the topic here in an interesting way. A lot of people really seem to dislike changing Harry's gender. "Why bother? What does it accomplish?" they ask. Fair questions. But then again, it's just as fair to ask that about any change.

Why change anything? To create a different story. Because the writer thinks that the differences will be interesting and hopes that others will as well.

Personally, I don't think there are nearly enough strong, leading female characters. Even Hermione tends to be a "support" character, doing research while Harry (and sometimes Ron) are "out there," acting, doing, etc. So I think that the gender change is interesting - one with a lot of potentially interesting consequences, even if some are small. There is also the fact that there are few truly new HP plots, but changing Harry's gender is a big enough change that even an "old" idea has a bit of new life in it (if done well, naturally).

Why do so many writers re-use the "stations of canon"? Why re-use anything? Not many send Harry to an original magical school, and I'll admit that I usually skip those - I prefer the familiarity of Hogwarts. So it's easy to understand if others also prefer the familiarity of other elements of canon.

Clearly, some really, /really/ prefer the familiarity of a male Harry, to the point where a female Harry almost seems offensive to them. I'll admit that I sometimes wonder what lies behind such extreme reactions, but I can't exactly object to someone (writer or reader) preferring something familiar. We all do.

But we all also focus on different things for what we want as "familiar." Preferring the familiarity of Hogwarts isn't better or worse than preferring the familiarity of some major canon events, or something else.

I find it very interesting that we have a person here complaining about a lack of sufficient divergence from canon, but I've seen complaints here about too much divergence from canon as well. How many times have people complained "there is no magical core in canon!" And that's just one example.

Stories are better when they engage our imaginations and make us care about the characters. A story that rehashes a lot of canon won't likely do that for me, but it might for someone else who has read less fanfiction. If so, then it's not a bad story... it's just not one that I much enjoy.

Personal preferences aren't objective standards.
