  Prefering fanfiction that diverges more rather than less from canon isn't bad. But it's not superior.

But if your Harry is a Jasmine and yet everything happens the same way it did in the universe where Harry was a Harry then yes, that is objectively bad writing. Sure, it's something we overlook because it's fanfiction, but it's /still/ objectively bad writing (along with writing a story with no conflict whatsoever, unsatisfying MacGuffins, deus/diabolos ex machinas, setting and forgetting Chekhov's guns, and other failings of plot).

I'm talking about people who /use the same goddamn lines from the book. Lifted. Wholesale/. Ffs at least try and imagine how else the dialogue could go.
