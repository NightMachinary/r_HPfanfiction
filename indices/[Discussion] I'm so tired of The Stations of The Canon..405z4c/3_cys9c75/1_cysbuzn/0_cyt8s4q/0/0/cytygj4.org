It's called "shifting the goalposts." It's unhelpful to change the nature of your complaint to something more easily defensible as soon as the original, less defensible complaint is challenged. If you find yourself unable to properly defend the original complaint, it's better to say so then modify your position.

Since I'm sure you aren't doing that deliberately, I'll just ignore the modified complaint and stick to the original.

  And yet that is what many fanfiction authors do.

Oh? And don't you mean 95%, since, you know, that was what your original complaint was?

While I'm sure it's done by some, I haven't seen it being done by as many as you complain about. Surely it couldn't be the case that other people's preferences upset you so much that you're magnifying the issue.

True. And is the problem as great as you make it? I, personally, haven't spent any time studying the issue to determine if those new writers who do this turn out to learn less and write more poorly over time - in other words, fail to improve. You have, right? I mean, you're not just pulling this claim out of your nether regions? I mean you have /evidence/, and not just a vague guess based on your own sense of outrage that others aren't writing things that you want to read?

Somehow, I doubt it.

I get it, you aren't entertained by a story that sticks more rather than less to "stations of canon."

Others seem to be. So what?

Lots of things don't entertain me, but I don't complain about that. I don't complain that others spend their time creating things that they like instead of things that I like, so I'm honestly confused about why you would.

  I mean, it's probably fine if you just want to write fanfiction and fanfiction only

I'll bet there are quite a few people like that. Doesn't change the fact that sticking more rather than less closely to "stages of canon" may help them focus on and improve other aspects of their writing, regardless of whether they go on to anything else. And if they enjoy what they are writing, what does it matter if you aren't entertained by it?

Your rant is all about you - what you like, what you can stomach, etc. If actually does matter to you whether others are growing and improving as writers, spend more time helping them by showing them how they can move past canon. I'm sure some will appreciate it.

And if it's simply a matter of you not liking what others are writing, go write your own. That's what I did, and I'm better off for it.
