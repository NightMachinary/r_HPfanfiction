  It's called "shifting the goalposts."

  Oh? And don't you mean 95%, since, you know, that was what your original complaint was?

Sure, don't actually, you know, address the meat of my comment. /They may throw in a new scene, or add a new interaction, or a (shudder) shopping trip to Diagon Alley, but when they reach a Station it's practically a guarantee that the characters involved will say and do the same thing no matter what has been changed about the story./ That is /literally/ what The Stations of the Canon trope is, which by the way is an established trope that I did not come up with. If you were interested in what my complaint actually was, there was a link provided for you in the post. But sure, call it "shifting the goalposts" when you mean "I'm ignorant of what your position actually is so I'm just gonna make an assumption".

  True. And is the problem as great as you make it? I, personally, haven't spent any time studying the issue to determine if those new writers who do this turn out to learn less and write more poorly over time - in other words, fail to improve. You have, right? I mean, you're not just pulling this claim out of your nether regions? I mean you have evidence, and not just a vague guess based on your own sense of outrage that others aren't writing things that you want to read?

Of course, I just pulled the fact using bad techniques in while learning a skill will lead to the formation of bad habits and an overall deficiency in craft straight out of my ass :) Never mind that learning to write /better/ invariably involves discarding said bad techniques.

  Your rant is all about you - what you like, what you can stomach, etc. If actually does matter to you whether others are growing and improving as writers, spend more time helping them by showing them how they can move past canon. I'm sure some will appreciate it.

Yeah, let's just skip the part of my post that mentions parts of canon that can be skipped, and my comments in this very thread about alternates to canon. But hey, you have a point and you're sticking to it, don't let me get in your way :)))
