  Sure, don't actually, you know, address the meat of my comment.
#+end_quote

I did. The first time. That was when you shifted the goalposts to complain about something more extreme. First you complain about repeating major canon plot points, then you shift to "everything happens the same way it did."

#+begin_quote
  That is literally what The Stations of the Canon trope is
#+end_quote

No, actually, it's not. Funny how you imply that I didn't follow your link and read the article when, in reality, the article says something a little different from your complaint.

There are two major differences that I'll highlight. First, the article doesn't say anything about "the characters involved will say and do the same thing no matter what has been changed about the story." The article is only about hitting the "iconic moments" that a fandom is familiar with. This is actually what I focused on in my first comment, pointing out the appeal of familiarity and how using canon structure may help an inexperienced writer.

Second, the article is quite explicit that a fic which has this trope is /not/ automatically a bad one, as you are trying to say.

Explicit.

I'll quote: "These events tend to be quite fixed, and thus they can, when done poorly, come across as merely crossing over The Stations Of The Canon, rather than an actual plot, which is where this trope gets its name." The phrase "when done poorly" means that it can be done... not poorly. It can at least be mediocre. Perhaps even well! Wow.

Even better: "Fanfiction stories can play this trope reasonably straight and still be good stories."

Huh, "good stories."

So I think I understand what your position is. I can even see where it diverges from the article you linked to for alleged support. And I disagree quite strongly with your blanket condemnation of such fics. When I gave reasons for my disagreement, you didn't engage them directly; instead, you altered your complaint to something more extreme that was easier to defend and which my critiques didn't really address anymore.

Shifting the Goalposts.

Which is why I dismiss the later and more extreme complaint about writers who change nothing, not even dialogue, and instead focus on the original complaint about hitting the main, iconic plot events over and over. You know, the trope you linked to.

I can understand getting bored with stories that use it. I can understand regarding them as being less creative than stories that don't. What I don't accept is your blanket condemnation and implicit attitude that you're somehow superior to all those who don't reject them.

Because I can also understand why some, readers and writers, are attracted to the familiarity of those iconic moments - and that such people are not in any fashion inferior to you because of it. I can also recognize that different people have different ideas about what is an "acceptable" divergence from canon - and that others aren't inferior to you because of that difference.

Reusing the same old troll scene isn't inherently better or worse than reusing the same old Hogwarts or same old gender.

  I just pulled the fact using bad techniques in while learning a skill
#+end_quote

Except that you failed to establish that we're talking about an inherently bad technique. You claimed it is, linked to an article that actually /disagrees/ with you, then used the claim that the technique leads to deficiencies as evidence that it's a bad technique.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, let's just skip the part of my post that mentions parts of canon that can be skipped, and my comments in this very thread about alternates to canon.
#+end_quote

Oh, I'm not skipping it. You may not have noticed, but you utterly failed to offer your suggestions to any of the people who are committing the horrible sins you are complaining about. Telling someone on Reddit who vaguely or even completely agrees with you about how other, unidentified writers could improve their unidentified stories does not, in any remote sense of the words, qualify as "helping them by showing them how they can move past canon."

If you cared about helping them, you'd be directing helpful, constructive comments directly to them. Instead you wrote a self-serving rant about how your desires aren't being fulfilled by others who are writing what they enjoy and are comfortable with. The former would be great, but I don't find myself to be very sympathetic with the latter.

To sum up: contrary to the complaints made here, Stations of the Canon does not automatically cause a story to be bad. Ergo, writing such a story doesn't automatically make someone inferior, and liking such a story doesn't automatically make someone inferior. There's no evidence that it creates bad habits or causes a person to become deficient as a writer, but the presence of a pre-built plot structure might help a person getting started with writing. At the very least, it might help them write something they like, even if they never write another thing. Finally, it represents a set of familiar elements that are just a few of many, many familiar elements from canon, and everyone has different preferences when it comes to what familiar elements they're willing to see changed.
