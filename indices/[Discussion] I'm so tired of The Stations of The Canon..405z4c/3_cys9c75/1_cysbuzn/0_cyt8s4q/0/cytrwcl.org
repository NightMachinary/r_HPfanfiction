  Except your post wasn't a complaint about everything being the same; rather, it's about all the major events being the same - the "Stations of Canon."

...and?

  A person who changes absolutely nothing, not even dialogue, isn't actually writing that much themselves. It's less creative and original, and I wouldn't likely bother reading very far in such a story.

And yet that is what many fanfiction authors do. They may throw in a new scene, or add a new interaction, or a (/shudder/) shopping trip to Diagon Alley, but when they reach a Station it's practically a guarantee that the characters involved will say and do the same thing no matter what has been changed about the story.

  And as a relatively new writer (for fiction), I definitely won't look down on someone who still depends on such crutches or training wheels. Maybe you don't, but others do. The fact that they are trying is great, and I wish them the best of luck.
#+end_quote

And not all training wheels are made equal. Not all training wheels are helpful in learning a skill, and some actively hinder it. This is one such.

I mean, it's probably fine if you just want to write fanfiction and fanfiction only, but if you claim to be using it to grow as a[n original] writer then explicitly engaging in plot fails is not a crutch so much as it is a stumbling block. Like bad grammar/style, it doesn't /aid/ your craft, it /hampers/ it.
