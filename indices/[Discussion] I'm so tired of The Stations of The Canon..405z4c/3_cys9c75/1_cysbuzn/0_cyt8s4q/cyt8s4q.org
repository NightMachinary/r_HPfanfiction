Except your post wasn't a complaint about /everything/ being the same; rather, it's about all the major events being the same - the "Stations of Canon."

A person who changes absolutely nothing, not even dialogue, isn't actually writing that much themselves. It's less creative and original, and I wouldn't likely bother reading very far in such a story. However, I'm sure that a person with less experience writing (I have written a tremendous amount of nonfiction) might need a lot more in the way of training wheels. So while I might not think much of such a story, I can easily understand the need to start out that way.

And that's not even what I had in mind with my pervious post - I was simply referring to someone who hits the main "stations of canon" - troll in the bathroom, blood quills, etc. These are the events that shift the canon plot into one direction or another. Creating such big events isn't easy for new writers. Creating a new plotline that takes new major events into account is harder. So, I hae quite a lot of tolerance for writers who feel a need to depend on them when learning how to write. And I can understand some readers preferring their familiarity.

The fact that you've grown past reading such stories is great. Good for you. Others haven't, and I won't look down on them.

And as a relatively new writer (for fiction), I definitely won't look down on someone who still depends on such crutches or training wheels. Maybe you don't, but others do. The fact that they are trying is great, and I wish them the best of luck.
