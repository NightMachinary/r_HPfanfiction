I'll bet this bothers you because of how often you've read such stories, over and over, yeah?

Well, not everyone has read as much or for as long as you. Right this minute, there are bunches of people starting fanfiction - as readers or writers - who are in the same place you were a few years ago. Is it somehow "wrong" that they go through the same process you did?

Of course not. That would be silly. Your tastes have evolved and matured; their's have not. That doesn't make your preferences better or their preferences worse.

Some readers will always prefer stories that adhere more closely to canon because it's more familiar to them. They aren't too adventurous. So what?

As for writers, well fanfiction is rather analogous to having training wheels for creative fiction writing. Someone else has done all the hard work of creating characters, backstory, worlds, etc. A new writer can change as little or as much as they want - whatever they feel comfortable with - and thereby get practice in writing without it being quite as hard.

Hey, that's great! I know it helped me. My first story was the first fiction I'd written in decades. It was short, and I didn't change much (not much happened, so not much to change). I did some things wrong and some things right, but I just re-read it and I think it's pretty darn good. The sequel changed more, got different things right and wrong, and is better. The next sequel is even better... and changes more things while keeping others. To reference your rant, there's still a trial, but it goes differently; Umbridge still gets into school, but not as Defense professor and her attempt to use a blood quill... doesn't go quite as planned.

For some people, like you, I might be keeping too much. For others, maybe I'm changing too much. The fact that my main character is a female Harry is a change that some /hate/ - they're more put off by Harry being Jasmine than you likely are by the presence of Umbridge. Neither group is "right" - what's "right" is that I had the freedom to change what I felt comfortable with as I developed my ability to write fiction.

Prefering fanfiction that diverges more rather than less from canon isn't bad. But it's not superior.
