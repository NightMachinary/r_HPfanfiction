Oh, yes. I hate it when a story remains on the canon rails. Especially since those rails are built with plot holes and characters turned into plot devices. If I wanted to read the same story, I'd re-read the canon books.

First time I used Umbridge in one of my stories, she was dealt with (sort of) on the day of her first detention for Harry back at school, simply because that made the most sense given the situation (a Dumbledore who actually did the right thing, not the easy thing.)
