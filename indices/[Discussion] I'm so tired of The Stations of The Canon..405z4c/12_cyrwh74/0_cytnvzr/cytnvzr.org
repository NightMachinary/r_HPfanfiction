  Oh, yes. I hate it when a story remains on the canon rails. Especially since those rails are built with plot holes and characters turned into plot devices.

That's beside the point. Would it be any better to rehash the plot if /Harry Potter/ were some flawless "rationalist" story with highly detailed and internally consistent worldbuilding? Frankly, I think that the incongruity of the exact same things happening despite changes to characters and preceding events would stick out even more.
