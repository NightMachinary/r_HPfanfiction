I don't know... You've got to separate Canon characters (their initial states, anyway), Canon setting elements (e.g., Hogwarts, how magic works), and Canon events.

"CwC" with respect to the first often indicates that the character is probably going to have a lot of In Name Onlys and bashing; or OCs, but that's much harder to pull off well.
