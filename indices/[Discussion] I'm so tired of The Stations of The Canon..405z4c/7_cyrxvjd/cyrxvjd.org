One of the reasons I like linkffn(harry potter and the masters ball) so much is that they use those events when they fit and ditch them when they don't. So the Triwizard Tournament happens but has 7 schools and 4 events, Quirrel happens pretty much the same but Sirius isn't in jail, Pettigrew is dead and not a traitor and so Book 3 is completely different.
