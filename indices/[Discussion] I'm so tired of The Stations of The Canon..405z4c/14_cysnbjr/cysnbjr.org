Yeah this is my one complaint with this otherwise fantastic [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/111713][Jily Lives AU series]] - recent chapters have tried to shoehorn canon events beyond the point of plausibility into what was previously a story not afraid to break canon!

If you're looking for wildly veering away from canon, I can recommend the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl AU]]. So far I've made my way through the first fic, and it definitely delivered on that end.
