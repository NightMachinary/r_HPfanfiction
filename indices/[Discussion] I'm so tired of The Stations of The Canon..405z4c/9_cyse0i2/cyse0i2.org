Really good authors don't fall into that trap. They may use some canon events to get started, but then let story develop on its own.

For example, if Harry was smart enough to get Sirius exonerated by year 3, then he should also be able to use Marauder's Map more effectively and work out Crouch Jr's deception. Or if a real smart Harry faced off Umbridge, he would either manipulate her to his advantage and/or eliminate her when she stepped over the line.
