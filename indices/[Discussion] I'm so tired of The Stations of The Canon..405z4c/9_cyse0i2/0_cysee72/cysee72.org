Oh my God, don't let me get started on Sirius. So, so many fics have him exonerated by third or even second or first year, yet he'll sit around twiddling his thumbs until the events of OotP where he'll end up in the Ministry somehow. Also the Ministry and wizarding public at large go from conservative to just plain stupid, ignoring the plainly laid out, painted-all-over-Diagon-Alley evidence of Voldemort's return for ever and ever.
