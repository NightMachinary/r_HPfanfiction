Yes. This is one of the things I hate most about fanfiction.

I think that the insistence by so many authors to keep themselves anchored to the canon ideas are why I'm getting progressively more fucked off with fanfiction as a whole. Day in, day out, I feel like I'm reading the same exact stuff, I'm sick of it. I feel like if I tried reading /canon/ I would get sick of it.

At this point, if I'm reading a fic and it happens to feature a magic school as a prominent location, I back out of it, even if it's a universally acclaimed fic like Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. I legitimately can't make myself interested in it.

As a result, it's been near enough a year since I've taken a fic to completion. I might as well just move to another fandom.
