Yes, this is the single most frustrating thing that I've encountered in the fanfic genre. I know that the authors don't owe anyone anything --- especially when the stories they write are both free and at least partially meant as a means for self-improvement.

And still, I can't even begin to describe how annoying and frustrating what you're ranting about is without using some really mean and derogatory language aimed at such writers.

It especially pisses me off when an author explains their badly designed plot structure by things like “destiny”, “fixed events in time”, or any other similar flavours of bullshit.
