I think you overestimate the amount of worldbuilding needed. I'd say it's far more work trying to conform to canon (especially if you have to look at secondary material like Pottermore and interviews) than creating your own. It certainly was easier to create a pureblood culture for "Patron" using the real world as an inspiration for religion and politics.
