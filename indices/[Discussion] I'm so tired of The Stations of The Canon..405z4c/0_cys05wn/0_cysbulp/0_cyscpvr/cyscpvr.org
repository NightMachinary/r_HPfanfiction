It takes much less creative effort to look something up on Pottermore or in the books (usually accompanied by copying the entire related passage and tweaking it a little if at all) than it does to come up with consistent worldbuilding that you'll have to justify to your readers. By extension, it's easier to get away with flimsy excuses or none at all for your worldbuilding choices if your plot is hitting all the same beats as canon, because [most] readers do show up to read /Harry Potter/ after all. It ultimately doesn't matter if your world makes no sense at all, the same things are going to happen anyway.
