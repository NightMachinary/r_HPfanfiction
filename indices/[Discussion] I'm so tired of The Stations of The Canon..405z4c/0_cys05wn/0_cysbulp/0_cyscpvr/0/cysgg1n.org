Reading this reminded me that when I first started reading ffn, I wanted Canon compliant stories, with either missing moments types or 8th year fics. But over the course of a year of heavy reading, I've transitioned to hating fics that force the stations of Canon, and preferring fics that mostly ignore Canon events.

Its probably since there are only so many rewrites of the same plot you can read, when the only difference is who harry/hermione are kissing and whether the weasleys/Dumbledore are evil
