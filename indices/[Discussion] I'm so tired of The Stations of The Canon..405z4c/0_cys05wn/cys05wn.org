Willing to take the butterfly effect into account is something few writers do because it /multiplies/ the amount of work required for worldbuilding and planning.

For people that write fanfiction for fun, perhaps that's not very appealing. They just want to write; not spend half their time worldbuilding and planning.

It's a shame, because I absolutely love fics that manage to abandon the Stations of Canon, and go after their own thing. linkffn(Emperor; Wit of the Raven) - things like that (but those /start/ very AU).
