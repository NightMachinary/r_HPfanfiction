  Harry doesn't have to meet Draco or Ron before Hogwarts
#+end_quote

But he has to meet Hermione, of course? ;-) But seriously why shouldn't Draco meet Harry before Hogwarts? In canon Draco is actively seeking out Harry in the Hogwarts Express. The only way to avoid this is by having an AU where Draco is dead or Harry isn't someone famous or famous enough to warrant a visit from Draco.

I personally want changes that makes sense in AUs, I certainly don't want changes for the sake of having changes. So I think Stations of the Canon has its place in AUs. More so in AUs where you're focusing on plot irrelevant characters such as Slytherin!Ron stories but in those stories "The Stations of Canon" are happening in the background, which is totally fine IMO.
