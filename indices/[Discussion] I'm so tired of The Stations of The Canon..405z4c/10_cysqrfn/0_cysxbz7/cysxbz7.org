  "The Stations of Canon" are happening in the background
#+end_quote

Happening in the background is fine, but it's the fics where they don't /and/ they're almost word-for-word exactly what happens in canon.

And a story with Slytherin!Ron should alter the Stations. He wouldn't be there to help with the troll, if he isn't friends with Harry then that's going to have /huge/ effects on the canon story, and POA would be different. (Everyone's going to wonder why the hell Sirius is breaking into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, the whole Hallowe'en scene would go different because Slytherin doesn't even have a portrait, and without someone like Neville writing down passwords then Sirius is going to have an even harder time getting into their common room.)

Admittedly, I do kind of agree with the your point about meeting Draco pre-Hogwarts. I get what OP and other people are complaining about, but I do think there are some things that are going to remain the same even in AUs, unless a character has specific reason not to do something or to do it different. Draco will probably always seek out Harry on the train and he'll probably always be in Madam Malkins if Harry goes to Diagon Alley on his birthday. (But in AU's why not have Harry go there on a different day, and their interactions will be different, which can affect later events, and if Draco learns who Harry is then he might decide not to seek him out on the train later.) The troll has come up a lot as something that makes eyes roll, but it's one of the things I think would always happen because (unless your fic is Quirrell-centric and you're writing him more intelligently or otherwise OOC to canon) there's no reason he /wouldn't/ let it into the castle--though I do agree that what happens once it's inside can change, and if it doesn't then we don't need to hear about it except in passing.
