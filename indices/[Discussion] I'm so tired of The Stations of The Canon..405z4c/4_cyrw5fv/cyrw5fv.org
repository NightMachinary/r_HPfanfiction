Brilliant. Stories that have the goblins instantly supply Harry with lore-breaking plot devices, unimaginable wealth, or respect he hasn't earned are truly awful.

That being said, I think your rant is best suited to cover long pieces that attempt to change a single facet of a character or relationship. Some of the best stories don't do this and are instead merely missing moments in alternate universes (e.g. linkffn(Screams Part One by cloneserpents)). But this probably falls under your disclaimer of the 1% of fics that avoid this problem.
