This is part of the reason why all my fics are either wildly AU, or take place post-Hogwarts, or are both. That way I don't feel as constrained by canon and can do (almost) whatever I want.

I think canon rehash is a problem that comes with the nature of writing FF in general: you're taking someone else's world, characters, and plots, and absorbing them into your own. Even if you write a very good fic, it's unlikely that you're becoming a better storyteller, because you're using another person's ideas. And when you're doing that, it's naturally difficult to make an original plot while still satisfying the "pillars" of canon that your readers want: a cohesive world that stays true to canon, all your characters to stay in-character, etc. That's pretty hard to do; I'd say it might even be harder than just going off and creating your own universe and doing your own thing, because now you have to both be original (plotwise) and copy the author (by staying within canon rules, and keeping characters true to their canon selves).

Most fanfic writers aren't that skilled, so they end up employing what I like to call the "Telltale Effect", after Telltale Games' method of storytelling: no matter what little changes they make to the plot or world, it always leads to the same endpoint, which, in broad strokes is what JK gave to us in canon. They do this because it's easy, and it's rewarding: you put in very little work (like have Harry embarrass a professor in class by showing his Ã¼ber-knowledge, when he would just sit and wait for the period to end, like a normal person, in canon), and then a bunch of readers emotionally fellate you for "making Harry a badass" and everyone ignores the fact that everything that happened in canon has happened in this fic.
