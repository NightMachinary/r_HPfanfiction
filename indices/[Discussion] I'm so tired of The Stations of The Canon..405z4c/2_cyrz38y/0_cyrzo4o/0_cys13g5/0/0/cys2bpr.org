It's not just the troll event that's so overdone, it's the utter lack of consequences of it outside a friendship among three kids.

If it's a diversion used by Quirrel, one that almost got three students killed, what would Dumbledore do in response to avoid more students getting hurt or killed? Especially after Snape fingers the main suspect? How can Voldemort escape notice in the investigation that should follow?

The canon plot is full of such holes.

In one story I had the troll incident - though only as a flashback. But it wasn't done by Quirrel. And it was just about the last canon "plot point" that wasn't derailed.
