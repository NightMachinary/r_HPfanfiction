That's great too! Or if they /can't/ actually beat the troll before the teachers show up, or if Harry and Ron split up on their search so only one of them finds Hermione, or if Hermione doesn't warm up to them immediately, or even if Quirrell lets some other magical creature in instead. Basically the reader shouldn't be able to skip the whole chapter and still know pretty much exactly what happened.
