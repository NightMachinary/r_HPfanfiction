At this point I'm not even looking for characters that drive the plot anymore. I don't even care if Harry, Ron and Hermione end up friends every time, just give up the whole troll-in-the-bathroom schtick already! You can work in different narrative beats without shattering canon if it's so important to you. At least just switch up the timing of things.
