I can absolutely recommend

linkffn(Brown coat; Green Eyes by nonjon)

It's one of his earlier works, and it kinda shows, especially the characters from Firefly are a bit flat, and some mistakes where he tries to be fun when it isn't fitting.

However, the worldbuilding is pulled off extremely well (I haven't seen strictly better worldbuilding tbh) the story is extremely intriguing (and it isn't obvious after Chapter 1 what the end will be) and it is definitly a fun read.

Most of the time the humor is on point and I genuinly laughed multiple times when reading it.

Also, there are multiple instances where Harry is (rightfully) regarded as Godlike.

You don't have to have watched "Firefly" (or the movie Serenity) for it (I did not during my first read), nontheless I did both and enjoyed it. Some stuff in the fic gets better after watching them, some stuff gets worse.
