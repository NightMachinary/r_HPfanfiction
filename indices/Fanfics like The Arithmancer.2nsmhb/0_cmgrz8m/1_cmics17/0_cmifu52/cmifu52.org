Well I considered that, but since students only receive a letter warning them not to practice magic at the end of the school year and Hermione mentions that she already tried a few spells before getting on the train, I'm guessing the ministry overlooks the small bit of magic they might be able to accomplish before school like they do for all the "uncontrolled" wandless magic.

Thanks for reading, it's nice hearing people's thoughts.
