I can only think of a single fic where people *drink* potions during duels, but it's not very good: linkffn(12317784).

However, I've read plenty of fics where potions (and alchemical concoctions) were used as grenades or general splash weapons/AOE attacks, like linkffn(6517567). If this second type is good too, you might wanna look into fics about Dumbledore.
