No, that's perfectly sensible way (see [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553296345]] and [[https://youtu.be/LoSnjYLw2A0]]), but you then have to collect all those written pages (or kilobytes) and throw them away. A famous Czech songwriter claimed he wrote a song every day, but then in the end of the year he took those 365 songs, and he was barely able to collect twelve good enough to be on his new LP. So, write it, but DO NOT PUBLISH all of them.
