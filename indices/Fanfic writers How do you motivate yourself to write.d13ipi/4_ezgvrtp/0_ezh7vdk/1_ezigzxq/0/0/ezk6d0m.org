If you only ever post a perfect story, you won't ever post anything. Perfection is the enemy of good enough, after all.

And by posting, you'll get feedback. Some will be the usual drivel by entitled idiots who demand everyone write according to their headcanon and decry anything they don't like as bad, but there'll be useful feedback as well.
