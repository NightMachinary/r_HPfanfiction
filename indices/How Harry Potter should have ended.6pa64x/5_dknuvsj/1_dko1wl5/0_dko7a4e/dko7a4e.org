They had same abusive childhood. Both survived AK. Both were destined to be slytherin. Both were halfbloods.

In battle of will (brother wand business) Harry and Voldemort were at stalemate.

Even at the end they both were equal in power. Harry won on technicality (which is based around a plot hole regarding ownership of elder wand).
