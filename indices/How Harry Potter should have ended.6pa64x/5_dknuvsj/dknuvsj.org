Neville is over glorified for no reason. 'OMG he killed that snake' is his only achievement in war. Let that man rest.

Breaking the elder wand was really stupid. Harry was equal to Voldemort. Nicest twist would be Harry winning that war, taking everyone powerful position (like Dumbledore) and saying 'Fuck you all for leaving me at mercy of muggles'.

It's certainly better than settling down with a fan-girl whose only redeeming quality was that her red hairs reminded Harry of his mother.
