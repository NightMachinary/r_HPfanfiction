Nah - because the person who doubted Neville most was:

NEVILLE HIMSELF (!) - sure his family layed the groundwork to that (bunch of abusive assholes, almost as bad as the Dursleys!) and people like Snape and Malfoy used that to make fun of him, but over all? He was the one who doubted his own skills (well: His father's wand "helped" (to keep him down)! His grandmother really is a bitch IMHO)

I'd really rather have had a normal hero's journey, where Harry gives his all (he might still die and only live because of Dumbledore's plan, but at least he really tried...this is what I hate most about the character: He's a stupid idealist unwilling to work for his greatness and hoping that self-sacrifice will be enough :( )
