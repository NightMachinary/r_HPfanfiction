I've found that people either go too immature with him (full on whiny arrogant child), or go too mature. It's really hard to write a teenager that has had to grow up too fast. Because he's really not an adult yet, and in the books that shows by some of his emotional reactions, and the ways that he screws things up. But he's also not 12... I think getting his mental age right is one of the hardest things to do, and many fics don't do it well...
