Yes this. Rowling said she saw him as an "old soul", I can definitely see that (while many writers do not, or are too immature themselves to relate), but at the same time he's not an old mind or an old heart. He's astoundingly mature on some subjects - many of them the ones that truly matter, like justice, love, redemption and so on - while also astonishingly impulsive, almost willful on some other matters.
