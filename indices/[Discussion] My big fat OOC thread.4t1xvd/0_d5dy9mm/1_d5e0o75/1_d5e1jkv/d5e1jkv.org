Its sort of the nature of fanfics to change the protagonist. This doesn't necessarily mean they're OOC either as long as their behavior is suppose to be different.

For instance a more aggressive Harry doesn't mean he's OOC. Unless the story starts at X point and Harry is suddenly acting differently.
