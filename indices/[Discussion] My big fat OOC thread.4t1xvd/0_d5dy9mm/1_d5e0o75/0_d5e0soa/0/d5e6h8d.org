Infuriatingly so. I love fics with her in awful pairings, like Snape or a Malfoy, but usually the quickness she turns her feelings of spite or hatred into affection is just silly. I understand that it's necessary to make the plot move onward, but it would /not/ take /one/ interaction with one of them to make her head-over-heels in love or dripping-in-her-knickers lustful.
