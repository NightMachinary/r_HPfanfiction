Harry is one of those characters that doesn't get portrayed in a certain way in the books since they are through his eyes, so we don't get a clear picture painted for us on who he is.

He's curious - but not in a Ravenclaw sort of way. He won't seek out information just for the hell of it, and almost everything he learns is just from other people. This is mostly just because he's the protagonist. As some people point out, though, sometimes he's just plain unobservant. A Harry that is motivated to do well doesn't line up with what we see in the books. I also hate when it portrays him as almost as smart as Hermione because we see him as having the same work ethic as Ron (and more similar grades too iirc).

He's angry, but you mostly see that in the 5th book because he's been bottling it up for months. You just know he's been staging arguments in his head and winning all of them while he's at the Dursleys. And he did have some anger when Carrow spat at McGonagall, that was hardly built up but I feel was more of a gut reaction. He's reckless and does things without thinking them through completely, or if he does, we don't see that thought process. He's hardly a planner. Look at the Ministry plan in book 7, which Hermione wanted to perfect but Harry felt would waste time. So a cunning Slytherin Harry doesn't make sense to me, unless he learned all of that from other Slytherins.

I think the one thing that drives Harry is his legitimate desire to see good in the world. It's not just because of his parents either. For this reason I believe dark Harry fics, by definition, are nearly always OOC. I'm sure there's one or two that would convince me but otherwise I don't want to see a Harry that goes so strongly against everything we see in the books.
