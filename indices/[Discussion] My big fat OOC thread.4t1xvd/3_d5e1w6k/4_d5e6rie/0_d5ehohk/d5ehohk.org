Yup. We see him refuse to identify Harry in Malfoy Manor. Perhaps he was afraid he would be wrong and therefore be punished, or perhaps he legitimately wanted Harry to live and defeat Voldemort so he could live normally again. Either way he was saving his own skin, although one is a more selfless interpretation than the other.
