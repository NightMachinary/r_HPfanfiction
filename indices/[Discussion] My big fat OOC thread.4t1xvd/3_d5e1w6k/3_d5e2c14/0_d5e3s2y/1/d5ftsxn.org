I think this had more to do with Draco being from a 'proper family' as Lucius hints in CS, not because of his sons intelligence.

The [[https://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy#Personality_and_traits][wiki]] gushes about Draco's intelligence, but the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html][Lexicon]] makes no mention of this imagined cleverness.
