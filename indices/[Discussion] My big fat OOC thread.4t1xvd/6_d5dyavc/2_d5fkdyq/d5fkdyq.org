I have so many opinions and thoughts on Albus, and fanon Albus. Let's see. Just like with Harry like someone said above, people tend to go to extremes with AD. Either he's pure evil, or he's really just a kindly, well-meaning old man (this one irks me in particular because it completely destroys everything that's interesting about AD, even more than the Manipulative!AD trope), or he's bat-shit crazy and senile.

He is none of those things. I see him as one of the most, if not /the/ most complicated character in the books. He's almost contradictory at times, yet he makes complete sense. Here is this charismatic genius, who grew up praised and adored by everyone he ever met, save his family (who were the only ones who knew the truth about him anyway), yet has had to keep this vital secret inside of him for all his teenage years. He's secretive and manipulative because he grew up that way, it's nearly something he cannot help at this point. His one lesson throughout adolescence was basically "keeping secrets is important and saves lives."

He used to be very arrogant - and still is, in many of his presumptions - yet he has an ultimately kind heart. He's capable of acting ruthlessly, forced by his position and power and more than anything, sense of responsibility to make some terrible choices and let horrible things happen, yet he is also fully cognizant of his deeds and regrets them deeply at the same time.

There are two things that are important to me here, regarding Dumbledore: the first is that he is (after Gellert left) no longer that person who would excuse his actions with the words "For the Greater Good", and he never really was to start with. It's a pet peeve every time someone let old!Dumbledore open his mouth and excuse some terrible thing he did with "it's for the greater good." No. Dumbledore would not say that. But the second thing is, neither would he let the cost of his decisions stop him from making them. He knew what Harry was in for when he left him on the steps of No.4, more or less, yet he deemed it necessary, and he made the call. This is, I've found, essentially what made his character so deeply morally grey - he's capable of doing some really shitty things without batting an eye, and he would not excuse it, but neither would he retract his moves because to him, it was always the "right" choice to make.

This is why, to an extent, I can believe part of the manipulative trope surrounding Albus. If he believed that shaping Harry a certain way would have helped with the war, I have no doubt that he would have done it, at least before he really met Harry and came to care for the boy more than he should. The uncertain thing here, however, is how much he really could have seen into the future and predicted the outcomes of his choices. He's scarily intelligent, yet he couldn't have been omniscient as he likes to pretend to be, and the balance here is crucial.

Another thing is that Albus, for all his appearances, is not nearly as selfless as Harry is, and he said as much himself. He's always had some powerful selfish motives that are integral to his character - they're not behind everything he does, but they've made some notable appearances in a few of his choices. The decision to keep Harry in the dark, for example, comes to mind. He refrained from telling Harry about the Prophecy out of his own selfish desire to see Harry happy. And then, the desire to atone himself and to be absolved of his crimes drove him to put on the Gaunt Ring in an astonishingly uncharacteristic bit of rashness and irrationality that eventually cost him his life.

Yet another point about Albus that fascinated me was his relationship with the boy Riddle. I never really got why he came to immediately dislike a mere eleven year old boy, it struck me as quite odd. Why, moreover, would he decide to watch this boy and thwart him in practically everything he tries to do, instead of trying to influence him in a positive manner and get him out of that hellhole he'd lived in? Two things: either Albus was truly blind to the way Muggles really are, and saw only prejudice instead of trauma and bad experience in Riddle's hatred (I wouldn't be surprised, he never truly lived in the Muggle world himself and was never quite targeted the same way - he was, in fact, targeted /because/ people suspected his father was a Muggle-hater), or, more likely he was just highly apathetic about really reaching out and helping unless he had to, until his conscience couldn't take it anymore (supported by the fact that he put off confronting Grindelwald until 1945.) Funnily enough, as much as the Diary Riddle complained of Dumbledore's meddling, Dumbledore's approach towards Riddle and Harry were in fact two extremes: Dumbledore never truly cared to help Tom Riddle, while fingerprints of his control could be seen in every step of Harry's life beginning from his birth. (It also makes me wonder if part of the reason Albus felt this guilt towards Harry was not because of the mistakes he'd came to realize he had made about Tom, making him partially responsible for Harry's miserable life, even though due to obvious reasons he couldn't have revealed his true feelings regarding that eleven year old boy he saw in the orphanage, since he cannot afford for Harry to sympathize with Voldemort more than he was already doing.)

Anyhow, piles upon piles of essays could be written about this character, that's how complex and fascinating he is, so I generally find the prevalent use of those poorly made caricatures as substitution for him in fanfiction pretty sad.
