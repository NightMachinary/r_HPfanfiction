I would not dumb him down like in canon, but make him really the force Voldemort feared. But since the Death Eaters were hardly competent, a Dumbledore true to his reputation would make the series quite boring. I would either raise Voldemort's competence or the Ministry's malice to increase the threat level.

As for 'Greater Good', that was something he rejected after falling out with Grindelwald. In the entire series, he NEVER said anything close to Harry.
