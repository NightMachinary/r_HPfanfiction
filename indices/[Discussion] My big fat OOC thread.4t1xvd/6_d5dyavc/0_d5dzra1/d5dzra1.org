Making him super manipulative. He's not some evil super genius... Yes, he manipulated people, yes he withheld information. And yes, he had his "reasons". But not all of these reasons were bad, and he couldn't have foreseen the consequences. On the flip side, making him all-knowing. He was only human. Sometimes things worked out the way he intended, sometimes they didn't. He didn't have some crazy master plan where each of his actions led to a pre-determined future.
