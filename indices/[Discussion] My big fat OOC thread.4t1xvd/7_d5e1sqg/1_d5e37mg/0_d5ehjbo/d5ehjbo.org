Yup. That's why I can accept a Gryffindor Pettigrew sorting. Peter valued bravery and honesty, but could never achieve it himself. Instead he flocked towards the strongest power he could in order to protect himself. He never seems /happy/ about it, though - even Voldemort knows he is reluctant to be there. I think Peter's ideal self is someone who can stand up for himself, but he personally lacks the bravery to do it. Both in his childhood and adulthood.
