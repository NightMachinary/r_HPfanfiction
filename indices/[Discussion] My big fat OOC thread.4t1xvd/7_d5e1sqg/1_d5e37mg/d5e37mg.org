For me a good rule of thumb is that the Houses' values are just that: things the pupils value, not necessarily things they are (yet). Those values can manifest in many different ways, and can end up leading down the same paths of action. For instance, kids from all four Houses would sneak into the Restricted Section - it's not a particularly "insert-House-here" thing to do. It might not even occur to both a Gryffindor and Slytherin to simply ask permission to check out the book, but for different reasons: one because of the thrill, and one because, well, why involve a teacher?

And most importantly they aren't hard and fast rules, so mix it up!
