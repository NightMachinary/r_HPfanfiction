This is probably a good place to say any of the kids talking like adults that are pretending to be proper but aren't. Its super common in Slytherin fics.

Also in canon Slytherins are a bunch of shits. I like sympathetic Slytherin characters but it isn't canon.

Ravenclaws do nothing but read is pretty common and shitty.

Slytherin is often portrayed as being very different in fanon. They don't cheer for new students instead being reserved and clapping softly. This actually goes against what we see in PS.
