There are things that go against canon, and things that don't oppose canon. The super studious Ravenclaw trope I mentioned is the latter. I'd say it does go against canon, but Demafromua says we don't see enough to be sure.

It's a fair point, one that will ultimately be decided based on opinion. Many people treat it as canon though, when it isn't.
