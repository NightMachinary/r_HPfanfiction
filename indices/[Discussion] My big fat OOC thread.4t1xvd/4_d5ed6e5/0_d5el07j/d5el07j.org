Things most people miss or mischaracterize: Ginny is able to mimic others' voices. She has the twins' sense of humor (and their respect- she could cast a serious hex using Percy's wand even before her first year at Hogwarts). She's strong-willed, confident, popular, attractive and sarcastic. She's Amy Pond.
