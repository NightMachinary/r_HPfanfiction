In /OotP/, Montague was a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. They pushed him into the broken Vanishing Cabinet (possibly/probably the one that Peeves broke in /CoS/ to distract Filch). Montague had to apparate out and wound up in the u-bend of a toilet. Montague was not quite right in the head for several weeks after that.
