This is one of the few things legitimately bothering me in the Pureblood Pretense.

They're not affectionate to first years and call them "puppy" - they give them experimental Puking Pastilles. They also don't switch places for the day. This isn't Ouran High School Host Club. They don't call each other Gred and Forge until Christmas when they get the G and F sweaters, and it's more of a way to poke fun at their mother than an effort to confuse their fellow students.
