  His family doesn't talk to or about their only non-magical relative.

There is no indication that his family doesn't talk to him /because/ he's a squib. We know that A: One of their relatives is a squib and B: The Weasleys don't generally speak of him. There is no reason to be believe that B is because of A. Most people hate Filch because he's an arse, not because he's a squib. The case here is probably similar.

Given how enthusiastic Arthur Weasley is of all things muggle, and given that he immediately tries to make friends with the Grangers, the accusation that he won't speak to one of his relatives just because he happens to be an accountant is ridiculous.
