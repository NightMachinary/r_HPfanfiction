I think that if you're looking at it objectively, sure, they're not all that impressive, but from Ron's point of view, Bill's this super cool dude who breaks curses in an exotic faraway place, Charlie works with basically the most exotic and powerful animals in existence, and while Percy definitely isn't cool (and Ron is certainly aware of that) he has always been in various positions of authority over Ron as long as Ron has been at school.
