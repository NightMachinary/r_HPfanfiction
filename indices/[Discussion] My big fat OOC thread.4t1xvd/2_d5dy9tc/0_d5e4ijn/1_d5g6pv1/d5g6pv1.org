  Yeah, he's insecure from growing up with five successful...brothers....

I wanna pick this nit, really quickly.

Couldn't one argue that his brothers, while smart, aren't really successful, though? In Ron's fourth year...

- Bill's a professional grave-robber for the Goblins.
- Charlie's basically a zookeeper.
- Percy is a low-level pencil-pusher.

The only thing positive in this light is that they love their jobs. The only Weasleys we can consider truly successful in canon are Fred and George. They own their own business and even in the height of fear it's doing good business.
