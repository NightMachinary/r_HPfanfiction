Ron Weasley is *not* a coward, a terrible friend, nor useless, stupid, abusive, or even a crumb-spraying idiot.

Any Ron-bashing fic is completely OOC for Ron. I'm a Ron defender until the very end. Yeah, he's insecure from growing up with five successful, well-liked brothers and having a best friend that is /literally/ the most famous person in the wizarding world. But he's a Gryffindor through and through. From how he is portrayed in canon, he would never, *ever* abuse or rape Hermione. There are ways to pair Hermione with someone else without turning Ron into a villain. Personally, Ron and Hermione are my actual OTP, but because I love to read time travel fics most of all, I very much enjoy reading (Sirius, Remus, James, Tom)/Hermione, etc. I read those way more than R/H. Just because Hermione is dating someone else in your fic doesn't mean you have to turn Ron into an undatable slug or an abusive bastard.

Also, he's not a fucking coward or horrible friend. There are numerous circumstances where Ron shows his bravery throughout the series. Hell, he literally offered himself as a human shield for Harry against a believed mass murdered in POA. After Sirius had already broken his leg, he is still brave enough to say, "If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"

And to those that think he's a mediocre wizard... no. He's just your every day slacker, guys. He comes from a family of very competent, and even powerful wizards. As he grows up and things become much more serious in the war, he learns how to hold his own in a duel. He becomes an Auror, for Merlin's sake! He's not stupid. I'm in the camp that maintains that he's the best strategist of the three, and that was his most useful strength as an Auror.

So if you're not trying to write Ron OOC, just *stop* with any of the above. I literally skip over every single fic that has "Ron bashing" or "Weasley bashing" in the summary. (Also, Dumbledore bashing, or any goddamn bashing, because honestly, bashing doesn't make any fic better. Whatsoever. But that's another rant for another post.)
