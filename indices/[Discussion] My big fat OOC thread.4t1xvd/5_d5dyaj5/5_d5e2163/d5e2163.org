When Hermione hates or scorns Quidditch with a passion. In canon she's at least passively interested in the sport; she attends pretty much every match and values it enough to cheat to get Ron on the team. You could argue that she does it because they're her friends/boyfriend, but the point is that she's fine with them doing it; she's hardly going to stop Harry from playing Quidditch because they're going out.
