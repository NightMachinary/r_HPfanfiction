Pureblood Hermione doesn't just defeat the purpose of the character, it defeats the whole purpose of the books. Why on earth would you take the biggest proof that blood "purity" doesn't really count for anything when it comes to magic and make her a secret pureblood? It's like saying "the Death Eaters were right, just a little violent in their approach (if that)".
