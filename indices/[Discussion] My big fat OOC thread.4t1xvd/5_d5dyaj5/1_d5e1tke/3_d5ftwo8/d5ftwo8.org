There's nothing in the series either way about her looks. AFAIK the only two people who offer an opinion are Auntie Muriel who says she has 'skinny ankles' and Harry who thought she was 'very pretty' at the Yule Ball.

The 'plain-with-poor-body-image' trope is just as awful as 'Hermione-from-a-lads-mag' cliche.
