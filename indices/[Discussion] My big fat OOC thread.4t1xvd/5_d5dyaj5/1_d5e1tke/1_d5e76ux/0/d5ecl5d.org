Victor didn't like her for her looks. I'd certainly say Hermione is an average girl, which doesn't mean ugly. If she is willing to put a lot of time and effort into it she can look very nice, just like any other average girl. We see this at the Yule ball, which a lot of people take as evidence of her beauty. Blatantly ignoring that its an exception to her normal appearance.
