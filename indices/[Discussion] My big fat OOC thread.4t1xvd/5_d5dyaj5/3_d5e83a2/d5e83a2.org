(I'm really wondering if this is in my head because I've never seen anyone complain about this.)

I find fanon Hermione reliably the most annoying, nosy, entitled, controlling character in the story. I don't mind being curious but she'll always /demand/ Harry tell her every single thing going on with him as if it's a given she has to know it, make decisions for him and be pissed off if he doesn't go along with them, moralizing all along the way as if a teenage girl is always going know what's best for her friends more than they do.

At this point I've read this character so many times I've forgotten what canon Hermione is like. I know she did the thing with the firebolt and definitely was obnoxious for part of SS, but I don't remember being pissed off at her for the rest of the books?
