Take a look at 5th year; Hermione gives Harry and Ron personally-enchanted homework planners that regularly say trite aphorisms about diligence every time they're opened. When she hears that Harry intends to break into Umbridge's office in order to Floo-call Sirius to ask about Snape's Worst Memory, she spends every moment for the next day trying to get Harry to change his mind about it.
