I really liked both of the pairings, so I was interested to see how it turned out. It was a very different SSHG than I usually read (Snape is irritating but very IC).

Iirc Harry has similar powers as Hermione except we see more of Hermione since it is Hermione-centric. The method of defeating Voldemort was something I hadn't seen before, but the execution could have been better.
