A Hermione who doesn't understand muggle things. A good example of this is Hayseed's /Dark Gods in the Blood/, where Hermione doesn't understand media, like TVs and DVD players and video games.

Also, a Hermione who is overly competent in physical things, such as a sudden year 6 fixation with (and ultimate proficiency in) things like kickboxing, karate, and yoga. I just don't feel like that'd be in character for Hermione at all. She's not an athletic character, she's an intellectual character.

And lastly, a Hermione who is perfect at everything and the key to all--even more important than Harry Potter! Take for instance, /The Problem with Purity/, where Hermione is one of 2 people in the wizarding world with an extreme amount of power and the ability to gift it someone else. She is also a very rare unicorn animagus, for some reason possesses the ability to communicate with Fawkes telepathically, frequently shows skills like dueling and hand-to-hand combat, is capable of casual wandless magic, magically "hacks" Hogwarts, and that's only up to chapter 5!
