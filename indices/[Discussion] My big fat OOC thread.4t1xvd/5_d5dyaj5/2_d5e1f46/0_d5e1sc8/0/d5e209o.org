Oh, I totally agree! I didn't mean to imply any mutual exclusivity. It's just that in canon, Hermione hated quidditch, didn't even like riding a broom, and seemed to place a very low value on those things. These traits were tread over multiple times, so from that, I just kind of got that Hermione wasn't the athletic sort, whereas her intellectual and academic pursuits were always emphasized.
