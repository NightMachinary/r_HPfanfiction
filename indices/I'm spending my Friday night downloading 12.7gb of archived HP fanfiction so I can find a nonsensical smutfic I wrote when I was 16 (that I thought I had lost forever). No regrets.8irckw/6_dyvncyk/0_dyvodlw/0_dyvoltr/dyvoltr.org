Ohhhh yeah, I never went back and edited mine. I used to publish first drafts. 1,000-word chapters, one chapter in a night. The smut makes you cringe and the rest of the writing is overly dramatic. Some of the later ones are better, but they still suck. These days, I have an editor and we edit over and over until it's perfect, then we spelling/grammar/punctuation check and off it goes.
