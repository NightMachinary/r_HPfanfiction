The writing's actually surprisingly tight in the version of my story I found! The concept and the sex is awful, obviously, but the rhythm of the writing is quite dialled-in. Mind you, the big asterisk is that the version I've got atm (while the rest of the archive is still extracting) is a release from 2 years after I originally wrote it, so it's been edited to within an inch of its life by 18 y.o. me.

What I'm really waiting to cringe over when I find it is the stuff 16 y.o. me was churning out. I did that horrible thing where you just ... keep ... the smut ... going ... until it becomes a /super-serious/ drama that's really important and meaningful, guys. OCs, alternate viewpoints to the year of DH, chapters jumping further and further desperately forward because I really just wanted to get it finished...
