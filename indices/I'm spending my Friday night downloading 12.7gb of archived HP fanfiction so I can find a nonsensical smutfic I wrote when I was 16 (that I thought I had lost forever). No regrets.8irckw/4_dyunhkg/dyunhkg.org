Interesting, I wonder if there are any archives that saved everything from like 2009-2010 onward?

Some dude hacked my email and ended up deleting every single story I had on ff.net off of my account(literally just to be a dick I guess...), some of which were unrecoverable. They were probably garbage since I was like 14, but it would be cool to have a way to get them back.
