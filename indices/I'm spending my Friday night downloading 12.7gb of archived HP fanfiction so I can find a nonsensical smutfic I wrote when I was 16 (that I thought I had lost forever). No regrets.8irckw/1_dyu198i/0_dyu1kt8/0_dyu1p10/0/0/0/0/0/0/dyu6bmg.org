They've not saved the state of ff.net from 2016 though, they talk about having had a script running for eighteen months prior to that. In my tired and limited understanding, anyway. The inventory does list a couple of fics from 2014 that might be what I'm looking for anyway, yippee. They may be the whole story, they may not.

I don't know when I deleted tbh, my emails don't go back that far. Prior to today the only evidence I had for this story was an automated Ficforums RSS post.
