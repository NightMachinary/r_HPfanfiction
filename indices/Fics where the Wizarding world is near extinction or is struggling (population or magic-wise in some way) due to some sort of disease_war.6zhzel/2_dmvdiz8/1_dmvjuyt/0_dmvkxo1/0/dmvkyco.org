  I was reading a story of the non-magicals deciding they weren't going to take it anymore - just exactly too late to really help. It fit a bunny that I had long considered. This is the start of a crossover - but I didn't write beyond this point. Anyone who wants to write a story based on this is welcome. This is done for my part.
