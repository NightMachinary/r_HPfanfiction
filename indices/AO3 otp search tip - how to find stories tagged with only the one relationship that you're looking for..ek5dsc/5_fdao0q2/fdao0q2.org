This isn't really /that/ useful in practice (although the rest of the shortcuts are) because ao3 writers tend to tag everything. Let's say you want to read an Albus/Scorpius fic. Almost every writer who writes that will tag Ginny/Harry & Astoria/Draco or other parent related ships even if they're minor characters because more relationship tags = more hits.
