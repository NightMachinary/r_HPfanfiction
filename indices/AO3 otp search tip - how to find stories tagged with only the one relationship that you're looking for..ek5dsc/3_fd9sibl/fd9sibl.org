1. Select fandom, exclude crossovers, word count above 1k, language of your choice.

2. Set the pairing and the characters. Exclude multi. Exclude warnings you don't like (eg rape, character death).

3. Exclude all rival pairings. For example, while looking for Harry/Hermione, exclude R/Hr, Dramione, Snamione and so on.

4. Scroll through your 15 results and Cry because half of those are just tagged background ships which appear briefly in chapter 36.
