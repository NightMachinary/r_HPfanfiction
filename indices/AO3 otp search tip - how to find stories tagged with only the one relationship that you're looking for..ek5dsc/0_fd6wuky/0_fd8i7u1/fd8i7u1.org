Agreed - nothing like finding a story thats says completed to only find out that 3 of the 7 sequels have been written, and the writter has disappeared from the face of the earth. I appreciate that its fanfiction and nobody is paid to do it... but its very frustrating putting time into reading it to never find out how it ends.
