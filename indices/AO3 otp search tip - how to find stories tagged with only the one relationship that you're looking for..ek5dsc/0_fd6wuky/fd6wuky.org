I've never searched by ship, but still a neat tip for those who invest in it that much. I just wish there was an easier way to find stories that are actually completed without spoiling plot points for myself.

And yes, I know there's a tag for it, but I hate getting to the "end" of a story and it's just the end of Harry's first year or something, and the sequel has 4 chapters only, last updated in 2015. Small gripe, but persistent.
