Thank you! Nice tip. I normally just exclude pairings I'm not interested in and crossovers in the search filter options. Clears out the tag of most of the clutter, but this could come in handy, too.

I hope AO3 gets around to expanding the search options to include "primary/secondary" pairings, fandoms, etc. It'll make life a lot easier for all of us.
