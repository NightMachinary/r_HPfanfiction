Huh, I had no idea this was a thing. Thanks!

But I'm not sure how truly useful it is. I usually get a good mileage out of recognizing the tags I don't care for that are the most common when searching. For example, if I look for Severitus, filter out Snarry (which I really don't care for, and isn't even Severitus) and Snily (because I'd rather read one or the other, not both which often has needless angst I don't care about).
