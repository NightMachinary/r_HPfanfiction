I feel like James's protection would prevent any active attempts to get at Harry and actually could clear up some discrepancies?

Harry entered the bathroom with the troll himself. He did the same for Quirrel. He never had contact with Riddle or the Basilisk until he went down there himself. Sirius could find him because he wasn't actually tryina harm Harry - Pettigrew just wanted to live, not harm Harry. Harry had to grab the portkey himself after actively trying to get to it. Harry did cause the detentions with Umbridge by his actions (although it was hecka unfair) and she was there vs Dumbledore rather than him specifically. 6th year, Death Eaters attacked the castle specifically when he /wasn't there/. 7th year, Voldemort tried to get to him when Harry just wanted to go somewhere, and Harry's wand personally smited Voldie. The only time he was actually caught was when he broke the Taboo.

There was nothing that happened to him without him instigating it in some way shape or form. Lily's protection sets Voldemort on fire, James' protection prevents any active assassination attempts.
