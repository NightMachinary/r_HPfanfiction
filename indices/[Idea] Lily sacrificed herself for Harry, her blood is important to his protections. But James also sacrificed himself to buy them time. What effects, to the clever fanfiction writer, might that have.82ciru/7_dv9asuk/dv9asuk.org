There is a massive problem here in that it expands a plot hole in the book.

Lily's sacrifice granted magical protection? How is this not super common. The type of war they were fighting involved regular home invasions. There should be a whole hoard of people lying around who only got out of a life threatening situation because a loved one sacrificed or did a last stand.

This is usually addressed in fanfic in one of two ways:

1) Genius Runemaster Lily found some complex ritual to give her son protection and was running a Xanatos Gambit

2) It only worked due to the particulars of the circumstances (ie, because she died right before)

Both of these get undermined if you have James also involved. 1) weakens by reducing the uniqueness of the caster. 2) weakens because by expanding the particulars of the circumstances you end up back at "how is there not a dozen people walking around with this protection"

If you wanted to do it with James, wouldn't be better to have it be instead of Lily, instead of as well as Lily? That would fit either model a lot better....
