  Lily's sacrifice granted magical protection? How is this not super common. The type of war they were fighting involved regular home invasions. There should be a whole hoard of people lying around who only got out of a life threatening situation because a loved one sacrificed or did a last stand.

One way to address it:

In the magical world, love is rare. Parents might value their children (once they're proven to be capable of magic), and they might be attached to their other family members, but love is just not really a thing. Hagrid's shunned in part because he openly loves his animal friends. Love is the power Voldemort knows not because he simply hadn't encountered it growing up or at Hogwarts. A self-sacrifice driven by love just hadn't come up before.

...now I've made myself sad.
