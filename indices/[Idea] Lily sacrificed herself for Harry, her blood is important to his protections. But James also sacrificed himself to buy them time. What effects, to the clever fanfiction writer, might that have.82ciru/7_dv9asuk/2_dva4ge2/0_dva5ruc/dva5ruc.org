I was actually gonna mention, if you structure your world as muggleborns being very rare (like 1/year or less), you could attribute it to upbringing. Although it is a bit of a departure from cannon, as cannon seems to imply at least a decent sized muggleborn/halfblood population.

It also falls squarely under point #2, that the circumstances are unique, and trying to make that apply to James would weaken it :)
