I believe I covered that under #2.

Although I still consider it a plothole. No one found themselves in a situation they could have escaped but instead turned around, dug in, and bought their loved ones time to flee? Or if it requires intent of the killer, there are no reluctant killers out there saying to themselves "please just turn around and go I don't want to be forced to kill you"?

Anyway, for this discussion it falls squarely under #2. The circumstances around it were special and specific. If you expand that to James you undermine the reasoning

Edit: I mean, it isn't as bad as some of the major oversights (/cough money cough/), but it is still rather... Loosely defined. Perhaps plothole is a bit too strong of a term, since loosely defined yet believable can be good for a story, let readers fill in their own logic
