  If Voldemort had gone unchecked, the magical stability would've been thrown out the window.

Do you know how many civilizations have risen and fallen over the years, and the chaos left in their wakes? The Middle Ages lasted for a millennium after the fall of Rome, for instance. That would affect your "magical stability" far more than a bit of terrorism in an small island nation. Magic shouldn't give a fuck about Voldemort.
