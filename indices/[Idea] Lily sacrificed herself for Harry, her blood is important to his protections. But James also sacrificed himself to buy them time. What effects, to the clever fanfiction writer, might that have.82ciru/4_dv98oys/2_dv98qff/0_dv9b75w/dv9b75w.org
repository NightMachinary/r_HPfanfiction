Totally :P The HP universe is expert in removing plotholes, because... magic :P

Still, the idea that someone else had in this threat, that perhaps it wasn't Lily's sacrifice, but James's - allowing Lily and Harry more time - and making a deal in the afterlife, it sounds pretty cool.

There are many ways to go about it, and personally I've always seen Magic as being a kind of status quo "being". If Voldemort had gone unchecked, the magical stability would've been thrown out the window.
