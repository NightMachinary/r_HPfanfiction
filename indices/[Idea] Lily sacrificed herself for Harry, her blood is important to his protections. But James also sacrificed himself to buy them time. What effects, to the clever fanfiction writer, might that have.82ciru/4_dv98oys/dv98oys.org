I have no doubt that many people would have tried to save their loved ones, mothers like Lily. The difference here is that a prophecy was made, and that changed everything. That made a "normal" sacrifice magically different.

I think your priority should be the sacrifice in relation to the prophecy, which means that James's sacrifice could mean something more substantial.

I've always wondered at the prophecy behind. How did it come to be? Why does the ability to forsee the future exist? Is it a cosmic stabiliser? Did Trelawney get it by magic, or just random? What would've happened if no prophecy existed - does that mean free reign for Voldemort?

In many stories, it seems that magic is almost sentient.
