I do need to note that technically, the prophecy has no magical power behind it at all, at least in canon; Trelawney's first prophecy only comes true because Voldemort heard the first couple of lines and (being muggle-raised) believes in it. The notion that said prophecy is somehow magically binding and gives Harry special powers is a fanon invention.

If you do want to make prophecies immutable, I came up with this idea that they could be a deliberate kind of fate-bending magic where the prophet utilises their magical power to force them to come true (Sleeping Beauty and that spinner's wheel prick thing, anyone?).

Centaurs could predict the future, but most would lack the power to make it come true. Sybil Trelawney isn't necessarily a powerful witch, so her prophecies rely on exploiting human nature and random chance to get the job done. Voldemort's malediction on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position might be a particularly powerful prophecy, altering the fate of the world and the minds of hundreds of people just to ensure someone will eff-up the DADA post every year.
