  I have no doubt that many people would have tried to save their loved ones, mothers like Lily. The difference here is that a prophecy was made, and that changed everything. That made a "normal" sacrifice magically different.

What was magically different was that Voldemort offered to spare Lily if she stepped aside and let him kill Harry. How often do child-murderers do that? Basically, the events go like this:

1. Voldemort kills James. He does not offer to spare James, so no special consequences.
2. Voldemort offers Lily to step aside and be spared (as a favour to Snape).
3. Lily refuses.
4. Voldemort kills Lily. Sacrificial Protection for Harry is created.
5. Voldemort tries to kill Harry, Sacrificial Protection makes the spell backfire.

Notice that if Voldemort hadn't offered /or/ had rendered Lily unconscious or just tied her up, then there would be no Sacrificial Protection.
