It would probably do nothing against a sniper, I am pretty sure that the notice given was fairly short and you would need to already be burning, and if they are sniping then you probably not.

It would be fairly useful in duelling against most spells (if you are at mid-distance you would probably have a decent time to dodge/ shield but probably not counter) it might be gotten around by transfiguration or something else that is unconventional as while you have increased reactions that doesn't help if there is no solution that you are capable- 2 Mistborns all have the exact same abilities, but Flitwick, MGonagall and Snape all have different specialties and therefore things that the others cannot do.
