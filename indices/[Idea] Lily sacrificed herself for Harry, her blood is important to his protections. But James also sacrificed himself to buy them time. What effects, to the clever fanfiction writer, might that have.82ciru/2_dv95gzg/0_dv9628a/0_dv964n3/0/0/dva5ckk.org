In a close range fight with a goal of survival and injuring the other combatants, that is. I'm not clear on how it is against a sniper. It would be helpful but not an overwhelming advantage in a hostage situation.

It's nearly useless if you're not doing stuff that involves reactions to rapidly changing physical situations.

In a duel in the HP-verse, its effectiveness depends greatly on how spells move (instantaneous vs tracking vs ballistic) and how well the assisted person can recognize and counter spells based on wand movements.
