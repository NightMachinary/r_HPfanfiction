Buying time, hm?

The closer Voldemort gets, the more time starts to distort between them. As they try to combat each other, they end up fighting each other at different points in time over the course of a few hours, fighting past and future versions in a confusing four dimensional battle. It's like a Benny Hill doorway chase with applied combat.
