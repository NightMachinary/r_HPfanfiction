He can kill Snape with a single touch because the life debt was not repaid (and Snape was the reason why the Potters were targeted).

On a more serious note, it would be interesting to read a story where Harry can talk to his dead parents and they help him out with all kinds of issues, like Lily answering Snape's questions and James being the equivalent of a sci-fi AI when Harry plays Quidditch (Beater at 9 o'clock, dive right) or helping his son flirt without it turning into a real character mash-up like in "The lie I lived". Imagine Lily and James as Harry's Cortana.
