There was a fic like this. I think it was abandoned though. I can't remember what it was called. I'll have to try and find it again. Basically, Lily and James' souls are trapped up beside the Horcrux in his scar and work to constantly hold it at bay. They are able to communicate with him though through his whole childhood and through his Hogwarts years. I think it stopped in first year though.
