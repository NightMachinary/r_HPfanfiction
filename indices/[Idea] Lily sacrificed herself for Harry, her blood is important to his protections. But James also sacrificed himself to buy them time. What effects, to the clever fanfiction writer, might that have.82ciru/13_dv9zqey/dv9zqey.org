The issue with this is while it makes some sense you'd have to try and keep it consistent. James fought a fight he could never win. I'm sure lots of people did that. It could potentially be interesting if lots of people had sacrificial protections unique to them but that sounds like a lot of work. Enough people find issue with the nature of Lily's sacrifice as different as it is, imagine the issues people would take if James's sacrifice was more meaningful.
