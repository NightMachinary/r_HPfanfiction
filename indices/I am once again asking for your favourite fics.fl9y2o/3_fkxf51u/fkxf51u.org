Favorite underrated fic on ao3 hands down for me is linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) which, imo, has the best characterization of Snape that I've ever seen. I'm also a big fan of linkao3(The King's Indian Attack; Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; Of a Linear Circle - Part I by flamethrower). I'm also going to plug my own series, linkao3(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

In terms of fem!Harry, linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) is good, but is a more well-known fic so maybe you've already read it.
