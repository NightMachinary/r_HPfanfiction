I can't recommend Of A Linear Circle ENOUGH!! it's an AMAZING series that's STILL updating and is actually still really good! I didn't expect to like it based off the description, but read it bc it's by flamethrower on ao3, who's an amazing writer. It's SO well written, has so many amazing plot twists, and keeps you hooked. 20/10, would absolutely recommend. Plus, it'll keep you busy for a long time!!

(If you like star wars flamethrower also has an AMAZING and huge star wars series that will keep you reading for a very long time too!)
