All completed except the top story, but it is a favourite of mine. It's not for everyone and someone once said that the wand he uses is a decent indicator of whether or not someone would enjoy the story so if you're unsure I could describe it.

Also with regards to The Seventh Horcrux; I found the description lacking; the story is a very good comedy read. Ignore the description and try at least 2 chapters before deciding whether or not you like the story.
