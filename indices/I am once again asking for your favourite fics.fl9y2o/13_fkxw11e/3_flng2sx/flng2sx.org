I tried the lockhart one since you recommended it bc i liked the concept, but I could not deal with the amount of character bashing that was going on or the impossible way harry was acting as a teacher (how overtly he was trying to manipulate and control harry). I couldn't make it past the first chapter. If anyone else is reading my comment, I heavily do NOT recommed.
