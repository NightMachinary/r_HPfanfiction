#+begin_quote
  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.
