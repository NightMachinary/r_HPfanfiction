I think I've read 'On the Way to greatness' but I haven't read the others yet. I started the Accidental Animagus but dropped it after the first two chapters a year ago because I wasn't looking for a Harry/Hermione fic. I've seen it recommended so many times now that I'll definitely give it the try it deserves. Thanks
