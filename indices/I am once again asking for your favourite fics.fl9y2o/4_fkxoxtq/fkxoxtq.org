[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel. These are also being posted to AO3, but aren't complete yet.

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.
