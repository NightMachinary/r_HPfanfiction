Knowledge is Power by Defenestratable. Original Author is Fettucini. Hands down, no argument, best NON-BWL & Older Harry fic out there. Dialogue is great from the beginning. Harry is not too overpowered, more like overly smart (or everyone else is that idiotic). The slow build between Harry and Fleur is fantastic as it seems to be more realistic but also not. Great OC's, these OC's have decent backstory, great personality, and are there not to be overpowered or for exposition.
