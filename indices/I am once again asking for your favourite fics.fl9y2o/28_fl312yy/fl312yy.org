This might get buried, but my all time favorite series is linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko).

In case it doesnt link [[https://fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]

The trilogy is over 1mil words and has a completely original plot. Harry is the main character and it takes a couple chapters until the author hits their stride, but it's well worth it. Great characterizations and world building, gradual power development (different too!). It's truly truly worth the read and it's very well written. We get to see what the Auror training is actually like, and a Harry who doesn't instantly find his one true love on the first date and instead meets and dates people like a normal person (though it's not the focus of the story). Multidimensional OC's and a believable situation that ends up with Snape adopting/mentoring Harry.

This is the only hp fanfic that I reread every year because it stands the test of time and is just that freaking good. Please give it a try and let me know what you think of it!
