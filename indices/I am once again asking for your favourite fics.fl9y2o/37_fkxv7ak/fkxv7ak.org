2 long and outlandish ones with Hermione as the main character:

I don't know it you're into this kind of stuff, but "Crazy Little Things" by Dreiser is my favorite fanfic ever. It's a university Hermione/Luna story and it was one of the first HP fanfictions that I've read and they reamined my favorite ship since then. Great chemistry, some interesting and pretty unique Luna depiction, a nice jungle adventure sequence and lots of lovely moments.

The other one I must mention is "Wingardium Leviosa Because it Makes Things Float" by ReverseHipster. It's a Harry Potter and Stephen King's "It" crossover with Hermione/Pennywise. There's a bunch of explicit stuff and gore in it and some really morally questionable character decisions, but the atmosphere and overall weirdness of the better kind was an absolute win for me. It's really not something you read every day.
