The Heir of the House of Black by Ravenclawblues on AO3 is one of my favorites.

It takes a largely unique approach to the Master of Death trope where Harry travels into a alternate timeline similar to his. This time it is to prevent the rise of a Dark Lord who was working behind the scenes as the world focused on Voldemort. He is reborn as Sirius and Regulus' older brother.

It's relatively new but has a tentatively large hit count of 55k. It currently has a 277k word count and 37 chapters. The author updates regularly though I don't recall the exact schedule. The story is gen with no romance among the main characters beyond the pre-established cannon ones.
