Hah. Quite.

I had a very inconventional entrance to the HP world and HP fan fiction in general. I stopped reading fanfiction religiously a few years ago and when i come back and read what i thought to be "masterpieces" I find badly written hulks, many of which I stuck on this list because of their sentimental value.

Generally now it turns out that I find it impossible to read fics that don't have good quality writing. Plot I have relatively given up on. So yeah, bad choices. What are your favorites?
