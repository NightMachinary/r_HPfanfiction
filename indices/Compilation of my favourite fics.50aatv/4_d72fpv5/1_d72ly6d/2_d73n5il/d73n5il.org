He means bad. Most of this subreddit doesn't like HPMoR. Personally I think its decent, though not the best thing ever.

However your list in general has several fics that you say the writing is low quality in. Which is weird for a favorite fic compilation when there are a lot of fics with good stories that are also well written.

For some example's see Taure's and Newcomb's lists that are linked later on in this thread, of which almost all the stories from these that I've read are decently written. Though both of those haven't been updated recently, and as such are missing any newer good ones, and obviously some older good ones too since nobody has read everything and people have differing tastes. Neither of these lists have the pureblood pretense, which is one of my favorite series for example.
