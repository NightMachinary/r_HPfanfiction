Imagine you're doing a math problem that takes a lot of time to calculate, but once you have the solution it's easy to check that it's right.

If you could send a message to your past self, you could basically send him a solution, and it'd be easy to see if it's right.

But what if your future self sends you a wrong solution? Then you send your past self something else.

This would again cause past self to get a (probably wrong) solution, and another different solution gets sent back in time and checked.

By using the time travel cleverly, all solutions are basically tried simultaneously, and since only the right solution ends up with itself always getting sent back, that's the result.

But because of the way Harry thinks, "Don't mess with time" is also a correct solution, because while it doesn't solve the math problem it als results in getting sent back.
