Depends on what you want. Here's some examples of my favorite Snape-centric fics of various kinds.

Snape as a Professor except he's actually good at the job? linkao3(The Hogwarts Potions Professor)

Snape as Harry's adoptive father? linkffn(Crime and Punishment)

Canon-compilant biography? linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles)

Snily romance? linkffn(The Peace Not Promised)

I can give more Severus raising Harry/similar, and Snily, if you're interested in those in particular.
