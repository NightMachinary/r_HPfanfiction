Harry couldn't do anything but stare at the bulky man barely squeezed into a robe far too small as the creature who had once been Tom Riddle laughed.

"Come now child, surely you did not think hiding you among the filth was enough?"

Voldemort's cold smile was somehow worse than the anticipatory grin on Vernon's face as his master laid one bony hand on an enormous shoulder.

It was too much for Harry. This night had crashed from horror to horror and he had hit his breaking point.

"But... how? HE'S NOT A WIZARD!" Harry raged, and the Death Eaters surrounding him broke out in fits of mocking laughter.

The boy was weeping with frustration by the time Voldemort silenced them with a wave. Harry's ragged breath was loud in the now quiet graveyard as the Dark Lord moved to loom over him, smiling down at his would-be destroyer.

"Did your precious Albus Dumbledore think me too simple to remember your mother had a sister?"

As Harry suddenly stiffened with realization, Voldemort sighed. "He did. How disappointing. I had hoped he would be a more competent adversary."

"A pity, really," he said, idly examining the bone-white wand in his hand for defects. "That mudblood even warned him of what her sister had become after the wedding, but the great Lord of the Light could not bring himself to contemplate a sister might want to see her sibling dead."

Harry had collapsed against the headstone, staring blindly at the Dark Lord's feet as that coldly amused voice spoke the truths that had cut him deeper than he thought possible. Aunt Petunia wanted his mother dead? He ached with the despair of it, joining the cut on his arm that throbbed with the pounding of his heart.

The tip of a wand below his chin forced him to look upwards, into the red eyes of Voldemort. Something brushed against his mind with the sensation of icy scales, and the pain in his forehead surged blindingly for a moment, leaving him panting again with the agony of it.

"This is far too easy, Potter." The noseless face wasn't suited to smirking, becoming even more horrifying. "I don't even have to curse you to make you suffer. I just have to answer your questions. Go on, ask another."

Harry's mind was foggy with pain, but the question burst from his lips, straight from the anger burning in his chest. "Why?"

At Voldemort's nod, it was Vernon who answered. "Money, of course. What else?"

"That dead bitch got my Petunia's parents to cut her out of the will." Dursley's deep voice was a growl as he spoke of Lily, full of contempt. "She got hers, though, just like that poncy little queer she 'married'."

Harry started at that, trying to come to his feet before a whispered /crucio/ surged through the wand at his throat and sent him sprawling, blind and deaf to his own screams as he writhed in the dirt. He came back to himself with every nerve burning with the echo of the curse, and the Dark Lord looking more amused than ever.

"It is impolite to interrupt your elders, child. Continue educating him, Dursley."

Vernon snorted with amusement. "We knew all along the Potter boy was a fruit. Pettigrew and Snape told us all about what he and that Black kid got up to, so he got exactly what he deserved. Once the boss here's done with you, we'll get what we deserve as well."

He stopped to gloat a moment, watching the shaking boy on the ground, waiting for the dreadful curiosity of the moment to draw out the question he wanted to answer.

"What?" Harry croaked, voice raw from screaming.

"The Potter money, of course. Why do you think we took you in?" His tone was dismissive, as if talking about some ratty hierloom that one kept to please an elder relative. "Since the bitch died last, all that goes to you since they never did find the will. Funny how easy it is to empty a safe deposit box when you can encourage someone to forget you aren't the right person."

Pettigrew tittered in the background at that, Harry thought. Things were getting hazy now as blood loss and pain caught up to him, but his uncle's words and the amused eyes of the Dark Lord kept him transfixed.

"So as soon as the boss has his fun and leaves what's left of you for the papers to find, there'll be no more Potters, and Pet will empty that vault by the weekend." Vernon grinned again, a terrible sight in the firelight. "The mourning guardian, leaving the wizarding world entirely to escape the memory of her murdered family. Worth missing out on strangling you myself."

Harry just stared up from where he lay, aching, filthy, and drained by the relentless tide of his Uncle's greed and spite.

"Your reward is well earned, Dursley. I have not had this much fun in *ages*."

The big man's laugh was somehow as bad as his master's, filled with enjoyment of the scene he was witnessing. "Well worth the effort, sir."

"Now then, boy, have they taught you to duel? On your feet!" Voldemort turned and stalked away, leaving Pettigrew to drag Harry to his feet and throw the holly wand in the dirt next to him.

Slowly, feeling as if he might collapse at any swift movement, Harry picked up his wand and turned to face his enemy. He knew there was no chance now. This had all been planned too well, there was no way out.

"Bow to Death, Harry."

For the last time he stood, tears running down his filthy face with the pain of it, and raised his wand in a shaking hand. Time to do what Potters do when all else fails; die standing.

"No."
