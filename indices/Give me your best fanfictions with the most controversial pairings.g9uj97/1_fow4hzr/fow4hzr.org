There's linkffn(8615605) - it's very well written, with probably the best version of """mentor""" Snape that I can think of and keeps him very much in character... But the (eventual/never actualized) pairing of Harriet/Snape is obviously offputting.

Not sure if it qualifies, though - the fic doesn't have the pairing in it, and the sequel seems to have died out before that point. However, it's well worth a read to see a fun interpretation of Snape.

(I'm not a big fan of the planned pairing, but it's well written enough for me to overlook it)
