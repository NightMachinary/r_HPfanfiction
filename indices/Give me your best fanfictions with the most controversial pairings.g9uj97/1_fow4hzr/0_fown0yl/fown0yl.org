I /am/ a Snape/Harry fan and not usually into genderbending either of them, but this fic is brilliantly written, even though I think everyone wanders in and out of character here and there. It also has a lovely, bittersweet depiction of Sirius/Remus and plenty of plot. Since I'm not that interested in a het version of Snape/Harry, I'm not bothered that we never arrive at the actual romance, although I'll be delighted if laventadorn decides to pick up the story again someday. She's just that good.
