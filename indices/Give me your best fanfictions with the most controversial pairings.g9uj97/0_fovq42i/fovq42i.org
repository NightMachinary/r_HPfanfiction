I don't know if this is controversial, but Snape/Neville is definitely not common. Warning for major character death. The story is called [[http://yearningvoid.net/stories/julad/000080.html][Night-blooming Heartsease by Julad]]. If you're familiar with an older Harry/Draco story called Transfigurations, this is the prequel.
