No i agree with the defensove curriculum shown here... I mean how many people use everything they learn at school in their jobs, not many! People specialise after school, but that doesnt stop them learning the basics for most things. Like all learning the basics for.m becoming an Auror... Some at Hogwarts could be incapable of casting any DADA spells, they still take the class, at least up until OWL in canon
