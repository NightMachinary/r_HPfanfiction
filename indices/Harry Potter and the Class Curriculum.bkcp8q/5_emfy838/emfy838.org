This is too brilliant. I was literally thinking earlier today that I wish there was a clear curriculum for Hogwarts out there. I really wouldn't trust J.K.Rowling to make one at the moment (sorry Jo but it's true re: "wizards literally pooping themselves". If you were to post the .xlsx form I would definitely download it! Now I just need to find a list of all canon spells and spells that were alluded to.
