Well considering that fact is actually false, yes. People of the Middle Ages knew human waste spread disease they just weren't sure how because they didn't have modern science on their hands. SO considering the fact that they believed in the four humors and other forms of pseudoscience, they came to the conclusion that "fouls smells must cause disease" they decided to get rid of their waste by emptying their chamber pots into local rivers and streams such as the Thames in London or even the subsequently named Shitbrook in Exeter where it would be carried away stench and all. But disregarding that, have you really thought of the implications of wizards just soiling their clothes when the urge to purge their bowels arose? Assuming that wizards like muggles took their children out of diapers by 2/3 then that meant that every pre-Hogwarts aged magical child went to the restroom they soiled themselves and had to run to an adult to clean them up. and there's no telling if they did that immediately! I mean that is ridiculous as well as unsanitary and foul smelling. And when exactly did student at Hogwarts learn the vanishing charm? Before they learned did they purposely wet their beds, what about when they went for a nice afternoon flight on their brooms, was there a sudden un-forecasted yellow rain shower???? What about sessions of the Wizangamot, witches and wizards in the stands and public galleries close quarters just letting go and poops make sounds when they come out depending on if their regular or like the curse of Moctezuma so yeah.... I just can't.... my mind just goes weird places. Sorry about the rant.
