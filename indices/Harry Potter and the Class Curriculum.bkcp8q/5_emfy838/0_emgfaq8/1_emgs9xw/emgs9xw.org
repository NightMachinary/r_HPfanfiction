see that whole "wizards pooped and then magic it away" didn't really bother me cause it reminded me of the "fact" that people would just take a dump in a corner at the Palace of Versailles and that the king and queen would vacation for a couple of weeks of the year while the palace got cleaned. (side note, this was actually more like anti-royalist propaganda than historical fact. But it's one of those pseudo facts that stick with you). I'm assuming JKR might have been told a similar story and maybe that's why it didn't seem that weird to her when she wrote that tweet.
