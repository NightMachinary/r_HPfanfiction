Thanks for the reply!

Wall of text alert!

As to point 1, I agree that it isn't intended to turn students into child soldiers, and I tried not to make it seem that way. Clearly I didn't do as good of a job as I would have hoped, though!

The problem with Defense Against the Dark Arts is that it is very nebulously defined throughout the series. Compound that with the curse on the position, and it's difficult to draw any accurate conclusions on the state of what the course usually covers. My personal thoughts on wizarding society is that it's a very small and fragmented society. Hogsmeade, which is described as a village in the text, is the largest permanent residence of wizards and witches in Britain. This, and other factors, lead me to believe that each wizard or wizarding family needs to be largely self-sufficient in matters of defense and protection. This gives it a more medieval and /wild magic/ vibe, which I personally associate with a lot of English magical folklore.

The way I prefer to look at DADA is that a lot of these are basic defense and survival tactics and spells. Note that none of the curriculum deals with permanently injuring. Most of it deals with defending yourself and possibly incapacitating whatever is coming to get you. Just like most martial arts courses do for citizens. I will agree that I should have rephrased a couple of things in retrospect. For example, "using basic medical spells in the field" does give off a connotation of a battlefield, which wasn't what I intended.

The first two years are focused on control, aim, and strategy. The only spells that are taught until fourth year are the stinging hex, expelliarmus, flipendo, and protego. I included the Shield charm so early because while in the books it wasn't taught until later, and while it was stated that most adult wizards could not produce an adequate Shield charm, I choose to believe that this is more a product of the curse against the position than it is any particular difficulty with the spell itself. Naturally, this is only my take so I encourage each author to use their own headcanons and theories that they like.

To continue addressing your second point, I agree that in canon the Water-Making Charm (Aguamenti) isn't taught until Year Six, but I consciously took a few liberties with Charms. I only /loosely/ based this on canon, and so I grouped Charms based on how they related to each other (water-making, fire-making, and light-making are all taught in the same Term), as well as their usefulness.

Rowling did not explicitly say in her texts why some charms are harder than others, or really anything governing the nature of charms themselves. I took the leeway she gave and adapted it to my ideas. Perhaps I was a little overzealous in the changes I made, but to be honest, it would be very simple for an author to move the different Charms around as they see fit.

As to your point about the Stunning Spell and Reductor Curse, I know that Harry learned them for a purpose. However, we do have some evidence that students of that age should be able to learn them. Ron and Hermione did, as well as plenty of Fourth Years that Harry taught through Dumbledore's Army. In my rather idealized curriculum, I see no reason that a student that has received competent and consistent instruction through their first three years of school could not cast said spells.
