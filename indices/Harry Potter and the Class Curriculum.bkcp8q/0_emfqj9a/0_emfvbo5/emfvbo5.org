Re the Shield Charm, I just read that part in GoF and it was also during Harry's special preparation for the third task, and Harry doesn't even use it "in the field"(and he certainly had cause to). The reason being it must not have been up to snuff. See quote.

  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx.

And you know, it seems to me that in many ways people should look to the Patronus Charm as the standard way of spells rather than the exceptional. Too often I see spell learning to be rather binary: doesn't know Wingardium Leviosa, next day knows it and can cast it in its complete form. And its not just the Patronus or Shield, again I just read Dumbledore using I think Stupefy with such ability as to blast apart an intervening door. I suppose this is just canon, but in my experience this is largely missed in much of fanfiction.

To OP/whomever it may concern, if you really wanted to it wouldn't be completely out there (though not canon) to introduce some spells early, but without expectation of practical use (see wispy gaseous patronus and above shield charm). Then revisit and reinforce them in later years, as Harry clearly must have done with the Shield Charm.
