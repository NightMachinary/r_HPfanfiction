That's quite a good point, and I did include some instances of 'revision' in there. I probably should have added a "Shield Charm Review" in there, possibly in Term 1 of Year 5 where they also review the stunning spell.

I /completely/ agree that spell-learning is not binary, and I guess I was assuming that most students' shield charms would be rather weak at first and get stronger over time, but I never explicitly indicated that in the curriculum.
