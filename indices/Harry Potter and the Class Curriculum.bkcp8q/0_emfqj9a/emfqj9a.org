My two initial thoughts are:

1. I think the focus of DADA is a bit off. Hogwarts isn't an academy for child soldiers and the purpose of DADA isn't to turn kids into Aurors. Your curriculum has a heavy focus on fighting as opposed to, well, defence against the dark arts.

2. Across the board you have introduced advanced spells very early in the curriculum. The Shield Charm in Year 2 is particular egregious - we know that this is an O.W.L. level spell and even then most wizards have trouble with it. Another example is the Water-Making Charm, in canon a N.E.W.T. level spell, which you have them learning in first year.

Also, pet peeve alert: it should be remembered that the Stunning Charm, Reductor Curse et al are not basic or easy spells. Harry learnt these early for the purpose of the third task; they are not standard spells that 4th years are expected to learn. Indeed, Harry's mastery of these spells put him in a position to be able to teach defensive magic to his peers and NEWT-level students in OotP.
