This is awesome.

One observation though: With the exception of Potions, there's nothing in this curriculum about giving students tools to /advance/ the state of magic. Granted, this is far from an emphasis for non-magic high school either, but I'd expect there to be at least a little bit about spell-crafting.

In a similar vein, it's unclear if there is anything in Runes about combining runes for magical effects. I assume some magical effects may be mentioned in the context of each alphabet, but I'd also assume that there would be some shared principles underlying /all/ alphabets and so there would be at least some comparative parts of the curriculum.

Similar comments apply to Arithmancy, although there the gap isn't as egregious because one could imagine that that's what goes into the "advanced tenets".
