About Muggle studies...\\
It is stuck in the extreme past. "Muggle Social Media and the Internet" would not even exist in the magical world by the time Harry goes to Hogwarts, the Internet was still very much in its cradle at the start of the 90s.

Also, based on the fact that Arthur Weasley works for the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office and knows barely anything about muggle items... I'd say that no one takes this class seriously and it has probably not been updated so heavily before the death of Voldemort.
