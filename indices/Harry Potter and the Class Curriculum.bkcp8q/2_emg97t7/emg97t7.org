Okay, this whole thing looks more like what Hogwarts' curriculum /should/ be as opposed to what it is, but I can definitely comment on the Astronomy curriculum.

In a basic astronomy class, after you learn how to use a telescope (probably by looking at the Moon and planets), you would definitely not start by studying the planets in detail. The planets aren't always up, and which ones are changes from year to year. You would start by learning about the celestial sphere--that is, the daily and yearly motion of the heavens as a whole (and finding true north). This is a large part of learning how to navigate on the sky, which is pretty essential to everything that comes after.

Next, you would learn about the daily and yearly motion of the Sun (without a telescope, obviously), and the Moon and its phases. Then, you would go straight to the constellations. Unlike the planets, the constellations stay put, and they are the other part of how you navigate on the sky. You would also learn the major stars with the constellations as you go because both the constellations and the stars in them are signposts to finding everything else (at least in the absence of surveying equipment). Since Astronomy at Hogwarts is astrology-heavy, the zodiac would be studied early, although realistically, it wouldn't really be a distinct unit separate from studying all the constellations and/or the motions of heavenly bodies through it. Minor stars generally wouldn't figure unless you included a unit on variable stars.

Only then would you move on to the planets, starting with the naked-eye planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and their moons. In the books, they do seem to study the physical properties of the planets (which is weird because very little was known in the muggle world until the 1960s), but I think it would mainly have to do with their motions on multiyear timescales and how they affect magic like herbology and potions.

After Uranus and Neptune (no handheld telescope is going to be able to spot Pluto), you could touch on asteroids and then move on to deep sky objects: binary stars, star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae; and transient phenomena: comets, eclipses, novae, and supernovae. And all of this would probably show up by 5th year, and it's about as far as you'll get with a handheld telescope.

At NEWT level, I'm not sure wizards would have a clue about the physics of gas and radiation, much less black holes, but I could definitely see them using larger telescopes and working on old-timey astronomy techniques like hunting comets and asteroids and taking pictures with photographic plates.
