Are you sure that's what it's called? I put the name in speech marks to search those exact words in google (if you search "harry potter and the good ending", it'll look for any results with exactly those words) and it only came up with your posts asking for it (literally, two results), so that implies it wasn't called that - or exactly that, at least.
