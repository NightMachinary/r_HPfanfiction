Reminds me of the pillow world episode of Adventure Time, except that there's two people involved and they both retain their memories.

On an unrelated note, I think it'd be interesting if Harry and Daphne (or whoever else) retain all their knowledge of magic and spellwork, but not their abilities: it adds an extra layer of angst if they find themselves suddenly unable to do things that were second nature to them in the dream world.
