Interesting plot, although I'd love to see some conflict from their child and adult mentalities rather than just having their childish personality from the dream.

This may seem a bit redundant as it's literally magic but, if you put a mind inside another body for all instances you become them, new neurons and pathways etc...

So it'd be nice to see the struggle with their adult mentalities and their childish personality, especially when their child personality would take presedence due to their adult mentalitites being nothing more than their mind. Perhaps a split personality?
