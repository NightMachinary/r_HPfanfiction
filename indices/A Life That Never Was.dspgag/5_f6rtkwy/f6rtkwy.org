Reminds me of some coma patient scenarios. Live an entire life, with some weird stuff being "off", and then it turns out the life was a lie.

I remember a SS&HP fic that had a similar premise to this, more or less. Some creature, as part of killing their prey, induces a perfect life hallucination. It wasn't a Severitus, but it had some similar themes of it -- Harry's parents was alive (in this "universe", SS was ultimately able to protect the Potters and avoid their deaths -- /both/ of them), and SS becomes a honorary uncle alongside the Marauders. He was able to move on from Lily, so there was ultimately no awkwardness in that regard, thankfully. In the end, they get closer -- not father-son close, but more mentor-level close.
