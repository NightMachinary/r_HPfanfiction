  Dumbledore and Sirius are worried they'll elope to Gretna Green the moment they're both fourteen or fifteen.

  They're still in love with each other and still act like a long-standing husband and wife couple, such as setting up dinner dates and the like, albeit with a degenerated dynamic because they're young, awkward teens again, on top of them pretty much both suffering from a large amount of trauma or even PTSD

The marriage age in Scotland is still 16. I feel like the bigger issue you run into is that they are, for all intents and purposes, mentally adults in the bodies of children. They had children. Which means that they will be used to the idea of sex with each other. And very familiar with each other's bodies. Legal or not, they will end up having sex with each other. Because the hardware is certainly there. Which is all kinds of questionable to write. But everything else is utterly unrealistic if they were happy with each other.

  If Daphne were a cold bitch and a firm believer in blood-purity and thought muggles were animals, for example, her 'experiences' in the dream-life could have made her do a one-eighty or at least become a lot softer or tolerable, astounding and disconcerting her friends/housemates/family.

Who cares about her peers. She is an adult, as is Harry. After living and fighting through a civil war and being adults for more than a decade, do you really think they would care what background character #5486 thinks? Harry has no family, and Daphne's is apparently a bunch of bigots who would not tolerate Harry. The only troubling disconnect I can see is with her little sister.
