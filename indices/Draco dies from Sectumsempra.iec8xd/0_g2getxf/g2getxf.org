Even if Draco dies, Snape would not be dying as he had no legitimate way of saving Draco if he simply was late or did not know Draco was dying.

The wording matters:

*Narcissa: "Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?"

Snape: "I will."

Narcissa: "And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"

Snape: "I will."

Narcissa: "And should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail... will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"

Snape: "I will."*

And as Snape does not die, rest will still go in similar vain cause the vow does not put a time limit, and as long as Snape still plans to kill him at some point.

The DEs coming in to Hogwarts will change though, and might not even happen, instead end of the year we just see Snape kill Dumbledore and be with it

Edit' thought I was in general HP sub and not the fanfic.. I will leave the comment though.

No fanfic recs though
