So I actually wrote a fic on this. I'm sure you'll find grammar errors and it is marked as incomplete but it is a one shot. I haven't decided to turn it into a “what if” for the rest of books 6&7. Right now I'm working on ATLA fics. I've seen some other stories like that but they are all Draco/Harry stories and I'm not into slash. I tried to be realistic with it, but I think I made Harry more intelligent than he actually is.
