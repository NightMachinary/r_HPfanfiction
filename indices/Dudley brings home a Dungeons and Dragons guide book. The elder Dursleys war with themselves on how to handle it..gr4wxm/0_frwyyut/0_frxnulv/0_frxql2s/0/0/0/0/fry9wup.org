Yeah, you're right, I should have qualified my point with that. From what I recall, there's not much in the text that supports anything worse than what would have been acceptable for corporal punishment for a boy in the 90s. We can see this in the 3rd book, when Harry tells Marge that he got lots of canings at school - at least in the US, paddling was still an acceptable punishment in the 90s.
