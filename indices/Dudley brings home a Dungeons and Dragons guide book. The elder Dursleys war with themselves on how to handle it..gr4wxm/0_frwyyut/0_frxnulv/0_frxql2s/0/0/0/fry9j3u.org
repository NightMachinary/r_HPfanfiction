Vernon attempts to throttle Harry at one point and Petunia hits him with stuff she has on hand.

I always took it by Vernon's comment in Philosopher's Stone (about how he should have tried his idea at "beating the magic out of Harry") however that they never beat Harry as extensively as fanon would have it be believed.

And to be totally honest, in that area they would not have been much worse than most parents at that point in time, a smack here and there, a backhand etc.

Dudley on the other hand, did beat up Harry and Petunia and Vernon did nothing.
