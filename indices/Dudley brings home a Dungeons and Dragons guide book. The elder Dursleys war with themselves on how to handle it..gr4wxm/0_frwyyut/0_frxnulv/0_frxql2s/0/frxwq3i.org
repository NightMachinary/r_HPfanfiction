I don't know about that. I think that Harry's reaction to the abuse is unrealistic, but then not many people really wants to read a realistic story about how a kid copes with abuse. Some people do make the abuse harsher than it was in canon, but Harry is a case study in neglect.

I think the fact that he's perfectly willing to live with an escaped ex-con that he just met instead of the Dursleys is rather telling though.
