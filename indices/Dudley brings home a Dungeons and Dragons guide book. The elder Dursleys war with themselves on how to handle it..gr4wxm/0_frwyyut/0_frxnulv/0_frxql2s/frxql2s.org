Yeah, I always got the feeling from canon that Harry was allowed to move around the house and what not. He had the same types of things as Dudley, just less/inferior versions of them: a cupboard instead of a room, hand me down clothes, more chores/less free time, even the ice creams at the zoo. It is absolutely still cruel and would take some real emotional healing to address but it's also not flaying his skin or whatever.
