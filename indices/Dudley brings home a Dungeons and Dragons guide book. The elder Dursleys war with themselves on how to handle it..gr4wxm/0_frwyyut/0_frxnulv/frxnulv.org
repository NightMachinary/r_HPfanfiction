I took a quick look through the first few chapters and all I could find was "If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon --- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas." Which actually suggests Dudley was allowed to watch cartoons and fantasy things and even that Harry may have been. He was just punished for talking about them I guess.
