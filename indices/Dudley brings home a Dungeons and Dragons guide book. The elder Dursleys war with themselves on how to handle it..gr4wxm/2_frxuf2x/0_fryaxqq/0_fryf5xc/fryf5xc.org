Reminds me of the Dresden Files. The main character is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden, conjure by it at your peril. He's Chicago's resident wizard. You can find him in the phone book. At some point, he has some friends invite him to a tabletop gaming session. He elects to play a brainless barbarian warrior.
