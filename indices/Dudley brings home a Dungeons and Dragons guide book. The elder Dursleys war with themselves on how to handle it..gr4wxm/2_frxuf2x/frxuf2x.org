I could see Dudley getting really into D&D and when he learns that Harry is truly a wizard (or if known already), taking some of those elements of what he might fitness when he makes characters who use magic. Maybe he and Harry start playing D&D together at some point, and even though Dudley is horrible to Harry otherwise, this would be the one thing both of them bonded over, slowly becoming closer and maybe even Dudley playing D&D and having his/others characters using magic etc, would make him think better of Harry...
