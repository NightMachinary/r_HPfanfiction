Harry was nervous and doing his best to ignore the cold, building feeling that made it feel like a snake was slowly squeezing his stomach. He just knew he was going to be punished hard this time, at least a lot of yelling and being hungry in the dark.

This time, something really scary had happened during the biweekly free period he would spend running for his life from Dudley and his friends. Just as he was really running out of breath, and the panic of the ensuing mocking and hitting exploded out of him like fire.

Suddenly he was on the roof, far away from Dudley but suddenly in a much more dire situation. Not that he couldn't get down from the roof. Harry was no stranger to climbing to get away from his troubles, but once he got to the edge of the roof and was about to climb down, he locked eyes with his cousin across the playground.

Dudley didn't chase him, didn't call out to his friends. Dudley just kept staring at him the rest of the schoolday, his eyebrows scrunched together in thought.

Dudley was going to tell on him, just like when he'd turned his teacher's hair blue and Uncle Vernon had pulled on his ear so hard Harry thought it'd tear right off.

As Harry reached reached the edge of Privet Drive, the snake in his gut felt like a ten foot python with an insatiable dry-ice addiction, but his anxiety came to a confused, stuttering end when Dudley came out of the front door, looking just as pale as Harry felt he did himself.

"H-Harry, wait. I wanna talk to you." Dudley spoke as he leaned in closer and continued in a whisper "/away/ from Mum and Dad"

"I'm not gonna get yelled at for not coming right home and doing my chores?" Harry retorted, seeing the obvious trap.

"Look, I already told Mum I was going to make you drag my bike up that big hill near Tesco, we won't be back for hours. I just, Just /please/ Harry" Dudley begged, his shaking voice almost giving out as he kept scanning the neighbourhood "We can't talk about it here, it could be /dangerous/"

Dudley Didn't lead him behind Tesco, or made him drag a bike around. Instead he pulled out a beautiful, colourful book, showing him page after page and babbling an explanation about a book that was also a game, about spells and levels classes.

Dudley was explaining one spell with particular enthusiasm, but struggling with the bigger words. Harry read the description around his cousin's chubby index finger and picked up where Dudley began to falter.

"Dimension door allows the caster to instantly transfer themself from their current location to any other spot within range" Harry read dilligently, then came to a crashing conclusion. "You're saying I cast a spell... like a wizard?"

"Not quite, you didn't have a spellbook or a staff or anything." Dudley beamed triumphantly and began turning back through the book, almost to the very beginning before exclaiming. "You're a sorcerer, Harry! A bloody /level seven/ sorcerer if this book is telling the truth."

The two cousins kept talking, quietly and nervously about the totally awesome things Harry was /supposed/ to be able to do with this newfound discovery, but when the subject turned to which bloodline he was supposed to have, his cousin's ideas started getting stranger and scarier.

"You see it runs in families, but not everyone has it. I don't think I have it or anything, but maybe your Mum and Dad /did/. Maybe they didn't die in a car crash, maybe they blew up in a wild magic fireball, maybe the MI6 took them away and they managed to hide you away with us."

The shaking in Dudley's voice from the front porch was back in full force and Harry was starting to empathize as the realizations kept hammering into his poor mind.

"I think Dad knows something, but doesn't really understand or maybe doesn't believe in it." Dudley continued. " Mum definitely knows something and I think she's scared. I think she's scared whatever happened to your Mum will happen to you, too."
