--------------

First it quickly goes through the HP-arc; where the fem!Harry builds her support base.

Then it goes to it's /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/ Crossover, where fem!Harry&co interact with that story...

Much of the story is about the old guard being led by Corrupt, Incompetent and/or mentally sick^{due to age} and the MCs going 'whyy' and working (competently) around/against the old guard.

the HP portion is Complete, Hitman portion also has completed an arc (ring-battle) so I feel like you get 1-3 complete stories from this fic before it hits its current chapter. (nor I don't feel like calling it dead )
