He creates wands on two separate occasions. But it's well over 100k words before he creates a true wand. If you're looking for a super action story this might not be for you. At no point in the story up to this point does Harry just roflstomp middle earth because he has magic and they don't. The closest it comes to that is in the last chapter that was released and it's a well exaggerated story told from father to son for a couple hundred years before we hear it's telling.

He does also eventually regain his old features so he isn't stuck looking like Gollum the whole story.
