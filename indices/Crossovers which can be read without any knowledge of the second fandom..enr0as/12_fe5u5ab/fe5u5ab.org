Not on FFN or AO3, but [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6214/Mhalachai+Inevitable.htm][this one]] is my favorite. It is an Anita Blake crossover that is honestly better than any of the Anita Blake novels (they are not especially well written but have some cool worldbuilding ideas). It is complete and all pairings involved are minor subplots.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][This one]] also works. Again, it is not on FFN or AO3, it is complete, and all pairings are minor subplots. I will admit that I am so intimately familiar with the other setting I have a hard time telling what knowledge is crucial, but it is written from the perspective of Ginny so I feel like the author does a decent job of explaining everything important.
