Since somebody already mentioned Browncoat...

Finding Home - Avengers. To be honest, I suspect that all MCU crossovers can be read without actually watching the films - I certainly read a LOT of them before sitting down with the movies. I will say though that watching Iron Man first will make you understand why people don't murder Tony Stark, however. MoD!Harry

A Child Avenged - Avengers, MoD!Harry oneshot.

The Elvenqueen - Tolkien (general). The events of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are relatively minor parts of this story, and twisted in an interesting way such that knowledge of canon doesn't matter in the slightest. Hermione centric, rebirth fic. The first couple chapters are odd but give it a shot and it'll pay off in the end.

Incendio - The Hobbit. A retelling of the Hobbit, you don't need to have read the book or watched the monstrosity of a movie first. Harry is a dragon.

Through the Wormhole - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I suspect that you can get away without having watched the TV show, as it more or less follows it along. However - if you have the slightest interest in Sci-Fi, I'd suggest picking up a "watch these essential episodes" guide for DS9 and watching it. It's aged /much/ better than it's counterpart Babylon 5.

Gods Among Us - Battlestar Galactica. I've never watched the series, and I muddled through this fic just fine. It explains things, and it helps that Harry and Hermione have no idea WTF is going on either.
