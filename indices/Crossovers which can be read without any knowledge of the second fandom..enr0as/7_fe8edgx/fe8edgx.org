Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is my favorite technically crossover fic, which is with Dungeons and Dragons. But there's no need to know anything about the game (other than some of the very basics, I guess - like it's a fantasy RPG that uses a 20 sided dice), even if some of the jokes/references get funnier if you know them. I'd heartily recommend this one - it's probably my favorite HP fic overall.

Another that I remember being funny (in a crack fic sort of way) was the linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens) set of fics - where Harry gets whisked away for a time to WH40K's universe before returning completely changed. All you need to know there (at least, all I knew going into that one) was that WH40K was insanely warlike, and that most humans have almost fanatical worship of the dying God-Emperor. But it's been a long time since I read this, so take it with an asterisk.
