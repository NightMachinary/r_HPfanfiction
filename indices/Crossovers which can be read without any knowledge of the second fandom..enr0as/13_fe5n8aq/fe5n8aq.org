im tired so will put a link in later but the pureblood pretence fits perfectly! it's a crossover with Alana the lioness (i think that's the name) - i haven't read it & the fic is one of my favourites so you don't need any knowledge of it:) the first few books are complete and the current one is being updated slowly - i know you said you'd rather they be complete but it's definitely worth reading even though it isn't yet!

on a similar note, if you do enjoy reading the pureblood pretence there's a fanfic series of it which is a m a z i n g - from america with love. it's less of a crossover but i would definitely reccomend it! again ill put a link in later
