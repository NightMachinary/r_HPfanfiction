To Know You Is To Love You is really good.

Ron and Hermione, shortly before they get married and uncertain about whether or not their relationship is strong enough to last, undergo a very unique kind of relationship councelling, where they essentially experience each others' lives from each others' point of view.

Which means that the bulk of the story is essentially a retelling of the HP novels from Ron and Hermione's POV -- so in addition to the familiar plot you get a lot of scenes where you see what Ron and Hermione were up to when Harry wasn't around. Plus, the adult Ron and Hermione are experiencing the story along with the reader, and so you get to see their reactions and revelations as they re-experience their lives from each others' POV.
