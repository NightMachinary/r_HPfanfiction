Here are two I found by an author called little_bird (now little0bird) on fiction alley back in 2012 that have remained my favourite since i read them. They are set in the same universe at different points in their lives and are both complete and cannon compliant with the 19 years later.

Treehouses and daises

"Ron and Hermione in the weeks after they return to the Burrow"

Burning down the house

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3999345/1/Burning-Down-the-House]]

"Some things come easily for some people. Then, there's Ron and Hermione"

Another one that is quite good is Australia (from a different author) where Ron travels with Hermione to find her parents in Australia after the war and how he deals with his brothers death.

"Ron grieves the loss of his brother and tries to figure out life after the war while trying to navigate his new relationship with Hermione"
