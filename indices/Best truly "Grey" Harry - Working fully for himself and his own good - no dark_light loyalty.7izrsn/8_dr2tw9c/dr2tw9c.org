Feels like you are describing For Love of Magic... linkffn(11669575) .

Though he doesn't ignore Voldemort, as he is still a target.

Harem fic, lots of smut, no slash. Long power build op that doesn't just stop because the author runs out of ideas once the "training" is done...

I think Harry is a bit "in your face" with his values and principles, but the writing is competent and the take on runes (powerful but dangerous, even the main hero has a price to pay) is one I like.

Dodging prison and stealing witches, linkffn(11574569) si often recommended but kinda has a whole "light/grey/dark Lord" system, so it's right up what you asked for.
