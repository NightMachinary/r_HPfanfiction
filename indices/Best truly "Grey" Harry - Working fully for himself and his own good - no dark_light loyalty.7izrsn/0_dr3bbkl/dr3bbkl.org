But, the issue is a grey(gray?) Harry would totally want to kill Voldemort. Voldemort murdered his parents. No dude gets over that, especially one that isn't averse to murder.

Canon Harry isn't manipulated into fighting Voldemort. Contrary to fanon, Harry desperately wants to fight. He wants to kill Voldemort.
