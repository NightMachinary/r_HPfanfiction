Gray and Grey both mean the same thing in the English language. Gray is more utilized in the US, Grey in the UK. Hence, i tried to use Grey since its Harry Potter lol.

As for the "issue" as you call it, thats not necessarily correct. In the books yes Harry has a grudge against Voldemort, in large part because of his parent's deaths. However, a couple points here.

First off, just because he wants to kill Voldemort does NOT mean he's on any side (light/dark/whatever) Him killing Voldemort can easily be because its what HE wants, not because its what others want/expect. And Grey does NOT equal neutral. So effectively, him being grey has nothing to do with whether Voldemort dies or not.

Secondly, the implication that "no dude gets over that" is blindly false. This is fan fiction after all and Harry does not have to be portrayed as he was in the books. He could easily "get over it" as it were and move on with his life. After all, he never actually knew his parents, and until he heard the true story, thought they died in a car crash. Even after hearing the story he did not really start to "hate" Voldemort till much later. And if he was raised differently, perhaps more in control of himself and focused on his own goals or desires?....

Finally, Canon Harry is most definitely manipulated. Would he fight Voldemort without the manipulation? Sure he would. But again, that's book Harry. This is fan fiction. I also do not get how this is in any way an issue with regards to him being possibly grey. Again, grey does not mean neutral, and one can be grey, and still kill, torture, forgive, accept, or whatever it may be if it suits them.
