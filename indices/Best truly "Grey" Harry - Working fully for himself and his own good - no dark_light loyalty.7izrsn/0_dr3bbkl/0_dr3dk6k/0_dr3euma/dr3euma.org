Well, the only issue I was pointing out was "not caring about Voldemort's agenda".

He's going to want to kill Voldemort. Even in linkffn(On The Way to Greatness) which has the grayest of gray Harrys, he hesitates to remain neutral, mostly because he has to give up killing Voldemort.

Also worth reading linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Pretty gray there.
