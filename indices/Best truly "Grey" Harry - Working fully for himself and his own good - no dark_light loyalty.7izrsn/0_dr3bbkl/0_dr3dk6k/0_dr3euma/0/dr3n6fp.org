Fair enough, although once again, neutrally is NOT grey. Several people in this thread have made that mistake. Neutral means not willing to be involved in any way. If you are "grey" you may play both sides or even assist one or the other for a time, but only for YOUR gain, and usually with an eventual goal in mind that is for your benefit but not tied into any side. Let's be honest, Harry could want to kill Voldemort, but not because of any agenda of the light or dark sides, but rather for his personal benefit. Hell, he could kill Voldemort and Dumbledore in secret and fill the power vacuum that creates. That's still grey, but certainly not neutral.

I've read "On the Way to Greatness", but not the other one, although as it says "mentor Voldemort" in the description I question how it would be grey unless he's playing Voldemort or has his own outside agenda that goes against Voldemorts. But ill check it out.
