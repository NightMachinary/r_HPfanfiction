So neutral doesn't necessarily imply staying outside conflict entirely. It really is not commiting to a side. An example is the US in early ww1. They sold weapons to both the british and the germans.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a great Gray Harry fic. The premise is, a sane and rational Voldemort already won. He controlls wizarding britain. Muggleborns are removed from the Muggle World through WYRA, the Wizard Youth Reclamation Act. Talented Muggleborns are adopted by purebloods.

In this fic, Voldemort did /not/ kill Harry's parents. When they found out about the prophecy, they fled the country. They're actually killed by muggles. Basically, Harry catches Voldemort's eye. He mentors him, looks after him, finances him. On the other side Albus Dumbledore and the rest of the Order are in Europe. They eventually make contact with Harry, and he essentially plays both sides.

I did notice you believe in "manipulative evil Dumbledore" (which I'll admit I'm not a fan of). This doesn't really have that, which makes Harry even more confused. Who to follow? The good? Or the man who essentially raised him? Regardless, it's a great read, and you really should read it.
