  First, the fidelius had just failed. Dumbledore thought he had just been betrayed by his inner circle.
#+end_quote

I am not sure I would call the "marauders" his inner circle. In fact, in canon it is implied that James and Lily are fairly young members and NOT that important outside of being skilled contributors if you will. And the other 3 mauraders are connected through them. Also you yourself said he trusted McGonagall or Hagrid, so why not have one of them be the keeper. Hell, McGonagall herself did not want Harry with the Dursleys. The only argument I would concede here is that because of the timeline the Dursleys may have been the best option briefly and temporarily, but not for his whole childhood. But then that asks the question, did Dumbledore NEED to do this in 24 hours? Surely he could have kept Harry hidden at Hogwarts for a time while figuring out what to do. He literally took him straight from place to place.

  This is a cultural difference.
#+end_quote

I will concede to some degree to your points in this paragraph. It was a different time for sure, as well as a different culture. However, I actually spent time in the UK as a kid with family friends in a house quite similar to the canon description and honestly not that far from the location either. I assure you, a cupboard under the stairs is hardly a room of any sort. Its a closet plain and simple but with a heavily slanted roof. I could continue the argument that being nutrition starved, and other elements constitute abuse, regardless of if hes going to school or not, but I feel we are at an impasse here in terms of what would or would not be considered abuse, even accounting for the cultural and time differences.

  Technical mishap on my part. I meant blood protection. Considering, as you said, the wards are powered from the protection, the intent is the same.
#+end_quote

We never really know what the blood wards would actually do apart from hide Harry, which seems to imply some sort of Fidelius like system. He could clearly go out without fear, the implication being that he could not be found by those wishing him harm. It is likely it's not just about preventing entrance. Point is, the intent is not exactly the same because of this factor. But this is also a debate that is not really resolvable without more information.

  How well did you know the headmaster/principal of your school?
#+end_quote

I am fairly sure going by Harry's and everyone around him years at Hogwarts that Dumbledore would have been seen repeatedly by Molly/Arthur and there would have been some communication as well. I never said they would "know him well", but certainly both would not have been an unknown to Dumbledore and he to them. I mean the school sees him at many meals and he seems to converse with students at times, and show up at sporting events and whatnot. Hes a fairly visable headmaster. And again, we dont know how close hew as to Molly/Arther coming out of school, but we DO know that Dumbledore knew the Prewitt twins well, and this suggests some level of contact between him and Molly's family may have been normal.

  Because Dumbledore actively thought he was guilty.
#+end_quote

That still does not explain Dumbledore ignoring the situation. Regardless of if Dumbledore thought he was guilty, the reasonable thing would be to put the accused to truth serum and find out information would it not? Why would you toss away what could be a valuable source of intel? No, its simply not reasonable to accept that Dumbledore believed he was guilty, and therefore simply let him be thrown in Azkaban without ANY interrogation, or trial.

#+begin_quote
  I detest the argument that Dumbledore should have "trained" Harry.
#+end_quote

I think this may be because of the loose nature of "trained". I understand that. However it would not have been hard to train him simply by being open and honest with him, rather than hiding things. By providing assistance as it pertains to mental preparation, historical context, and reasoning without delay and without misrepresentation. It does not have to mean physical or even magical training of any sort.

#+begin_quote
  I just hesitate to use the word "manipulate" mostly because it has such a negative connotation. I think the far more appropriate word is, plan. He's a general. He made his mistakes, but most of the actions he took were beneficial, and he was very meticulous in his strategy.
#+end_quote

This I fully support. You are right that manipulate often has negative connotations. I understand your hesitation and again I want to make it clear I dont think Dumbledore was evil in ANY sense of the word. I do however think his history caused him to become misguided at times, and his treatment of situations and those around him, stunk of a belief that he knew best. Someone's heart and mind can be in the right place, and they can still screw things up badly, and manipulate in an effort to help.
