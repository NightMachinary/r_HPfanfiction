A minor nitpick: Madam Rowling did not use the word “ward” to refer to magical effects of the kind that the fandom calls wards. Hogwarts has “protections”, and likewise, from the beginning to the very end, the protective effect on Harry that relies on the blood of Lily's relative is called “blood protection”, and there are no wards there anywhere.

But, as I wrote already, it's just a minor nitpick.
