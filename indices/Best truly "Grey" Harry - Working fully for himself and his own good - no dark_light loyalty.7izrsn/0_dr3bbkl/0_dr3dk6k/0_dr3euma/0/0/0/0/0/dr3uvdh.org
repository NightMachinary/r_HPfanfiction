I will consent that the whole WW1 does depend on definition, although again I will refer to what historical textbooks say which states that "while the US and its leadership officially declared it was neutral, they did not maintain the necessary components to be accurately called neutral as it pertains to war." But lets ignore that whole debate...

  Placing Harry with the Dursleys. It really was the best option. The blood wards that he's under are strong. Remember, they literally burned Quirrell's face off. Considering that just six months after Voldemort's disappearance, Bellatrix went after the Longbottoms, other wizards & witches probably chased after Harry. Especially following Voldemort's collapse. Harry was best protected at the Dursleys. Also, he wasn't abused. Not truly. It seems to be isolation, and consistent bullying by Dudley that they turned a blind eye to. That's being neglectful and absent, not abuse. To a much more eloquent and coherent argument, I'll refer you here

Its a big leap to call it the "best option". There were other options certainly, although not with blood wards. But with the right type of secrecy, person, and a Fidelius charm? Perhaps at Hogwarts or across the pond? Without more info we certainly can not say it was the "best option", merely a good option. In addition, it was not the blood wards that burned Quirrells face off, but the blood protection. COMPLETELY different things, although they are connected in the sense that the blood wards are powered by that protection combined with remaining at blood relatives. In addition, I am not sure of your definition of abuse, but in the "real muggle" world, what they did WOULD, in fact, qualify as abuse. If the child protective services had shown up and found him locked in a cupboard and a failure to provide proper nutrition, throwing aside any possible physical aspects, they would still remove him from the situation and classify him as an abused child.

  He manipulated Harry into being friends with the Weasleys. The Weasley's were not in the Order during the first blood war. In fact, they stayed out of it, most likely due to their young children. The closest relatives they had were the Prewetts, Molly's brothers. They didn't really have a relationship with Dumbledore until they started taking care of Harry in the summers. At most, it was just admiration from afar. He was a figure in the community that had similar morals to them. Their relationship with Dumbledore was the same as mine with Barack Obama (my political hero).

Honestly we dont know enough to say how connected they were with Dumbledore before the Harry connection. And while I agree "manipulation" in this case may be a strong word, it is a bit unusual how the two sides meet at the train station, and I have found it entirely likely Dumbledore simply asked Molly to keep an eye out for Harry by the entrance. The Barack Obama comment is silly since Molly and Arthur would have met and been nearby Dumbledore way more often if only because of Hogwarts.

  Sirius's trial. "But, Dumbledore could have gotten him a trial! He didn't want Sirius to raise Harry" It's not clear exactly when Dumbledore was the chief warlock of the Wizengamot. But based on the pensieve memories from GoF, Dumbledore was only a member of the audience during the post-war trials. Assuming that Sirius's guilt was questioned around the same time, Dumbledore's only influence was confirming Sirius's place as the secret keeper.

As you said, we dont really know enough in this case to pass judgement, although once again the question is raised of, why wouldnt he do more? Even without being chief warlock, he was the hero who defeated Grindlewald, held a seat, and could easily have had some sway in the matter. If to do nothing else than request truth serum.

  "He made Harry walk to his death, raised him from age 0 as a pig from slaughter" - Dumbledore didn't really find out about the Horcruxes until 1996. He had his suspicions of course, but he tells Harry that he truly only confirmed it with the existence of the ring. That means he probably realizes the truth about Harry somewhere around that timeframe. He doesn't want to sacrifice Harry either. In the Snape Memory, he refers to all the time he spends trying to rid Harry of the Horcrux. He then realizes the best chance for Harry to live is for him to sacrifice himself, and use the blood tie he established with Voldemort.

I have never believed Dumbledore raised him to be a pig for the slaughter. But I DO believe that Dumbledore had an idea what Harry may have to do and hesitated to train or prepare him because of it, not knowing what it might do with regards to the prophecy. You yourself mention that he only confirmed it with the ring, but he had his suspicions long before that and we can see that from year 1 with Quirrel. In addition, instead of openly talking to Harry, he delays and delays, which seems really odd, even accounting for his whole idea of not putting burdens on Harry's shoulders.

At the end of the day, its obvious that Dumbledores plans are convoluted, excessively complicated, and a bit odd. The question has been, how much of that was intention, how much was simple mistake, and how much was innocent.

  My conclusion - Dumbledore never manipulated Harry, rather the events surrounding Harry. He set up the pieces for him, making it easy for Harry to take them down. He never once hurt people or society the way that Grindelwald did in his quest for the "Greater Good".

Ehhh see, but even if you say he did not directly manipulate Harry, if hes manipluating events AROUND Harry, which by their very definition would affect Harry, thats manipulating Harry. The argument as to how many he "hurt" is a whole other one as there are a variety of deaths, including his own, that could be questioned with regards to how much he could have prevented if he had been open, and honest with Harry. For example the death of sirius alone would have been prevented if Dumbledore had been open with Harry. Yes its not exactly direct manipluation, but its certainly mistakes made that were due to Dumbledore trying to control events, and guide things in a way he thought was best.

This is why i dont use the term "evil" with Dumbledore. But simply say he was a manipulator and not always for the best.

Also, my favorite character is Luna ;)
