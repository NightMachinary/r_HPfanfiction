  So neutral doesn't necessarily imply staying outside conflict entirely. It really is not commiting to a side. An example is the US in early ww1. They sold weapons to both the british and the germans.

Its been established through (by historical scholars, in textbooks, and the like) that the US was not truly neutral by the very fact that they participated via selling weapons. Maybe there was the perception of neutrality, but it was only that, a perception.

  I did notice you believe in "manipulative evil Dumbledore" (which I'll admit I'm not a fan of).
#+end_quote

Not exactly. I believe Dumbledore did heavily manipulate Harry, and the circumstances surrounding Harry, however, I don't believe it was because he was evil, but rather he simply believes what he is doing is right. His heart was in the right place but he made poor choices with the belief that he was right, often ignoring hints or feedback otherwise.

I have long subscribed to the belief that Dumbledore fell into the same trap as Grindlewald, and their connection as youths only furthers this belief in my mind. Not evil, but misguided individuals the both of them. While Grindelwald took a much darker path, Dumbledore went the other way, but they both ended up extremists on opposite sides in a way, and both, while not necessarily inherently evil, had their issues. Voldemort on the other hand was truely evil.

Thanks for the info on the Prince fic. I'll definitely give it a read.
