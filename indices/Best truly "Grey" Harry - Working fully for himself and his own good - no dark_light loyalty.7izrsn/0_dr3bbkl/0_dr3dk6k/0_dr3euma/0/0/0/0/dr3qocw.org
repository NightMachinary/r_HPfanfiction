Yeah alright, I have to have a debate. Dumbledore is hands down, my favorite character in the entire series. I'll cop to some manipulation, but I don't think he "fell" to the idea of the greater good.

First, about ww1. The US wasn't neutral according to your definition of neutral (as well as others). We're not going to reach a consensus on this point simply because we have differing definitions. The US was /officially/ neutral until 1917, since they didn't commit to a side by having Congress declaring war on either side.

Next, Manipulative Dumbledore. Dumbledore isn't ever /truly/ manipulative. I'm going to go over some famous "manipulative Dumbledore" points. Let's talk about that in chronological order:

- Placing Harry with the Dursleys. It really was the best option. The blood wards that he's under are /strong/. Remember, they literally burned Quirrell's face off. Considering that just six months after Voldemort's disappearance, Bellatrix went after the Longbottoms, other wizards & witches probably chased after Harry. Especially following Voldemort's collapse. Harry was best protected at the Dursleys. Also, he /wasn't/ abused. Not truly. It seems to be isolation, and consistent bullying by Dudley that they turned a blind eye to. That's being neglectful and absent, /not/ abuse. To a much more eloquent and coherent argument, I'll refer you [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm#abusive_Dursleys][here]]
- He manipulated Harry into being friends with the Weasleys. The Weasley's were /not/ in the Order during the first blood war. In fact, they stayed out of it, most likely due to their young children. The closest relatives they had were the Prewetts, Molly's brothers. They didn't really have a relationship with Dumbledore until they started taking care of Harry in the summers. At most, it was just admiration from afar. He was a figure in the community that had similar morals to them. Their relationship with Dumbledore was the same as mine with Barack Obama (my political hero).
- Sirius's trial. "But, Dumbledore could have gotten him a trial! He didn't want Sirius to raise Harry" It's not clear exactly when Dumbledore was the chief warlock of the Wizengamot. But based on the pensieve memories from GoF, Dumbledore was only a member of the audience during the post-war trials. Assuming that Sirius's guilt was questioned around the same time, Dumbledore's only influence was confirming Sirius's place as the secret keeper.
- "He made Harry walk to his death, raised him from age 0 as a pig from slaughter" - Dumbledore didn't really find out about the horcruxes until 1996. He had his suspicions of course, but he tells Harry that he truly only confirmed it with the existence of the ring. That means he probably realizes the truth about Harry somewhere around that timeframe. He doesn't want to sacrifice Harry either. In the Snape Memory, he refers to all the time he spends trying to rid Harry of the Horcrux. He then realizes the best chance for Harry to live is for him to sacrifice himself, and use the blood tie he established with Voldemort.

My conclusion - Dumbledore never manipulated Harry, rather the events surrounding Harry. He set up the pieces for him, making it easy for Harry to take them down. He never once hurt people or society the way that Grindelwald did in his quest for the "Greater Good".
