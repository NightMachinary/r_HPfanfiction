  There were other options certainly, although not with blood wards. But with the right type of secrecy, person, and a Fidelius charm? Perhaps at Hogwarts or across the pond? Without more info we certainly can not say it was the "best option", merely a good option.

First, the fidelius had /just/ failed. Dumbledore thought he had just been betrayed by his inner circle. And he was, just not the person he thought. He had very few people he could trust-the only two being McGonagall and Hagrid. You also have to take into account, he had to do this in 24 hours. When you take into account the betrayal, as well as the existing blood protection, the Dursleys really were the best option.

  In addition, I am not sure of your definition of abuse, but in the "real muggle" world, what they did WOULD, in fact, qualify as abuse. If the child protective services had shown up and found him locked in a cupboard and a failure to provide proper nutrition, throwing aside any possible physical aspects, they would still remove him from the situation and classify him as an abused child.

This is a cultural difference. The "closets" in Britain aren't quite closets. If you quote canon, there's room for a bed, and Vernon, a man of considerable girth, to move unimpeded. That suggests that the cupboard is actually the size of a small room. They had simply given him the smallest room. You're also making your abuse determination from a modern bias. In the 90's when JK wrote the book, the notion of abuse was far different. Spanking was still a reasonable punishment. Locking a kid in his room to ground him was acceptable. Also, in canon, Harry isn't locked without meals, or daylight. He still goes to school. He's just grounded. In the 90's that wasn't abuse. Of course, that's semantics. Abuse is abuse, regardless of the time period. But, what that explanation means is that JK didn't write Harry to be an abused character, just an emotionally isolated and neglected one. If you observe his actions from this point of view, you find a boy who desires friendship and companionship.

  In addition, it was not the blood wards that burned Quirrells face off, but the blood protection. COMPLETELY different things, although they are connected in the sense that the blood wards are powered by that protection combined with remaining at blood relatives.

Technical mishap on my part. I meant blood protection. Considering, as you said, the wards are powered from the protection, the intent is the same.

  Honestly we dont know enough to say how connected they were with Dumbledore before the Harry connection. And while I agree "manipulation" in this case may be a strong word, it is a bit unusual how the two sides meet at the train station, and I have found it entirely likely Dumbledore simply asked Molly to keep an eye out for Harry by the entrance. The Barack Obama comment is silly since Molly and Arthur would have met and been nearby Dumbledore way more often if only because of Hogwarts.

How well did you know the headmaster/principal of your school? Especially because Dumbledore is a very hands-off headmaster, Mcgonagall seems to run more of the day to day of the school. Maybe the relationship isn't as far as me and Barack (an exaggeration), it's not close enough for Dumbledore to ask Molly to keep an eye on Harry.

  As you said, we dont really know enough in this case to pass judgement, although once again the question is raised of, why wouldnt he do more? Even without being chief warlock, he was the hero who defeated Grindlewald, held a seat, and could easily have had some sway in the matter. If to do nothing else than request truth serum.

Because Dumbledore actively thought he was guilty. The premise of why didn't Dumbledore try harder is flawed. It assumes Dumbledore knew of Sirius's innocence. Considering the actions that Sirius took, confronting pettigrew, laughing in a deranged manner-screaming "It's all my fault! I did it" as he was apprehended, Dumbledore had no reason to believe in his innocence. Dumbledore is reasonable, and believes Sirius when he approaches him in 3rd year. If Sirius had acted rationally (Hard to do when your best friends are killed), it could have been avoided.

  But I DO believe that Dumbledore had an idea what Harry may have to do and hesitated to train or prepare him because of it, not knowing what it might do with regards to the prophecy. You yourself mention that he only confirmed it with the ring, but he had his suspicions long before that and we can see that from year 1 with Quirrel. In addition, instead of openly talking to Harry, he delays and delays, which seems really odd, even accounting for his whole idea of not putting burdens on Harry's shoulders.

I detest the argument that Dumbledore should have "trained" Harry. Trained him for what? Voldemort is a wizard that will always be beyond Harry's reaches, even if he were a genius. Voldemort's natural talent combined with years of experience are an impossible hurdle. Harry does an /incredible/ amount of learning off screen. He's a legitimate prodigy at Defense. At 15, he's teaching seventh years. Keep in mind, the average wizard can't do a shield charm. He handles almost all Death Eaters, and reasonably can fight toe-to-toe with people like Bellatrix. While he's never going to be Voldemort or Dumbledore, I image post-canon Head of the DMLE Harry to be among the McGonagall's, Snapes, Shacklebolts, and Slughorns. Arguably even the best duellist they have during the Epilogue timeframe.

What Dumbledore did do is prepare him as best as he can. He helped Harry understand Tom, down to his very core, his motivations. This was crucial during DH, especially as Harry planned his next moves. It was especially crucial for Harry to find the Diadem. It was also how he knew that Voldemort would kill him, how he'd toss aside Snape, how he wouldn't understand Harry's protection on Hogwarts. Imo, Dumbledore prepared Harry almost as best as he could.

The prophecy and MoM incident is Dumbledore's fault, to be sure. Albus does tell Harry that he didn't want to tell him the prophecy, because he loves him, which is believable. Dumbledore and Harry are both close by the end of the series. Which, I think, indicates a deeper off-screen relationship, a more mundane one that Rowling didn't include in the books.

I just hesitate to use the word "manipulate" mostly because it has such a negative connotation. I think the far more appropriate word is, plan. He's a general. He made his mistakes, but most of the actions he took were beneficial, and he was very meticulous in his strategy.
