It's kinda a love it or hate it fic. Don't go in expecting a literary masterpiece; just go along for the ride. The first year or so is kinda weird (apparently Hogwarts has more Professors than in canon for alternating periods, more hufflepuffs than the ones named in canon) but it's pretty cool watching how far Harry goes to master Necromancy.
