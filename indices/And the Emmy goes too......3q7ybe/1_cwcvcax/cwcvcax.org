Ill even start us out. The Emmy for best comedy goes too [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]] Why...just read it. The relationship between Sirius and Harry is more like two brothers than godfather/godson. I wont spoil too much but when they keep waking up with random women that are linked by some crazy (but funny as hell) reason i actually laughed out loud. Oh and Bella trying to get pregnant.... i dont want to spoil too much just go read it.
