Interesting. I liked the part where they noted a possible misspelling in the inscription, and a commenter talked about accidentally cursing the wrong person. I can just see it backfiring for a Death Eater:

"Curse Boy Who Lived" - every male at Hogwarts gets a hangnail, because the curse is spread too thin.

"Curse Boy Who Loved" - for a short period of time, breakups are common, again because the curse is spread widely.

"Curse Toy Who Lived" - the Velveteen Rabbit suddenly finds things going poorly.
