Actually it was simply the result of a tantrum.

The author had an IRC channel that myself and a few others used to hang out in on a regular basis. After about a year or so without logging in I thought I'd go back over to say hi, catch up, see how people were doing etc.

He banned me from the channel as soon as he came online. I still have absolutely no idea why. I can only imagine that it was some kind of fit of jealousy based on my frequenting DLP instead of sticking with his dead IRC channel.

Anyway, in response to this betrayal I may have trolled the hell out of him. In response he pulled all his fics from FF.Net.
