Sadly, they pulled their material a little while back.

I'd direct you to any number of harem fics which might qualify, except that their authors don't realize that their version of Harry is evil.

Beyond that, there's this:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8190004/1/The-Star-Alliance][The Star Alliance]] by RahXephon

The year is 2599 and the Hogwarts Training Fleet of Witchcraft, Wizardry and Space Travel is accepting the latest batch of magician cadets. A bewildered Harry Potter enters a world of starships, intrigue and interspecies war while exploring new worlds and meeting diverse alien races. Yet will the human race be able to maintain its monopoly on magic? Sci-fi space era AU.

Again, author isn't quite clear that his Main Character is evil, but he is an acknowledged asshole (the character I mean- I know nothing about the author's possible ass-holish qualities).
