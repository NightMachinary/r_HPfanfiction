In many of the harem stories, our 'hero' is blessed with some sort of unusual power that permits him to assume control over any number of witches, all of whom join into the brood due to subtle adjustments of their attitudes towards sex and polyamory. Whether it's a life debt, the radiant effect of Harry's aura of power (with that 9000+ magic core) or simply because once he's had them, they want nothing more than to serve his urges ... it's all magical subjugation.

I don't have a problem with characters sleeping around, or even forming a true polyamorous trio (if properly developed)- so long as the witches keep their wits and their own interests alive.

There's something really pitiable when the writer feels that any woman who has been bedded by the main character should now permanently become part of his menagerie. How rejected one must feel to insist that the fantasy partner is henceforth incapable of saying 'no' or betraying them or even simply leaving them?
