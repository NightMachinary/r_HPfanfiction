Ah. Fair enough, sorry, my innately contrary nature makes me want to down vote anything which tells me not to (though I don't know if I'd feel like up voting anything which told me to down vote it, I think I'd probably down vote it because I'd expect the person to be trying to use reverse psychology on me).
