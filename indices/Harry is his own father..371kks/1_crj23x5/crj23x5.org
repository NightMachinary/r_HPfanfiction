While the whole cycle thing would be cool, I think I'd prefer it if he actually fights Voldemort and wins this time around.

Basically ending up in an AU where he suffers from an Oedipus situation where he "killed" his dad by replacing him during the transfer and ends up wooing his mother because initially he believes that he was his own dad. After he finds out he's in an AU situation, its already too late and he's already in love so he tries to just live life the best he can.

Anyways, that's a pretty cool setup, but the ending is a bit dark and it would make me sad. I prefer fluffier stories.
