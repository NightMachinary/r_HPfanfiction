  if Harry give Harry only JP genes

The idea is right, but part of genetic diversity is that [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Chromosomal_Crossover.svg/512px-Chromosomal_Crossover.svg.png][parts of mom and dad chromosomes will/can link up (forming a chiasmata) and then trade]], giving Harry a chromosome that is 90% Lily, but 10% James on the tip. So Harry's chromosomes are still 50% James and 50% Lily, but not necessarily separable and able to be reassigned to each parent as cleanly as one might think.

If that makes sense, sorry if it was a shitty explanation. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover][Wiki probably does it better]] but is more technical.
