I think that this is a little be biologically impossible - how someone can be their own parent? I mean, unless he made a sort of 'clone' of himself instead of a normal conception (50% of genes from each parent - and that is why I said it would be biologically impossible, btw).

Anyway, I can't see Harry doing a clone and impregnating Lily with it, because its not a very 'noble, nice' thing to do with his own mother...
