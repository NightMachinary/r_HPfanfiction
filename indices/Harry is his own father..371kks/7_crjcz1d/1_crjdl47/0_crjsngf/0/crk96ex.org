It isn't, but you have to understand the difference between "realistic" and "plausible given the internal context of the world". Most of what happens in Harry Potter is wildly unrealistic, but most of it is also internally consistent and plausible.

What about Harry merely replacing James Potter is more outlandish than his adult soul/mind/whatever possessing him? Can humans mate with house-elves? If not, why not when they can mate with goblins and veelas and giants? etc. Why does one thing make less sense than the other, given the context of the Harry Potter universe? I'm not one to say 'it's fantasy, nothing has to make sense' because I don't think that's true.

I'd usually agree with you, except that the Harry Potter universe is a bit of a special case. Its whole point is that it isn't normal, it isn't usual, and that the explanation of 'a wizard did it' is actually considered valid, because that's usually what happens. Other fantasy universes have strict rules for magic and what is and isn't possible. Harry Potter doesn't, really. So much of it has still been left undefined, and the use of magic within the setting canonically is so broad that it's difficult to infer much at all about its rules other than the ones we already know.
