I mean, the Minister literally had Barty Jr kissed minutes after finding out he was still alive without any form of investigation or anything. Even the countries that actually still have the Death Penalty wouldn't just summarily execute escaped criminals without at least looking into what happened. I believe even the US accepts that second trials are usually required in that instance. Or Fudge putting Hagrid in Azkaban (a human rights violation of a place itself, unarguably) without apparent trial or anything.

There's only so much you can be charitable about in a story where magic Nazis kick a useless and reoccurringly criminal government out of power and set up work camps for their political enemies.

I do agree with you on Sirius, though. People just fucked up on that one. There's no way a society that implicitly favours one racial demographic would lock up the eldest son of one of their most-liked family, no matter how rebellious he was.
