Of the three named house-elves we see, two suffer because they are slaves. One of them is forced to torture himself. They suffer because tehy are forced to work for and obey someone they hate. Forced to do things they abhor.

And the most prominent elf in the series wants to be free and is happy being free - proving that elves don't need to be slaves. The books state that they are magically bound - it's not some inherent need to be a slave.

Elves aren't dogs. Elves are enslaved people.
