I understand that the issue of slavery is rather painful in some countries, who had nasty run with it in not so distant past (almost every nation in the world practised slavery at some moment, fortunately for us, it was so far away in past, there is no real link to it now). Therefore, I understand, that even by asking this hypothetical, it may be too much for somebody. Please, don't be angry.

We really don't know much about the nature of house-elves. They are obviously not fully human. What if, just hypothetically, they really have different expectations of happiness. I know it was said about the African-American slaves they are not fully human, which was awful (and obviously not true), but what if ... what if it was true about house-elves. What if they were in their understanding of happiness closer to for example, dogs? What do you call removing a dog from the household of its owner? Liberation? I think it is actually closer to rejection and torture. What if house-elves were truly more like that?
