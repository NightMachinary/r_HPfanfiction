The books explicitly call it "enslavement". Dobby, Ron, Dumbledore call it enslavement. It's not in doubt. It's not "technically" slavery - it's slavery. House-elves are property - Harry inherits Kreacher from Sirius. They are magically bound to obey.

All that is clearly stated and shown in the book.
