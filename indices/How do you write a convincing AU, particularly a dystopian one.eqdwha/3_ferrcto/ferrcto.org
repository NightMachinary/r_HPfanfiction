It is hard to write a dystopia because there has to be a balance between the evils/flaws of the society and how well it is presented. Typically in novels, a dystopian society is presented as a eutopia and slowly the cracks begin to show. The dystopia also has to be believable for maximum impact.

The AU in this one shot really weaves in the dystopian theme. I think what made it work was that there was a tense suspenseful feeling even though this was following along a chapter we've all read. And then when Ron speaks and and the Sorting is set up you can slowly put together what changed and how wrong it is compared to the original chapter. Things are taken to the extreme, but within believable limits. The ending is very unsettling and makes you wonder what they will do.
