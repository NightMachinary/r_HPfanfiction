Hmm, okay.

Well, for the first, I think it depends on if your dystopia evolved or was imposed. Like, if Fudge gradually became more autocratic over time and ended up a dictatorial face for a Pureblood Authority, that creates a different setting than if Grindelwald returned and took over Britain after a war even if he imposed the same rules and authority practices. The Man in the High Castle is an excellent point of inspiration for the latter, while the former is more V for Vendetta. An evolved dystopia is usually far more subtle, far more tricksy, since it's usually through cunning and trickery that they got into power. Imposed dystopia relies on brainwashing the next generations and imposing/intimidating violence. Each pattern would be best served by different types of explanation.

Generally though, a good way to explain a dystopia is simply to demonstrate the effects. Living under a dystopia, especially one where you're aware it's a dystopia, is tense. Really, really tense. Like "I just lay down in bed and closed my eyes and something suddenly breathed" kind of tense. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for them to find that one thing you did wrong and get you for it. That tenseness is really at its best when shown rather than told. In The Man in the High Castle, characters often walk past armed soldiers while nervously keeping their eyes on the ground and hurrying past as quickly as they can. In V for Vendetta, there are signs on the streets marking a curfew enforced by guards. It's actually better that you don't go into too much detail, because the mystery is part of what makes a dystopia scary. "They go into the gulags, and they never come out." kind of vibes, you know? Have a lot of Propaganda and Branding stuff, too. A dystopian authority works best when a part of it is visible and talking. 'cause if that part is visible and talking, you don't see the hands moving behind the scenes.

Regarding characters, I'd give them a small rebellion. For instance, Imperial Japan is very traditional and would be against a lot of themes expressed in modern art. The Man in the High Castle has one of the main characters married to a modern artist and praises his art, which he quickly hides when representatives of authority comes past. Lets them show parts of how they'd be without the dystopia, but also lets the jaded, cynical, tense fear dominate when they keep that small rebellion hidden. Like Hermione, for instance. In a dystopian Magical Britain, she'd still be obsessed with books, but she wouldn't be quite so visible about it. She'd bury it and only let it out when she felt safe.

I could probably talk for ages more on this - I'm a psychologist, a D&D worldbuilder, and a culture nerd, so this fascinates the hell out of me on so many levels - but I need to sleep soon and I figure this is enough for you to read for this one. Feel free to ask more on anything I've said or missed and I'll do my best to help out. :)
