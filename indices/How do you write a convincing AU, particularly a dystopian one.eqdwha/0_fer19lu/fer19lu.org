You need to be very careful with dystopias. It is very easy too take it way too far and suddenly you end up with a big evil dark power wankfest in which everyone is evil. Try to make sure that you have a balance of power, obviously tipped towards the darker end but you can't have too few good guys else it becomes unrealistic. I would recommend reading up a bit on how the NAZIs controlled Germany because that gives you a good view on how a dystopian state might be ruled and will allow you to make it more realistic.
