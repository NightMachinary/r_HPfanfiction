Well, not necessarily the balance of power. Try “[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1143960][Holly at Hogwarts -- Return to Neverland by Forest_of_Holly]]” (Part 3 of “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]”), which has lovely “1984 with Dementors” part, which I like (well, “liked” is not the proper word for dystopia) very much, and we certainly cannot talk much about balance of power. What you need is some kind of hope, that the good guys could at least theoretically ultimately win. Otherwise it is just a pure depression and boring.
