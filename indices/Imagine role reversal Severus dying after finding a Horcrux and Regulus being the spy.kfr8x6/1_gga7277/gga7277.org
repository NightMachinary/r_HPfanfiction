...Huh.

I imagined that Regulus doesn't care about the Potters so much as he “knows” Sirius will be the Secret Keeper, and doesn't want Sirius to be tortured and/or murdered, so he switches sides to save /Sirius/.

Sirius wasn't going to be the Secret Keeper anyway, but Regulus doesn't know that. Sirius will probably go off after Pettigrew and get locked up, but Regulus, at least, will probably push to get him a trial. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728][Ozymandias]] portrays the ensuing legal battle rather well, if you wanted to crib from that.

The biggest problem is Harry---if Voldemort isn't asked to spare Lily, then he doesn't give her a chance, so she doesn't actually make a sacrifice, so Harry isn't protected and he just dies. You'd have to either come up with a different reason for Voldemort to make that offer or say that Harry was protected by some other means (or just kill Harry and persist in the doomed world you have created).
