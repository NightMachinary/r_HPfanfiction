Hm, Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily, what if Regulus asked him to spare James? I mean, there's nothing in canon that would suggest they liked each other, but Regulus had to know how much James meant for Sirius. If James died and Sirius found out it was because of Regulus, he would have never forgiven him, so this could be something he asked for Sirius.
