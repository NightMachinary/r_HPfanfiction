What I find interesting in this scenario is that James would have died to protect both Harry *and Lily*. Would it mean that Voldemort couldn't kill Lily on that night? Would she become the Woman who Lived? And in canon, Harry has to stay with Dursleys because of the protection, but James didn't have any family left, so what would happen to the protection of James' sacrifice over the years?
