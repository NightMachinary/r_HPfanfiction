Without Snape around to ask Voldemort to spare Lily's life, she wouldn't have been able to sacrifice it to save Harry. So Harry dies and Voldemort wins, or someone else ends up fulfilling the prophecy. Either way, nothing looks anything like canon.

Maybe Regulus could beg Voldemort to let Sirius live if he happens to be there, and he could be the one to give Harry the sacrificial protection. That doesn't really change much though, except that Harry's third year is quiet and he doesn't get depressed at the end of OotP. Unless his parents weren't home when Voldemort came so they survive.
