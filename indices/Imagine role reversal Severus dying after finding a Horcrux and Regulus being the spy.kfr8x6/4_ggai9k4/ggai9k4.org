This is a fascinating thought. Would Sirius have trusted his brother when he said he changed sides? Or would he just have thrown him to the side since he was a reminder of the family he hated? How far would Regulus go to make Sirius believe him? I have so many questions!!!! If I thought I could actually make a decent fic I would think of factoring this in somehow.
