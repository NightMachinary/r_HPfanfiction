Hi! I read through the first 40-50%, so here are my impressions so far.

First, the writing is definitely coherent and understandable. The story is also not boring as a brick, which is a definite plus - there was a real pull to read on, so it didn't feel like a slog through.

There were a few grammar mistakes - some switching between past and present tenses in the narrative - which is a mistake you should check for carefuly as you write.

Additionally, dialogue is often hard to get right, and while you managed to get it to sound natural about half of the time, it felt a bit stilted in the beginning.

Now, some people would advise you to not include a "wall of exposition" in the narrative. (Specifically, the explanation of the divisions, for example.) However, that doesn't mean you can't include so much exposition! It just means that you need to come up with a way for it to sound natural, as opposed to being a information dump. There are many ways to do this, and many people much better than me at writing have explained them.

So, to conclude based on what I have read so far. The good parts are that the story is good and the writing is coherent. The problems are some grammar issues and some parts that don't feel natural.

Keep writing, and you'll keep getting better. I'll finish reading the story (at least till the latest chapter - or is it complete?) and give you some more plot-related final impressions.
