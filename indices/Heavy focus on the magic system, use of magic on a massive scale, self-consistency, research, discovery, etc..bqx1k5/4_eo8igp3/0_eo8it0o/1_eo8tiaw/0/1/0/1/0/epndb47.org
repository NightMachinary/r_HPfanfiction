Hey! Sorry for the late reply. (Six days, that's terrible even for me.)

Anyhow, I thought the characters were pretty good - the backstories were nice, the characters weren't one-dimensional, etc. Most importantly, they /felt interesting/. That can be really hard to get right, and one of the biggest obstacles to writing good character.

A large part of writing a character is writing how they speak and think, and of course I said a bit about the dialogue in my earlier comment.

No promises about when, but I'll give you more impressions about the general story once I'm caught up. Again, sorry for the long wait!
