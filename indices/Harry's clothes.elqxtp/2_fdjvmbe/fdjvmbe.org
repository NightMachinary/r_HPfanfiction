i can imagine harry just wearing what he was given from the durselys and then just throwing his black robes over it at school. he never seems to have much care for how he looks. the clothes were big but not actual rags. it's possibly he's repairing and transfiguring the same clothes he's always had. he may have been given some of rons old clothes; with no younger brothers to need them. maybe there was some still at grimauld, i can see sirius going through everything to find him some. or harry wearing sirius old muggle stuff later on. bill and fleur might have replaced what he lost in those last few weeks at shell cottage.

reading fanfiction should explain why there's no shopping scenes. they're the worst.
