I don't think it's ever really described in canon. The only tidbit I can think of offhand that gives us a hint is Archie or whatever his name is at the World Cup who insists on wearing the sundress for the healthy breeze around his junk. To me, that implies similar sort of wear (e.g. robes with nothing underneath) is pretty standard for at least a certain subset of wizards.

EDIT: Also Snape's memory shows him getting flipped upside down so his underwear is exposed, again suggesting little-to-nothing underneath as the standard.

EDIT 2: Also also I can't remember if boys and girls changing into their robes on the train separately is canon or fanon, but if it's the former then that's another point in the "nothing much underneath" column -- if the robes just go over normal clothes, then there's no need for privacy at all.
