Relatedly, what do all the wizard-raised kids wear other than robes (if anything)? It can't be Muggle-style casual wear like we see in the movies, since we know many/most wizards and witches can't dress convincingly Muggle. Molly Weasley knits jumpers for her kids, so those are apparently normal enough among magicals.

It's probably just another case of "JKR didn't think of that", but it's low-key bugged me for years.
