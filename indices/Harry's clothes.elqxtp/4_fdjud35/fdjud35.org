It is never mentioned in the books, that he would buy a normal clothes, but I have always understood that not later than when Harry spent those couple of weeks (days?) in the Diagon Alley before the beginning of his third year he would buy some proper clothes for himself. However, without this silent understanding, he was still wearing cast-offs from Dudley when not being in his school uniform. Yes, it is silly (and it makes him silly), but many fanfic authors wanted to emphasize his abused situation but keeping his in his oversized clothes.
