I grew annoyed by the same three plots you see all the time (Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, good Dumbledore and Happy Weasley family, canon rehash) and can't stand them anymore. I think that this reflects in my writing since I try to subvert the common tropes. For example, Harry being dosed with love potions because someone wants to create discord amongst the trio, Andromeda getting the Black seat in the Wizengamot, Dumbledore staying true to his hands off/observe style of operations, Daphne working for Voldemort out of personal gain, just to name a few.

Coming up with creative approaches for problems is not difficult and if the plot becomes interchangeable with countless other stories, I'll drop the story. The "common" tropes just feel like the author is not even trying or is simply farming favs/reviews.
