Yes that is exactly how I feel about bashing and illogical character actions and stuff! It doesn't seem that hard to me to just make actual CHARACTERS act like real people instead of weird cartoons or cutouts or just things for the author to twist no matter what makes sense. I don't understand why story writers actively decide to do this with their characters either. Why DECIDE to bash? Why DECIDE for a character to just randomly out of nowhere become an evil jerk?
