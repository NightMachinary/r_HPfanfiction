In some ways, both. My position is very similar to yours, though.

I've always hated bad grammar and spelling, particularly relating to items from the books - /Luscious/ Malfoy, anyone? - but I've definitely started to hate more and more tropes in stories after working on my own (which I tried to avoid - although likely missed a fair few - using tropes in) to the point that stories involving stuff like the lordship trope, nice Goblins, politics, almost /any/ Slytherin characterisation I've seen in the last few months, just immediately switch me off to a story.

On the opposite side, I feel like (having had difficulty with writing some characters and word usage in certain scenes) that I'm appreciating well-written stuff a lot more. Authors who not only have a broad vocabulary but actually use that vocabulary correctly in their work stand out way more to me than they used to.

Also, I suppose I sympathise more with how difficult it can be to write consistently time-release-wise, as I've let more than a few posting deadlines slip due to RL stuff to the point I've just abandoned a regular schedule, as I no longer feel it works for me.
