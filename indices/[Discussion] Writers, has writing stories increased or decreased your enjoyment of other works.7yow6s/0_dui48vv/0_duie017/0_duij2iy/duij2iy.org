I dunno, I guess I am sick to death of: anything to do with (poorly thought-out) politics, at all. Anything to do with betrothals, at all. Any Ice Queen shit. Any "Slytherins" are all actually smart and misunderstood (but when it's played off that blood is actually important and thusly validates all the racism). Any mention of an internal pecking order or hierarchy, or "house unity because everyone is against us" or special "Slytherins settle their disagreements in the common room" or weird nobility garbage that has no real grounding in actual court politics or aristocracy, and wouldn't even exist anyway at Hogwarts because /they're all children/.

I guess I either like Slytherins all being unrepentant arseholes (as that seems to be happening less and less these days and can be fun for entertainment value) - either as full on blood purist maniacs, softer blood purists who show little more than disdain and disrespect to non purebloods, or just some particularly douchey/unpleasant/maladjusted kids.

Or, I dunno, maybe I'd more like to see them written as /normal/ children, if at all. I draw more enjoyment from reading plain, interestingly-written normal kids than I do any special characters. Normal people are just more interesting to me than individuals defined by one thing or character trait. They can be witty sometimes, sad or hurtful others, brave, cunning, loyal or studious, just like any other normal person. Because they're in a house should not mean that (if the story is serious) they embody a single trait over others.

I mean, did Draco Malfoy ever really display so much as a cunning thought? I don't really think he did.

I'm sick of Slytherin being this hive of fucking edgy garbage, as if they're all special or more special than anyone else. God damn, at least people should write more Hufflepuff stories. If all the houses are gonna be /super unique!1!!11/ then I would be impressed if authors did more with the 'Puffs.
