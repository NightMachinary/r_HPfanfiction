Thank you for this in-depth answer! ...So... I'm mostly in the clear as far as my own story is concerned, but I don't enter into either of your "would like to see" categories either, oddly enough. The idea wasn't entirely mine, but (do mark that this is a light-hearted story) I portrayed Slytherins as a /fun/ sort of schemers --- the sort the Marauders could well have been if they hadn't also been brave do-gooders. These Slytherins intentionally cultivate their "evil" image by dressing in black and trading meaningless rings and things, and they come up with weird plots at the drop of a hat, few of which they ever even bother to act upon. They're basically an extension of how I see some of the things the Slytherins do in canon --- like when they dressed up as Dementors to scare Harry. That wasn't "cunning" or "noble", it was /goofy as hell/, and that's the approach I've taken.
