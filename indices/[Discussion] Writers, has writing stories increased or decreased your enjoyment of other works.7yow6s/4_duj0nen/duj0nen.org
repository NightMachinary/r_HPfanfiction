Both.

But I can forgive a lack of polish /as long as the story is engaging/. I'm measuring a fic against other fics, not fic against published works. If it hooks me, I'm in.

Sometimes I end up pleasantly surprised, though.

... except when it comes to romance fics. I literally write romance stories for a living, so the slightest mistake puts me off. It's better for me to just avoid reading them.
