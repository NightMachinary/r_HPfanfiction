Bit of both, really. I see the seams in most things now. I put a book down and go, ‘second time foreshadowing same element, it'll be pivotal in the climax' or ‘and that's the end of Act 1' and that difficulty turning off the technical analysis takes me out of the flow of the story quite a bit. But I've come to more greatly appreciate the artistry of novelists who have enough skill to keep me distracted from how they make the magic happen.
