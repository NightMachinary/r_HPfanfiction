I have definitely started to look more critically at other author's work, which decreases my enjoyment of some. But on the other side I now appreciate creative plotlines and writing more, so it also increased for some.

In some other way I also became a lot more lenient with many mistakes. Typos, the occasional fucked up sentence,... You know, stuff that's often found by editors. I got really hung up on those before I wrote my own fics, but now I understand /how/ these things can just slip past you. Theres still a limit to how much I can take of that, and universe specific words are still 100% off-limit to get wrong, but again, I've become more lenient with it overall.

What I became hyper-aware of is out-of-character actions. I absolutely began to hate stories where there are scenes in which characters turn 180Â° because the author didn't have the foresight to plan the plot accordingly. It's preventable by a minimum amnount of planning and just shouldn't happen, period. I probably became so aware of it because it's what ended my own fics in a way. I ended up at crossroads where I realized I'd have to make my characters go through a tremendous development to get them to the point I want and just didn't have the muse to write that.
