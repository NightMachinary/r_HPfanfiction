Yeah, there are a few extra chapters on DLP right up to the yule ball, then as every good story out there ,we get left hanging, which is a shame as the dude was really on to something there and calypso is a cool OC , the only thing that would have hooked me more is if harry started using runes to bridge magic and tech, magineers are freaking cool when done right.
