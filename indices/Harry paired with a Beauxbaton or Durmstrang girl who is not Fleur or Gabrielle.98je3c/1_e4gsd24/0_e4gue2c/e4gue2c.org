  Cassiopeia Black

Not what I was looking for. I was thinking more along the lines of romance with a foreign exchange student, not someone part of a British family. Preferably with some interesting world building for the rest of Europe, but at the very least some minor cultural differences (which are not summed up with "America, Fuck Yeah!", "Hot Asian girl" or "Native inhabitant wank").

  I really want her to get together with someone, but it's going to take ages before she'll be at Hogwarts

As someone who played around with similar concepts, I'd recommend skipping most of that arc and use the in-media-res approach and flashbacks if necessary. Start with her chatting up Harry at Hogwarts or something like that, otherwise, you'll get bogged down in side-plots and never make it to Hogwarts because you get bored halfway through year 5 at Durmstrang. Because let's be honest, without all the shit Voldemort was doing, Hogwarts isn't all that interesting unless you write slice of life.
