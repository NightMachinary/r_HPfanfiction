I've just started on a story like this. The thing is, I've really only just started (10k words in) and I want to make it an AU story. The plot is basically like this: Harry is 2 years younger than the girl (Cassiopeia Black). Both their parents got killed. She is forced to attend Durmstrang. Story follows the girl at Durmstrang.

Therefore I'm not sure how it complies with you; I really want her to get together with someone, but it's going to take ages before she'll be at Hogwarts (seeing as it's Harry's 4th year, meaning i'll have to write roughly 6 years of Durmstrang before she goes there). So yeh. It's only a long term thing for my personal story, no clue when that's going to be done.

Sorry for not giving any useful recommendations, just wanted to tell you that I'm working on something but it may take a prolonged period of time.
