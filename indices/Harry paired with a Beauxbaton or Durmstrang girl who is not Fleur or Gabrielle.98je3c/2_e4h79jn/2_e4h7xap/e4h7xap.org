The most popular approaches are to age her up and explain her appearance with some Veela pseudo-science or to have them get together once she is above a certain age (15 is the age of consent in France, 16 in Britain).

There's actually a decent one around where they are in something akin to a platonic long-term relationship during the Horcrux hunt and get together at the end (and even that one ages her up).

Edit: Honestly, I'd rather take Harry/Gabrielle than any story that ships him (or Hermione) with Death Eaters. I mean, the French president was "cradle robbed" by his teacher and ended up marrying her. It's more believable for Harry to fall for a 13 or 14-year-old girl than it is for him to have the hots for Snape or Voldemort. Then again, the age of consent is 14 here in Germany, so maybe it's just not something on my mind all the time (like in American Media where they celebrate a girls 18th birthday because that makes her officially bangable).
