I usually don't care much about them, it only actively turns me away if it reads like the author wanted to try his hand at writing a poor porn scene. Other than that I usually skip through them and carry on.

On the other hand, I actually have enjoyed some when they are contributing to the story - not really for plot, but for character development. Depending on the setting it can be a huge show of trust or something similar and if it has notable effects on a relationship and is well written it can really get some emotional attachment to the story across.

Another interesting attempt are sex scenes where magic is actually involved in some way, mostly for the way it's written. I think it's most common in (soul-)bonding fics though, which can be a whole can of worms to open regarding quality.
