I do agree that fanfiction on the whole is not the best place to find well-written sex scenes, probably because most writers are fairly inexperienced in that regard - not necessarily in the nuts and bolts, but in the emotional side. Teenage angst leaves me cold I'm afraid.

But in fiction generally, I like it in romances - as long as it packs an emotional punch. I do use some short sex scenes in my own stuff and I hope I make a reasonable job of it. No one has complained yet anyway except for a troll :) Which is success of a sort I supppose.
