Though I may be exactly the kind of author you're targeting, I've felt that one of the key advantages of fanfiction and its lack of editorial oversight is that we /can/ write those scenes for which most publishers would insist it be written as a fade to black or euphemistic distraction so purple as to be ultraviolet- inscrutable.

Of course, my early attempts at fulfilling this promise of free expression were abysmal, but I feel that I've improved greatly in the delivery... sometimes.

For certain, I could remove half the sex scenes I've written in my most recent story and still retain the meaning, but the other half are integral to the story and relate directly to developments later in the plot, by design. I think it's worth exploring, especially considering how powerful the influence of sex is in our lives.
