I totally agree with that! I find myself getting so caught up in a scene or how a character is supposed to act or how I know they would characteristically react to a situation that I forget to consider how they as a /human/ would react. So so so many historical decisions were made because this king wanted to sleep with this woman or this person wanted that one's land. Greed, lust, laziness, etc can literally change history.
