I do enjoy writing them, but the reason I'm reconsidering their value in that particular story has to do with a change of intent. After a few chapters, the reviewers were getting more interested in the progression of changes to the canon rather than who I could hook up together.

At the same time I'm still being praised for some of the later sex scenes, so to keep the audience I'm willing to continue spicing up the story when it makes sense to do so. I have extracted a few sex scenes that just weren't that plot-relevant or even logistically probable and intend to post them separately for those who enjoy the erotica. It's like I'm now writing two interlinked stories in tandem (again).
