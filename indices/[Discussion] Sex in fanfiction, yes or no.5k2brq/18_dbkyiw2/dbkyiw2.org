My opinion is that often fics fall into a trap whereby once they get their pair together they do little else but have sex. Which although might be like a real life "honeymoon period" doesn't serve plot/story.

I quite like a sex scene, or two over a long fic but any more and I tend to skim passed. No matter how well done they grow dull with repetition.

In the outline for my WIP I have a draft sex scene which I flip-flop on plans to include. I drafted it because it drew out the emotional truth of the characters and served the plot in using physical intimacy as the means of creating emotional distance. I like it, my alpha readers have agreed that it makes the break into the third act work better, but I still hem and haw over it's inclusion.
