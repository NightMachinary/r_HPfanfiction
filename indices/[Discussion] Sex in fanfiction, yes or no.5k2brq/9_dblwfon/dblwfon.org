I've read a few fics where they fade to black, but on the whole, I tend to prefer Explicit fics to those with lesser ratings. It's not an automatic pass, but I'm an adult and I feel like characters who are older teens and adults should act like older teens and adults.

If the main character is ace, I'll happily make an exception: their sexuality is still handled in an adult way by their saying no, not interested, rather than pretending this major part of many peoples' lives doesn't exist.

tl;dr babies don't come from the stork.
