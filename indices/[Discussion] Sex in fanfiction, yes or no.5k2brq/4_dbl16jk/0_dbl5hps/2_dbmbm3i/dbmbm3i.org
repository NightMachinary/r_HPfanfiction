Honestly, writing sex scenes is the same thing as writing about pregnancy (and also raising children). You can't fake that knowledge. You have to experience it to really know what you're talking about. It's more than just describing an action, it's the psychological and emotional aspect that goes in it as well and you just can't get that kind of intimate knowledge from a book or video.
