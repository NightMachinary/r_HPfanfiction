We may be wandering into a different subreddit's content, but I really don't believe that anyone could write a good sex scene with no experience whatsoever. The act is more than "insert tab A into slot B..." and 'inexperienced' writers are probably why fanfiction is so blighted with poorly written sex scenes that would only be considered good if one was a sheltered Victorian country maiden who didn't know any better.
