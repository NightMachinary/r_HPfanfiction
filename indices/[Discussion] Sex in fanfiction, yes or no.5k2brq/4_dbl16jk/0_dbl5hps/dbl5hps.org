To clarify: you would prefer scenes to be written by those experienced in the act rather than someone trying to describe something they've never experienced? I only ask because the skill of writing is something developed through visualization and imagination; veteran writers who are married and have children may be horrid at presenting an explicit sex scene. A young writer with talent, no fear and some worthwhile research materials can put together some of the most titillating scenes.

I'd rather encourage people to try it with the advice to do proper research first, rather than declare 'only write what you know'.
