  To clarify: you would prefer scenes to be written by those experienced in the act rather than someone trying to describe something they've never experienced? I only ask because the skill of writing is something developed through visualization and imagination; veteran writers who are married and have children may be horrid at presenting an explicit sex scene. A young writer with talent, no fear and some worthwhile research materials can put together some of the most titillating scenes.

Of course it's possible a very good young writer could write great sex scenes with enough research, but odds do not favor them. It's far more likely their sex scenes suck.
