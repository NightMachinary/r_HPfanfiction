I dont like them in general. If its a romantic fic and the 2 main characters get together - sure. But some random "and then he banged that girl, and then that girl and then that girl" you sometimes find in fics (especially dark!harry or independent!harry ones for some reason) is just bad.

Sex, as pretty much anything else, is ok if it serves a point in the story. If it doesnt it doesnt belong there, just as any other activity wouldnt. Sex for the sake of writing sex is ok in a smut story, but no where else.

And even if sex is important for the story, keep it classy and dont go graphic.
