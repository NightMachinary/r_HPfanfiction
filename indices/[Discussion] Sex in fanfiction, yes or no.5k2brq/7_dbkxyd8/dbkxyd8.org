It really depends on a lot of things to be honest. With some pieces, the sex scenes add character or relationship aspects that might not be properly conveyed elsewhere. Often times though it is not necessary and should be removed. Sex scenes are extremely difficult to write, let alone /well/, and as much as I applaud the effort done by the author, if I can skip it, I likely will.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good PWP (and I have a number bookmarked), but like others have said, it's a very rare skill to have.
