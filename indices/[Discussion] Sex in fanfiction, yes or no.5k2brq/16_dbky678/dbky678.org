I used to skip them until Murder Most Horrid. That fic made me rethink things, and now I give them a chance. I enjoyed this one where Neville and Hermione get into an S&M thing. No others come to mind.

I don't mind if it exists, as long as I can skip it easily, and some authors are considerate enough to warn you about it. When it is hard to skip, it is a pain. Reading all the way through the Sacrifices arc was the hardest thing, because there's relevant dialogue in there sometimes, and the start and end aren't sharply demarcated.
