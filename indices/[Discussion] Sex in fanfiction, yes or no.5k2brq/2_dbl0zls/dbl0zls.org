98% of what I read are romances so I actually expect to see sex somewhere in my stories. It adds to the anticipation of the relationship for me, especially when the act is written after the couple has finally gotten their act together and are now ready to commit to each other on that next level. Honestly, I don't read rated T or heaven forbid, rated K romances because I don't care for the fade-to-black scenes. Now that said, too much sex can be too much and I have left or heavily skimmed through stories where sex is essentially a third character in the story.
