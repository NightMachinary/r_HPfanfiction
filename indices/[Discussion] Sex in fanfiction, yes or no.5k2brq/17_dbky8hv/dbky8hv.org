As a reader I am fine with sex being presented in stories, both original and derivative ones, for as long as the occurrence of the act makes sense to me in the context of the story (meaning that, regardless of whether or not I personally agree with the decision, I see why the characters would decide to do it). That said, I am fine with both getting the scene proper and with a fade to black, although as I am generally not looking for titillation when I start reading a book that is not designated as porn it means that I simply get through the scene and make sure I didn't miss any important details and then I move on, meaning that the worth of those scenes is often lost to me.

And as a writer I did write scenes of this kind, but they were always scenes that were solely for me and the actual work always had a fade to black instead, as I really like to use ambiguity as a tool (well, that and the reactions of women's bodies I write in those scenes generally tend to be based on how my body reacts, which makes it kind of hard to show it to people).
