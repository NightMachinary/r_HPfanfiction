I used to read them a lot more when I was a teenager and largely unconcerned with how sex actually worked. As an adult I rarely seek it out specifically and am ambivalent about it in longer fics that I read. If it really adds to the story, that's awesome. If it doesn't add anything at all, and the story is getting mediocre, I might just close the tab and move on to another fic. Pointless sex scenes just make me feel bored, not annoyed or disgusted. I care far more about the emotional significance of the acts, and most of that is developed outside of the bedroom anyway.

In my own writing, though, I'm not confident enough in my own narrative voice to write anything explicit. I'd rather imply or just keep it PG for the most part.
