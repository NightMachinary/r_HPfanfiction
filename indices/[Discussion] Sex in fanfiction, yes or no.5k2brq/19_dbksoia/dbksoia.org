too many sex scenes in fanfiction are poorly written wish fulfillment, and honestly add nothing but word count to a story. Of all the various sexual scenes I have read, few are realistic, and border on copying a porn movie. Honestly , unless the story was written to write sex scenes, most of them can be dialed way back and still tell a story. Not criticizing, I like a good PWP as the next reader, but I know that upfront. Good writing doesn't need it. to quote something I wrote years ago.."and the young couple did what young lovers do" It got the point across, and didn't detract from the flow of the story.
