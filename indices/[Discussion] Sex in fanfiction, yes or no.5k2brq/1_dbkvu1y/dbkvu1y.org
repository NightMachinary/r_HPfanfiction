Depends on the how/why of the scene. I dislike harem fics quite strongly, so I tend to dislike sex scenes in those stories just as much. They tend to be written as if by a 13-year-old virgin who's finally found his or her dad's porn stash and thinks it's THE BEST THING EVER!!!

The "fade to black" seems like a cop-out, honestly. Either do the thing or don't, I am perfectly capable of deciding if I want to read it or not, and if not I'll just skim until I see it's over. Otherwise mentioning the fact that your characters is having sex 9 times out of 10 has no impact on the story, and the lead up was probably just some mushy, lovey-dovey, "twu wuv" BS and now I don't even get any smut to make up for it.

A lot of the sex scenes that are included in fanfic tend to be full of flowery euphemisms and avoid actually mentioning what's being done as much as possible. "Harry worshiped her body and drowned in the pleasure of their love made physical." is about as sexy as getting The Talk from your grandma. Authors who write scenes like this can also just skip the sex scenes and build-up.

A /good/ sex scene can convey quite a lot. Changing feelings between characters, emotional closeness, vulnerability, character growth. I once read one sex scene for a Dragon Age fic that yeah, was pretty much PWP, but it left the characters so damned exposed and raw that it didn't feel like PWP.

So my rules as a reader for a good sex scene are:

1. Know how sex actually works.

2. Grow some balls and actually commit to some raunch.

3. It's not common for people to orgasm together unless they really try.

4. 15-year-olds should not have "fantastic" sex the first time they try.

5. Unless the chick is a banshee, she should not be screeching and moaning from start to finish. Build up to that and save it for things she really enjoys.

6. Use actual descriptors of what's going on, none of this "Harry ran his hands up and down his goddess' glorious body" nonsense.

7. Dirty talk is an art form, but if you're no good at it, just go Google some lines and leave the "Oh my love, take me now!" for the Harlequin romance novels.
