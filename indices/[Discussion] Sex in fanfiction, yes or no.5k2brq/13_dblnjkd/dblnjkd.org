Unless they're absolutely horrible and look like they're written by someone who's completely illiterate in any human language; I generally don't mind them.

A majority of the time I prefer the fanfics I read to have sex in them; because for fuck sake the characters are emotional hormonally charged teenagers, if their isn't any sex it's unrealistic as hell to me.

That being said, if there's no sex in a fic I'm reading by the time I get to chapter 15 or 20, I will often drop it like a bag of dragon shit on fire unless the plot is absolutely stellar. It doesn't have to be good sex, it doesn't have to be anything more than implied or a "fade to black", but if I'm going to continue spending my time reading a fic there has to be sex in some form.
