I love it. Headcanon adopted. And it's probably flashy ice, with sparkles or lights or bright colors, usually charmed so No-Majs can't see them but one who did see it came up with the idea of those plastic LED ice cubes that flash colors. People buy/make containers to hold their ice cubes and they're personalized.
