I've been really into Tom/Harry fics recently here are some of my faves:

linkao3(15676317) - amazing, funny, well done and a little more light hearted then most tom riddle fics, highly recommend! some of the best characters i've ever read

linkao3(24970723) - just finidhed this, i really liked it! lots going on plot wise, well thought out and planned and harry's character is very interesting. the dark arts call to her but she resists until she gives in a bit and then tries to find a balance. pretty big age gap in this one because it's present day harry and voldemort.
