I'd recommend trying Certain Dark Things by eirajenson. If you like characters that act their age, sisterhood, magical world building, and plots that are shaped by but distinct from canon, it should be your cup of tea.

The endgame primary pairing may not be to everyone's taste, but it will not happen until Harriet is in her 20s. Right now, the fic is completely gen and the author has said that it will not be romance centric.

It's probably my favourite currently updating fic and updates are super regular too.
