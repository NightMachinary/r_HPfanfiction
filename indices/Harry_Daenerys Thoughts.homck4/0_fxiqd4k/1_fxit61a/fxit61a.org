She didn't start out ambitious or cruel. She was made that way over time by circumstances. Also, it matters if we're talking about the books or the show here (the show's ending was so forced and out of left-field in multiple ways that the Imperius Curse would make as good an explanation as any).

She's also anti-slavery, which Malfoy is not.

I'm not sure either she or Harry would be interested in each other, though, if they're in-character. Harry seems to want normalcy, and someone he can relate to (I suppose he could relate to Danny being a "chosen one", but that's not a part of himself he seems comfortable embracing). And if he has a type, its sports players (Ginny, Cho), not aristocratic women. Danny... I'm not sure. She seems to like warrior types, which Harry isn't really, unless you count magical combat, and only then by necessity.

Harry might empathize with her, maybe even like her depending on when they meet, and she'd probably see him as a potentially useful ally. But he would disagree with some of her more brutal tactics, she'd think him naive and ultimately untrustworthy, their values would end up clashing, and they'd probably end up at odds a lot. Harry/Danny would probably end much like Jon/Danny, except he'd take her alive instead of stabbing her.
