Malfoy was rich spoilt crudl racist thug, never knew pain. His parents provided him everything he wanted on a silver tray. Remember second year? He bought his way in to quidditch team by bribing 6 top of the line brooms.

Danaerys started as a naive girl who was terrified of her brother, she was sold, captured, raped and betrayed almost every person she encountered. She sacrificed her army for killing greater threat. But, she was betrayed by same people she fought to protect. She stood strong till end.

D&D decided to give disney ending to Stark family made her OOC in last season.

Never compare Dany with weakling like Malfoy.
