I like that pairing. It was my favorite pairing in crossovers. Both of them are somewhat similar, abused by family, ready to help others, Gryffindor tendencies ..etc.

But Harry had trusted friends who had his back, but Dany was surrounded by vultures and betrayed too many times and suffered too much cruelty of others.

I think Harry's friendship would've done great for her. But, he should meet her before 2nd book or 3rd one. Later, she started to develop arrogance and I don't think Harry would like that.

But, Harry magic is too over-powered on Westeros. You've to nullify it someway. Otherwise he could simply gift her Iron Throne in a week.
