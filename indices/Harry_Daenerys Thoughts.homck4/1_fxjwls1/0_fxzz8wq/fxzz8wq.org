I mostly agree, but I would disagree that Harry's magic is that powerful. Oh, compared to some charging knight, sure. But...

Harry is limited by his own values. He will likely be reluctant, initially, to use magic publicly, even though the SoS doesn't apply in this world. He won't kill. His mobility will also be limited, as apparition has limited range. And if anything happens to his broom, wand, etc, there's no way to buy a new one (logistics, people always forget the logistics).

But bottom line, Harry isn't willing to use his magical abilities in the ways he'd have to to take a kingdom, unless its a very OOC Harry. Namely mass-mind control plus AKing anyone strong-willed enough to resist.

Also, there are things that can threaten him:

-A dragon. Short of AKing it, its questionable whether any spell he knows can reliably bring one down before it can burn him to death, especially if these dragons have the same magic resistance as Potter ones.

-A Faceless Man could kill him by ambush. Ditto Melisandre's shadow baby. For that matter, a random archer could, if he got off a shot before Harry knew he was there.

-Enough wights could, especially with surprise/in close quarters. They're basically inferi except better.

-The Three Eyed Raven/Crow. Scary time traveling body snatcher. It can potentially see what Harry's going to do before he does it, go back and alter his past, and oh yeah, possess him (Harry might be able to resist, though is record on countering mental assaults is mixed).
