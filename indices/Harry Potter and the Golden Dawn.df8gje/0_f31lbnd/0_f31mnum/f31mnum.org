Not really, I mean it more like the equivalent of going to college or traveling after high school. Plus, I always felt Harry needed a much wider social circle in canon than just Ron and Hermione. Making new friends isn't a bad thing you know.

Plus, I figured Harry needed to be more independent than canon. The way Rowling writes it makes him seem a little too co-dependent on his friends to achieve things. And sometimes in life, you need to do things alone to truly appreciate how far you've come. And after DH, I doubt either Ron and Hermione would've wanted to go wandering around the world. Ginny would be having her new relationship with Neville and school, etc. So this is Harry's equivalent of going on a journey to find out what he wants to do now that Voldemort is no longer hanging over him like a guillotine.

And during this journey he would see things like Wars, Famine, Corruption, etc that test his views and have him re-evaluate things. Plus, the discussions with Grindlewald's spirit could highlight how the dead can influence the living and the possible dangers of the Resurrection Stone's power.

I mean think about it from this angle, For Example, Harry sees people suffering due a war/terrorism and desires to use his powers to end the conflict and help the people. A lot of innocent people end up dying in one of these attacks and is prevented from intervening by the authorities when he could've helped them. Was it right for Wizards to withhold their help to those who needed it just to keep the status quo or was it simply easier? A moral question he begins asking himself throughout his journey.

And Harry would have a support network, I don't know how you came to that conclusion as I don't think he wouldn't make friends within his new organization or old friends couldn't join it.
