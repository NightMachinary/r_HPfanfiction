Also, Harry in the fic Emperor is more OC than the OC characters. This prompt is about a Post-Hogwarts Harry seeing how bad the world outside his little corner of it is and asks himself a simple question.

Are Wizards right to be hiding away when they can do something to help solve many of the worlds problems Or are Wizards simply taking the easy way out? Even Hagrid in book one, says "Everyone be coming to wizards to solve all their problems" justification for why wizards hide.

Harry during his journey and experiences comes to question this belief the more he learns. And decides to do something about it. Harry would lead because he simply doesn't trust wizards not to go with what they've always done instead of whats right. And if you'd read the books, Wizards are highly resistant to change and thus need someone to lead them if they are to change. So Harry would becomes King to get things done, rather than out of a desire to be King.
