I respect you opinion but I doubt it's that simple, you seem to like to accept canon only characters but that's kind of useless if your trying to make an international movement if you only have british/irish/scottish base. You'd never get traction if you don't make connections outside your little corner of the world.

And there have been OCs that have been accepted before, but admittedly it is tricky to pull off. However, rejecting OCs outright just because you yourself are not comfortable moving outside of established characters doesn't mean its useless to make them. It just has to be done carefully.

Plus, those 'friends and followers' you mentioned would likely to not want to start a Wizarding Revolution right after having just fought a civil war and likely would be resistant to the idea of change when many are likely to want to simply return to the status quo from before the war rather than fight a new brand one. Plus, Voldemort was a psychotic dictator who was murdering people left and right that everyone needed gone so the choice to fight him would have been a whole lot simpler than taking part in a revolution.
