I love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866813/1/A-Whiff-of-Competition][A Whiff of Competition]], which, like you mentioned at the end of your post, is all about the world of professional quidditch. It focuses on Katie Bell and Oliver Wood, but one of the most important and most interesting parts of the fic is the whole concept of pro quidditch that the author creates. It gets into the trainers and coaches, the facilities and compounds, and the inter-team politics. It's a WIP, right now over 100k words.

Beyond that, I'll say that that ship, Oliver Wood/Katie Bell, has several other stories focusing on quidditch, at Hogwarts and the pro level, and would certainly benefit from more readers!
