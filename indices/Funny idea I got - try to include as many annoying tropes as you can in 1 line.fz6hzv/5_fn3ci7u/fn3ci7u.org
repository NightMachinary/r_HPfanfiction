While you're at it, you can also pay major compensation for my marriage contract with ginevera and I'm gonna go with all of my trillions of galleons to the wizengamot where I, an eleven year old, will speak, act, and be respected like a wise elder who has trained all their life. Oh, and also I'm going to live in an ancient castle with my house elf, harem, and flueueueur delicoor who owes me a Veela life debt-bond and because I am completely immune to her alliurere she is infatuated and my other 6 wives for each title also are enamoured and now I'm going to turn umbitch into a toad and play pranks then put her in Azkaban for thirty two life sentences and then I'm going to live forever on my private island and I also own all muggle and magical businesses and control half the world so take that dumbledick

Something like that? (I can spell btw)
