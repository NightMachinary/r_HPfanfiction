Hi my name is Harrison James Evans-Gryffindor Peverell Ravenclaw Black-Potter and I have long shiny straight black hair(that's how I got my name) with Slytherin green streaks and red tips like Lily Evans that reaches my mid-back and emerald green orbs like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like my mother (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Lucius Malfoy but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a triple Animagus with a phoenix, dragon, and a kitsune but I only use the phoenix most of the time. I have pale white skin. I'm also the strongest wizard of all time, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the fifth year (I'm fifteen). I'm rich (in case you couldn't tell) and I have 40 manors and 20 seats on the Wizengamot and 5 soul bonds. I love shopping in Diagon Alley and spending 8 chapters buying everything there. For example today I bought a giant expandable trunk with 7 rooms and an expanding closet in it, 2 snakes (one was rainbow colored opal and the other was black), another wand with whomping willow wood and a basilisk fang and threstral scale core and two wand holsters. I was wearing a black dragonhide robe with dragonhide boots and black leather pants and sunglasses to cover my scar like in the Matrix. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of Death Eaters stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
