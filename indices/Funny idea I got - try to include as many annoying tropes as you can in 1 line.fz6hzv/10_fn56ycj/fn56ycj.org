Harry had determined to be the best wizard ever, to hell with Ron holding him back. He got up at 5, ran round Little Wining for an hour, then after the Dursleys list of chores (which he got Dobby to do) he studied Charms for three hours, transfiguration for three hours, potions for three hours, wandless magic for three hours, Defence Against the Dark Arts for 10 minutes because he now knew that only Dumb-as-a-door and his dupes called the pure-blood traditions Dark because they were determined to make magic acceptable to the Muggle-born. To think he'd thought his mother was Muggle-born when she was in fact the daughter of the Malfoys, kidnapped at birth.
