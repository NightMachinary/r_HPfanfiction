Not so much a line as a summary for the crackiest crack that was ever cracked.

Dumbledore's obsession with the prophecy has led to homicide and madness.

Dumbledore was convinced that he was receiving visions that relate to the prophecy, and he is sure that Sirius was supposed to die in the battle of the Department of mysteries. When Bellatrix doesn't push Sirius into the mirror like she is supposed to, Dumbledore takes it upon himself to provide the appropriate amount of trauma to push Harry along his path.

In a horrifying twist, Dumbledore apparates out of the Department of Mysteries with Ron, murders him and then apparates back with his body, blaming the Death Eaters for his death.

Dumbledore is completely and utterly insane. He is the author of all of Harry's misery, because he has grossly misinterpreted the Prophecy. He thinks that the power that the Dark Lord knows not is driven by trauma. (Think ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas' by Ursula K. LeGuin)

In additional Revelations to this horrifying backstory, we learn that Dumbledore tortured the Longbottoms and framed Bellatrix for it. Bellatrix didn't torture the Longbottoms for the same reason that she didn't push Sirius into the mirror - she hoped that the Dark Lord would bring the Black family together, not tear it apart, and she saw Dumbledore's manipulations for what they were.

Dumbledore also manipulated Pettigrew into betraying the Potters and framing Sirius. Dumbledore also knew what kind of people the Dursleys were and sent Harry to live with them anyway.

The final twist was going to be that Dumbledore */IS/* Voldemort, like, Full-on Fight Club Style. Dumbledore is so deeply insane that he killed Tom Riddle when he was young and assumed his identity. He used Tom Riddle to create this alternate Persona that he could use to make himself look better. After Dumbledore had taken care of Grindelwald, he lived in a world where everyone was asking him ‘what have you done for me lately?' All heroes need a villain, and Dumbledore's split personality became His Own Worst Enemy.

After Ron's death, Harry becomes deeply traumatized. Since I am a smut writer, of course the answer was going to be freaky sex with a bunch of witches, because everyone knows that a harem is the perfect antidote for soul-crushing grief. Ron's murder sets up an initial Harry/Ginny and later Hermione, Luna and Pansy jump on the pile because Blonde, Brunette, Redhead and Raven are ‘the four food groups' haha. I was also going to include a will reading, the Full Goose Bozo of Lord-Potter-Peverell-Black, Harry's bound magical core and helpful goblins.

“The power that the Dark Lord knows not” Actually turns out to be freaky ritual group sex with Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Pansy all making a freaky sex pile and using the energy to grow stronger.

I can't believe I actually wrote this summary. I hate myself. I am deeply ashamed. My brain needs a shower, and probably yours as well.
