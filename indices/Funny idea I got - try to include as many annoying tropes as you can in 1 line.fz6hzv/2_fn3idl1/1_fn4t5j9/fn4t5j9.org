(In response) Are you really? Interesting. I was waiting for this, actually. You've finally grown into your own. Yes, in fact all of this power came from my manipulations. How does it feel, Harry? To know that you can never escape my reach, that everything you do, even if you strike me down, was, and will forever be, orchestrated by me alone? After all, I am a the most powerful Seer in the world since I broke that upstart Lovegood's ability and added it to my own. 'Twas a shame it killed her and weakened her daughter's ability. I obliviated her afterwards into thinking it was an accident, and she will never OBLIVIATE!

We had a nice chat, talking about your newfound powers that I unlocked for you. You simply weren't ready until now, because I feared that with the Horcrux inside your head, Voldemort would be able to take you over. Now that you're of age, I was able to remove it, so go, fight, and win for the Greater Good.
