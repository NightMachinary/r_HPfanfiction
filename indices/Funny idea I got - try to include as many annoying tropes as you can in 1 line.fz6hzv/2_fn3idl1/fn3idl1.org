What the hell did you just fucking say to me, you old goat? I'll have you know I've been emancipated by the goblins, and I've claimed my rightful lordships, and I own over 300 vaults. I unlocked the abilites you blocked and my magical core grew over nine thousand percent. You are nothing to me but a squib. I could curse you with power the likes of which has never been seen since Merlin, mark my bloody words.

You think you can get away with calling me "Harry" instead of "Lord Potter"? Think again, old coot. As we speak I'm Legilimentally contacting Amelia Bones and your Wizengamot title is being revoked right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the pathetic web of lies you call your life. You're fucking done, Dumbledork.

I can Apparate anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my katana. Not only am I extensively trained in wandless magic, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the MACUSA and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable beard off the British Isles. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" manipulations were about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have kept your crooked fingers to yourself. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you senile fool. I do not forgive, I do not forget.
