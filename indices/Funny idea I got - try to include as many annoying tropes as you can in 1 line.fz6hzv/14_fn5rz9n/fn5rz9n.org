What do you mean you're betraying me Won Won Weasel? You really think I, heir of the most ancient and noble houses of potter, black, slytherin, griffindor, ravenclaw, and scion of houses gaunt, perevell, and Emrys didn't know you were betraying me? You're too pathetic at magic to realize that I, with my powerful magical core and only intent, have been spying on /you/. I've known this whole time with my bayesian reasoning that you have been working for Bumblebee and Moldyshorts! At this moment, Griphook, may his enemies blood salt their fields and his vault grow yearly, is reclaiming the money your mother and sister stole from me to pay for their love potions with interest! The only good weasleys are the twins! Meet my friend and also occasional lover, Amelia Bones!
