"What, esteemed honorable goblin Griphook? You mean to tell me I, Hadrian Potter, am not only the Lord Potter, but also to Black, Peverell, Emrys and Le Fay? And this blood lineage test also showed I'm a shadow elemental and metamorphmagus, and Dumbledore has bound 99.99999% of my core? I'm also soul bound to 7 witches? Hmph and I suppose obtaining Slytherin by right of conquest as well shows I am the actual boy who lived, not my brother who has been so lovingly raised by James and Lily Potter. I will... MAKE THEM PAY! Goodbye Griphook, may your wealth grow, loins flourish, biceps engorge, and enemies' blood spill out of their eye sockets."
