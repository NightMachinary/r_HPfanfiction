My name is Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and I came from the future with my soulmate, Draco's timeturner to inform you, travling back more than a year will cause you to arrive in an alternative universe, where you're not Hailey Potter, the jedi girl anymore, and you can be anything from a pink fox to a detective in a stempunk world, so be careful with it and also don't let Luna touch it, even if she needs it to find Crumple Horned Snorkacks! I trust you, because you're from a noble house and you're the chosen one as well. Just keep in mind that if you mess this up, all the timelines and universes will be in danger and Ron or Cedric might end up evil, and you may even encounter a person named Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and her gang of.. I'd better not even tell you. I've met them and it was really unplesant, I can assure you.

P.S. Hermione is in love with Snape in your universe, and Ginny is secretly with Luna, but Neville is about to come out as pansexual, so he's not only into boys and mermaids anymore. And Ron's already evil, sorry, but at least his IQ is only 79, so he won't be much of a threat.

P.S. P.S. DON NOT MESS WITH TIME! Unless you want to have some private time with yourself, that's fine.
