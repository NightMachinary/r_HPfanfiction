It's one of the common set ups for a haphne romance. Lol

If the set up is independent from Hermione, they usually bump to each other on the train (sometimes literally). Or Daphne is assigned as a class partner when Harry switches out of an elective or Snape randomly decides to use progressive learning strategies in Potions.
