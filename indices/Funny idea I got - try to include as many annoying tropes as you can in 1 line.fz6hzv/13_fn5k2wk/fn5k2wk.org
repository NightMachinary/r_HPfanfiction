On the train ride for their 7th year in Hogwarts...

Hermione: guys, this is my best friend Daphne Greengrass

Ron: I didn't know you knew each other....nor you were best friends /suspicious look/

Harry: /Green eyes stares into the newcomers blue eyes/

Daphne: /blue eyes stares right back/

(hints that they are soul mates for real)

Neville: /non existent even if he was mentioned a paragraph ago/

Hermione: yeah, we hit it off at Ancient runes since we were the only non-ravenclaw students. We were best friends ever since.

Ron and Harry: /does not comment about the fact that there was no mention of this best friend after years of going through life threatening scenarios together/
