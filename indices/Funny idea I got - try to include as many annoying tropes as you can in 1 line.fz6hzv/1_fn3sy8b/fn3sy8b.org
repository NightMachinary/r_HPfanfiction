Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell Emrys Slytherin Ravenclaw Gryffindor (but not Hufflepuff because it's the house of the duffers) stared at his enemy Albus "Too-Many-Middle-Names" Dumbledore, his AK colored green orbs flaming with power.\\
"It's over, old man", the raven haired lord said, a gush of wind flaming around him as if conjured by his words, "I have finally broken free of all you manipulations, and will not let you complete you plan to raise me as a lamb to slaughter".\\
The Old Goat reacted at his words, and seemed to want to respond, but was paralyzed by the aura of power which radiated from "The Boy Who Lived", and at that moment he knew that his boy had managed to remove the block he had put on his magical core, making him more powerfull than even him. As if reading his minds, (and he probably was, the loss of the block revealing his powers as a natural Legilimens, as well as a naturel Occulumens, Basilisk and Phoenix Animagus, Metamormagus and Shadow Mage"), the Green Eyed boy smilled.\\
"Yes I have discovered everything", he continued "How you Imperiused Pettigrew to force him to betray my parents, and how you made sure Sirius ended up in Azkaban with no trial. I also know how you paid the Weasleys to "take me in", don't think I have not read the Marriage Contract you signed in my name as my Illegal Magical Guardian after sealing the Potter Will, everything goes to Ginny after my death right?"\\
At that moment, Severus Snape entered the room, yelling "Potter how dare yo . . .", but before he could finish his sentence, Harry used his awesome Metamormagus power to turn his eyes red". Snape was shocked "Li-Lily?" he managed to say.\\
The "Man Who Would Conquer" looked at him with disdain. "You Snivelius, mistreated me for all my life her because you were jealous of my father. You don't even deserve my hate you . . . bully". And Snape, confronted with suck an insult, could not do anything else than see the errors of his ways, and chose to beg for forgiveness by giving Harry James Potter everything he owned, including the secret recipes of potions to cure Lycantropisme, heal his allie parents (because a Longbottom always stand next to a Potter) and make Muggles magical, before throwing himself out of the window to his death.\\
Harry looked back at Dumbledore, ignoring the intermission that had just happened. "As I was saying" he said "I know everything of you plan. Too bad you didn't respected the Goblinsg, May the blood of their enemies flow and their vault be filled with gold. Griphook was the most helpful, showing me everyone of your machinations. It's only natural since the Potter are long time allies of Gringott and one of their "special" clients. The only reason I talk to you know is to get back what is mine". At that moment, the Elder Wand jumped out of the old man pocket right into Harry's hand. Just as a ring came from the window and the Invisibility Cloack materialised on Harry's shoulder.\\
"As the Master of Death" Harry said, using his new found power "I kill now Moldy Short, as if he could truly "Fly from Death".\\
At the same time, at the Malfoy Manor, Voldemort got a sense of dread, right before dying in front of his Death Eater, his Horcruxes destroyed. With his death, Bellatrix Black was finally free from the Imperius she was under since he teenage years, and taking her sister Narcissa, jumped into the floo to Hogwarts in order to . . . reward her saviour.\\
His deed done, Harry looked at Dumbledore one last time. "You see, Old Coot, it was as simple as that, if not for your stupid plots". Shocked by what had happened, and outraged by the insult, the genius Dumbledore forgot to breath for 30 second before his survival instinct finally kicked him and swallowed some air. Just as he did so, the door opened and Susan Bones, Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood and Daphne Greengrass entered the room, just as the floo flared and Bellatrix and Narcissa appeared from it.\\
"Now that this is done", "The Master of Death" said, "Know that Amelia Bones know all about what you did, and will arrive in 30s to arrest you. As for me, Hogwarts as nothing more to teach me, so me and my lovely bethroved, as if you could keep them hidden from me and in Hermione case try to give her to Ronald Weasel with love potions, will pass some lovely times in my private Potter island in Greece. After this, I may clean Magical Brittain of their stupidity and break this stupid Statute because the Muggles are better than wizards, they went to the moon after all. And don't think you can stop me by calling me a Dark Wizard, I use both Light and Dark Side, I am . . . Grey". By saying so, he used his amazing powers and apparated out of Hogwards despite the wards, taking all his girls with him. Albus thought he saw more girls leave with Harry than he thought he mentionned, but it was probably an halucination of his feable old mind. And it's not like Harry could satisfy all the girls of Hogwarts if he chose to. This was his last coherent thought before Amelia Bones came from the floo and arrested him, putting him in Azkaban.

Sorry way longer than one line. And sadly I'm pretty sure I forgot some
