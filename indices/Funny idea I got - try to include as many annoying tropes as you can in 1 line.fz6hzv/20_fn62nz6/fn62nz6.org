Not gonna lie the dark!harry trope is something that I really like as long as its well written and has a decent plot and doesnt have the even more annoying trope of harry being part veela/part elf/ part dragon hybrid with a blocked magical core and all that random shit. Not adverse to Dumbledore bashing but once you've read one of them you've read them all so the trope gets very old. Not what you wanted but just some opinions..
