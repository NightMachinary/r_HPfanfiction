Thanks for the recs! I actually struggle to get into bashing but keep trying to give it a go because some really good writers have done it. Do you mind if I ask how you know if it's a good bashing fic or a bad one?

Also - does it feel like you're confronting the negative traits of characters when it's done well? I'm genuinely trying, like it's a cuisine I just don't have the hang of haha. I keep on reading them thinking they're super out of character but maybe just reading the wrong ones?
