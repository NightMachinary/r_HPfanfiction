A good bash fic is like a good whump fic: larger-than-life characterization that indulges the id and brings about catharsis. Sometimes that little, primal part of you just wants to see someone pay for being mean to +you+ the protagonist. You don't wanna be fair, you don't wanna be reasonable, you don't wanna see the other person's point of view. It's escapism.

Badly done bash fics, IMHO, don't set that scenario up properly. The reader still sees the bashed person as reasonable or sees them as horribly OOC. Or they'll have the revenge be disproportionate enough that the protagonist loses the moral high ground. A good bash fic indulges the reader's desire to be vindicated against antagonists, to be Right while your enemies are Wrong.
