From my perspective, bashing is just somebody getting slammed in to a metaphorical wall, for some shits they did in canon, or somewhere in the past. A good bashing fic will usually deal with the person bashed in a very serious way or a in a crack way. But don't let me tell you that, I love bashing fics because i have a stone heart and want somebody to get hurt.
