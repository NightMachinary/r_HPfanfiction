Thanks , I think my thought was more of the fact that I see Percy as the black sheep, idk about his older brothers but the twins and ron don't look up to him , the twins even make fun of him, and Ginny always felt very independent and not wanting help from her brothers, but I imagine a scared fem Harry latching onto an older brother figure and him enjoys the responsibility and trust that comes with it. Male Harry would also be more inclined to be friends with Ron because they live together for most of the year , but fem Harry would still be friends with him just not as close , which I think would make a closer bond with Percy , but that's just my opinion
