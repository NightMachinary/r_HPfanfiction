Ahhhh shit I can't find the name of it but there was a really fun F&G time travel fic I read that I really loved. Fred was sorted into slytherin. If anyone remembers the name please add it.

In one of my faves Hermione ends up with george and in the sequels has a nice depiction of him so imma leave that here since I can't remember the other one. /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]])
