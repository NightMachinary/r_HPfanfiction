You could probably expect the rift to be very subtle in the Wizengamot, with everybody trying to downplay its importance. In reality, it could be the one key issue which regular folks use to align their political views. I think it could be interesting to read about the mentality of 'muggleborns are the cause of all our problems' gaining traction in society and Wizengamot members slowly getting bolder with their discrimination. Could lead to some interesting complications, such as an anti-muggleborn minister being elected (assuming OP is making the position electable) and starting to legally diminish muggleborn status. Of course, he would have to clash with Dumbledore in this endeavour, which can only lead to great scenes.
