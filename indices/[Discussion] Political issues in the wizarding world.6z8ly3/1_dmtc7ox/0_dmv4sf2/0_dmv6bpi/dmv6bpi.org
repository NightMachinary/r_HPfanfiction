I'm talking about postwar period, when Dumbledore and Voldemort were both dead, the blood purity movement was discredited, and Harry's gang had taken over Magical Britain.

This issue would gain more urgency as Muggle technologies has been advancing at a rapid pace and it became more and more costly to maintain the SoS. Minister Hermione Granger saw the danger and was deeply worried about its disorderly collapse. Muggleborn or not, she faced the difficult choice of opening up and preparing for the inevitable collapse of the SoS, or increasing the isolation and tightening the use of magic in Muggle areas.

The issue could tear their gang apart, because both sides had indeed good arguments.
