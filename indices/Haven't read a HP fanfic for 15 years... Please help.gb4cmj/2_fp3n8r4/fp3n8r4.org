Here are my top 3 R/Hr fics:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Major AU. Lucius Malfoy took some risk and won big after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore had to leave for France, where Harry was raised by Sirius and went to Beauxbatons with the Weasleys. But they would have revenge 18 years later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): A long and grim war epic, with very detailed depictions of small unit military ops. Political intrigues and manipulations are ripe. Canon Horcrux Hunt would have never worked against this Voldemort.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Set in a non magical sci-fi AU, this fic goes through all 7 years and tries to map canon events in this world. Things are however very different at times, especially so in Year 7.
