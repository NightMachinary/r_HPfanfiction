Time to list some personal favorites. Fraid t

Make A Wish - linkffn(2318355) - An absolutely amazing story that is super fun. Also, anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is a good read. I strongly recommend checking his stories out.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - Most touching fic in my opinion and one that is always going to stay with me. Has Harry acting fatherly which is always great. This one is not Ron/Hermione friendly.

Grow Young with Me - linkffn(11111990) - Also an amazingly touching fic that I recommend to new folks.

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - This one is cute and I like to share it.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - One of the best Harry and Daphne fics out there and has good read and reread quality. Its sequel is just as good.

Inspected by No 13 - linkffn(10485934) - A good fun crack-fic that is well done. One to be shared with others for sure

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A well thought out and interesting world-building story that also delves more into the magical culture.

These are my basic fics I recommend to anyone. I hope you find something to your liking here.
