I would suggest either the arithmancer-verse series which focuses on a really, really math smart Hermione who tests into arithmancy early.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

For a crackfick, but one that is really, really good, I suggest linkffn (Like a Red Headed Stepchild) which follows Harry that looks like his mother (with red hair) comes to join the weasily family and proceeds so SOW CHAOS.

As of my most recent top suggestion nothing beats linkffn (Harry is a dragon, and that's ok.) While currently incomplete, it has just started the equivalent of year 5, and updates regularly.
