Very minor. The kids only get a few chapters in the second half. On the Hogwarts Express first year, James, Sirius, Lily and Severus happen to choose the compartment with a sleeping Professor Potter. Harry points out the stupidity of Severus wanting his best friend to join the anti-muggleborn house and Snape takes it to heart. He ends up up in Ravenclaw.
