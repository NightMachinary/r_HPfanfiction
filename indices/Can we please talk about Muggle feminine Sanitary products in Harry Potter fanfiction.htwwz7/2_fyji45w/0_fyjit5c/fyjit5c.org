I've read fics where there are potions or spells that deal with all of those problems, providing a magical solution to overcome vision, blemishes and appearance. When Hermione gets her teeth fixed, she consciously chooses not to have buck teeth anymore.

We're talking about magic here. There's a freaking spell for everything. There's a potion that Regrows. Your. Goddamn. Bones. Who would be denying the Witches of Hogwarts fundamental feminine hygiene? SO MANY WITCHES would be getting their periods at school. But every time I've seen that in a fic, it's always pads and tampons and not a spell or a potion. It's really, really jarring.
