  Who would be denying the Witches of Hogwarts fundamental feminine hygiene?

I just had to pull this comment out, and say, /everybody/. Look at the muggle world - in the UK, women have had to pay an additional tax on sanitary products because they're considered a 'luxury', a tax which has only been abolished in this year's budget (after a LOT of lobbying/protesting). Period poverty is a genuine thing experienced by many women. Girls across the globe have to miss school because of their periods. Realistically, I don't see why wizarding Britain and Hogwarts in particular (which seems to prefer to turn a blind eye to student safety and support anyway) would be any different.

That being said, it's not particularly something I'd like to read about in a fic and it amuses me that fem!Harry dealing with her period is so common that it appears to be a trope!
