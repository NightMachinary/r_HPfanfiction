I mean, it's just not true that wizards and witches /use/ spells for everything. They still brush their teeth with toothbrushes. They still have showers rather than cleaning themselves magically. They still shave with razor blades. They still do laundry. They light their houses with fire, not Lumos charms.

The overwhelming evidence of canon is that wizards typically use physical objects to perform day to day tasks rather than using spells to directly achieve the end result. The difference is those objects are enchanted. Maybe the shower is enchanted to be the right temperature, and maybe the razor blade is animated so that it shaves you itself. But they're not just using spells to go /zap/ and achieve the end result.

In fanfiction, sure, you can make new stuff up. But let's not confuse that with canon. And let's not pretend that it would fit tonally with canon either - the aesthetic of wizarding society is not some sci-fi universe, nor is it high fantasy.

And I quite like it that way. This will probably result in my being called a boomer again, but I think there is a certain comfort in a well-made object. In our world of disposable fast fashion and vegetables that come wrapped in two layers of plastic, there is great attraction for me in the idea of the simpler life. Objects that are built to last rather than be thrown away after a single use. Vegetables that you've grown yourself. A fire which brings not just light and heat, but also atmosphere and the feeling of being home.

As Muggles, there are many good reasons why we don't use fires anymore. They're fiddly to start. They make a mess. They create carbon emissions. They're difficult to regulate and you can easily get too hot.

But with magic, you can have the benefits without the drawbacks. And once you can do that, I think the "traditional" option is just superior to the "modern" one. Why would wizards stick a Lumos charm in the ceiling like a magical light bulb, when they could have a cosy, instant-start, no-mess, magically regulated fire burning happily in the hearth? Why would they use a spell to wash, thereby robbing themselves of the relaxing, mind-clearing ritual of water?

*All that said:* with respect to periods, in VP I simply have the girls take a potion each full moon. So long as they take the potion, they don't get periods.
