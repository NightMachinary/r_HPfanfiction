It could also be a preference thing

while you could use a spell to shave, you would get a far worse shave then using an enchanted item designed by experts to shave you well

so it might literally not be worth the time investment to learn the spell oh and if you want to try a different beard style, you might have to learn a completely different spell but your mate who bought the enchated razor can change things up how he wants and we know wizards can grow hair with magic so perhaps the razor is also enchanted to do that so if you shave and change your mind the razor will regrow the hair for you
