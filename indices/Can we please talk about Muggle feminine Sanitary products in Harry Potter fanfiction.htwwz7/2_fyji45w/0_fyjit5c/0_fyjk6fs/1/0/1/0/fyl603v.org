*Maintaining multiple spells simultaneously*

I feel like this is too innumerable to count. Flitwick levitating hundreds of ornaments at Christmas time. Neville remaining petrified while the trio completed the 3rd corridor tasks in PS. Any time anyone casts a protective charm then goes on to cast other spells from within its protection. Casting spells while dissilusioned.

I can't think of any example of a spell failing because a wizard then went on to cast a different spell. The fact that spells stay in effect once you've cast them is kinda the basis of their whole society. And the system you're proposing, where wizards use lots of objects with spells on them, relies on this exact fact. A charm on an object is still just a charm; if casting another spell cancelled the previous charm you had cast, that would include charms you had cast on objects.

*Casting multiple spells simultaneously*

This is rarer. The most obvious example is Harry casting 3 stunners at once in DH, where he is holding 3 wands. That's a pretty limited and specific example, but it shows that it's possible in theory to cast multiple spells simultaneously.

I don't think it's limited to situations where you are holding multiple wands, however. I'm fairly sure Dumbledore's animation of the statues in OotP must have involved numerous spells at once: one, to bring them to life, a second, to direct them to follow his will (we see in HBP that Hermione uses a separate spell to direct the birds she has conjured), a third, to strengthen/shield them (Bellatrix's spells bounce off them after Dumbledore animated them, where a moment before, when confronting Harry, she had blown off a statue's head with a single spell). So I think Dumbledore cast 3 spells on 3 different statues with a single wave of his (single) wand.
