Nail on the head. I've had an essay stewing in my mind for a while about how wand casting magic is single threaded -- you only cast one spell at a time. From a user experience perspective, when you think of a wand as basically a souped up multi-tool/smartphone for this analysis, that sucks. The natural inclination and solution is to enchant things to have features and functions instead of relying on charms constantly. And you're totally right: there's a significant satisfaction (and market) with objects that do things.

Why cast a warming charm when clothes would most likely be already enchanted to keep your temperature regulated? That should be the default for all clothing, not just high end stuff.

Similarly, why couldn't undergarments be enchanted to vanish bodily fluids on contact. Take a potion for the cramps and balancing the hormones, sure, but the process of menstruation itself is very natural and unlikely to be messed with directly. They'd more likely just make it more convenient.

I actually have my AU set up where women's magical resonance fluctuates with their cycles (based off hormone levels). So they wouldn't want to completely remove periods. But that's just the direction I went with mine.
