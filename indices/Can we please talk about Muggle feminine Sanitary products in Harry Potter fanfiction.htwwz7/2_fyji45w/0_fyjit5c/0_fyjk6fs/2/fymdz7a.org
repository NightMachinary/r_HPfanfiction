my favourite take on magic is in the dingy corners of diagon ally, the unused classrooms of hogwarts, the weasley home in general. These places bring normalcy to magic that makes it so attractive to me. Not that magic is'nt this new discovery for a bright-eyed muggleborn entering a new world, but that it's also a well worn and old part of some other witch or wizard's life.

The older more careworn look make sense to me because it puts forth an impression of what I imagine magic would do to people's priorities. Maybe it's a look that's characterized by the wizarding world shuffling into the shadows, but that's not as whimsical for me.

I pine for the weasley house, though. To me it reads like a house held together by intention and magic. There's a homeliness inherent to a building that seemed to grow ramshackle for their needs. Where magic isn't used to negate every concern and worry. Where magic works hand in hand with time and effort. Where a mother's and father's love and care for their children builds an impossible house even as they struggle with poverty.

i'm tired and don't want to care about proofreading whateever the hell I just wrote,
