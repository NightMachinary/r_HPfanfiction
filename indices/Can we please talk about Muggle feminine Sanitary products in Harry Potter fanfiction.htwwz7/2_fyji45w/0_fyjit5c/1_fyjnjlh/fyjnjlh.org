Yeah, they would be getting their periods at ages 11 and 12ish, most likely, some of them before they even start Hogwarts. Are they ready to perform those spells on their own bodies right then, when they've barely learned anything? I think it's very likely that even if there are spells for this, they use muggle products at first, or hell, maybe the purebloods use what muggles used 200 years ago: a rag.
