Tl;dr: Thank you for this ride, I have never put so much thought into wizarding menstrual cycles before.

Feminine hygiene (and women's health in general) is under researched in the muggle world, so I can easily imagine that it would be in the wizarding world too.

I think the problem with a spell or potion is that you would come against the problem of side effects. Yes, wizards can regrow bones but it's extremely painful.

Also, what interactions would a period potion contraindict? Could taking such a potion only be necessary for cases like PCOS and endrometriosis where pain and significant health problems balance out, say, not being able to have grapefruits, hair or life saving potions? (Grapefruits interacts with many muggle medications.)

Does the potion itself cause side effects, perhaps headaches, stomach aches, mood changes, extra spots, a slightly green tinge, etc? Perhaps long term effects - hormone development (do you need a fixed quantity, would it be too changeable in teens) or can long term side effects occur if you take it too young?

Do you need to vary the dose or take it at particular times in the cycle? Under 16s generally have a settling in period with periods. As much as the idea of taking it at the full moon (a suggestion downthread) sounds highly convenient it doesn't match up which are typically far longer than the adult cycles. Even in adults, healthy cycles can be from 21-40 days. So if you're a teen who doesn't have or know the pattern yet, you'd be a bit fucked with a potion.

In the muggle world, a serious consideration for giving under 16s the pill is whether they are reliable enough to take the pill regularly. Teens are developmentally the same in both worlds so it strikes me that Madam Pomfrey/St Mungos might not prescribe potions to young people.

As for spells, well, the pre-OWL years mostly focus on spells on objects. For example, the Cheering Charm is an OWL level charm. Eloise Midgen, on the other hand, tried removing her spots without the experience and ability required and had to have her nose reattached, leaving it permanently off centre. If I remember correctly, the staff weren't very impressed about it.

On this basis, it seems to me that spelling periods away would be (at the earliest) a NEWT level skills with most women unable or wary of performing it. Potentially, it could even be something taught during Healer training and akin to a hysterectomy.

Since muggle products aren't electric, they shouldn't interfere with Hogwarts and therefore could easily be used by muggleborns who trust them more. There's also the fact that Hogwarts uses toilets and (as far as we know) toilet paper as well as baths and showers which seem to have a few special effects rather than being fundamentally different to muggle items. So at some point, muggle hygiene practices integrated with the wizarding world.

I can imagine that spelled products would be popular - for example a fabric pad (of sorts) which stops blood spilling onto clothes, but either sufficiently absorbs or vanishes (perhaps one variety is more expensive than the other) the flow. Given that wizards previously shat on the floor and vanished it rather than simply bespelled it out of them, this makes more sense to me.

Potentially something akin to a moon cup, for those who are less squeamish but don't don't enjoy the transit process from body to pad?
