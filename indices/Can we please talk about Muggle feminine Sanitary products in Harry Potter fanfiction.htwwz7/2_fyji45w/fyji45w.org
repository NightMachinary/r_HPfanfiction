Wizards and witches of all ages wear glasses. There's a young witch in the books who struggled with acne. Snape has crooked, yellow teeth and greasy hair. Dumbledore's nose is crooked. Hermione had frizzy hair and Harry had a mess of hair.

While I'm certain there's a spell or potion to deal with each of those issues, those people either don't want to change them and/or don't have the ability to do so. In other words: fem Harry doesn't have access to the potions/spells required to deal with menstruation.
