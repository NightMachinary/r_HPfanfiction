My head canon is Madam Pomfrey has a class just for girls where she introduces then to pads/tampons and teaches them the simple spell that vanishes all the blood so they can be instantly reused indefinitely.

Meanwhile the boys are told nothing so they have to learn about life from their parents and each other. One dreads to think what poor Neville thinks is going on. I imagine Hannah having to get be him a crash course in female anatomy.
