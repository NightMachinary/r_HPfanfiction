You see I'm expecting the visit with Madam Pomfrey to be somewhat similar, where she sits down fem!Harry and gives her the talk, but then I'm expecting Madam Pomfrey TO PULL OUT HER FUCKING WAND AND TEACH FEM!HARRY THE FEMININE HYGIENE SPELLS BECAUSE SHE'S A FUCKING WITCH. I was not expecting Madam Pomfrey (or whoever showed fem!Harry the ropes) to pull out muggle feminine hygiene products in the third or fourth fic IN A ROW which addressed this.
