Hogwarts has toilets in canon, if only so they can get smashed up by Trolls or have a thousand-year-old Basilisk hiding in a secret tunnel behind the sink. Presumably the average toilet actually gets used and it's just kinda wired up to the wizard equivalent of a septic-tank.

That said, agreed. Unless it's actually super-relevant to the character or plot, just don't mention the unmentionables.
