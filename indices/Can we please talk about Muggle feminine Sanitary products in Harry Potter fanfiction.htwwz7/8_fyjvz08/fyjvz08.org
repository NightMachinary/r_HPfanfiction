I don't really know why it has to be addressed at all. I don't care how wizards deal with their poop, if their toilets just vanish it or if they've got a variant of whatever charm Lockhart used to vanish Harry's bones so they can vanish waste straight out of their colons, or if their toilets are magically (or non-magically) connected to the Muggle sewage system, or even if they just dump everything into the Lake. It really isn't relevant to character development or the plot, so you can think of whatever solution you want.
