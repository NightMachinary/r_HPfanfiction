Even if the younger years might not have the ability to be casting spells directed at their reproductive organs, I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination that enchanted underwear would be easily accessible (or super easily cast) and leagues more practical/hygienic/straightforward than muggle sanitary products. I really like how it's addressed in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] where the author has an older witch explain 'domestic' and 'female' charms to Hermione, among them spells to better deal with periods. It's addressed in a very realistic way considering the world building, as one of the comments is that witches are weary of using products they haven't enchanted themselves as unsavoury types may use their blood for magical rituals when it is "vanished".
