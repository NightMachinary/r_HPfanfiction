"Miss Flannarty?" said Binns, blinking owlishly at the student before him.

"Flanagan, Professor," replied said student, looking quite red.

"What seems to be the problem, Miss Felicity?"

The ghost seemed to waver physically for a second, and an utterly baffled expression came to his face. "And...?"

"Umm.. do you have... a tampon..?"

"A what?"

"A TAMPON!" she suddenly shouted.

"I heard you the first time, Miss Flaherty. No need to shout. What is a tampon?"

"Merlin's sake, it's /Flanagan/! I want something so I don't stain my knickers, alright?!"

"Well, I've never heard of these "tampons", but I'm sure the hospital wing menstrual cups. The pewter ones are quite popular."

Miss Flanagan's face blanched at the idea... "Nevermind, professor."
