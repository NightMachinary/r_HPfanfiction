I'd disagree with that one. The term 'simp' is usually used for a guy who does anything for a girl in order to get inside her panties, but once he learns that pussy is not a reward he moves on... maybe even insults the girl. I think Snape, even if at some point had romantic feelings for Lily and he is also quite creepy, genuinely cared about her as a friend. He spends the rest of his life atoning for the sin that he was accomplice to her death and does this without anyone (except Dumbledore) knowing - even going as far as being hated by everyone towards the end of his life.
