Regardless, he risks his life for that kid. And aside from the general argument that the kid looks like his father... there are many things to be said about it, such as the fact that Voldemort could penetrate the minds of his servants and if he saw Snape treating Harry well there would be consequences. Not to mention that Voldemort could also see through Harry's mind. Also, in before, in HPB the connection is broken... Snape doesn't shit on Harry's work in DADA. He is annoyed by the fact that he acts disrespectful towards a professor and almost kills a fellow colleague, easily lies about it and then he doesn't show any remorse. Even if you were the loving parent of such a brat, you would not tolerate such a behavior.

Don't get me wrong, Snape is a foul, vindictive and nasty character but I don't think he falls in the category of what we call nowadays 'simps' or 'incels'... not from the book description anyways.
