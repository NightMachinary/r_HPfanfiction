That is a horrific argument.

1) He repeatedly harmed James at school, "he gave as good as he got" and he literally got him killed and only begged Voldemort to save Lily.

2) See above, got her killed, and begged Voldemort to save her for him...you know to swoop in as her saviour after getting her husband and baby killed. But yeah congrats, he didn't rape her I guess...

3) This isn't even true, any strong emotion (like obsession) could change a patronus.
