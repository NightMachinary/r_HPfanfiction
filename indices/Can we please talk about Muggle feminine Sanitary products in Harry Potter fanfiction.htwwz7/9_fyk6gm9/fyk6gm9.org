I wouldn't necessarily say that there's a spell to outright stop menstruation, as that would come with its own pitfalls, but rather something that automatically vanishes the, er, mess somewhere along the way.

It /periodically/ vanishes it for as long as the spell is in use, I'd say. This also allows for greater opportunity for witches to go commando beneath their plain black robes whenever they want, just like the boys. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Magic is the great equaliser, yeah.
