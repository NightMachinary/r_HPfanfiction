Wizards use the Hogwarts Express, which is a locomotive that only goes back and forth to the magical Village which is right next to their magical School. Wizards are seen using a single train to get back and forth to and from a magical destination.

The only car we ever see them using in the series is the Ford Anglia that is INVISIBLE TO MUGGLES AND ENCHANTED TO FLY.

The Knight Bus is a double decker Style bus, but its resemblance to muggle Transportation stops there.

When we see those pots in Molly's kitchen, they are washing themselves. Normal pots do not do that.

The clock in the Weasleys home isn't actually a clock; it's a dial that magically tells where every member of the family is and what they're up to.

Look I get it. Certain things in the Wizarding World seem mundane on the surface. However everything that Wizards and witches come into contact with gets touched by magic. Can you imagine the Ford Anglia being completely mundane, or the Knight Bus just being a regular muggle bus, or the Hogwarts Express just being another part of the British Rail System that only goes back and forth to Hogsmeade?

The Wizarding World has a sense of Wonder attached to it. Wizards using strictly muggle products and muggle items blows up my suspension of disbelief. The muggle-borns have a little wiggle room with this but even something as boring as cellophane tape had to be repurposed into spellotape. I'm assuming feminine hygiene would be handled by spells or potions but honestly I wouldn't mind If madam Pomfrey pulled out a packet of any of the magical Sanitary products which have been mentioned above; I do mind if it just says Tampax on the tin. It's not magical. It's lazy.
