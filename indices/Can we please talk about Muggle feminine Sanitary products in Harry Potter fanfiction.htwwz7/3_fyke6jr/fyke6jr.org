Women have been dealing with menstruation for thousands of years, without using modern tampons. I don't necessarily agree that there's a spell that just eliminates the whole process, but there's certain to be some form of dealing with it available in the magical world. In keeping with the rest of the world building, it's probably something old-fashioned in form, but with either an enchantment or the use of simple spells (e.g. scourgify) to make it as useful and safe as a modern Muggle tampon. I'm not sure exactly what that would be (or how disgusting or unpleasant it might seem), but I agree that the idea of going to a teacher for Muggle goods is ludicrous.
