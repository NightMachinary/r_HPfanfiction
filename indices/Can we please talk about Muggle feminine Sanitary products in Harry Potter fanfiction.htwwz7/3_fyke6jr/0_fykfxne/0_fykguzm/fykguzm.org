This is essentially what I'm getting at. Historically women would have used something similar in concept, but different in materials and overall appearance. Or maybe there were other historical techniques that approached it slightly differently, I don't know.

Probably whatever was common in the 18th and 19th centuries, but with more magic.

Though one just directly using a magical plant is actually a good idea
