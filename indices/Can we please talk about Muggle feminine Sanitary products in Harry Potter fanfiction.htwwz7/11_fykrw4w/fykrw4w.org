I agreeeeee, in my headcanon, they must have potions to just not have you period, but just like taking muggle anti baby pills without pause, they still do mess up your hormones. so a lot of girls/women take different approach. spells to vanish it right when it's leaving, or underwear that takes it in and you just wash it afterwards. hell, even muggles have such underwear. the magical type would be just slimmer, basically just a normal one with a spell on it.

the reason why I don't believe they would use muggle products are quills. so they use quills instead of pens. do you really think they would take pads and tampons from the muggle world? most wizards don't even know how to dress muggle. and yes, there are muggleborns, but conventional pads only existed for what, a hundred years? you would think witches would find a way by then already.
