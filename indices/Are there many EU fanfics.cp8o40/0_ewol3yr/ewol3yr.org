You know, for a moment I though, 'why does this guy want a story about Harry Potter and the European Union?'. Then I put it together, meant more like Star Wars EU. Anyway...there are a few I can think of:

linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is an OC during the canon story who mainly stays out of the limelight in Hogwarts.

linkffn(The Wandsmiths) focuses mainly an OC child of Ollivander, with some interesting wandlore involved.
