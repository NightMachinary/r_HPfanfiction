I've heard good things about The Ollivander Children and its sequel, The Ollivanders at War. They focus on Ollivander's grand-niece Calliope, who after leaving Hogwarts went to study in Boston, but when Ollivander is taken by Death Eaters during the war she returns to England.

Canon characters make guest appearances from time to time, especially the Order of the Phoenix, with Tonks getting the most prominence as Calliope's friend from Hogwarts, but the focus is mainly on Calliope, her brother Linus and her Muggle friend Mark from Boston.
