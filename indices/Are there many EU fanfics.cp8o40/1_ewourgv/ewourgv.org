linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas; A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - Starnlicht is a period piece, so really it's exploring a different time than a different place. A Long Journey Home is about Jasmine (fem!Harry) Potter being tossed back into Ancient Egypt and living her way back to the present while trying to stay out of the way of history.
