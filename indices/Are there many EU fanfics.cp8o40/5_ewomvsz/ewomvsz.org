Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

It's mostly a documentary of the international politics after Harry accidentally exposes the magical world to muggles.

There's a lot of original places and things, such as the muggle-phobic Galiver Consortium, a group of hidden islands, the different American magical centers (not MACUSA, it's a little old), the Israeli, Saudi Arabian and South Korean magical governments, Koschei's hidden island, and the martian crater with ancient fossils.

There's also a lot of original plot, including trouble from Westboro, Al-Qaida, Syrdan, North Korea, Voldemort, Rasputin and the Harold-Green pharmaceutical corporation.

There's a pretty interesting plotline involving Hermione in the second half after Harry loses importance.

There's also a lot of things flying around - Bentleys, carpets, nukes, DeLoreans, spaceships.
