well, yeah. As a Ravenclaw, I am curious as to what the minimum murder necessary to create a Horcrux is. Could I kill an innocent non-sentient? Either way, there's an obvious way to get around the 'only have a fraction of my soul' problem - simply:

- Create some clones of yourself (actual RL not-Hollywood-science clones).
- Do minimum murder to make said clones into your Horcruxes. If you need a sentient, use criminals condemned to death.
- This establishes intitial Horcurx Legilimency soul-connection.
- Since there is no mother's-love barrier, and you have awareness of the connection, use the link to slowly copy your mind into the clones as they grow up.
- If possible (i.e. research this), integrate your soul-shards into their souls completely.
- When they are old enough to successfully perform Horcrux ritual, have your clones make you into their Horcrux. Then have them perform it with each-other, so each body has a piece of everyone else's soul.
- This way, you have an army of yourself, linked into one super-mind, like the Borg, each ensuring everyone else's immortality. If you can integrate the soul-fragments, you can thereby avoid the insanity that tends to arise from having a partial soul.
- Rinse and repeat as needed.
