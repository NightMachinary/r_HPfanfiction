Why use an Unforgiveable if you could use Legilimency or a Pensieve? Or in other words: Why make yourself guilty of a crime if there are legal ways to do it? I mean... I suppose you could, in theory, but why would you?

In canon the Unforgiveable Curses are 100% seen as evil magic. Even the Imperio Harry used on the Goblin was described as a last way out.

In all "humanitarian" uses of the spell, I could easily think of other spells, or create my own, that would do the trick just fine. Instead of ordering someone to feel no pain, why not use a spell that numbs the body?
