Forgivable uses of the Unforgivables:

- AK: Quick death of minimal pain (other than that of dying). Other than 'mercy killing', also for any case where the only way to stop a very bad thing is the death of someone, or where there is a (magical) shield that would stop other spells.

- Imperius: Person X must perform an action, and cannot summon the willpower to do so. e.g. Person X is trapped, has to saw off own leg. Circumstances prevent use of direct spellwork to teleport or remove leg. Person Y uses Imperius on X so X can remove leg with minimal danger. Or Person X is about to (innocently) push big red 'end of world' button, so stunning or immobilizing spells could cause it to be pushed anyway.

- Cruciatus: Depends on how it works. If works by, say, making every nerve fire, it could restart heart, breathing (as part of a magical CPR), or disrupt a seizure. Could possibly also disrupt migraines or cluster headaches - a single moment of cruciatus might be better than an extended migraine or cluster headache. Even if it works by magically inducing the sensation of pain in the mind, that is still going to manifest in extreme brain stimulation... so the latter uses might still apply.
