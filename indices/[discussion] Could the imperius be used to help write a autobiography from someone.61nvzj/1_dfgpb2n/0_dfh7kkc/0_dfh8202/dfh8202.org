Meh, I don't know about the Cruciatus.

I mean, we know that you need to hate in order to cast the Cruciatus. If you don't hate a patient, you won't be able to cast it. Also, if we're talking hypotheticals, I could see healers using animation charms to make the heart pump and the diaphragm move to push air in and out. Also: Headache Potion - cures all headaches.

The Killing Curse and the Imperius are more open to debate, I'd think. Though I also feel like they should have some sort of penalty, or difficulty to them. There gotta be a reason why casting an Killing Curse is "unforgiveable", but blowing the head of someone off with a Reducto isn't.
