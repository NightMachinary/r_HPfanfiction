I'm pretty sure security questions are supposed to be a lazy defense against polyjuice, not imperious.

Also, I think the books show how imperious works with actions rather than more cerebral things. In book 4 when Moody casts it on Harry, thinking about what is going on helps Harry break the curse, so I wonder if something that requires more thought would be easier to break in the early stages.
