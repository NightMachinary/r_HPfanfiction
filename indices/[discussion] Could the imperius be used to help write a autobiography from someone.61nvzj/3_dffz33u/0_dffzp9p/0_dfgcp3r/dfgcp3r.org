That is where subtlety comes in. When doing cartwheels, there is no real objection. You don't tend to hate cartwheels on principle. But commanding things which require thought is easier if you make it things they want to do anyway, and harder if they have an objection. That's why Imperious in the Ministry is so dangerous. You dont force someone to make a law, rather you force lots of people to do paperwork which when put together is evil. They were all doing paperwork anyway, so it isn't as if they can really object to their job. It's just that the small tidbits which seemingly don't matter actually make up the plot.
