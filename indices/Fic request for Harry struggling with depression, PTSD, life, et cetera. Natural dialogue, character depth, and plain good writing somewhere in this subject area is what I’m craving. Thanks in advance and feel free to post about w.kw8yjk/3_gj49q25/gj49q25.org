Yes, another chance for me to promote my all time fave fic: linkao3(the secret language of mistletoe by Endrina). The working title was Harry is depressed and Draco is a Communist or something to that effect. (Takes a gooooood while to get there.) Writing is top-notch and the series is complete.

Another one I read recently that I enjoyed is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1104020#main]]). This one is pretty smutty, but it is also about working through trauma. This is the author of the fantastic and popular "Away Childish Things."

Both of these are slash, btw. Happy reading!
