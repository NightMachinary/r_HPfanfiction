From reading this and remembering certain scenes in the series, part of me is now wondering how Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucyfar would interact... I suspect they'd get along until Bellatrix tried to do something truly sadistic or started ranting about blood purity, at which point Lucyfar would kick her ass or even kill her.

Lucyfar is from Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm A Supervillain, she's a professional supervillain (professional in this case meaning follows a treaty established between the heroes and villains decades ago to outlaw torture, targeting secret identities especially families, etc) whose powers include being tough as nails and creating blades of shadow she can telekinetically control, and her schtick is she identifies as the literal devil, and has a Batman/Catwoman-like relationship with a 6-winged hero named Gabriel (she's even known to flip-flop and play the hero randomly, often but not always at Gabriel's prompting, such as one example where she turned on a villain she had partnered with after Gabriel pointed out the guy's bombs were gonna hurt kids). Suffice to say, she drives like a maniac and is the fun kind of manic-insane.
