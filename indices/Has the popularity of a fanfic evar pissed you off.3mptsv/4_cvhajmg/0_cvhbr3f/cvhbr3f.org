This is true, and those of us who don't agree can only roll our eyes, mutter "no accounting for tastes," and move on. But some of the most popular fanfics truly are dreadful - embarrassingly bad SPaG, crimes against characterization, emotional idiocy all over the map, utter lack of coherence, and a weird naivete about the way the world works. Not to mention some flinchworthy ideas about what exactly happens during various sex acts.

I don't like every popular book or movie, but most professionally published books and most films have at least /some/ baseline of good carpentry, pretty pictures, decent sentence structure, competent actors, and so on. A lot of popular fanfics can't even claim that much.
