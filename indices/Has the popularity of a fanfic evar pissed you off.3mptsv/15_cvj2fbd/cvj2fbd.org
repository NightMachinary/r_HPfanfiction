Yes! It drives me crazy when a story has thousands of favorites and reviews and it is poorly written or one of the characters is really not in character in a bad way. There was one that bothered me that I remember clearly. It was something about corporeal punishment in Hogwarts but I couldn't get passed the first two chapters because it was so incredibly sexist and endorsed girlfriends and wives who submitted to their partners without question.

It was completely against every value I hold as a feminist and what pissed me off the most was how popular it was.
