Popularity per say doesn't ever make me mad, but I feel really sad after I finish a really great, well-written, fanfiction, with unique ideas and a cohesive plot, and see like 200 reviews.

- There are very few fics I would call well-written by the way, I wouldn't even call many of the ones on my favorites list well-written.
