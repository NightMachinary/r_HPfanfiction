I understand that everyone has their own likes and dislikes so I can't say I hate any fic because it's popular. I do however get annoyed when everyone refers to the same fic in every post due to its popularity. I come to reddit to get suggestions on new fics to read and it gets annoying when the same fic is mentioned over and over.
