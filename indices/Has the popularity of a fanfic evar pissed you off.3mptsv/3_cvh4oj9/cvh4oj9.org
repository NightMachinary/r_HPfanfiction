Definitely. Well, it doesn't piss me off. It's just confusing and strange. The one I'm thinking of is a WIP fic that's frequently recommended on here, even by people whose tastes are usually in line with mine! I have no idea why it's so popular and I honestly thought they were joking the first time it popped up.

There's no accounting for taste!
