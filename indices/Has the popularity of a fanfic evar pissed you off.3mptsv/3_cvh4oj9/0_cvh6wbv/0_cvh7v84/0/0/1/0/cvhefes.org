I'm the opposite, fem!Harry turns me off a fic. I don't like that we know she ends up intact, it kills any sense of danger or that something unpleasant might happen. Oh you own a restaurant? How exciting, interesting and shocking.

I'm usually all for time travel especially to time periods without canon to follow, but holy moly I have no interest in this fic at all yet so many people harp on about it.
