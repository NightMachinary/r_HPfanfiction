Those with more cultured and refined tastes have long realized that popularity and how good a story is are not the same thing. Like, just look at Twilight as a prime example. But, for fanfics, you got stuff like Poison Pen and Isolation with over 10k favorites, and they're just not good stories.

Heck, sorting FFN by favorites, only 2 of the stories in the top 25 are what I would consider good (Make A Wish and A Black Comedy), with another being a guilty pleasure (Deprived). And I say this knowing that I'll be downvoted for not being on the MoR or TLIL bandwagon.
