Everyone ITT is raging on DAYD, but I feel like Bungle in the Jungle is equally bad...

Bungle hasn't aged well, has a terrible bashing start that the entire plot hinges on, utterly one-dimensional female characters, OOC-to-the-max Harry, egregious 2nd person narrative... Yeah, jbern's wards are cool, but that's not hard to find in fanfiction anymore; to me, it's not worth slogging through the rest of the shit just to read one of the original "wards" fics.

I didn't get all the way through TLIL because I sensed it was going to go the same route of one-dimensional females with an unbelievable casanova!Harry.
