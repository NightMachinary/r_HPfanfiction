I don't get pissed off exactly, but I don't understand the hype about Oh God Not Again! and I often see it recommended here.

It's basically a retelling of canon. It does some things differently and then has to jump through hoops to make sure canon happens anyway. +Sometimes+ So often it has to retcon things to fix the plot holes it makes.

Harry is this weird pseudo-soapbox for the author sometimes and he has these random thoughts (usually to try and fix a plot hole and explain why it makes sense that everything is still following canon) that feel completely shoe horned in. Sometimes it's just the author replying to reviews by having Harry have some random thought.

None of the characters were likeable, except weirdly Lockhart. They all have the "speak like grown ups" problem and they often don't even seem like friends. Harry is completely obnoxious, the worst of a bad bunch.
