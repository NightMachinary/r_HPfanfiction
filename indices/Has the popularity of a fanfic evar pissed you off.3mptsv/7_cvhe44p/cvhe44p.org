There are people pissed off at how popular the Harry Potter series is and don't think it deserves the praise it gets compared to <insert book/series here>. The thing I've found I enjoy about fanfiction is there's generally something for everyone, what anyone else thinks of a work of fiction is irrelevant. I'm sure there are plenty of FF writers that deserve more praise or readers just as I'm sure there are books and series that will never make it to HP heights that deserve more praise as well. Best way around that is to recommend what you enjoy and usually people looking for that certain story will stumble upon it.
