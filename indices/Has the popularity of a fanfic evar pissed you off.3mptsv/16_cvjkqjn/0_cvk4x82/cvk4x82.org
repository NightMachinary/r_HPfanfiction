Really? I thought it was brilliant. Nice and long, author with a soapbox (one that I agreed with, unlike a lot of others), and a resolution that makes sense of everything in the plot. (though not necissarily the mysteries of magic)

But I'm young, and the main attraction was an author I considered about as smart as myself (for better or for worse). Also, I have a reputation for liking things that I shouldn't while I'm reading them. I'm sure that in a decade I'll look back on it and either hate it, or remember it as the best thing ever.
