It annoys me sometimes. Other times it makes me sad for the writers I love, who don't get the appreciation they deserve - or would deserve if quality were the measure of popularity. I just hate to see talented writers discouraged by the lack of response, to the point that their desire to write for the fandom fades and dies. (Or, speaking selfishly, if it compels them to switch to another fandom I don't follow, which means I still lose the excitement of seeing them post another piece.)

There are several fics I loathe, and quite a number whose popularity baffles me - although the latter would probably number in the thousands if I didn't skim tags and first paragraphs for hints of the writer's skill. The truth is, I skip almost everything, even in my OTP. But I have a hard time justifying bashing other people's work in public - with the exception of DAYD and HPMOR. Most writers don't actively offend me; they're just bad, often beginners who play to the latest tropes and whose fics appeal to their age groups.

Femslash writers, writers interested in unconventional pairings or who deal with tropes complexly or not at all - they're usually not escapist enough for the majority of fandom, and their work is snubbed. I wish it were otherwise, but reading for pleasure is rarely about good taste, and when it comes to fanfic, you can multiply "not about good taste" by a power of ten.
