This kind of attitude I absolutely cannot relate to. If I were thrust into the past I wouldn't be concerned about my personal entertainment. I'd totally want to befriend my best friends again (even if their childish behaviour gets on my nerves) and I'd want to help them. For example one of my best friends had a much worse home environment than I was aware of when we were younger: I would invite him over much more than I already did. There's also a guy who I sat next to in school and was a kind of friend that killed himself a couple of years after school. I'd certainly want to try to be a better friend for him.
