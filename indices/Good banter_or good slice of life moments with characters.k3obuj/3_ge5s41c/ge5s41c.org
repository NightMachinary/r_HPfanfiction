That basically describes my fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon][/Loose Cannon/]]. Banter starts in the second half of the first chapter, so you won't have to wait long.

It's not finished yet, but it's hella long (>750K words published so far) and I update every week. No bashing, and no mortal peril.
