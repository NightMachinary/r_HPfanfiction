  Who will be next to perish? Should he support the Ministry? Does Dumbledore have a plan? These questions and more haunt Harry as he and his new Order train for war and vengeance in-between three weddings and a funeral. Hogwarts is stunned when Snape gets the Defence job. Will he too be struck down? Harry has been warned about the returning Potions Master, but how can he resist hearing tales about Slughorn's favorite student, Lily Evans?
