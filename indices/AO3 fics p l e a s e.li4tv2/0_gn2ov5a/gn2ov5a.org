- Magnificent series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], which is probably the best Petunia story I know about.
- Another series is “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]”, which is something different than your average Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter story. Very different and very highly recommended.
