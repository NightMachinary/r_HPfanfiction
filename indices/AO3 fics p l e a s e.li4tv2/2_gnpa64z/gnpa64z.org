Mmh. I'm a bit late, but AO3 has some pretty good filters. Just go to the Harry Potter fandom, exclude Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy and whatever other ships you don't like. Exclude explicit rating to filter out the worst of the m-rated stuff. Finally, sort by hits or kudos to see the best stuff first.
