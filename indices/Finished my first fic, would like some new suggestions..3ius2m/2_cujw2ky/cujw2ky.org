*linkffn(Reign of the Serpent)*

It's wildly AU so might be a cool exploration of that for the first time. Primarily from the POV of Hermione, although Harry is a prominent side character along the lines of say...Draco? Or Neville maybe.

If you like Slytherin you'll love it cause it's the world if Slytherin had won and become immortal. Tom Riddle is the Headmaster and former leader of the feared Death Eater Squadron that fought against Grindlewald in an ongoing war in Europe and the Order of the Phoenix is an 'evil' rebellious group like the Death Eaters were in canon.

Oh and the houses are caste systems. Muggleborns have no caste unless risen to a higher one by the Ministry/Salazar.

It's really cool and is a WIP so if you like it I suggest making a fanfiction.net account to get update notifications.

*linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)*

Basically Snapes life. That's all there really is to say there. Really good but he's horrendously whitewashed and ever bad thing he does is somehow a total accident that isn't really his fault and the Marauders barely appear. Really well written though and the pre-Hogwarts years are great.

*linkffn(Against the Moon)*

Also a WIP, but wonderful. Again it's basically Remus' life and there's not much more to say there. IMO is far better than The Snape Chronicles, it's just as well written but makes everything much more realistic from what we know of canon.

*linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)*

Voldemort's horcrux takes complete control and Harry doesn't exist. The single funniest fic i've ever read. I'm actually rereading it now.

I'll also say this, not liking canon Harry doesn't mean you should never read Harry-centred fics, you'll miss out on a lot of amazing works that have Harry there in name but not spirit. Like Harry who's raised by Elves in *linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them)* is not canon Harry by any stretch of the imagination. *linkffn(harry potter and the boy who lived)* involves Harry's family surviving including his brother, the boy who lived. Harry goes to Durmstrang in this and it's unbelievably good but Harry is basically an OC.

Hope one of these is enjoyable anyway. :)
