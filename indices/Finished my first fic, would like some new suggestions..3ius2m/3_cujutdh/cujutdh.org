You mean you just do not like Harry as he was in the books, or you can't even stand the idea of reading a fanfic with him as the main character? Cause if the former is the case, you should know that there is an untold number of stories where with the right 'tweaks', Harry becomes a much better MC.

Plus, you'd miss on too many good ones if you simply skip on those.
