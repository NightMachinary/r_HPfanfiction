[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7753649/1/Allegiance]] One of the best "Ginny gets sorted into Slytherin" stories I have ever read. Be warned the author has not completed the story or updated in a while, but still a good read in my opinion. Sticks to cannon for the most part

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2110560/1/Changing-Sides-and-Hearts]] Another one that looks like it will never be finished, but still a fantastic read. Ginny is tired of being overlooked in life, and decides to look to the Slytherins for help. Loosely follows cannon
