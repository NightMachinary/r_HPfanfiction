I've been on a Haphne kick lately.

Really liked linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13566959/1/If-not-for-Umbridge]]), and the direction that linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13771500/1/Wrath-and-Remorse]]) is going. Those are the only new ones I can recommend that were written in the last few months.. It's a little bit outside your timespan, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13653786/1/Serpentine-Advice]]) is really good, too.
