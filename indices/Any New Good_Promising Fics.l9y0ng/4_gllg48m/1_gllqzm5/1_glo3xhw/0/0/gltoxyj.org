Is this a better summary?

"HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off /anywhere/ else. Magical travel between worlds is possible if you have enough power, so Harry gets to meet some dragons! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore."
