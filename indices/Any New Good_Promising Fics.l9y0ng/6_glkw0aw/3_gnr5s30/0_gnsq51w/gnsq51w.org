Well, these are the 1st two that popped to mind, although I don't know if they're exactly what you're looking for.

Harry Potter and the Unexpected Mother by StruggleMuggle; linkao3(24446656). Recently finished.

Saying No by Bobmin356; linkffn(7274734). Half serious, half crack; inmates taking over the asylum.
