If you don't care too much about realistic character development and 11 year old geniuses, then HPMoR. It's got quite frequent and consisted time travel. For example, when Harry's trapped, he plans to use the time turner to rescue himself once he gets out and gets rescued by his future self. Then there's quite a few scenes and fights where he's in multiple places at once.
