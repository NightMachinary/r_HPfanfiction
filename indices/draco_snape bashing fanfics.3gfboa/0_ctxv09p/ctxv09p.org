I don't personally read anything with bashing because it's the surest sign of a horrible story written by a man-child author for man-child readers, so I have no recs for you. That being said, Robst seems to be the type of author that would bash. I might be wrong about that, though, I've never fully read any of his works. Beyond him, you could probably just google search Draco or Snape bashing and find a lot of fics with it.

On second thought, Partially Kissed Hero probably features bashing of Draco and I'm pretty sure it has Snape bashing. Again, though, I've only read a few chapters, so I can't be sure.
