I think your view of Snape and Draco is quite shallow. However, there are literally thousands of fics that do exactly what you want - most average, terrible, and badly written. You might want to start with something like linkffn(Harry Crow), look at more of Robst, or go on Scryer and search for Snape and Draco bashing.
