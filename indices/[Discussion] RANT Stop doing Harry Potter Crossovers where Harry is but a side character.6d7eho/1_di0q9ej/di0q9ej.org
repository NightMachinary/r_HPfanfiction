A-FUCKING-GREED!!!!!!

Every Grodd damn time! It's probably the worst in GOT crossovers because nothing ever changes when it certainly should, especially if you add a character of Harry's caliber into the story. An example of this is in a story I read where Harry has all his magic, he's friends with Ned stark, he's there at Neds execution and yet Ned still fucking dies. Like what mate? What the fuck?! He's a fucking wizard! He should be king of Westeross yet he's relegated to a fucking bystander.

Even worse is those stories where Harry warns Ned about Baelish and pretty much has everything figured out yet somehow Ned still act's the same way he did in canon.
