I both agree and disagree, because I think it comes down to character motivations. For the GoT example, Harry might be morally inclined to save Ned, but at the cost of revealing his magic to all of Westeros (assuming it was being kept quiet in this case). Maybe he has greater plans that Ned would be in the way of. Or maybe he just wants to bang Sansa and Ned didn't like that, so he says 'fuck it' and lets him die. I guess I can sum it up the whole thing with 'could vs. should.'

Plus, canon Harry generally seems to hate being in the limelight so being on the sidelines and playing support rather than going all Big Damn Heroes on the villain du jour also makes sense, as long as the job gets done. There's a lot of different angles to this, and in the end it comes down to how good the writing is, and if it makes sense for the character to do that thing they did, rather than what we the audience want them to do.
