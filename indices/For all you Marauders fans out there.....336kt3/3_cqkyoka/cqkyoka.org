I'll ask one question, and it is a critical one: is this fic yet another one where the author more or less implies that Snape deserved everything James and Sirius did to him in order to make them out as perfect heroes?

Sirius is one of my favorite characters, but so is Snape; my problem with most Marauder-centric fics is that they make me have to choose between two of the least clean-cut characters in popular culture.
