I mean, the oceans pretty big, so despite shipwrecks being an (obviously) finite resource, there might be a more than you think.

I just looked at a Wikipedia article titled 'List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean', and it divides it into pre and post 1492 (Columbus). So even ignoring everything before then, that's 500 years worth of shipwrecks out there. And that's just the one ocean.
