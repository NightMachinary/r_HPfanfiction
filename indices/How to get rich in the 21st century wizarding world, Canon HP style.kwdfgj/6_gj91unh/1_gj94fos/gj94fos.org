True, though at greater depths pressure is a problem. My solution would be an application of animation and unbreakable charms combined with Protean. Let dolls do my diving while I watch the progress in my Protean-charmed mirror and direct them from my ship.

That, and "point me" acting like GPS is fanon. In canon, it's merely a Four Directions Charm, and shows north. That means a bit of extra work there. Might be more worth it to just take a boat on a grid search and use Accio XD
