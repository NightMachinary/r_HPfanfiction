I always thought that Fred and George's patented daydream charms could be the first step towards the next big thing in the wizarding world. Fanon likes to portray the wizarding world as stagnant but I don't think that's the case at all - magic is intended to progress in an analogous way to technology.

So if you wanted to go a Neuromancer type route you could definitely portray a 21st century wizarding world where increasingly wizards are occupying a "virtual" shared dream world, and where George Weasley has become the richest wizard in the world as a result.
