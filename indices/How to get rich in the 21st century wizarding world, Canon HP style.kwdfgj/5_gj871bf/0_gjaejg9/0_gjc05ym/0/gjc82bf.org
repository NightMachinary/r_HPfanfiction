I took some liberty here with interpretations, in that i'd made it so the ICW alwasy works alongside locals or in parallel to them, so that they can keep the handle on secrecy side of things if a country goes to shit.

When it comes to Voldemort, they did a hell of a lot of the work keeping magic secret since it wasn't like death eaters and Voldie were particularily concerned about such unimportant things like muggles.

In that particular instance, ICW simply beat the Brits to the punch in apprehending the perps - a part of their quest of getting ahold of the more resourceful wizards. Some shock and awe, a few legal threats, and a sweet promise of helping their business continue as long as they maybe agree to work with ICW once in a while and keep more cautious about their business.

As for the 1 vs 4 thing - not all wizards are of the same skill, and if you get a drop on someone it should be fairly easy to subdue a few people, especially if you're skilled and they're not.
