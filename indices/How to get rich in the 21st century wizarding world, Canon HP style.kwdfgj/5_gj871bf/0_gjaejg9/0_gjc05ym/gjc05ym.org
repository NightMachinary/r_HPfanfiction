Not really, you are free to do whatever. Thing is, normally it would not happen. ICW does not handle individual cases - it handles nations, and there would not be any ICW agents until the situation was already shot to hell (complete breakdown, no longer a country), or they were specifically invited. I mean, they ignored Voldemort.

Add in that they purchased all properties they flipped and removed all magic before selling them, legally they could not only win the case, but also sue for harassment after. The addition of Mind Magic charge could be used to discredit prosecution - they never used any. Just perfectly muggle cloth tents, as used by other extreme house flipping teams.

Add in that they were confronted by one official... The natural course of action would be the guy finding himself obliviated, drunk and in Soho.

But otherwise, it was cool, and generally the more words get typed, the happier I am XD
