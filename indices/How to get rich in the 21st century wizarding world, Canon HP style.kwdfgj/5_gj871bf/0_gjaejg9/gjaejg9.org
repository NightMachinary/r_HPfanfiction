***/later, at a local pub\/***

*"*Cheer, drink and be merry, friends! It's not every day we can claim such a success!"

Sometime in the evening, all four of them have found themselves sitting at a table. Their last job was bigger than any single one before. "/Who would have thought that you can make so much money renovating some decaying ruins?",/ Sarah thought,"/How come noone else had ever done it before? It's so easy!"/

Most of the homes ended up being sold, and after a grand opening of their own private cinema their group decided to celebrate their success. That it was their seventh official job seemed to make it even more fitting for a celebratory drink or ten.

They've placed their orders, and only a moment later a middle-aged gentleman with a tray of five glasses approached their table and deposited one glass before each of them.

"I didn't want to be nosy", he began, "But i've overheard that you kids are drinkin' up for some success here, aye? Well, i've come to come for a small celebration myself, so i thought i'd share my cheer with ya!", a good-natured smile adorning his features.

Sarah looke at her friends exchanging glances. Sarah shrugged, and made an inviting gesture towards the older fellow. Newly rich or not, who they were to refuse a free drink?

"Thank you, sir, it's very nice of you", she said. "What is it that made you so happy today?"

"Ah, i've got me old job back, kid. Been tryin' to get that un for ages, i tell ya, but somethin' always came up. What about ya young folk then? Got into Oxford or somethin'?"

"Ah, nothing of the sort, /grandpa/", Mark said in good humour, "We're running a business here. Property renovations. Just got our seventh deal done since we've started a few mo... years ago", he recovered, masking the slip up by taking a heavy sip from his glass. His eyes widened and bulged, as if he were to suddenly start choking on the liquid.

"Don't likin' the good, ol' Islay whiskey, eh? Don't ya dare spit it out, Lagavulin ain't cheap!" the old man jeered with a wide grin, then punctuated his statement by taking his own glass in one go and slamming it on the table. "What it was you said, thoug'? Seven house flipped in few months?" he asked with a raised eyebrow.

"Ah, no, no, i really meant years", Mark countered, "After all, it takes work and time and effort. We aren't magicians or anything" he 'joked'. Everyone gave a bark of laughter at that.

"Aye, that you aren't", their guest said. Sarah thought she noticed a briefest glimpse of something sharp in the man's eyes, but before she could dwell on it she felt her legs get gipped together something fierce and her whole body stiffen.

The man smiled and rised, looking at four now teenagers before him, now bound and petrified. Sarah realised the whole pub seemed quiet, as if no sound were to reach their table. She saw the waitress that took their original order walking by as if everything was in perfect order and she didn't see their predicament. She turned her eyes towards the man.

"Michael von Usedom, ICW", he finally deigned to introduce himself, "You're under arrest for gross violations of Statute of Secrecy, misuse of muggle artifacts, unlicensed use of mind magics on non-magicals and running illegal business ventures. I'd say you have a right to remain silent, but that seems kind of redunant, now, doesn't it?". He was still smiling, and Sarah wanted nothing more than to wipe that grin of his face. Of course, that wasn't really an option at the moment, but a girl could dream.

Now introduced ICW official put his left hand on the table, his other now visibly gripping a wand. "/Portus",/ he murmured, tapping the table, and suddenly the world lurched and spun, lights flashing. Sarah felt her breath knocked out of her lungs as her back hit the floor at a new location. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her friends suffering similiar fates. That ICW bastard still stood, smiling, only now he was suddenly dressed in deep blue robe instead of a casual suit he sported earlier. He waved his wand, and more ropes bound all of them as the /Petrificus/ curse lessened.

"Fuck. You", John spat, "Don't you ICW folks got anything better to do?!"

"As a matter of fact, we don't", the official anwsered, a small smile still playing on his face. Sarah could see a slow transition happening, his beard lenghtening and graying in some sort of artistic pattern as he slowly paced to the table to pick another glass.

"Do you think you're the first smart cookies to come up with a scheme to profit off of muggle world? No, my dear friends, you're just recycling the ideas that people better and smarter than you have tried for generations", his smile widened, "After all, i have been one of them!", he laughed. Sarah felt at a loss. What did they did wrong? Where did they fail?

"Well, I'm sure you'd love to hear that story, but i'm slightly pressed for time. You know, muggles to obliviate, assets to secure, Ministers to meet, that sort of thing. Someone shold pick you up soon, anyway." ICW wizard continued, "Do take my advice about remaining silent though. As long as you stay nice, you might even learn how to avoid such mess in the future".

He turned to them, his eyes glowing with a faint sheen. "But do remember", he warned, "Don't try to escape. It won't end well", with that, he apparated.

Sarah could hear some wiggling from her side, propably Mark trying to wiggle around enough to turn and apparate. She, on the other hand, wasn't even thinking about it. She barely even registered the parting words from the ICW official. Her gaze was focused on the full-wall window that was right in front of her.

Behind the glass pane, all she could see was endless black void, dotted with tiny specks of white. Right in the middle of it, she could barely make out a bigger speck, blue streaked with white, fluffy patches of clouds covering the planet they just left.

Took me a while to think of some interesting direction to take this one. I hope you're not mad i've sent your protagonist to jail.
