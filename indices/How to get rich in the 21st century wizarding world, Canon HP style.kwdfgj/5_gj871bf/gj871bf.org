If you passed Henry by on the street, you would not know he was homeless. His clothes were old, but clean and cared for. His beard was trimmed, as was his hair. He didn't carry the smell of someone who went days without a shower. And even if all he had were three changes of clothes, no one would know.

The factory he had been working on went under almost two decades earlier and he could not find a stable job since, but he was still young enough to work construction from time to time, and still had his papers up to date. Sometimes he was hired for the papers, but construction work was easier to put on the paperwork. Rates were lower, too. He didn't mind. He could not afford a flat, not with his irregular income, never mind a house, but he could affford the necessities. It could have been worse.

The occasional jobs were enough to cover food and water, and even electricity. The abandoned cinema he was squatting in he kept in good enough shape that it looked like it was still owned. The nearby lots with warehouses and garages were empty, too, but more because there was no value in the area than anything else. Structurally unstable. Mine subsidence. Unlivable. Still, his cinema was fine, and he visited the garages too. And then, one day, three kids, barely out of their teens came to him with an offer to buy.

Well, they didn't phase it like that, but they found the place, they liked it... They said they would be willing to pay him to testify. He had lived there for more than 12 years, after all. With his testimony, they could claim the whole area, the cinema, the overgrown, empty lots, the warehouses and the garages under the squatter's rights. They offered to cover all court costs upfront. They offered to build him a proper house, one he would own both the building and land it stood on. They just wanted all the rest - and if he proved his presence, and his work keeping out vermin and paying bills for utilities, the little he used... WEll, the electricity company didn't check if the old cinema went bankrupt or if he owned it - all they cared about was that it was connected to the grid already and that there was someone willing to pay for their power.

Henry though on it for a while... and agreed. The property was repossesed and formally granted to bim and to his partners within a month, during which time they visited to talk and to survey the land. It turned out that land had been in something of a legal limbo, so the adverse possesion was approved by default. There was no one to challenge the claim. He had insisted that the cinema would stand until his house was ready. He didn't have money to live in a hotel or anywhere else if it was demolished. They had just smiled then.

A week later, a tent had sprung up over the first property. By the second week, all were covered and hidden from prying eyes. By third, his cinema was no longer surrounded by ruins. Instead, there were beatiful houses with small gardens and white picket fences. The road had been repaired too, the asphalt smooth and the brick of the sidewalks even and neatly fit into place. Mining damage vanished like an illusion.

"Here you go, Mr. Strong. This one is yours! And here's the deed, already filed and legally binding. "

He barely fought back tears as he receieved the sheaf of papers from the girl, Sarah, who brought back to life a dream he had given up on since after his first workplace fell. To live on his own land, in house he owned. Mark, Sarah, Jessica and John, four children barely drinking age, had managed an impossible. A miracle. Henry lost his battle.

"Alright, that is the seventh spot. Jessica, you said you had some buyers already lined up?"

"Yeah, Mark, we've been over this already." she responded "I've got three families ready to move in as soon as you finish the road. Good job on the local surface, but we need an access to the motorway if we want people to buy. How's that going John? "

"Almost done. Should be ready by wednesday"

"Great. And the cinema will be ours, as we agreed. Sarah?"

"Yeah, yeah. All the permits are secured, we own all the surrounding area, we can do whatever. Good thing we strted now, in five years it would have become a monument, and complicated matters. You're not paying me enough to deal with that!"

"But, we do an even split! You get whole 25%?"

"Exactly!"
