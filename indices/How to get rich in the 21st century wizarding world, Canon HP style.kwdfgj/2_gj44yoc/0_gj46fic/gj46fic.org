I'm not sure if it'd be that legal. Muggle authorities, especially tax related, would find it suspicious and investigate. Magical authorities wouldn't like the potential breach of Secrecy. And they probably have laws in place to prevent Wall Street from being overrun with wizards with halfway decent divination skills. Any realistic magical government would put a lot of effort into making get rich schemes exploiting the muggle world more difficult. They'd probably get suspicious at anyone trying to convert large amounts of muggle money to magical currency. Making lots of magical currency without getting into trouble with the government would likely require doing something completely new, something difficult to detect (magic powered Bitcoin mining?) or something perfectly legitimate like selling inventions to other wizards.
