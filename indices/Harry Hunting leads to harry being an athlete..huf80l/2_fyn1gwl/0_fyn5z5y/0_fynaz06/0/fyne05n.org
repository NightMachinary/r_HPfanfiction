  From what I understand of canon, Harry didnt interact with people a whole lot outside of his year.

That's putting it mildly. He didn't even know Susan Bones' /name/ in /The Order of the Phoenix,/ and that was after four years of having her in Herbology, at the very least.

He also didn't know who Cormac McLaggen was, despite McLaggen being only one year older, and shared his Common Room.
