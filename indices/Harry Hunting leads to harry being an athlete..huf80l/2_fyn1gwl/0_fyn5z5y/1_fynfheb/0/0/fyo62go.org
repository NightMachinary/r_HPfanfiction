I don't think Jk really thought that far beyond Gobbstones, chess and quidditch (the latter which I think we can all agree wasn't /really/ thought out) for fun (I may have forgotten some).

It's a shame that the books didn't show more at Hogwarts, with the other characters. However much it doesn't work logistically it seems a shame that we got "Dean forest" rather than the dark reality of Hogwarts 7th year. The other books were too repetitive in the details.
