Oh yes, someone else who says 'tis'! I don't get the hate aimed at poetry at all, it's not boring unless you read a boring-ass poem, I fondly remember a funny poem from my childhood, featuring an eccentric old man and his young and closeminded son. I forgot the name :(, I know it was in an exam workbook or something...
