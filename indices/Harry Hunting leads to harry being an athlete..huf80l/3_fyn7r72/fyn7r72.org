I always liked the idea that Harry Hunting made him very sneaky and stealthy in addition to being athletic.

Add in hiding from fans and enemies in Hogwarts and I just love the idea of Harry being a master of stealth even without the Cloak and maybe going on to (in a crossover mostly) become a spy, information broker, or assassin.
