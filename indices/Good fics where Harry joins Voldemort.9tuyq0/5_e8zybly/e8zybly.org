I'm writing one now, but I'm waiting until it is finished to post it. Here is a rough draft of the summary.

To protect his friends Harry is forced to join the Dark Lord. Taken from Britain to a far away land, Harry shall find the markets of the Ottoman empire have more to offer than pomegranates and figs, djinns and slaves. Amidst new friends, cultures and creatures, he becomes a centerpiece between two brothers fighting over the throne and discovers magic he could only dream of.

Linkffn(Lindsiria) is the old version. I've been updating my profile with my progress.
