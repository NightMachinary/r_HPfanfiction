Yes!!! I've seen one where they band together against cyborgs. I think it was a Next Gen Star Trek or Babylon 5 crossover set post-series.

I'm pretty sure it's a full scale invasion style story but I wouldn't say with 100% confidence how obvious the non magical presence was.

I'm on my phone atm but I'll remind myself to search for it tomorrow when I'm on my pc.
