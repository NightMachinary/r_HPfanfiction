I'm also fascinated by this possibility. By the year 1992 (end of Philosopher's Stone, start of Chamber of Secrets) the Statute would have been in place for 300 years. Its third century would be a fine time for it to be lifted.

Heh, you know that thing in Iron Man Armored Adventures where gathering all 10 of the Makluan Rings drew the attention of the Maklaun Empire to Earth?

Maybe the destruction of the Philosopher's Stone, extraordinary transmutation artifact that it is, causes a unique energy signature to ripple out from Earth, drawing the attention of aliens from another planet...or another dimension.
