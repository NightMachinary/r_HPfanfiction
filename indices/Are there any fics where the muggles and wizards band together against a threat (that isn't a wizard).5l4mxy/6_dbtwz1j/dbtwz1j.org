It's mostly seen in fics where there's been an extinction-type of event. However it is mostly touched on in the first one or two chapters as a way of explaining what Harry and company tried before going to another world. I have seen this in various Warcraft and Game of Thrones crossovers.

From the description there seems to be some Avengers crossovers which suggest that there are cooperation between muggles and wizardkind, but I've never read any of them. But then again, those aren't really muggles, but instead the Avengers type of muggles (advanced science, super heroes etc).
