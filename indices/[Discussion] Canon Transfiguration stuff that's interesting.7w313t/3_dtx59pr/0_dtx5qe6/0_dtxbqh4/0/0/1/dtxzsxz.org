But I guess your way is right, even if it's like the speed of light thing where light ALSO does travel from one thing to another, it's just so fast there isn't a delay for our eyes! :) Because yes in canon Snape did say that "Time and space matter in magic." So I guess yes it's like light that it WOULD take travel time, it's just so fast we don't notice a delay for MOST spells? :)
