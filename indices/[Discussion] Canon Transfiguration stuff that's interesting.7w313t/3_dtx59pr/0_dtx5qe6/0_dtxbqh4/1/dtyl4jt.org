I had an interesting brainstorm this particular topic.

My current headcanon is that some spells have a more distributed magical profile and other spells need to be focused into smaller time and space. Spells also lose power faster over distance when they move, so the further a spell needs to travel the more likely it will be condensed by the caster into a projectile.

For example, a stunner is a focused spell that overcomes a wizard's nervous system by applying a great shock to a specific point. Thus, every stunner travels as a highly compressed red bolt that's easy to see. Where as something like McGonagall transfiguring the desk into a pig, that's diffused magic over a larger area. She was also likely standing right next to the target. The magic of her transfiguration would require a much higher sensitivity to see, enough that first years and muggles wouldn't manage it at all and adult wizards would have to be looking for it.

This also leaves open the idea that different wizards have different spell profiles for the same incantations and wand motions, given their competency at the intent part of magic and shaping the magical "energy". Invisible spells would be just as much a sign of a skilled wizard as nonverbal incantations. Flashy spells could serve the same purpose for different reasons.
