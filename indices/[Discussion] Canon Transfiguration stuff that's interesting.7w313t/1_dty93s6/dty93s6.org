In Harry's first Transfiguration lesson McGonagall transfigures her desk into a pig. Earlier in Philosopher's Stone Hagrid attempts to turn Dudley into a pig but only manages the tail.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][Pottermore]] says that /"the pig is often considered a particularly non-magical animal and is notoriously difficult to charm."/ I like to think that McGonagall is showing off her skills to the class and to the pure-blood children in particular who would've been taught that pigs are non-magical and difficult to make magically.
