Sound is easily explained by the presence of air around the subject, the difference in volume between Malfoy and a ferret means that when his volume shrinks drastically, there would be a sound resulting from air rushing in to fill the space. When the reverse happens, the ferret suddenly takes up as much space as Malfoy, and the air has to move away from him, which of course means it creates a pressure wave, commonly known as sound.
