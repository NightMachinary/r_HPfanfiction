With the colour change thing, I always imagined the charm as being like "painting" the target whereas transfiguration would be changing the material of the target to one with a different colour.

The mandrake detail is a nice catch, thanks for posting :)

Maybe the size difference between Malfoy and The Amazing Bouncing Ferret(tm) meant that the air was displaced extremely quickly, causing a tiny sonic boom? Both transfigurations appeared to be pretty much instant.
