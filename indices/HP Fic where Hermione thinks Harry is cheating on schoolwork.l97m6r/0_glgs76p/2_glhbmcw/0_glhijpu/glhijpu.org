Oh lord. I'm considering reading this now.

Edit: I changed my bloody mind!

This is the scene OP is talking about if anyone wants to read it. By the way, there's not even smut between James and Severus. And that's the only reason why I bothered skimming it.

I feel betrayed.

*Hogwarts, School Board Meeting Room - May 11, 2002*

It was a month after the twins birthday when Severus walked into the school board meeting. Granger had finally gotten angry enough at her low grades to file a complaint. Severus wasn't the only one that had been summoned to this meeting. Filius, Aurora, and Samson, the english teacher, were all sitting next to him.

“Ok, our next complaint was filed by Hermione Granger, first year Gryffindor, against Filius Flitwick, Aurora Sinistra, Samson Thrace, and Severus Prince-Peverell, claiming unfair and biased grading. Headmaster Dumbledore and Deputy-Headmistress McGonagall have come to speak in her support. Sebastian has said that he will not be voting on this due to a conflict of interest as Severus is his husband.”

Alice stated as she looked over the eleven page complaint. Really, all a student needed to do was state their name and issue. It took less than a single paragraph to file a complaint. “Ms. Granger, as you are the one filing the complaint you may explain your issues first.”

“Thank you Mrs. Longbottom. Over the past few months I have found that my assignments have been being marked harder then my classmates. It doesn't matter how much information I provide, nothing is ever enough. I have repeatedly gone to the professors to show that I have done the work, but they just won't listen.

I study and research the best ways to cast spells, but it still isn't enough. I do the readings, but when I answer the questions in class I get in trouble. It isn't fair that I am being marked down for no reason...”Hermione read from a sheet of parchment.

She then continued on for almost half an hour. But it was basically just her whining that she wasn't getting the marks she wanted.

When she finally finished, it was Minerva's turn. She spoke about how bright Hermione was, and how she should be receiving better grades. Dumbledore said that it all must be a slight misunderstanding. He felt that Hermione's lower grades were just a mistake of the teachers, because Hermione was obviously the brightest witch of her generation. Hermione preened at that.

When the time came for the professors to speak, Samson was the one selected to speak for them.

“As we have all told Ms. Granger, repeatedly, if she wishes to improve her grades, she must follow instructions, and do the assignments that we assign, not the ones she wishes we had assigned.

It was this board that gave us the marking scheme that we use. It dictates how we are to mark. We have only been following those guidelines. We have repeatedly explained to Ms. Granger what we expect from her assignments, but she won't listen. We can not give her top marks when she doesn't do the work properly.

None of us deny that Ms. Granger is highly intelligent, but it takes more than that to get top grades. We are trying to teach our students to be able to critically think about things, but she just keeps repeating what the books say.

Ms. Granger refuses to stick to the assigned topics or lengths. For the first two months, we all made allowances, as she and the other students were all just starting, but after then we expected that they would learn how to properly structure their work. Most of the students did learn from the comments we put on their assignments, as well as from the lessons I have taught in my own class. But every time I have broached the subject with Ms. Granger she informs me that I am wrong, and that she shouldn't have to follow the rules I set, even though all the other students do.

The reason she gets in trouble for answering questions in class is because she is shouting out. If we attempt to give the rest of the class a chance to answer a question she gets angry and shouts out the answer over the other students. Yes, we know she knows the answer when she raises her hand, but some of the other students do to and it isn't fair to them to only pick her.

We can not give her special treatment because the headmaster and deputy-headmistress, along with her, seem to think that she should be above the rules.”

After Samson finished, Filius stood up.

“I have also spoken to her about her practicals almost every lesson. While Ms. Granger is usually among the first 5 to accomplish the spells we are working on, that is where she stops. Once she has managed to accomplish the spell once, she pulls out her book and starts reading.

But just being able to accomplish a spell once is not enough. I am trying to teach how to master the spells. Research has shown that the true mastery of a spell can take over one hundred successful castings in a row. Ms. Granger may have accomplished the spell once, but that isn't enough. To pass her exams, she will need to be able to cast accurately, with the appropriate amount of power, on the first attempt.

Reading is beneficial to her work, but not at the expense of practice. That is why we have 2-hour practical sessions every week. It is to help students begin the long process of mastering their spells. She gets marked down in her practicals because she refuses to practice. Whenever I have brought it up with her, she will just tell me that she did the spell and that should be enough.

Like Samson said, we can not give her top grades just because she feels like she deserves them. To get the grades she wants, she must earn them.”

After a back and forth between Hermione and the teachers, the governors put up a privacy ward to discuss the issue. It didn't take very long to come to a decision, even with Molly, Doge, and Vance trying to make excuses for the girl. Alice was once again the one to speak.

“Ms. Granger. After a discussion and looking over some of the assignments you provided, we have decided that there is no evidence of bias or unfair treatment. If you want to improve your grades, do the assignments you are given.

I would recommend looking at the marking scheme that I am told is hanging on the bulletin boards at the back of most of the class rooms. That will show you the break down of how you will be marked. If you want better grades, you must earn them.”

Hermione was furious as she left the board room. How dare they tell her she wasn't earning top grades because she didn't deserve them. She knew that she was being treated unfairly. And, she knew it was because she was muggleborn. When she became minister she would throw all of those death eaters into Azkaban.
