ohh I have read many of those fanfictions. I used to like them but idk it just makes hermione seem less likable and overly bossy. a helpful hint to finding fanfics (or at least how I do it) is to search up:

'harry stops hiding his intelligence fanfic' "harry potter studies hard fanfiction" 'harry potter has better grades fanfic' 'Hermione is jealous of Harry's grades fanfiction'

These search queues give you lots of related fanfics to choose from and are mostly very accurate, a favorite fanfic based on your request would be:
