  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.* “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.”
