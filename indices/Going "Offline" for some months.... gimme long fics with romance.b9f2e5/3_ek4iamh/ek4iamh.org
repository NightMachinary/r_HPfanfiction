If you don't mind crossovers, Magic of the Force by Vimesenthusiast is quite good. linkffn(11577249) Fair warning, the author says he intends to bring other HP characters in, but so far (11 chapters and 400k words) that hasn't happened. Star Wars/HP

A similar crossover, with a more OP Harry is I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by kathryn518. linkffn(11157943) Somewhat crackish, with no actual pairings yet, though several have been hinted. Star Wars/HP

The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger linkffn(11115934) is excellent. Lord of the Rings/HP
