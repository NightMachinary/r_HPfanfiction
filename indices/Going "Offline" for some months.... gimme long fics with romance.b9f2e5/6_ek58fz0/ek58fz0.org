A pretty decent James/Lily fic that is ridiculously long is !linkffn(Commentarius) . Lily is a little neurotic, but still a pretty good fic.

I am also particularly partial to Tonks/Harry fics, so things like !linkffn(Lady Black, Lord Potter) or !linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) or !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change).
