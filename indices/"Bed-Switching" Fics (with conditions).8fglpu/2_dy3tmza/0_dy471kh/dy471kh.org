To be completely fair, rape fantasies are common in both men and women about equally. So long as it never leaves the realm of fiction, I don't personally see anything wrong with it.

But, to clarify, what OP is asking for is two people mistaking each other for someone else, likely their respective partners. In such a situation, who would you call the raper? They both made the mistake.
