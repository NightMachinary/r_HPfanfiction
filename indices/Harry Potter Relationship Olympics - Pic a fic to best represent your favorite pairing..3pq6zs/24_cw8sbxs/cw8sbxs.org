Hermione/Draco - [[http://dhr.accio.nu/gravidy/the-god-of-the-lost/][The God of the Lost by Gravidy]]

Picking it because this is the story that made me see the potential of the pairing. It tears both characters completely out of the setting of Hogwarts and isolates them with each other. They are grown up, and in my opinion stay true to novel characterization adjusting for aftermath of the end and time to mature afterward.

Pretty much every other story by same author is worth reading as well.
