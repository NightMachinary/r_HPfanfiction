/Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=narm][*/narm/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Narm is a term used on the website [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TV+Tropes][TV Tropes]] for anything that attempts to achieve some kind of dramatic effect but, whether because of poor writing or poor acting, tends to instead be unintentionally humorous rather than dramatic.

  The term comes from the show "Six Feet Under." During the climax of its last season, its main character is stricken by a brain embolism. As he suffers from the effects of his sudden seizure, he begins yelling the words "Numb arm," quickly slurring it into a single syllable.

/I really love 24, but that scene where Jack yells, 'WHERE'S THE FOOTBALL!?' over and over is just full of narm. I couldn't stop laughing!/
