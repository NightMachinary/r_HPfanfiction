Well, seeing as Forever Knight and Vox Corporis -- probably the two best H/Hr examples -- have already been mentioned, I'll go in a completely different direction.

I don't know what sort of morbid curiosity drew me to it, but I find the clashes of character in Tom Riddle/Hermione fascinating. The best example for this that I've yet found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima Ratio]]. It goes without saying that this wouldn't serve as a canon rewrite by JKR for a multitude of reasons (not least of which being that the relationship is necessarily dysfunctional, at best). However, it is interesting to examine what caused Tom to become Voldemort, and whether his humanity could have been preserved under different circumstances.
