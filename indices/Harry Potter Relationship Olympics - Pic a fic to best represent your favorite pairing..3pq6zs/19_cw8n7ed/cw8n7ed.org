These two Harry/Ginny oneshots represent the pairing well.

I really like the Harry/Luna interaction in linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Unfortunately, the relationship is just a tiny part of the story and it never really goes anywhere.

Hmm. Ginny or Luna? Why not both? [[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173&index=1][Back to the Garden]] (register to read) handles the dynamics between the new trio extremely well. I also like the Ron/Pansy relationship in the same story, which I haven't seen done elsewhere.
