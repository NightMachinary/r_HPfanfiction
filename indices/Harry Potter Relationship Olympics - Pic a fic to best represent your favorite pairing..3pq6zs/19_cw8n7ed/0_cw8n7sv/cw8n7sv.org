  It was not Harry's heroism, Ron's desperation, her mother's love, or her brothers' toilet seat humor that brought her back (though the toilet seat helped). Ginny breathed deep at night. She wept. She remembered how to rage. She snuck out at night and stole each of her brothers' brooms in turn. She took to the skies and brought herself back to life.
