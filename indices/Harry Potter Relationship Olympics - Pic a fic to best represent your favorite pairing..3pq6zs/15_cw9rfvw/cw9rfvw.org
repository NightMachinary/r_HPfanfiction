Olympics? All right, then, even though there's not a snowball's chance in hell JKR would consider making my pairing canon. Not for a microsecond. Frankly, /I/ can't imagine it. Even so, let me step up to the plate and represent my side.

...which is Snape/Harry, one of /the/ dirtybadwrong ships in HP and from my perspective one of the more interesting cases of popular --> vilified after the rise of Tumblr and the increase in mainstream participation.

Anyway, the fic that first yanked me into fandom is still one of my all-time favorites, Snape/Harry in all their dysfunctional glory, and it contains a boatload of trigger warnings: underage, mindfuck, Stockholm syndrome, graphic sex between a teenager and his much older professor (although readers should remember that Snape is about 35 or 36 as per canon, not Rickman's 60-ish), betrayal, noncon, and other issues I've no doubt forgotten. It also has one of the most brilliant versions of Snape I've ever read, cruel, enigmatic, manipulative, ruthless, radiating a horrific moral ambiguity and intelligence, with just the right ratio of snarl to sarcasm, and a more powerful and dangerous self-determination than he ever actually evinced in canon. The tension between Snape and Harry is off the charts, and it is delicious.

At the other end of the scale (since my feelings about my OTP are strung between two poles) is another fic I've recced a few times here. It's compassionate, romantic, and streaked with poetry, which upsets some people because they can't stand to see Snape described in those terms.

Fucked up and dysfunctional on the one hand, semi-tragic and obsessive on the other: that's my ship.
