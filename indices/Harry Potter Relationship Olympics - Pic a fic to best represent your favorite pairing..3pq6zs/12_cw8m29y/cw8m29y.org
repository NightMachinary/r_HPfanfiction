Most of the ficus mentioned here contain hermione in the pairing, which is fine, but I think some others are being neglected. Some of my favorite pairings are Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne, but I can't think of good examples of the top of my head. Another of my favourites is Harry/Tonks and I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the summer of change) by lorddwar I believe to be one of the best. It is finished but it still leaves loose ends and I would like to see the conclusion of the tale. Edit: fixed authors name with second "D"
