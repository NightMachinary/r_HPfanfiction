Well as my original ship was H/Hr, i'd nominate Forever Knight ([[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]) to represent just how good that pairing can be. It would not exactly rewrite canon as it is /Ahem/ more...mature than cannon. However, it has always been my go to for a good H/Hr rec and I have only really received positive feedback from those who have read it after I suggested it.
