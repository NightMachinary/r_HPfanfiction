Awesome! Check back in and let me know what you think. For me, the second chapter to the point of the prologue are too fluffly but they are important to establishing their relationship. In rereadings, I skip to the point of the story where the prologue is. It is one of my all time favorite stories and definetly my favorite H/Hr.
