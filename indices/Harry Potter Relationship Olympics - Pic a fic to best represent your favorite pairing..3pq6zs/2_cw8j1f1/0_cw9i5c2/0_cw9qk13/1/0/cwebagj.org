The prologue is a scene from later in the story. Thats the point in the story I normally start from. Edit: let me explain a little more. The prologue is from part 2 of the story (somewhere like chapter 13 or 14). I skip to this part not as a knock against the first part of the book, but i feel like the second one is where it really sets itself apart from all other Harmony stories. Homecomming or comming home or something, is the chapter where it felt like most of the fluff for fluff's sake disappeared if i remember correctly. By part 2 in the story, Hermione has come to terms and accepted herself independant of Harry and all that. This is where I like to start because I already know all the backstory and how they got to that point.
