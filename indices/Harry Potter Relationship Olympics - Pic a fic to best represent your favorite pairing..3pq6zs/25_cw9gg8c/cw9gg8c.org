Somehow, no one has posted any Harry/Ginny, so I'll give it a shot even though I don't really read for the ships. I guess my favorite for this pairing would be The Refiner's Fire trilogy linkffn(2163835) or maybe Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent (this one is older and not on ff.net, just google it ya lazy people). Both are really good stories that focus a decent amount on the ship but also have good action/plot besides.

Oh and definitely check out Aspirations linkffn(4545504) for another good H/G, this time with dark magic and costumed vigilantism!
