I think linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) ticks pretty much all your boxes.

#+begin_quote
  in the marauder's era or first war,
#+end_quote

Check. After Snape's canonical death, he's offered a chance to go back to sixth year (after his breakup with Lily) and try again.

#+begin_quote
  where the marauders become friends, or at least make peace with Snape. and then maybe conquer the evil together (if it's in the first war). if it's in their school years, then just becoming friends over something.
#+end_quote

Check. It's a slow process, but they do eventually set aside hostilities. Severus and James are tentatively on first-name terms as of recent chapters, and are working together in the Order of the Phoenix; James is also his teaching assistant.

#+begin_quote
  Please no pathetic Snape and/or too evil marauders.
#+end_quote

Check. Severus isn't pathetic at all; he has decades of experience in magic and espionage. And the Marauders actually extend the olive branch first (several times; they're quicker to forgive than Severus is).

#+begin_quote
  it can be time travel, however, if so, they need to be already enemies, so no first year Snape getting sorted in Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

Check. They have a lot of nasty history by sixth year.

#+begin_quote
  it needs to have a happy ending, or at least happy-ish. therefore, it can't be the canon marauder ending, as in, James and Lily death, with Sirius in Azkaban etc.
#+end_quote

Mostly check. It's regularly updating (the author has drafts several months in advance), but not finished yet. However, based on the story's arc, it's clearly headed for a happy ending of some sort, and Severus has already found greater peace and happiness in life than he's ever had before, albeit with difficulties along the way. He and Lily are happily married, as are James and Marlene.

#+begin_quote
  I'm ok with pairing Snape/Sirius, Lupin/Snape, wolfstar, James/Sirius, even James/Snape (... maybe), but please, no harem. there are fics with Snape being their ... lover, and it being an orgy. not what I want. I would prefer no romance at all, but if it's at side or if the lot becoming non-enemies is still more important than the relationship, that's fine.
#+end_quote

Is Severus/Lily romance ok? There's quite a bit of that. But definitely none between Severus and the Marauders. He eventually grows to /tolerate/ them. Eventually. No way there's any romance brewing. Quite apart from the fact that he has had exactly one love interest, Lily, in his two lives; that hasn't changed.

#+begin_quote
  I love Snape's character (not saying he is a good person, lol), so a lot of him would be great.
#+end_quote

Check. Getting inside his head is the biggest part of the plot, with Lily's point of view being the second.

#+begin_quote
  saving Regulus has plus points.
#+end_quote

Check. Severus' increased influence within Slytherin House, and his avowed split with the Death Eaters, results in Regulus approaching him after the locket is placed, instead of just charging off by himself.

#+begin_quote
  and Regulus and Sirius bros.
#+end_quote

Ok, it doesn't really have this. Sirius is present but is slower to warm to Severus than the other Marauders are, so we don't see a lot of his point of view once they stop actively hexing each other.
