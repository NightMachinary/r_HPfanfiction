Harry, Hermione, and Snape go back. The first half of the fic is Snape, he went back to his pre-Hogwarts age. Changed things a lot. Went to Ravenclaw. Ended up a secret marauder.

There are fixed points in time (Halloween '81, the prophecy,etc), but Snape changes a lot of the timeline. Like no Vernon Dursley. Or Dudley. Hell, when Harry/Hermione wake up, everything is different.
