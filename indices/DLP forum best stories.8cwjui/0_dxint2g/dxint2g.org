DLP exclusive is going to be a pretty short list. There's usually a reason a story doesn't end up on FFN. Like, I've probably posted 50 chapter 1's that never go anywhere and are just abandoned.

The only story I can even think of that has more than 5 chapters and hasn't been posted elsewhere (that I know of) is The Stalking Blood Sack.
