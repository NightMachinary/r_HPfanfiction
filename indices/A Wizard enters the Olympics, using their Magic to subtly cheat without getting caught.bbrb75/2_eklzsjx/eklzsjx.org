Re'em blood is the way to go.

#+begin_quote
  The Re'em is native to the wilds of North America and the Far East. The Re'em is extremely rare, resembling giant oxen with a golden hide. Re'em blood gives immense strength to the drinker for a limited time. However, since demand far exceeds supply, and obtaining the blood in the first place is extremely difficult, it can rarely be found on the open market.
