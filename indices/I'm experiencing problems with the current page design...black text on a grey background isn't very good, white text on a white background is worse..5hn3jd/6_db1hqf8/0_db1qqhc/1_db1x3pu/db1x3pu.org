I don't know how or why you're getting that, because it's certainly not a feature of our stylesheet - or Reddit itself. Reddit posts shouldn't be floating like that.

It's probably some third party app interfering.

Your options are to a) remove whatever third-party plugin is causing that, or b) install [[https://redditenhancementsuite.com/][RES]] and uncheck "subreddit style" on the sidebar
