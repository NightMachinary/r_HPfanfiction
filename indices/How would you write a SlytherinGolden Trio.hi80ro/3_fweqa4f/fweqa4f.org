As I explain on the other comment threats, I do think Hermione has Slytherin traits, and that such traits are stronger than her Ravenclaw traits. SO you need to :

1. First you need to put Hermione there, and for that you need to get around the blood purity thing. Maybe she doesn't read about Slytherin's disdain for muggleborns (unlikely). Maybe instead of Neville she talks to a Slytherin in the train that she actually likes, a neutral Slytherin. Just get her over the blood purity traits and the leap to the sortin happens naturally.
2. Harry doesn't like Hermione at this point, and he would like to be far from her. However, we all know this one is the easiest. Slytherin was quite a possible scenario to him in OT. the hat just says "Fuck what you think, I'm putting you in Slytherin."
3. Ron is hard, because he really likes Harry but he has the strongest preconceived image of Slytherin. He would not ask to be put in Slytherin... the hat has to propose it and Ron has to embrace the idea. It is difficult because he is the most clear decision to be put in Gryffindor. Ron has a few minutes to analyze the "If Harry is in Slytherin, maybe Slytherin is not all bad" before he is called. So, I guess the only plausible way is have the hat "seeing" Ron's doubts on Harry and lurking Ron's mind based on that. It is a bit of a stretch but I guess it can be made.
