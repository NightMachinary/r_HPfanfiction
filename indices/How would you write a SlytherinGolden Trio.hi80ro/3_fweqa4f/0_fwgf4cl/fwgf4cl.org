  Ron is hard, because he really likes Harry but he has the strongest preconceived image of Slytherin.

I don't think Canon Ron would have a particular bad image of Slytherin, from what we saw in the book, he is probably the member of the Trio who care the less about this House (outside of his feud with Draco and his goons).\\
The main problem with Ron would be his family history. He is not afraid to end up in Slytherin, he is afraid of not ending up in Gryffindor. As he says to Harry, Hyfflepuff would not be that bad (because they are harmless and everyone like them), but Ravenclaw and Slytherin are probably as bad as each other for him.

But contrary to Hermione (who don't really fit Slytherin House and would need to be tweaked a little to go there), it's pretty easy to justify his Sorting.\\
As seen in PS with the mirror of Erised, Ron's biggest desire is to stand out and become his own person. He doesn't want to just be Weasley nÂ°6 (and later Harry side kick), and also want to be Ron. This desire can already be seen as ambition, and the Hat can add some lines like "/Slytherin would help you to leave your brother's shadow/" to sweeten the deal, especially if he did meet Harry on the train, who already got there.
