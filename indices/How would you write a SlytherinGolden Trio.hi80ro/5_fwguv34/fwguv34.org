Frankly, the only way I could actually see that happening was a full on AU where Draco was nicer at the very start, and befriended them on the train. Harry would simply allow himself to be sorted there, Ron could follow him there if he saw that Slytherin wasn't as bad as he thought (I believe that Ron wouldn't even need to ask the hat too much. Overshadowed by his brothers, he definitely has ambition, even if he's not exactly active in seeking it out. I mean just look at what he sees in the mirror of erised.) I'm not actually sure about Hermione, she's the first out of them all the get sorted and didn't actually befriend Harry and Ron on the train. Maybe if she befriended them, Draco was there and Harry somewhat agreed that he might end up in Slytherin, and Ron went along with that, she would want to follow her friends? Like I can see a good way to get Harry and Ron there, but I can't see an easy way of getting Hermione there without delving into some atrocious cliches.
