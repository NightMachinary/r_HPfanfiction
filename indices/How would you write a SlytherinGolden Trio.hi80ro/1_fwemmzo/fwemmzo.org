Do you mean as in all three of the original trio sort Slytherin?

That would be interesting even from the start - you could put up an argument that Ron goes Slytherin because Harry has already done so and he makes a snap decision that it can't be /that/ bad if the BWL sorts there. And Ron /could/ be classed as cunning - especially fanon Ron who leans towards "strategic genius who is desperate for glory and recognition."

But Hermione? Who is the one who would sort first of the three? That's an interesting one - firstly she's probably heard that muggleborn aren't welcome there so would be against it. I also don't think Hermione /values/ what Slytherin offers - she's a natural fit for Ravenclaw but she says herself that "courage and friendship" are more important than books in PS, which explains the reason she goes to Gryffindor. I know Hermione can be cunning and sly - she traps a woman in a jar for blackmail ffs. And she could be classed as ambitious - as she matures she clearly wants to change the world. But at eleven, the sum of her ambition is "read all the books and try and make a friend." She's also a highly, highly moral person in a way that Harry isn't. I think Hermione's sorting would be the first major hurdle in making a Slytherin GT fic believable.
