Ambition and cunning are not "evil oriented" by default. She does value her cunning and ambition when it furthers her goals, only that her goals are not evil. That is why we have the law-modifying Ministry employee working to help elves where she thinks she can actually do a difference and accomplish her goals, and not a protester or elves-rights activist on the street. That's why we have Minister of Magic Granger and not Unspeakable reasearcher-for-reasearch-sake Granger.
