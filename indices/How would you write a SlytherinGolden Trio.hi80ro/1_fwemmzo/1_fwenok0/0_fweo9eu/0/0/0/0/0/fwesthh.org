Might I remind you that 11 year old Hermione was okay with going into the Restricted Section to get info on Flamel. Breaking the rules to get what she wants. She doesn't wait to GOF to exhibit Slytherin traits. All she needed was to see common ground with the guys she saw as rule breakers (Harry and Ron). So I don't see how a conversation with the right Slytherin boy/girl could push her to accept Slytherin a few hours later.
