No, because it's not about /having/ it. It's about /valuing/ it. So Hermione at age eleven has the potential for cunning, but she thinks it's a Bad Thing. So Slytherin ceases to be an option. She grows up, of course, but at eleven she thinks it's bad to be sneaky and to not follow rules to the letter. She only mellows in this fashion because of outside influences (Harry and Ron). Hermione by the end of GoF is arguably a completely different person to Hermione at the start of PS.

Neville on the other hand has the potential for bravery, and he also thinks bravery is a Good Thing and something he wants to have. So Gryffindor.
