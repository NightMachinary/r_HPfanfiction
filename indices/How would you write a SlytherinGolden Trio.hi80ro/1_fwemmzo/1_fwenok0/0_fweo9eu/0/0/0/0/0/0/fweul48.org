However - breaking into the restricted section under Harry's cloak /doesn't mean cunning./ The way they go about most of their rule breaking is not cunning. It is obvious, in your face, bravado. Her plot in book 2 of getting Lockhart to sign the slip, now that's cunning, but that's after over a year of hanging out with those two...

BUT. Hermione does not see herself as a sly or cunning person. She sees herself as morally right, all the time. And again, as you say, a lot of her rule breaking is influenced by Harry and Ron, but that takes more than a few hours, so I'm not sure a conversation on the train would have influenced her. Even as she becomes more relaxed about rule breaking, she still mentally splits the rules into "just and unjust laws," allowing her to still see herself as "morally good."

The Hermione who walks up to that sorting hat is desperate for two things - she wants to do well and she wants to be liked. Developing slyness and cunning won't help her, at least in the mindset she has. It's also important to note that in the UK (I can't speak for other countries obvs), "cunning" and "sly" are generally seen as negative traits. Children will be punished by teachers and parents for "slyness." It's synonymous with lying, cheating, and general undesirable behaviour. Clearly in some social stratas of the Wizard world that is different (Draco obviously got some sort of reward every time he showed slyness), but Muggle UK primary schools in the late 80s early 90s were still very much run around "Christian values" and slyness was "an offence." So even though Hermione has that capability, she doesn't value it, doesn't recognise it in herself, and has been taught to view it as Very Bad Indeed. And /that/ is why the sorting hat would not have put her into Slytherin; for the similar reason that although intelligent, she sees creative whimsy as a waste of her time and thus was not suitable for Ravenclaw despite fitting on paper...
