I never said they were "evil oriented." I absolutely don't believe that at all, if I had to choose what house I was in I'd want Slytherin. I value ambition myself, very highly.

But Hermione Granger at age eleven sees the world very much in black and white. There are good people and bad people, and rules are there to be followed. She grows out of this over the series and becomes someone who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get the "right" outcome. But a large part of that personality change is from hanging out with Harry and Ron for years, both of whom are massively relaxed about rule breaking but still demonstrably good people. At the age of fifteen, Hermione would fit Slytherin. She's cunning enough to secretly put a boil hex on a parchment and trick people into signing it. She's ambitious enough to try and free 100 house elves. She's confident enough in her own path to decide a teacher is wrong and make alternative learning arrangements. But Hermione at age eleven, at the start of PS? No way. She toes the line and follows the letter of the law, not it's spirit.
