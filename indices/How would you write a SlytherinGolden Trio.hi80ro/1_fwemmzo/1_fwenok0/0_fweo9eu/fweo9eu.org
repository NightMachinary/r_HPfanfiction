The thing is, while Hermione is /capable/ of cunning, I don't think she values it and she sees it as a last resort.

I don't think she'd go Slytherin because I don't think she cares at all for the values of the house. Pretty much anyone could sort anywhere but Ravenclaw. Intelligence is something you have or you don't, really. But everyone is cunning, brave, or loyal when they need to be. No one is "just cunning" or "just brave." Hermione is cunning, brave, loyal and clever. She could have gone anywhere, based on /ability./ But her /choices/ show that she values moral courage above anything else, which is why she could never be a Slytherin.

Absolutely agree the Ravenclaw riddle would do her head in and she'd see it as a waste of time!
