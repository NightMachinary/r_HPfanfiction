You did list the reasons why Hermione could be seen as a Slytherin. Blood purity aside, I think she fits Slytherin more than Ravenclaw. Slytherins do value knowledge as well. And Ravenclaw values some creativity, ingenuity, sense of wonder and questioning of the world that Hermione lacks. She has book smarts, but is more of a stay-by-the-book than a think-of-all-the-possibilities knowledge. Personally, I think Hermione would struggle answering a different trivia to enter the common room daily and might even see the whole thing as impractical.
