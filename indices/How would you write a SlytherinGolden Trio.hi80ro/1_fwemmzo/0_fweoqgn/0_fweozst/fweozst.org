"Hermione sets a high moral standard for everyone who is not Hermione."

Yeah, you're right. I genuinely howled with laughter at that, because you're so right and I don't know how it didn't occur to me before.

That said, it's just another reason Slytherin would be a nightmare for her - because she would be surrounded by people behaving in a non-Hermione-approved way and it would drive her to distraction!
