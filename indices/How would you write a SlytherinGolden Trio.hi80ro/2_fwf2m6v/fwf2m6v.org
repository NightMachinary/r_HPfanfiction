I'd start by asking how they would get there. Briefly, /we/ know that they are destined be friends and work together to defeat Voldemort, but /they/ don't know that when they get sorted, and while Harry and Ron make sense as friends, Hermione has very little in common with either of them. There also needs to be reasons for them to be sorted there, and those reasons will determine what happens after.

Ron is the easiest. He has the ambition to surpass his brothers. Going to Slytherin would normally be anathema to him, but if he sees Harry sorted there, that might give him the license to agree with the Hat's suggestion to that end.

Hermione has the makings of the perfect Ravenclaw, but she values her vision of justice and the (small-g) greater good---changing the world whether the world wants it or not---over learning as such, so she goes to Gryffindor. There are seeds of Slytherin-ambition, however: she likes to show off and be seen as the smartest person in the room. To move her to Slytherin requires shifting her ambitions to be more self-centred, so /something/ needs to happen to change those.

Harry is probably the hardest one: notwithstanding the Hat's comments, he doesn't really show anything but Gryffindor traits and has little personal ambition. He is the quintessential adolescent male hero archetype. The only way any of his goals become "Slytherin" is if he goes off the deep end and becomes preoccupied with something like resurrecting his parents. It didn't help that Draco is really bad at the whole "temptation to sell your soul" thing. So, in some sense, it's up to Ron and Hermione to drag him kicking and screaming into Slytherin.

OK, here's a way this might go down:

*Point of divergence:* Hermione's and Draco's arrival in Harry's and Ron's compartment coincide.

1. Draco says something blood purist that sets Hermione off. For example, to Draco's classic line "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.", Hermione breaks in to ask precisely what he means by that, and it escalates from there. There is a shouting match, wands might be drawn, and the prefects might end up having to break it up.
2. That gets Hermione motivated to prove Draco wrong; she might even say something about how she could be a better Slytherin than Draco ever could.
3. Now, Harry and Ron are witnessing all this, Ron might get some of his own words in, and Harry's Muggleborn mother is mentioned. The end results: rather than being annoyed by Hermione's know-it-all attitude, Ron is sympathetic to the outspoken Muggleborn; and the trio gets their common enemy (blood purism as exemplified by Draco) two months earlier.
4. Thanks to her new "I'll show them! I'll show them all! Muhahaha!" mindset, Hermione ends up in Slytherin, triggering a cascade.
5. Seeing a determined Hermione marching over to the Slytherin table, Harry basically goes "To hell with it; let's do this!" and agrees with the Hat to send him to Slytherin.
6. With Harry and Hermione there, Ron is easy.

Draco, then Voldemort won't know what hit them.
