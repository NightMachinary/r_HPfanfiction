1. Ron: Ron is probably the easiest to sort into Slytherin. He wants to prove himself to his family, earn money and be powerful. He is also an excellent chess player, something that indicates strategic thinking. The obstacle we encounter here is that Ron doesn't want to be put in Slytherin. He wants to prove himself, but he also doesn't want to lose his family. He is ambitious, but he wants to be greater than his brothers in their field rather than define himself as "different". Being in Slytherin would also be a burden for Ron. At home, he'd miss out on inside jokes that come with being a Gryffindor, and he'd feel like he's missing out. At school, he'd be the blood traitor. An easy way to goad Ron into Slytherin is him getting mad at the hat when it says "another Weasley", or you could modify cannon and have the Weasley's be poorer, and have the kids working odd jobs. This Ron might want to remove that burden from Ginny's shoulders.
2. Hermione: Harry and Hermione are harder, but I'm going to steal [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]]'s idea for Hermione: Draco says something blood purist that sets Hermione off. For example, to Draco's classic line "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.", Hermione breaks in to ask precisely what he means by that, and it escalates from there. There is a shouting match, wands might be drawn, and the prefects might end up having to break it up. 3. That gets Hermione motivated to prove Draco wrong; she might even say something about how she could be a better Slytherin than Draco ever could. 4. Now, Harry and Ron are witnessing all this, Ron might get some of his own words in, and Harry's Muggleborn mother is mentioned. The end results: rather than being annoyed by Hermione's know-it-all attitude, Ron is sympathetic to the outspoken Muggleborn; and the trio gets their common enemy (blood purism as exemplified by Draco) two months earlier. 5. Thanks to her new "I'll show them! I'll show them all! Muhahaha!" mindset, Hermione ends up in Slytherin, triggering a cascade.
3. Harry: For Harry, we'd have to change one thing: The Dursley's. This version of them begrudgingly take care of him, but they punish him quicker than they do Dudley. So Harry learns what they like and sucks up, vowing to one day be so great that they can't deny it.
