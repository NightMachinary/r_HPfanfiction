I've come up with something I haven't seen a lot of yet: make the Trio itself a foil to Voldemort, by reflecting in each of them a part of Voldemort's greatness, and showing that they are equal to him through unity, friendship, and love --- and perhaps become more than the sum of their parts in the process. So Harry could have Voldemort's innate aptitude for magic, instincts, grace, way of thinking. Hermione his ambition, ruthlessness, intellect, and passion. And Ron his charisma, social skills, manipulative streak, inner strategist, and so on. The details don't matter that much -- you can pick and choose who gets what depending on your interpretation of their characters. The most important thing would be to make each one a /truly/ essential part of the equation, so that with even one missing they wouldn't be able to keep up with the antagonists (and you could make 'x is missing' thing into a plot element later on). I guess it could work regardless of the House, so the focus on Slytherin qualities would be good --- Harry=magical power, Hermione=ruthlessness/mental power, Ron=manipulation/social power.
