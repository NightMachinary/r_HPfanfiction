I know he's supposed to be young, and it's a young perspective/outlook, but I think it just personally makes me feel a bit uncomfortable?? The manner he speaks can be conflicting at times, and what he should/shouldn't know based on the age they're trying to portray. For example:

"What... was that?" he asked, in awe. "That thing you did, with your arms," ...."That is called a hug."

Harry shook his head. "There's something written at the foot of Mister Statue, but it's written in strange characters, like the guy was drunk or something."

For some reason, he's never seen a hug before, though he must have seen his guardians hug Dudley many times, or other parents and children after school. But he know what it means to be drunk and how it could affect writing? And would say characters instead of letters?

I think it's just little things, but they pile up for me. I love the idea of the story, but maybe I've just read too many stories with more mature children -- so reading one that doesn't, it annoys me a bit. It was the same with one that got recommended awhile back, the one where Harry gets adopted by a band of gypsies -- it just gives me the same feel/vibes.
