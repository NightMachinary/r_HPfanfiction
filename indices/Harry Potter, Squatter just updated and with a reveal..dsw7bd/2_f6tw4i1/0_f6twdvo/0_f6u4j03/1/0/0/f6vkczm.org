Yeah the hentai thing runs a bit more than it should as a cheap gag, which is a bit in appropriate in the first place. Overall it feels like a clumsy way to try and get a laugh and let Apollo say he's really old. I still like the story overall, and I feel like it hits a lot of good emotional marks, but yeah it can get a bit lost in places.
