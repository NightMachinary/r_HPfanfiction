You seriously asking me that? I mean, when Harry gets trained in the art of war by Athena, you'd think she would teach him roman martial arts, nets, spears, etc etc, or at at the very least, modern version of martial combat. Instead, he get's handed Chinese martial arts from ancient China. You have to understand, the greek gods adapted to America, so thus, must adapt to the modern world of MMA and martial arts such as judo, jiu jitsu, kickboxing, and many more related to UFC.

Martial ability is about evolving, not staying stagnent.

This is far too influced by anime when the guy came along and gifted Harry with hentai porn.

And kung fu is far too limited in a fight. More acrobatic and gymnastic than actual fighting ability.
