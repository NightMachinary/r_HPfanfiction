No, my problem is that the western gods aren't jealous of eastern gods teaching harry their martial arts. It's not bias or racism, or some such, but simply that the greek gods are very territorial of their possessions and proud of their culture. For Athena to hand a book on Kung Fu to Harry is just... wtf?
