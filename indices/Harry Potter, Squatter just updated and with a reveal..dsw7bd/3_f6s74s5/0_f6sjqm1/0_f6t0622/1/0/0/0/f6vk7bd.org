Actually he raises a good point, remember how the other gods give Hestia strange looks when she suggests having an 'out of pantheon' god teach Harry magic, and only really get a bit more chill when it's revealed to be a 'rogue' god with no pantheon? It does seem a bit strange that Athena wouldn't use any other western example there.
