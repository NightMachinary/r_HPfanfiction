Also, Harry got the knowledge of martial arts thanks to Hephaestus' gift. So he probably will use his fists mostly in close combat, because he got some skills from a godly source already. Why go through the extra work of training him specifically for the spear, when he already has a good basic knowledge of unarmed fighting? That's stretching him too far. Let him learn martial arts until he is solid enough with it, then suggest to him to learn an additional weapon, if unarmed, archery, knife fighting, fire magic and the lasso aren't enough.
