You're referring to this passage:

#+begin_quote
  "As a mortal, and especially as a demigod, you may not have the option of total pacifism," Athena said, brutally honest. Harry's shoulders dropped, and he looked at the ground. Everyone was pushing him to fight.

  "Here is something that may help you," Athena said, causing Harry to look up. The Goddess of Wisdom pulled a book out of thin air, and handed it to him. "In the Orient, there is an order of monks called /shaolin/, and their philosophy will be of interest to you. They train their entire life in the martial arts, learning many different styles of combat, both in hand-to-hand and with various weapons such as staves and swords. They are known the world over as some of the deadliest fighters."

  Harry stared at the book. Those guys sounded awesome, but still... fighting. He'd always been the victim. He knew first-hand how much it hurt, and he didn't want to inflict it on anyone else.

  "However," Athena went on to say, "they are also among the most peaceful. Their religion is called /Chan Buddhism/. It prohibits violence, so they will go out of their way to avoid it. However, when all other options are exhausted, they can protect themselves."

Let's recall that over the course of this story, Harry's been influenced by Hestia to abhor violence. Athena is using this example to explain to Harry why he needs to learn to fight, not necessarily that he needs to learn to fight /that way/.

All of Harry's other lessons with Athena after this involve learning to think strategically and use his mind.
