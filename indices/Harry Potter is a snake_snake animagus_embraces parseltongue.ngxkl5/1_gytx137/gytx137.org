Try Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond. Best depiction of parselmouths and parsel magic I've ever seen. Bonus points for various other cool magic and world building. And it's (as the name suggests) a soul bond fic featuring Harry and Hermione with a lot of Ginny and Ron bashing but a honestly good Dumbledore.

(unfortunately Harry is no snake animagus but something different and definitely more awesome)
