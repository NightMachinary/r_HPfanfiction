I would say it's a romance fic in the first place. At least Harry goes to Hogwarts to finally meet his soulmate with the intention to marry her. On the other hand it's quite a slow pace and there are many things happening without romance and the relationship between Harry and Hermione could also be called a very good friendship (at leat at the beginning and of you can ignore a bit of flirting)
