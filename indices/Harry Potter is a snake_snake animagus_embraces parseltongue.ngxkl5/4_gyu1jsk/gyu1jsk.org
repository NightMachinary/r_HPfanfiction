Lomonaaeren has one where there's a whole group of snake people/parselmouths and they want to teach him, but I can't remember which of their many stories it is

Kiera Marcos who was linked upthread has a lot of parsel related worldbuilding, and there is an older story on her site that has him learning from a mentor from Japan.

My brain is failing me here, sorry I can't think of others rn, because there's some really rad stories out there
