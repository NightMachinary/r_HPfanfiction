Seems promising even though it features a marriage contract. Forced romance if I ever saw one... although /probably/ not as bad as a Harry x Draco fanfic - that didn't show itself as such until the fifth chapter - where Harry isn't gay but Draco is a veela who would die if not accepted by Harry. That's the worst premise I've ever seen, almost made me vomit.
