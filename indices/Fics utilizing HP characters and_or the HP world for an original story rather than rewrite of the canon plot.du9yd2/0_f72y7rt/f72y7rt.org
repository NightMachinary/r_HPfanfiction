Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Reads like a heist movie. Voldemort is a side plot in the first half. Hermione becomes a literal catburglar playing a cat and mouse game with Harry and Ron who work as aurors. Harry and Hermione centric, alternating.

Linkffn(Invincible)

Wizards in space adventure after earth got destroyed leading into a Battlestar Galactica crossover. Harry centric.

Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Still in progress, weekly updates. Backstory is that in the middle of the anti Voldemort war Hermione got catapulted into a different dimension, and has to get back. Story is told from the perspective of the Ron in this alternative universe.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

The Statute of Secrecy goes down the drain, muggles start experimenting with magic, Voldemort changes strategy and works with muggle terrorist groups and North Korea, Rasputin makes a big comeback, portkeys replace rockets both in space travel and in nuclear weapons delivery, and someone installs a time turner in a DeLorean and does a time trip to get lottery numbers. Crazy, weird and full of interesting concepts.
