If you count crossovers, I'm a big fan of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality). Sure, the HP universe is present, but so is the Matrix and the author integrated the two fairly well. Voldemort isn't at all a focus or even an issue in this fic.

Otherwise, there are all the fics that occur outside the canon time line, since most of them don't involve the stations of canon. I was a big fan of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]) Where Draco needs to learn to be a muggle for a few years to avoid being put into Azkaban. Or say linkffn(In the Bleak Midwinter) where a time traveling Hermione Granger convinces Tom Riddle Sr. to take care of Jr. rather than leaving him to the orphanage.

As far as stuff that occurs during the canon timeline, normally fics with a heavy AU tend to be more divergent from the stations of canon. Like say linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) where Lily lives by conducting some kind of underworld ritual to spare Harry, which has ramifications as he grows older.
