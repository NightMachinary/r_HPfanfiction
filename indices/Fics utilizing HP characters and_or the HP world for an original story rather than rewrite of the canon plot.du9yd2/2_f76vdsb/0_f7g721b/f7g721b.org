Hard recommend. With a spectacular cast of flawed, well-developed OCs and a Magical America that both predates and is significantly better than Fantastic Beasts canon, this series is a completely satisfactory set of “Harry Potter EU” books that are written with professional quality and a heart-wrenching commitment to realistic storytelling.
