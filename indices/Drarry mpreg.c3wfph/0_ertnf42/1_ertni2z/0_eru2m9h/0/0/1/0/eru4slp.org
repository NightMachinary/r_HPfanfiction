Cool. Good luck finding what your looking for. Just remember that on the internet, what you type is different from what we read, because we don't know you nor do we have things like emotions to also take note of. It's why we have */s* to mean sarcasm for example. We can't tell what you mean by your tone, because there is no tone.
