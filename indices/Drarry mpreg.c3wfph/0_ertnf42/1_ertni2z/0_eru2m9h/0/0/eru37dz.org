Look, it's fine to like that stuff. It's a kink, everyone has them. You shouldn't ask for such on reddit in general though. Asking for a relationship is one thing, asking for a story where Drarry has kids is also fine, but it's more the way you worded it that's the problem. If you said your looking for a story with Drarry as the pairing, and you want it to be a story that has some focus on them having a kid, you'd probably get more positive results. In this universe male pregnancy is believable, because magic. The way you worded it sounds like your looking for smut, or something. Which again if you are cool, all the power to you, but don't ask for that here.
