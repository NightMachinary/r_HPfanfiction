It's not about following rules as much as it's to be polite. Kids use this sub-reddit, and asking for this in the way it was is not exactly "kid friendly." Like I told the OP, it's fine asking for this stuff, but try to ask about them in a more kid friendly way. I hope you know what I mean. If you read this whole comment chain, you'd know that this is what I meant.
