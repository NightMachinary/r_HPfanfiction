Again, have I said that he broke the rules, no. You seem to be acting purposely obtuse in this conversation in regards to another conversation that was ended in a polite, and civil manner. I'm going to stop replying to you now. what is your problem that you can't seem to understand that this conversation was ended without anger, or hate, nor did I ever state that someone "breaks the rules" as you seem to believe.

Edit: Also I did recommend ways he can get what he wants, and suggested alternative ways to go about getting more positive results. You did read all my posts right, or are you just picking, and choosing? If so, for what reason?
