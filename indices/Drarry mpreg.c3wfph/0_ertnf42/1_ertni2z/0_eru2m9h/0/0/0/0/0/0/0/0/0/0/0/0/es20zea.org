And while I was a little rude in my first post, did I not make a small contribution to help with his request. Telling him how he can get results in a more positive way on this sub, and how to look for what he wants on fanfiction.net. So while there was mild bashing, I was still helpful, and offered advice. I even cleared things up with him further down the chain.

You seem like a dog with a bone with this. Both me, and the "victim" have cleared things up. So your input here is both unneeded, and unwanted. Your basically acting like the white guy who gets offended on behalf of his black friend when said friend has already sorted this out, or was not really offended. Could I suggest turning your sights to people who are breaking the rules currently, and stop harassing me on something that has already been resolved.
