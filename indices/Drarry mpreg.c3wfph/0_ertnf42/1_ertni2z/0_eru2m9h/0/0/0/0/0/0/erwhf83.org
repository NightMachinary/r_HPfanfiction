Please state where I attacked him. Sure I came off as abrasive at first, but as both you can see, and he can tell you, I was being helpful even when I was abrasive. I even explained how he could get more positive results depending on how he asks. While your not trying to make this sub kid friendly, it doesn't change that a good chunk of the audience is underage, and therefore just like in real life, it's up to the adults to at least try to be a little more responsible, and kid friendly. Like I said, the sub may not be trying to be kid friendly, but that doesn't mean that we just start being irresponsible idiots, because of that. If you wish to see it differently, that's up to you, but do try to understand your audience better.
