No. You just don't ask that. Asking for Drarry stories are fine, but if your looking for this crap just put mpreg in the search bar, and then narrow it down to HP fanfics, and you should be good. It's disgusting to ask for this crap though. I'm completely fine with gay pairings in stories(i'm bi myself), but why the hell are you looking for this crap. Seriously.
