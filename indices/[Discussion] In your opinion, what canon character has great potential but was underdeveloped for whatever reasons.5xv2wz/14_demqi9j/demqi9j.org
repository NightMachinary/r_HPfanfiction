Whatever are your most prominent traits. "You could be great, you know." Wasn't a lie, he was telling a hard truth, that at the expense of making two friends that continuously stab him in the back, he could become one of the greatest wizards of all time. Some theorize that the Sorting hat attempting to put him in Slytherin is Voldemort's soul-piece that was inside of Harry, but I doubt that, the Sorting Hat stated everything we already knew about Harry, but still arrived at the conclusion that, that was Harry's best bet.

What you state isn't being reactive, it's being proactive. Was he the one required to go down into the Chamber? Nope. Did he? Yes. Was he required to learn the Patronus? No, he could have just quit Quidditch for the season, that would be the reactive thing to do. But I agree, post-book 3, he was super inconsistent in everything he did.

Like I said, he isn't written like a human-being, he isn't curious about the magical world he is in, he isn't curious as to what his Animagus might be, other than alluding to wanting to master it before the second task, in case it was a water-involved form.

That's the thing though, we always hear Harry go "a Dark Lord is after me" or "I watched his resurrection, yet he still cared enough to attempt to kill me". Somehow he doesn't arrive at the obvious conclusion that someone needs to ask Professor Dumbledore for magical training.
