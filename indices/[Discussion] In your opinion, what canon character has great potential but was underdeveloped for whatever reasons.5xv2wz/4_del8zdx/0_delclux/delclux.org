I want to know what Andromeda did during the first war. Did she, Ted, and school age Nymphadora all go into hiding? What was her career like after returning to the Wizarding world? Was she accepted into any sort of society, or looked at with suspicion from all sides either because of her family or her blood-traitor status? I want Andromeda backstory, badly.
