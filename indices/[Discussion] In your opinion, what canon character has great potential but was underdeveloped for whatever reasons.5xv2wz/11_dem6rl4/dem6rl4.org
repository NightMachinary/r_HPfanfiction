I always thought *Tonks* had the potential for an incredibly interesting backstory/childhood. Being a metamorphagus, the auror academy, being a Hufflepuff with a penchant for trouble. All interesting.

Also *Fleur*: does being part-veela mean anything other than prettiness? Is her haugty attitude arrogance, a defense mechanism because people treat her differently for being pretty, or does it come from her superior magical ability? I think the fact that she was both the most talented student at her school and was under higher-than-average scrutiny meant that she would have been able to empathise with both Hermione and Harry and it could have been interesting seeing her take on a big sister role with them.
