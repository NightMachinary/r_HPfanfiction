There are so, so many as long as you don't mind pairings. If you're ok with some smut Isolation by Bex-Chan is a great. Right now I'm tearing through Leo Inter Serpentes, which explores some of the dynamics in the Malfoy family. Great read, can't recommend it highly enough. linkao3(922767) linkffn(6291747) Edit: Sorry made a mistake with my links.
