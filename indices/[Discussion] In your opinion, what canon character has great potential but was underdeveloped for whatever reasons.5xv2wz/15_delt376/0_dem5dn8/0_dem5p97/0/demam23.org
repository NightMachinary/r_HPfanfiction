Did he circumvent it though? I have to wonder, what makes the sorting hat sort a student? Is it where they would fit best, is it where they wish to go etc? It's not really stated, we just know that the sorting hat decides, I've always been of the opinion that it will place you in a house where you want to go if you got for more than one. Thinks it's on the wiki, but Lockhart was like Harry. He should have gone to Slytherin, but managed to convince the hat to put him in Ravenclaw, just.

And I agree, I don't think Harry was particularly well written, it felt like he was just an eyepiece for us to use. But I do stand by the idea that he was mostly reactionary. He went into the chamber, sure, but that was an immediate threat that he felt he needed to confront. He learnt the patronas, but unless I recall wrong, that was because he almost died during a match and had no choice if he didn't want it to happen again. What I'm trying to say is that it seemed to me that Harry, especially when it comes to learning magic, only shows proactivity when his feet are literally in the fire. There was nothing stopping him from learning magic, he just never did because he doesn't really care about magic.

This feels especially obvious in fifth and sixth year. In fifth year, it was Hermione that pushed him into teaching, otherwise he was have just spent the year bitching and not doing anything. And in sixth, did he try to learn powerful magic? Despite the country falling apart due to Voldemort, despite knowing that he had to be the one to kill him? He knew he had to kill Voldemort, that it had to be him.

Yet he did nothing, because there was no immediate threat to make him do so.
