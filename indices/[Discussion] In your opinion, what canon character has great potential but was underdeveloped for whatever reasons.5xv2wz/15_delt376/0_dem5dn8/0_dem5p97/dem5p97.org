1.) Nope, I'm of the opinion that Dumbledore was a good person, nor was he manipulative. It was just a non-genius attempting to write a genius, and failing miserably.

2.)Exactly, for some reason a thousand year old magical artifact designed to send kids to the house thats best for them, enchanted by Legendary Wizards, was circumvented by an eleven year old. Suddenly, you can have a choice.

3.) Contradictory, he wasn't reactionary when he said "not Slytherin". He wasn't reactionary when he went into the chamber to fight the Basilisk, nor was he reactionary when he learned the Patronus just in case he ever met a Dementor again. I could go on and on, the point is, like I said before, he wasn't written to become his own character, he was written with set purposes, with minimal internal dialogue involved.

4.) Not a full Horcrux, as the full ritual wasn't preformed. I don't get why people don't understand that? You'd think that a powerful piece of magic that splits your soul and places it into something, would require more than taking the ejector seat to Albania. Maybe Dumbledore was right, Voldemort just left some power inside of Harry? On a side note, Voldemort was supposed to have been a Prodigy at all magic, one would think that if Harry managed to inherit one ability, he would get the rest? I'm not saying Voldemort's memories, but his talent for subjects and unnatural control over magic should have followed along. Otherwise, why leave him with anything at all if it's going to be inconsistent?
