I feel like you've been reading too many manipulative Dumbledore stories. Harry could have been Slytherin, he just chose not to be. Maybe because of misconceptions, but he still chose Gryffindor of his own will.

Harry could study magic, he just didn't. Harry is, at heart, reactionary. He doesn't do much of his own will, he just isn't proactive.

Or, well, he did study magic, but not much beyond class, and he was decidedly average at it.

And Harry had no other option but to sacrifice himself. There were no goblin rituals or secret magic that could remove the horcrux. He had to die, no matter what. It wasn't until after Voldemorts resurrection that Harry had the possibility of surviving.
