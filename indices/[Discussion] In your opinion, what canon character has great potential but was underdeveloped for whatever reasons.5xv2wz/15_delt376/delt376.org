Harry, Harry had great potential. He was underdeveloped and pushed to the side, simply to fulfil the narrative, I would have enjoyed seeing Harry built up in some meaningful way, but sadly, he was confined to all these pre-dispositions set out to him. "You can't be Slytherin, you need to have friends." "You can't study magic, I need to rely on my Horcruxes and Hallows." "You can't look into your magical power, you need to be weak so you have no other option, other than to sacrifice yourself at the end of the book." Harry was used for the purpose of fulfilling an agenda, rather than for growing into his own. He is the most underutilised and underappreciated character, in all of the Potterverse. Just look at Cursed Child, they couldn't even characterise him, "Is he moody?" "Is he powerful?" "Does he idolise or despise his previous mentors?" Why would he name his child after a man who made his life hell, just because he wanted to sleep with his mother?
