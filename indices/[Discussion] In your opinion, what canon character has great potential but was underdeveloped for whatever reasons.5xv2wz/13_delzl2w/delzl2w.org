Hmm...well, I for one would like to know more about any of the house-elves, the centaurs, goblins, veela, giants...every character who comes from a different race/culture than the main wizarding one.

Seriously, we hardly get anything about how they tick. Why are house-elves so intent on being slaves? What makes the Forbidden Forest centaur tribe xenophobic? Why does Griphook feel justified in betraying Harry & co. when promises are apparently so important to a goblin? Are giants really as violent as popular wizarding perception claims?
