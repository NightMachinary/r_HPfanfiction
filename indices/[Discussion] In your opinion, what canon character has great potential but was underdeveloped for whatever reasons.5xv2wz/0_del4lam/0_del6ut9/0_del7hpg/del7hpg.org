  You said it all - completely agree with every word. This the love of his life and shes barely in the story at times, partially i think it was JK Rowling trying to keep everything PG but its such a waste. Harry never once in the series tells anyone that he loves them, that walk to the forest in DH would be so much more powerful when he passes Ginny if he had told her that he loved her at some point.

Right?! I brought that up in another thread and people didn't really seem to agree that it was odd Rowling didn't go this route, but it's such a good and obvious thing to do. Harry wins because of love, yet he never hears it or says it to anyone in the entire series (i know Dumbledore alluded to him being loved, but he never heard the words "i love you.")

I agree that realistically, Harry and Ginny shouldn't just be in love when they get together, but also remember canonically, Harrys shows very strong feelings for her while on the hunt. His last thoughts before death were of Ginny, too. I am overall more than fine with them being at that point despite only having a few weeks together. Because if not, then it would mean that by the end of the battle, Ginny cared more at one time for Dean or even Michael than she did at that point for Harry. And that just doesn't work thematically for the story. We just need to accept they had stronger feelings for each other even when a part during HBP than Ginny ever had for Dean and Michael and Harry for Cho.

  The only plus from all this is the room it leaves for fan fiction, but even then i haven't found anything that really covers her in the way id imagine her to be after the battle. Strangely my favorite Fics tend to have her breakdown in some way - which is completely the opposite of she'd probably act considering how she bounced back from being possessed by the greatest dark wizard of all time at 11 years old.

I agree with this a lot. It's funny you mentioned enjoying fics where she breaks down despite it being OOC. I find myself in an internal struggle when reading some Harry/Ginny fics because I want the two to just be happy together, but as far as an interesting story goes, it is bland when that actually happens. Fics where they break up and even date other people are like car crashes that I can't look away from.
