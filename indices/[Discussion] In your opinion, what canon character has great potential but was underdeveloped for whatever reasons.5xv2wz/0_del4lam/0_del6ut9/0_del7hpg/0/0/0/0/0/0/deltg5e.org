Another event that actually diminished the pair for me was when Harry agreed to keep Ginny locked in the Room of Requirement during the battle.

This is yet another example of Harry acting very selfish, suppressing the very thing that is supposed to like about Ginny, and Ginny just accepting it. Obviously since they wind up together. But how does Ginny accept that from him? She seems to easily accept Harry breaking it off to protect her even though she would vehemently argue she doesn't need protecting. Then, when she wants nothing more than to fight for her friends and family, he does the same thing and tries to keep her safe.

I just don't get it. Rowling has Harry do something that, based on everything we know about Ginny, would infuriate her and dump him cold. But she obviously doesn't. Because when it comes to Harry, Ginny is not the great character we know and love. She's someone who takes a back seat to what Harry wants and happily puts up with it. And I doubt Rowling meant to write it that way, but I don't see how the reader can interpret it any differently.

And we see it even after the series ends. Ginny willingly allows the kids to be named after people important to Harry (which in a vacuum I'm fine with but does look suspect given all the other times she acquiesces to him). In CC, she serves primarily to support him and offer words of encouragement.

I love the pair, and I think they make sense together and all that jazz. But there is that fundamental issue where Ginny is there to comfort and sacrifice for Harry's happiness and comfort, and Harry is not expected to respect and honor things that matter to Ginny.

That's why a story about the pair set after the battle would be so beneficial to her character, as well as their relationship. I think a good story would be a real hard look at Ginny and how she changes when it comes to Harry. I could imagine a story set after the battle where Ginny is so happy to have Harry alive that these issues lay dormant. And then when Harry wants to desperately get married and start a family even though Ginny might want to slow down with starting that part of her life, she might finally start to reexamine how she is with Harry. She'd force him to understand that things can't be how they were during the war, where Ginny was expected to be a comfort to Harry. They are equals and he needs to support her the same way she supported him. That's a story I'd love to read.
