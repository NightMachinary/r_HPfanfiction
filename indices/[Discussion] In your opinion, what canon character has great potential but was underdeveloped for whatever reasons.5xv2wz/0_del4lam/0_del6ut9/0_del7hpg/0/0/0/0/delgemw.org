  I'm probably gonna catch some flack for saying this but if JK Rowling was to write a series (or even just one book) about any other character that parallels the main series to me Ginny would be best choice that story of going from a mess on the floor of the chamber of secrets to leading the DA and marrying her life long love would be an inspiring tale to say the least. Of course this is what I've searched for in Fan Fiction but have been able to find.

You're in my mind!! Literally have this exact same thought. It would never happen as I don't think Rowling has the connection with Ginny that she does with other characters, meaning she would sooner revisit them over Ginny. Good example is all the Pottermore articles expounding on other secondary characters but not her.

I also agree I wouldn't quite trust Rowling. I just don't know what she really thinks of Ginny both as an individual and in context of her relationship with Harry. That breakup scene; I got what she was trying to show with both Harry and Ginny. But especially with Ginny, it just didn't make sense. It was more about showing Harry being the noble one with a "saving people" thing than whatever Ginny brought to the table.

I sort of wonder if she just didn't want to have Ginny become the woman pining and waiting while her man did brave things. But she only half-succeeded. She showed a strong Ginny, but an out of character Ginny. Canon Ginny says something like "i know you have to go defeat Voldemort, but we're not over. I refuse to let Riddle control our lives like that. You can't protect me since I'm a blood-traitor like the rest of my family, and I don't want you to. I'm going to fight this war best I can, just like you. And when you kill Riddle, we will be together. " Instead we get a Ginny who is strong in accepting his break up, but essentially still takes on the role of comforting girlfriend, letting him break it off so he feels better. I kind of hate that Rowling never clarified if Ginny really felt they were done. I suppose the kiss in DH hints that she doesn't believe so. But I'd absolutely hate for it to be canon that she dated after he broke it off. i mean, the torture-filled year probably made the possibility of dating moot anyway, but perhaps she dated to seek comfort? For my own personal curiosity, I'm very interested to know canonically what happened in that year and after the battle.

Regarding Ginny's PTSD, realistically she definitely would have that, but within the context of the story, I don't think so. At least nothing severe. One flaw in Harry Potter is the events in the story never quite impact the characters that much, from the serious to the trivial. For example,

- Harry seems relatively ok after the death of Sirius.
- Ginny was cracking jokes soon after the CoS incident (joking about Percy and his girlfriend)
- Ginny never seemed too broken up about ending both her long-term relationships (this certainly supports the theory that she never really cared much about either boy)
