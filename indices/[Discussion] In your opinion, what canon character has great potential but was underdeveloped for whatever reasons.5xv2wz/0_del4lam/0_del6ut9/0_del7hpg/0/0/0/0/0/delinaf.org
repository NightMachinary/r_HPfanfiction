Ya I suppose your right and having a 11/12 year old deal with something that heavy probably wouldent make the publishers too happy and would really mess up the tone of the story... and I see your point about characters not reacting to events - when I really think about it I never really noticed before.

That quote is exactly what I'd imagine she should have said to him at some point tbh, it's a just seems too easy; Rowling wrote ginny as a strong female character that doesn't take any crap, but she just turned off that switch for plot in that funeral scene to avoid having to write an argument, I just don't see the ginny that has been waiting for years for those few weeks to give up that easily. And ya I suppose you could argue that she didn't and that was the whole reason for the birthday kiss was but why would she wait, if anything I think that Ginny more than anyone else is the one who'd outright tell harry he's being bloody stupid, isn't that part of the reason he likes her?!... they would have argued imo like all couple do, ginny rolling over like that is stupid - and in fairness kinda boring in a creative sense - at the same time though I understand this isn't a romance story about Harry and Ginny and their arguments so I suppose it make a sense a little. As for her dating others we saw that she didn't just wait around for him all those years but went off with Dean and Micheal but again as you said her feelings on them were never clear - were they just training for Harry? or did see genuinely care about them? But I agree unless she's far more stupid than she's portrayed (which i doubt) she knew as well as the reader that was Harry bring Harry and they'd be together again - at least that's the only truth il except!

It all comes back to unanswered questions and Ginny has far more than most other characters ..... it's just stupid that someone so pivotal to the main hero of the story was given such a bad shake. And ya I agree i dont think Rowling cared for Ginny much, I mean we got to see far more of Luna who in the grand scheme of things is far less important to the hero than we did of Ginny. It's just mind numbing especially because she's so interesting.

It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who sees Ginny this way most other discussions iv stumbled upon are far less critical of how Rowling wrote her which I belive is the crux of the problem, we need to know that happens in Hogwarts in that year to get any answers and i doubt she will ever post anything detailed enough to answer all questions.
