I feel the same way! And it's rare! most people either hate ginny or accept the way she was written as enough!

Your absolutely correct by the end of HBP she was probably at the prime of her confidence and we see that with her "birthday present" in deathly hallows she was defiantly not over him, it's one of the scenes to me that just seem to just be a complete disservice to her character in favor of easing things along, she seemed far to understanding at the breakup which in some ways make sense as she, at least in my view understands Harry in a way no one else seems to, but still it's hard to belive to say the least ... lots of fic authors seem to put it down to - that she understands that he's trying to protect her and accepts it as part of Harrys nature, but I don't buy that, she is one of the DA that went to the ministry, she takes no shit and we are told multiple times that she is a powerful witch and if you attribute that she probably resents people trying to control her after the CoS or treat her like something that needs protecting (which i do) I think this would make her angry more than anything else - it's just seemed to easy. .... again another missing moment is what happened after the funeral, on the train home - I like to imagine she didn't let him get away that easy.... but then at the same time Harry had just lost his mentor so I suppose there is an argument that she just went along with it to spare him any pain and understood he was just being "noble" and they weren't really split, but again I don't buy it.

Another thing that's crossed my mind a few times after a particularly Angst heavy fic was - did she really recover from the chamber as well as we belive?? again it's never stated - I can't even remember if ginny was mentioned in Prisoner of azkaban, I mean to me she had to have had a rough time she was an 11 year old child and she was possessed by the most powerful dark wizard of all time and we hear nothing about what happens after! At very least she must have had terrible nightmares if not outright PTSD which make her transition into the as you said "boss" she turns into all the more interesting.

I'm probably gonna catch some flack for saying this but if JK Rowling was to write a series (or even just one book) about any other character that parallels the main series to me Ginny would be best choice that story of going from a mess on the floor of the chamber of secrets to leading the DA and marrying her life long love would be an inspiring tale to say the least. Of course this is what I've searched for in Fan Fiction but have not been able to find.

And as dumb as it might sound I dunno of id trust Rowling to do it! (The irony of criticising the person who literally created the character is not lost on me belive me) but it's just so obvious that Ginny was done badly and she deserved a better arc. And you said it seems like Rowling didn't know her character.

Sorry for the walls of text but as you can probably tell - this is a topic I could rant about forever.
