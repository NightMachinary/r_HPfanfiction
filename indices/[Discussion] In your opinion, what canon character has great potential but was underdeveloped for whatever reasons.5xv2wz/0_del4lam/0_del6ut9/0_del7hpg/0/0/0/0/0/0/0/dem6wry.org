Yeah your right, its as if whenever the plot need her too she turns into another character around Harry and I don't think its intentional, she was leading / if not heavily involved in leading the DA in what amounts to a rebellion for a year in Hogwarts against Death eaters, and she just agrees to stay in the Room of Requirement! when people younger than her are out fighting - that's not the Ginny we came to know.....its as if Rowling converts her into this "perfect" girl for Harry in moments where her true character should be most evident, it just screams poor writing to me.

The kids names will always annoy the hell outta me, I believe that Rowling wrote the epilogue first (or at least very early into the series) and that makes sense (but also makes Ginny's poor portrayal at times all the more frustrating) because she knew her ending for years and it seems to me that as she went on things changed in the story, but she still put the same ending on.... in my opinion that epilogue doesn't fit well, its not terrible but its definitely a rough fit after everything we've read to that point. I mean James Sirius is ok - even if there is nothing from Ginnys side, Albus Severus is a bad joke, Snape is a great character to read, but hes also an arse, he bullied Harry and others for years, and he didn't give a dam about Harry, just because he was a double agent and had a weird obsession with Lily doesn't justify naming a son after him even if its a middle name. I can see that he might give the Albus name to one of his sons, but probably more as a middle name. Its as if Ginny has no say in anything, Lily Luna is stupid as well, Lily - is ok, but Luna, i mean get shes a probably a good friend, but your going by friends names that why no Ron or Hermione! - i prefer to imagine the kids as James Sirius Potter, Albus Frederick Potter and Lily Tonks Potter.

Of course thats all going by what we know form canon across 7 books - we have no idea what happens next so as you said a follow up would clear so much of this up - for all we know there was more to Snape than we got, and maybe to Luna as well? but that's all guess work unless she actually writes something, which is unlikely especially given the involvement she has with the Fantastic Beasts movies, and i don't see them giving any more insight into post Harry Potter story.

All this just comes back to what a shame that a character with so much potential was utterly wasted, I know she wanted to focus the story on the trio but my god she could have gotten some really rich and interesting characters if she had branched out a bit...... Ginny had the potential to be Harrys true equal the one who doesn't give a crap that hes the chosen one and would tell hes being an idiot when he is being one, instead shes the perfectly obedient, go along with whatever Harry says kinda character and that's just such a shame.
