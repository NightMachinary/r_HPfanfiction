I feel like I'm having a conversation with myself, we are so much in agreement.

The standard belief is that the movies butchered Ginny, which is true, but I'd argue Rowling did her no favors either. It seemed like she didn't know her character. When Harry breaks it off with Ginny, it seemed OOC for her to accept the way she did, right? She spent years hoping the day would come where they could be together, and she barely puts up a fight when he ends it. What happened to the Ginny who went after what she wanted?
