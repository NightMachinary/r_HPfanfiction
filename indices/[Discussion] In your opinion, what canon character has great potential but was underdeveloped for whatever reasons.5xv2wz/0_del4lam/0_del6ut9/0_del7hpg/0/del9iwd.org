She is just the epitome of missed opportunities shes such an interesting character to me. I cant wrap my head around the hate she gets some times, she was given the shortest straw in the series in my view. You've said it all and i don't mean to rant but like you this just annoys me so much!

The whole problem could have been solved as you said by them getting together earlier, by the time they are together in Half Blood Prince, Harry has nearly killed Malfoy, if Rowling had included various scenes of him and Ginny acting like a teenage couple throughout HBP- sneaking out after curfew, inside jokes around Ron, innocent little things like that - it would have lended so much more weight to growth Harry does in Hallows, have a handful of scenes of him acting like a 16 year old would have fitted perfectly into Half Blood Prince.

And yes! yes! yes!, Harry never telling anyone he loves them is just stupid to me. He literally defeats Voldomort with love and he never expresses it himself!, Its obviously heavily implied that Harry loved Ginny, with her being his last thought ofc, but still, it being said would be way more powerful.

The movies treated her far worse but in fairness to Bonnie Wright (and i think her look and acting were fine) she wasn't given anything to work with, at least they tossed in a couple of moments in order of the phoenix (if you watch closely) where she eyes Harry from the background or something which i always thought was a nice touch but ultimately Ginny was shafted to the bland girl that Harry kisses - purely to remind you that hes growing up.

Ugh sorry for carrying on with this, but to me its the biggest gripe i have with series, so much wasted potential! and i completely agree with Fan Fiction, Harry deserved a happy ever after more than anyone... but to me if he gets it straight away its just unsatisfying, the current fic im reading has me wanting to literally throttle the pair of them but im glued to it!.
