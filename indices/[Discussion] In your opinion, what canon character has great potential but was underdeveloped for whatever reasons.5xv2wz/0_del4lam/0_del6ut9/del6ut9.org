You said it all - completely agree with every word. This the love of his life and shes barely in the story at times, partially i think it was JK Rowling trying to keep everything PG but its such a waste. Harry never once in the series tells anyone that he loves them, that walk to the forest in DH would be so much more powerful when he passes Ginny if he had told her that he loved her at some point.

I suppose though if we are being realistic, they were what? 16 and 15 in Half blood prince that kinda stuff might be a little heavy for a relationship at that age and in DH they are barely around each other so in my opinion Harry and Ginny really wouldn't get started with a serious relationship until after the battle, and even then that period had to be full of grief and mourning, i suppose that's why I favor fics where they don't just get together the morning after the battle and live happily ever after.

But still Jk just missed so many interesting scenes between the two. And the lack of development really gives all the Ginny haters ammo to dismiss her as a fangirl with no interesting qualities at all.

The only plus from all this is the room it leaves for fan fiction, but even then i haven't found anything that really covers her in the way id imagine her to be after the battle or in Hogwarts. Strangely my favorite Fics tend to have her breakdown in some way - which is completely the opposite of the way she'd probably act considering how she bounced back from being possessed by the greatest dark wizard of all time at 11 years old.
