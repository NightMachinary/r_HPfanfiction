Ok, this is going to wind up being a bit of a rant.

Part of the reason Ginny is my favorite character is specifically /because/ she was underdeveloped, underutilized, and had so much potential as her own character.

There are many characters, some of whom you mentioned, that are drastically underdeveloped, but we learn so little about them that to go into their backstory is to be complete fanon.

But with Ginny, there is enough given in text to fill an entire book with her backstory without it seeming non-canon.

Let's start with the obvious: her possession by Riddle. The actual events as they happened would be compelling to read from her perspective. But even more, the aftermath of it all is really interesting too. Harry is also possessed/controlled/influenced by Voldemort, and he often reacts poorly, collapsing into himself, lashing out at others, and just suffering. Ginny, however, seems to go the opposite way, acting outgoing, friendly and boss (sorry, couldn't think of a better word). But the effects of Riddle stay with her, as evident in OOTP when she calls Harry out for forgetting she was possessed. But what was Ginny really dealing with those years? Was she having nightmares, doubts about herself, etc? Rowling wrote that ginny was possessed, yet we didn't see how it affected her. She then made a passing remark about it 3 years after the fact, and then we just moved on. I want to know a lot more about that.

Rowling actually screwed up with Ginny a lot, in my opinion. She was barely present in books 3 and 4. We learn nothing about her through her relationships with Michael and Dean, even though it would go a long way to showing her connection to Harry (for example, when she was with Dean, did she actually want that relationship to succeed or was she just biding her time until Harry noticed her). Then she is just one of those characters who support Harry but aren't really that close with him (Neville and Luna being the others). Finally, book 6 is supposed to be her big moment but we don't actually get much interactions between Harry and her until they get together. No big heart to hearts where Ginny reveals the depth in herself we know exists, nothing.

Then Harry breaks it off and Ginny sort of just accepts it, despite that not really being like her at all, and we don't get any more insight into her thoughts.

Finally, book 7, where she is non-existent until the final battle. We don't get any of her leading Dumbledore's Army (the book suggests its more Neville than anyone else). When Harry comes back, we have this great chance for her to finally say everything she wanted to about this past year, but instead all we get is Harry agreeing to keep her safe, and while she does escape and fight, she doesn't get any moment. Neville gets his moment, so does Luna. Hell, her only possible moment, when fighting Bellatrix, becomes Molly's moment and actually supports the desire on her family's part to keep her safe. Then, after the battle, we don't even have a reunion between her and Harry.

My point here is that, compared to other characters who justifiably have little backstory or moments of glory, Ginny is fully deserving of rich character development and significant contribution to the plot, but she gets none of that. When we talk about wasted potential, we can't not talk about Ginny.

Here's how I would have rectified her character development:

- have Harry notice her sooner, which would lead to a closer friendship with her where they would talk about her coping with Riddle's possession, his fears about having to kill Voldemort, etc.

- shorten the time she was with both Michael and Dean so Harry would start dating her much earlier. This would accomplish two things: accurately reflect the level of feelings she had for both boys (i just find it odd she could date both boys for so long when she never really was that into them), and intensify her relationship with Harry so that when he breaks it off with her, it carries more weight.

- give her a larger role in the final defeat of Voldemort. Harry tries to keep her safe. Her family says she is too young to get mixed up in the war. Rowling says she is powerful but we don't get to ever see it. Ginny is also the seventh of the seventh, so make that mean something. Harry also knows that it is the power of love that enables him to defeat Voldemort. Ginny is the love of his life, so do something with that.

- Explore the dynamic that would exist when Harry and Ginny start dating, and he turns to her over Hermione. Have Hermione get jealous of this and make us see exactly why Ginny is who Harry would turn to now.

There's more I could say on this topic, but I've ranted enough for now.
