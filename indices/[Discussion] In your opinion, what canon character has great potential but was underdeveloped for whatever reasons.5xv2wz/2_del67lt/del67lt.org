The big ones that jump out to me are Ginny, Draco and Snape. Ginny and Draco just don't get enough exploration to fit their importance within the story. Especially considering their place in the epilogue that we are supposed to accept.

Snape just happens to little, too late. His character arc feels, to me, forced and unbelievable based on all the interactions that have occurred earlier.
