The 'pain' and discomfort' spirits feel is actually them 'degrading' in this plain, like their slowly losing cognitive functions, memories, beginning to look like they're decomposing, et cetera.

However, popping back to the other side for even just an hour undoes all these negative effects, like hitting a reset switch.

They abuse the shit out of this, with some spirits like his parents hanging around for twenty out of every twenty-four hours.

Unfortunately, the one side-effect of spirits being on this plane? They can become quite wrathful to those whom they feel wronged them.

For example, if Wormtail were still alive, Lily would do everything she could, bar demanding Harry himself kill him, to see him killed and booted ass-first into whatever grim afterlife awaits him.
