And then Voldemort shows up and always stays the longest possible, at first he is in denial over being dead and tries to keep the war going, then when the coin drops he decides to try by any means to get Harry to resurrect him, including but not limited to trying to trick him in doing it, bribing with money/information/knowledge/magic/power/anything, threatening him about it, bluffing that he had more Horcruxies, trying to convince him he changed and deserves a second (thousandth) chance and finally annoying him until he does it just to make him go away.
