I often wonder when I'm in fandom spaces how the disconnect between HP being a British property affected how its international audience received certain characters. JK definitely leaned on certain British character archetypes when writing instead of going for something more all-inclusive, and it results I think in sometimes things being taken not the way the author intended.

(Given that British humor, for example, is notoriously much more harsh and/or dry than e.g. its US equivalent)

I wonder if at some point a more American/ized/ adaptation of the franchise will come that will better communicate the intended /spirit/ of certain characters to a US audience. Ginny is, imo, definitely /intended/ to read as spunky, spirited tomboyish little sister who was babied by her mom and is shaking off that image as she gets older.
