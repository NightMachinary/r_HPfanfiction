Exactly. Some of it is absolutely just subjective humor --- what comes off as cruel to me could be hilarious to someone else --- and other times it seems like a mismatch between the original childish nature of the books and the attempt to age them up with the reader.

I find Ginny is one of the most notable examples of this. I like her more than a lot of people do, but I always feel the book intends me to read her as more ~spunky~ than harsh and it doesn't always work.
