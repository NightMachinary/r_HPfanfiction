Looking back at the series, as an adult, I do raise my eyebrows at a few things, how certain treatment from certain people is handwaved by JKR while similar treatment from others is brought down on with a ton of bricks.

Throughout the series you /can/ read that as mocking the very nature of double standards, but when things like this appear in the epilogue, I do raise an eyebrow that JK actually condones it.

Two examples off the bat: the Weasley twins' general behavior, and how mean Mrs Weasley, Ginny (and Hermione? it's been a while since I read that book) are to Fleur for iirc zero reason except that she's foreign and pretty.
