I would not have the epilogue 19 years later. It would be at best one or two years later after the war. But that's not a small change. So speaking of small changes:

-Ain't no freaking way Harry names one of his kids after Snape. Because fuck that bastard who didn't care about an infant getting murdered as long as his childhood obsession survived.

-And seriously, who names ALL of their kids after someone they knew and their parents? That was seriously too much. His first kid is named Albus and that's it. Even the middle name is something random.

-When the kids see Ron, they are overjoyed. Yep, Ron should be the absolute favourite among kids.

-Don't mention Draco or Malfoys. At all.

-No talk about "what if I end up in Slytherine?" J.K., you completely screwed up with Slytherine. Sorry, but there wasn't a single damm Slytherine in your series that could be considered decent. All of them were either assholes at best and downright villains at worst. You can't save them anymore.
