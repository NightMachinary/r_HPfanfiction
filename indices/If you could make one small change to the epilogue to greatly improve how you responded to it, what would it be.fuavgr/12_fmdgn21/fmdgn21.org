I really like the epilogue. All is Well isn't saying all the time. It's a situational feeling Harry feels as he drops his child off to Hogwarts. He never expected to have a loving family as an abused child. He truly thought he would die facing Voldemort and planned to do so.

I do suppose I would have liked a bit of a recap of those nineteen years leading up to it, showing the less rosy bits, but I don't think its necessary.
