Agreed. Mysteriously, many people seem to like it as it's common even in fics (even in this thread). It always makes me feel like parents are somehow belittling their children though. Like those children are not their own people, but some mementos of other people. Being in a child's place, I would always wonder when hearing parents say my name if it's me they're thinking about or if they're remembering the person I was named after.
