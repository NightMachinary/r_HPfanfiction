I like it too! It might be the single name I ha e the fewest complaints about:

Naming kids James and Lily is putting too much pressure on them when those people have been turned into legends.

Rose is a flower name, which is an Evans tradition, so that name should go on a Potter daughter.

Albus Severus is fucked up

Hugo makes me think of Victor Hugo which Hermione would appreciate.
