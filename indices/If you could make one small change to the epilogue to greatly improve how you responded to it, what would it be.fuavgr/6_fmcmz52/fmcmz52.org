Give more screen time to Draco to REALLY drive home that nothing has fundamentally changed and that muggleborns have no hope for justice or equality.

More time with Harry's fourth kid, Tom Vernon. Make it clear that Harry mostly names his kids based off of lost bets.

Have Harry immediately arrest Ron after he admits to casual mugglebaiting. This trip to King's Cross was a sting.
