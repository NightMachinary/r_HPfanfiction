i would just continue on with the war for a couple chapters before the epilouge where they are all a little more scarred and jaded, not just the trio but all of the generation that was alive and fought during the war. character deaths gallore as well maybe ginny dies or more of the other weasly's or andromeda and teddy is raised by harry

basically a darker ending that makes sense for an end of a war
