I'd have Snape alive and no longer working at Hogwarts; he'd be seeing his own 11 year old son off to school for the first time. He'd be nervous, knowing that there was a risk of the boy being picked on because of who his father was, so I'd have Snape take a minute to overcome his pride and ask Harry to say hello to the boy with people watching, in the hope that the BWL being friendly might help his son be accepted.
