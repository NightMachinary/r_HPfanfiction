I think I would change the number and names of kids, because I always saw Harry having a big family and while I don't think that Albus Severus or Lily Luna are bad names, naming two out of three of your kids that is kind of...questionable. So I think I would like something along the lines of this:

1. James Sirius & Lily Rose Potter (third years, twins)
2. Albus Severus Potter (first year)
3. Molly Jean Potter (seven years old instead of nine -- I think Percy should've had a son named Ignatius instead of a daughter named Molly)
4. Arthur Bilius Potter (five years old)
5. Remus Neville Potter (two years old -- maybe he has a nickname to prevent Harry from “stealing the honor” away from Teddy? That or a mention that Teddy was cool with it)

Additionally, I think Ginny (in both this ending and the real one) saying that she was pregnant at the end would've been much more satisfying than (paraphrasing here) “and Harry's scar hadn't hurt once in 19 years. All was well”, because that was the /lamest/ last few sentences in a book that I have ever read. And it left me wanting for more rather than satisfied with the completion.
