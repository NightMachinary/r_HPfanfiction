Like many things in HP (most things? everything?), the details and mechanics are somewhere between fuzzy and non-existent. I usually try to give the author the benefit of the doubt, or just assume it's an AU wherein "that's just how it works." Dumbles would certainly know how to participate in some minimally acceptable way.
