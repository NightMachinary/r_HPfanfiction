I doubt, even with wizard lifespans, that these would still be active and relevant overall but I could see where specific families can trace their lines back to those groups, and perhaps that some of the blood-traitor vs pureblood vs Sacred 28 type distinctions have roots in those old feuds.

I could certainly see Celtic and Anglo-Saxon magic users being more "whatever works" about blood purity while Romans and Normans looked down on the conquered lands and considered the existing magic users barely better than the muggles.
