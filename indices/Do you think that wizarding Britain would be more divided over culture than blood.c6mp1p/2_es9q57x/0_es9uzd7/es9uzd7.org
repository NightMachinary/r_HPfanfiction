You make a good point, but I'd argue that, unlike muggles, magical societies have the potential to be more fractured because they have ways of hiding their enclaves away (space warping magic, wards such as the Fidelius or unplottable charms to completely hide their existence from outsiders, etc.) Additionally, Wizards seem to travel primarily via teleportation (floo, apparition, portkey), so the concept of national boundaries demarcated by physical proximity needn't apply.

Of course there's no hint of that being the case in canon, but I've seen some interesting fanfics that touch on the idea.
