Some friends never do you dirty. Some friends DO do you dirty. But was it intentional or a heat of the moment anger?

And also, please, Hermione is the queen of passes. She always has logical/understandable/smart reasons for what she does when they are not-nice. Ron doesn't get to do that but what's so believable about Harry and Ron is that misunderstandings/terrible arguments DO happen between best friends through the years and coming out of it each time makes the bond stronger. And like it was stated earlier, the â€˜second abandonment' was Horcrux induced.

Fanon has abused Ron. Because people want to identify with Hermione or Harry so badly when really, they are more similar to Ron who...what do you know? He struggled with childish jealousy on his worst days.
