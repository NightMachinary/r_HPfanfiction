This is not a debate on whether or not Ron is a realistic or relatable character. He isn't for me, since I didn't abandon friends at their lowest when I was a teenager, but I get that a lot of people here feel that hit close to home apparently.

Regardless, Ron being fickle might be more relatable than the others, but it doesn't make Ron any more loyal. And like it was stated earlier, Hermione is standing right there, horcrux in hand, not abandoning the fight in the middle of a war. There's a word for that, you know. It's called desertion. That Ron has personality faults that made it easier for to do it doesn't make his abandonment excusable.

Yes, fanon turns any fault they can get their hands on and turns it up to 11. But it seems only with Ron do people want to entirely ignore the fact that he has the fault in the first place. Ron is the only main character to look at Harry and say â€˜I don't believe you and I think you're not worth supporting', and he does so twice. You can try to dance around that all you like, but at the end of the day that's not loyalty. That's being fickle with your friendship and trust.
