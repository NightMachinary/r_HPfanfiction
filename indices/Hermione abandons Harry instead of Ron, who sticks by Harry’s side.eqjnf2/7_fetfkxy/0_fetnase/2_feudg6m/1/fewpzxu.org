Ron had more to lose than Harry or Hermione. Harry dies in the war, people will miss him for sure, but someone else can kill Voldemort.

Hermione dies, her friends will miss her, sure, but her parents minds were wiped by herself, to protect them.

Ron, had more people to mourn him, more to lose. He was a blood traitor, his family and friends would have been killed/tortured right in front of him to make a point out of blood traitors.

They're also TEENAGERS! Teenagers. Teenagers fighting in a war that not one of them is ready for. (As much as I love Dumbledore, I also blame him for not sharing more info on what he thought the Horcruxes were/where he thought they were located).

Harry and Hermione are only the only child in their families, Harry never really loved his aunt, uncle and cousin. Hermione loved her parents and that's why she sent them away.

Ron, always had his parents and siblings by his side, of course he'd succumb to his wants and desires of wanting to see his family.
