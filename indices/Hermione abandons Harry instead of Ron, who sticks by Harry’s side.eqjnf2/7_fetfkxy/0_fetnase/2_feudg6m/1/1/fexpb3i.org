I'm not necessarily agreeing with the person you're arguing against, but I do find your argument lacking in its logical throughline. Let's break this down:

Harry:

-Has no living relatives that he truly cares about, does have the Weasleys, Rong, Hermione, and Remus/Tonks along with a few others he cares about

-Overall with the wizarding world he's had a pretty shit experience, being ostracized by the school multiple times, slandered by the Ministry, had the Ministry try to assassinate him, being forced to compete in the TWT, etc

-Has a personal vendetta against Voldemort because he killed Harry's parents and has continued to make Harry's life hell by trying to kill him

Hermione:

-Her parents are safe and sound in Austrailia

-Basically has the same relations that Harry does, but other than Harry and Ron possibly has less of a connection to those people

-Also has had a pretty horrid experience with the wizarding world since she started

Ron:

-Has an entire family at risk if they lose this war

-Seems to have more friends than Harry and Hermione, or at least knows more people

-Was raised in the wizarding world, this is his entire culture at risk

Out of the three, Ron should be the most likely to stay. Maybe Harry, but that's just because Voldemort's targeting him. If he decided (and considering everything that's happened up to that point) to say fuck it and abandon the wizarding world, it'd be pretty justified. Same with Hermione. They're both outsiders who are used to living in the Muggle world and could probably easily get out if there and go abroad in the Muggle World before the war really started breaking out in Muggle Britain. They have the least amount to lose out of the three of them. Ron, on the other hand, has his entire family and culture at stake. He doesn't know much of anything about the Muggle world, and if they lose the war he has a lot more to lose than Harry or Hermione. This shouldn't be pushing him to abandon his task with them, this should be pushing him to carry on. He should be the most motivated one. Sure he might be homesick but he should know that if he doesn't complete the Horcrux hunt then he won't have a home to go back to. Him leaving made no sense unless you consider him a coward or something. Really I think it would have made a lot more sense for him to be the driving force between the three to keep them going, and instead we got a rehash of 4th year but on a much grander scale.
