People seem to forget or ignore the fact that they're also teenagers. Ron never really had hardships, outside of wanting to be more rich to get more stuff.

As you said yourself, the Wizarding World is Ron's entire culture, he and his family are close, despite whatever Ron complains about with them (complaints are normal and even healthy among family members).

I have a mom, and two sisters. Outside of that, I have a huge immediate family on my mom's side, I'm also close to my mom's side of the family. Yes the Horcrux was largely to blame for Ron's influence, but at the same time, he's never been away from his parents in such an intense situation before, he's worried sick.

Plus the fact that his sister Ginny is the only Weasley left at Hogwarts, where several Death Eaters are, (They don't know Snape is on their side), of course he's beyond worried/scared, et cetra.

There's a lot of stress if they fail at destroying the Horcruxes, but Ron's also incredibly worried about his family as well. He wants to be there for Harry, but at the same time, everyone does have their breaking points. And yes it was largely the Horcruxes influences, I'm not denying that, but I also wouldn't be surprised if some of it was Ron himself, wanting to be with his family.
