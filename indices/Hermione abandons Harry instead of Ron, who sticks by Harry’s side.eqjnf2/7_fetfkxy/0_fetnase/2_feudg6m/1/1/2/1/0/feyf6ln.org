They attacked the burrow during the Wedding and left them all alive. The radios never mentioned any of the Weasleys dying. The last time he saw his family they were still alive(his dad) despite them rounding up all muggleborns. His sister(and himself) were still allowed to go to Hogwarts. Everything was pointing towards the Weasleys being left alone unless they started up trouble if not they would have been captured or killed in the last couple of months prior to Ron leaving. If Voldemort wanted them dead they had ample opportunities to do so and yet he never bothered.

The only thing certain at the time was that Harry didn't have a plan and they had just spent the last couple of weeks wasting their time without making any progress and that if Ron was caught his entire family would have been captured.
