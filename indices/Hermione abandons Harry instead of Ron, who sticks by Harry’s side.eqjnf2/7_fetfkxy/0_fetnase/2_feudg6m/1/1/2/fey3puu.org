I mean he also has the most to lose if they get caught. Voldemort and the DE never made any moves against the Weasleys throughout the war since despite being blood traitors they were still purebloods. They were still allowed to carry on with their lives and jobs. His family wasn't at risk even if they did lose the war considering Voldemort was pretty much in control of Britain and yet nobody bothered to attack the Weasleys.

Him getting caught on the other hand would lead to his entire family being captured due to him actively aiding Harry.
