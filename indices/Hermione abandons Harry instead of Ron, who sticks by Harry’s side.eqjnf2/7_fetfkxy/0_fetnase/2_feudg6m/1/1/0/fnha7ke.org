Ron is perfectly justified for leaving a hunt that's is going nowhere. What good comes out from that god awful run. Ron can easily choose not to fight and live because he is a pure blood. DE won't kill the pureblood who is neutral. Voldemort soul is mentally torturing him. He was badly injured and need proper food to recover. The important thing is when he is away from the influence of Horcrux he immediately wanted to come back.
