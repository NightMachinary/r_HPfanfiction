Yeah, cause that's what those were. Just small fights any of us have with our close friends.

Whether this place wants to hear it or not, abandoning a friend twice in four years that had the threat of death upon him, once in the middle of a goddamn war where you're one of three people in the country properly fighting to end it, is fickle. It's also a whole lot of other worse words. It's especially laughable that he gets such a pass when Hermione is there the entire time, a walking, talking counter-argument to â€˜abandoning your friend under the threat of death is totally what loyalty looks like'.
