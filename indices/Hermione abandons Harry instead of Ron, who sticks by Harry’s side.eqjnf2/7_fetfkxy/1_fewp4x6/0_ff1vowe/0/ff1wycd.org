I only have 2 siblings, but my immediate family is huge on my mom's side. We are a very close family, on my mom's side. I'd be willing to do anything for them. People also often seem to forget that Harry, Hermione and Ron are teenagers. Teenagers fighting in a war that they weren't ready for.

Harry had neglectful and abusive relatives, he's unfortunately used to being shunned by people.

Even Hermione, was bullied before Hogwarts, and not very liked before the troll attack, once she did get to Hogwarts.

Ron? Ron's whole life is the Wizarding World, that is his culture, he cares greatly for his family, despite/in spite of any arguments/complaints he has (hell complaints/arguments are very healthy to have with family members).

It greatly makes sense why he fled, stress getting to him, fearing about what was going on with his family, et cetra. And while the Horcrux did play a huge roll, in his decision, the Horcrux likely fed into his fears for the safety of his family.

Plus, Ginny was the only Weasley left at Hogwarts, a school being run by Death Eaters (They had no way of knowing that Snape was in fact a spy).

His behavior is so relatable, and yet it's like: Oh Ron's bad! Bad bad bad! No, he isn't. He's not bad at all.
