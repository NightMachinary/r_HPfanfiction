THISSSSSSSSS. So much fax, no printer!

The way I relate to Ron - I like money. I'd like to be seen as different from all my fancy doctor and lawyer cousins. I love my family and my friends and I can be super selfish sometimes. I'm saying it rn, if World War 3 happened at this moment and my friends wanted to join the army, I'd bolt to stay with my fam and wave bye to my bestie as we are renewing our passports to go back to West Africa. And I wouldn't need a Horcrux to do it. But all jokes aside, Ron's actions have always seemed reasonable if you keep in mind that he is the teenaged last son of a large family.
