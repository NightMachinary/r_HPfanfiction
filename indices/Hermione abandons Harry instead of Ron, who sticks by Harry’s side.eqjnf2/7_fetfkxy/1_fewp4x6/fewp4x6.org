Ron had insecurities all throughout his life, wanting to be seen as different than his brothers and sister, wanting to be acknowledge more than just a Weasley, more than the best friend of The Boy Who Lived, and stuff like that.

Ron is so... normal, so easy to relate to, and yet people think of him as worse than Draco Malfoy, that makes no sense.

Ron was willing to sacrifice himself in first year, not knowing if the giant chess pieces would kill him or not. In third year, he stood on a broken leg, to protect Harry from Sirius, who Ron thought Sirius was a criminal. Ron, afraid of spiders, went to the Forbidden Forest in second year, despite/in spite of his fear of spiders.

Ron got the same grades as Harry, with like one or two differences, and yet people often write Ron as an absolute idiot who drools when he talks.

Canon Ron Is NOT fickle. He wants to be seen more than what he is, but that's very relatable. He has fears and worries, but that's not what I'd call fickle, that's very relatable.
