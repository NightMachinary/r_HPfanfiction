Yes, please! Skip the "making up" part, though. Too many fics shoehorn Hermione into a friendship that only happened because of a well-timed troll, with two people with whom she has a personality conflict that flares up at least once a year and no interests in common whatsoever.

In GoF (or, better yet, PoA), it's not too late for Hermione to start making friends with Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. If Harry and Ron need her help with something in the future, they can trade favours or something.
