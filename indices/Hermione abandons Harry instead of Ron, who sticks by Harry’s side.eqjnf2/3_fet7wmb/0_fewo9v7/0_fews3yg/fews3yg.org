Oh, I already published the fic in question, though I'm currently only in third year, so that scene is still a ways off.

The fic in question is primarily a Harry/fem!Riddle fic called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19028845/chapters/45193261][Departure from the Diary]]. Part of what I wanted to do with the fic was was explore the breakdown of Harry and Hermione'w friendship as Riddle slowly corrupts him.
