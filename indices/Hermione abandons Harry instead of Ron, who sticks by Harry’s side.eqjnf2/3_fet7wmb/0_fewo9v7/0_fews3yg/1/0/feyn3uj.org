The basic idea is that Hermione has noticed Harry's change in behaviour and attitude after he went into the chamber of secrets at the end of their second year. Between that and the gradual divergence from the plot, Hernione doesn't believe that Harry didn't out his name in the goblet. Hermione was wrong about Harry putting his name in the goblet, but she wasn't wrong about Harry changing and not being himself.
