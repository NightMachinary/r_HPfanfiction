Turn it on its head:

Harry couldn't believe that all of Hogwarts had shunned him. Again. You'd think that after being wrong the last time they had learned, but, well, wizards. He heard his only remaining friend, Hermione talking with someone he couldn't recognize.

"Hermione, how can you stay friends with that liar?!"

"Liar? He's not lying. Honestly the only thing worse than his ability to lie are his marks. He /couldn't/ have entered himself. While he might have the power, he doesn't have the brains. It's a shame, really, all that potential going to waste."

Harry cuts Hermione out of his life. Starts doing better in school--just to spite her. Eventually, after she continually harangues him about ending their friendship "for no reason" and how he shouldn't be dallying in dark magic to do (I dunno) intelligence-enhancing rituals or some such nonsense, he cuts her off and just says that he wants to better himself because, after all, it'd be a shame for all of his potential to go to waste.

Hermione's (fanon) eidetic memory connects the two and she starts crying--not because she's sorry, but because she was found out. And also to emotionally manipulate him into feeling bad for "making her cry" and get him to forgive her.
