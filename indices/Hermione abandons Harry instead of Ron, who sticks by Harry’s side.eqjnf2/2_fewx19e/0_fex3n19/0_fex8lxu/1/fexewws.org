I'll never understand how people think that any one "fanon" character exists. There are trends, yes, and they're /usually/ built on extant stories, but "fanon hermione" doesn't exist. All you're doing is mesh together all your favourite tropes and say that that's her character, despite that not being the case.

As for your "mary sue" claim, I'm just going to say that the term "mary sue" has become synonymous with the person saying "I don't like powerful/knoweldgeable women as protagonists". I don't see you complain vehemently about the (much more prevalent) 'godlike/super smart/super powerful'-harry genre. In my experience anyone who uses the term "mary sue" nowadays usually harbours sexist tendencies (see rey hate, hermione hate, etc).
