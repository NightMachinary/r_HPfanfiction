  Fanon Hermione is either the biggest, most perfect Mary Sue ever to grace any form of media, or some brainwashed slave of Dumbledore that is so annoyingly obtuse that almost makes me stop reading the fic. It's quite rare to find something in the middle in regards to her.

Yeah, but try telling this to her stans. Hermione has to be a prefect princess who might make a mistake or two but it's for a good cause, it's the only way that her admirers can cope, right [[/u/heff17][u/heff17]] and [[/u/Uncommonality][u/Uncommonality]] ?

Honestly though, I have never seen Hermione bashed as hard as Ron or Ginny have been in fanfics. Fics on the level of HP and the Champion's Champion or pstibbons' work. But you can't tell that to Hermione stans because they'd play the 'Hermione is perfect' card, or the 'She was right for the bird attack! Who cares about MoRon?'. If they can show me some fics where she's bashed as hard as I've seen Ron, let me know. Please let me know.

In fact, I feel like [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/5917.html#comments][these]] [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/7444.html#comments][posts]] can help them take their stannery to the next level. It has everything they like, Badass!Hermione and tortured Ron. And girl power, can't forget that.
