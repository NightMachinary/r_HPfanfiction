Fanon Hermione is either the biggest, most perfect Mary Sue ever to grace any form of media, or some brainwashed slave of Dumbledore that is so annoyingly obtuse that almost makes me stop reading the fic. It's quite rare to find something in the middle in regards to her.

Her actual canon character is not all that likeable to begin with, but she is alright once you get to know her. Fanon!hermione is something im totally sick of.
