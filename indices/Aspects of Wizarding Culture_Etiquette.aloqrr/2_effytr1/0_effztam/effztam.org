We do know there were a magical band that played during the Goblet of Fire Winter Ball. Quiddith at various levels. Painting if the portraits are anything to go by. Dueling is almost certainly a thing, but it may have decreased in popularity during and after the war.

I love the idea of a Magical Olympics.
