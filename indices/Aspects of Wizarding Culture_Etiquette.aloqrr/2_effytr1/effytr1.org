One of the things that always strike me as lacking is that there seems to be a lack of entertainment. In modern societies you will always find that certain hobbies have a certain status.While things like Quidditch or Football is everyone / the masses, other sports like Duelling would be for the upper classes. People who watch TV are seen as less educated as people who go to the theatre. What about the wizarding world? What does the clark on Diagon Alley to after work or at the weekend? What does a Ministry worker or healer do? Are there clubs and hobbies for adults? Is there some sort of additional qualitfication institution?

Also questions about social status are rarely addressed besides Squibs and blood status. How are adults seen that didn't go to Hogwarts? Or stopped after OWL year? Is working for the Goblins considered a good job?
