How about, being invited into someone's home is polite. Usually only to the 'public' part of it's a old manor type place but the point is there.

However being invited to stay over at night is a big difference (not in the euphemistic way) due to the various ways of instant or near instant transportation, staying over at someone's house because it's difficult to get home or it's too late isn't a thing. As such being invited to stay over is a major sign of "you are accepted into our household and we want you around"
