You flatter me with your words. This delicacy is made by the most highly paid minimum wage workers. The meat is cooked as efficiently as possible while also taking preventive measures to ensure the meat is pure. The origin of this meat is questionable, but it is one hundred percent of some specimen. The main meal consists of pure rice seasoned and flavored by a man with the outward appearance of a Japanese chef, but with the heritage of the southern neighbors of the free land of America. To top it off, the meal is then brought by a woman with an extraordinarily high pitched voice that isn't unpleasant even if out of the common range.
