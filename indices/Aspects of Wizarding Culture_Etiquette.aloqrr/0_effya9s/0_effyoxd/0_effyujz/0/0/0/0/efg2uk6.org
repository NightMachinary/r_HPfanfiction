Hahaha ok I couldn't keep up the charade. You had me at "it is one hundred percent some specimen" Beautiful :D

But yes, I always enjoy reading stories that contain some amount of pure blood political manoeuvring and etiquette following. Especially if it's just the kids taking themselves too seriously I just find it adorably amusing. "Oh you helped me with my homework question that means I owe you one favour of lesser or equal value. But only one"

But Ron having to nudge Harry or Hermione because they either made or are about to make a social faux pa does sound like something that should have happened a bit because they are knew to the world.

I think my favourite one that I saw (obviously played for laughs) was that 'Family Magic' is of course only shared with people in the family. So asking to see someone's family magic, or sharing the magic, was basically proposing to them. So Harry accidentally married hermione by asking for her interpretation of something he was reading in the Potter family magic book
