  Only Legilimency is useful. And we have only ptoof of 6 people and the knowledge that the skill is super super rare

That doesn't make sense though. A skilled and power hungry leglismens could wreak absolute havok upon the entire wizzarding world if no one knew occlumency.

If leglismency existed in real life there would be tons of people trying to learn it to get themselves an advantage and there'd be no way you'd ever get into the higher positions in the government or within companies without being able to protect your mind.
