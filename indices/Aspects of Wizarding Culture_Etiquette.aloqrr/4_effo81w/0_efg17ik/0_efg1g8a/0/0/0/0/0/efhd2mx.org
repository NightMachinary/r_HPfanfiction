  I think you are confusing the hallows with Horcruxes.
#+end_quote

Nope. The hallows are in the Tale Of The Three Brothers. I'm thinking of The Warlock's Hairy Heart.

  Canonically, out of the hole order, only he, Snape, Harry, know Occulmency
#+end_quote

You have no idea whether that's true hardly anyone ever talks with Harry about Occlumency, so we don't know who else might be aware of it.

  People would be scared and try to flee. Besides, no way can they ever be on a level to be able to keep Voldemort/Dumbledore out
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's right, run from the guy who told you there are people who can read your mind and then promised you to teach you how to defend yourself. I seriously doubt people would actually be that dumb.

#+begin_quote
  You are missing the most important thing. Nobody knows about it.
#+end_quote

Well, someone knew enough about it to write a fucking book about it. And we know about at least three different people who learned about and then mastered both Occlumency and Legilimency probably independently of each other so it can't be that well hidden of a secret.

#+begin_quote
  And that's the way it should be. If someone learns there's a method to defend against mind reading, naturally he will research it as well. The less people know about occulmency, the less people know about Legilimency.
#+end_quote

No because even a single person capable of untold damage using legilimency if no one knows to watch out for or defend against it.

If no one in the ministry knew Occlumency, a single Legilismens could topple and take over Fudge's entire government in a matter of months just by digging out the right secrets from the right people and using or revealing them at the right time.

Keeping the art a complete secret would eventually almost definitely end in total disaster. It would be much smarter to just break the power of Legilimency by just teaching everyone how to defend themselves enough to at least recognize an intrusion.
