  and there are even references to the concept in Beedle's stories so the information blackout is far from perfect.

I think you are confusing the hallows with Horcruxes.

  Do you really think it makes sense that Dumbledore, leading a secret resistance against Voldemort (who he knows is a leglismens), would not warn his followers that all their members and secret hideouts and plans can become compromised at a moment's notice without anyone realizing if anyone knowing them encounters Voldemort? And you know, maybe train his inner circle to at least recognize an intrusion even if they won't be able to fight it

And canonically he hasn't. Canonically, out of the hole order, only he, Snape, Harry, know Occulmency

  Or that Voldemort wouldn't tell his followers that Dumbledore can do the same?
#+end_quote

Why would he? You reveal that you can read minds and that your opponent can do the same. People would be scared and try to flee. Besides, no way can they ever be on a level to be able to keep Voldemort/Dumbledore out

  Considering how Dumbledore expects Harry to learn Occlumancy in just a few months it can't be that hard to learn and it just makes much more sense to tell people about it, so they can learn to shield their minds, than to just idly hope no one bad ever learns anything important.

You are missing the most important thing. Nobody knows about it. And that's the way it should be. If someone learns there's a method to defend against mind reading, naturally he will research it as well. The less people know about occulmency, the less people know about Legilimency.
