  First none of the others would be able to teach Harry at Hogwarts and secondly likely none of them mastered it to the level of Snape. That doesn't mean no one else in the order can do rudimentary Occlumency.
#+end_quote

No reason why they couldn't and if they haven't mastered it to that level it doesn't do them much good against Voldemort or Dumbledore

#+begin_quote
  Nukes are a really awful comparison to mind reading. Those things are not even remotely comparable.
#+end_quote

They are not meant to be. Your argument was that just because three people managed to develop the same thing it can't be that rare. I used your argument against you.

#+begin_quote
  If you are right and Voldemort was seriously the only death eater capable of reading minds or shielding himself I seriously doubt he would be willing to share that power with Snape of all people who wasn't even his top lieutenant.
#+end_quote

He had the Dark Mark. Only the inner circle, the most trusted, had it. So, yes he was.

#+begin_quote
  especially if people don't realize that eye contact might be dangerous.
#+end_quote

People tend to avoid holding long unbroken eye contact during conversations. It doesn't feel comfortable.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, if legilimency is really hard to get right then the danger of letting people know about it isn't that big.
#+end_quote

Guns are also rather hard to get right, but we don't want everyone and their mother keeping a loaded gun. Nukes works too in this example.

#+begin_quote
  This comparison is so bad on every level I have no idea how you thought it might fit this situation.
#+end_quote

I can do another one. It's would be if by preparing for winter we shopped a hole in the wall.

#+begin_quote
  A few, yes. However, legilimency would also be far less useful if most people (at least those in important positions) knew how to detect and defend against it.
#+end_quote

Which is incredibly hard. Why arm people with mind reading abilities that they can abuse when you can simply not do that?

#+begin_quote
  I think a lot of people would be rather squeamish at the thought of someone reading their mind and then blackmailing them with their deepest darkest secrets.
#+end_quote

Not many people have such dark secrets to blackmail. And besides, people are squeamish about a lot of things and do very little about it.

#+begin_quote
  Besides, the Occlumency doesn't have to be strong enough to actually keep an accomplished Legilismens out, just strong enough to recognize an intrusion and break eye contact and stun the person doing it.
#+end_quote

If everyone knows Occulumency that wouldn't work. Either Legilimens would train himself to be stronger or would have already be prepared to stun you if you do anything like break your eye contact. Besides, say you do manage it. You'd be punished for assault. And not everyone is going to even be able to recognize an intrusion if the legilimency user is good at what he does. There was a similar debate here around a few years back about Horcruxes. OP argued that telling everybody about them is a good idea because people would know how to destroy them. Everybody else argued that that would only increase the number of 'immortal' wizards seeking power. And what good is the knowledge how to destroy them if you can't even find them?
