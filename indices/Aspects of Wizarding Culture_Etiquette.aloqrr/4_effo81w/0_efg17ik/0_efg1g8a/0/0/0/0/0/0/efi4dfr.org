  You have no idea whether that's true hardly anyone ever talks with Harry about Occlumency, so we don't know who else might be aware of it.
#+end_quote

Well, it was mentioned numerous times to Sirius and he never once claimed to know what it was. And if anyone else in the Order knew, they could have taught Harry instead of Snape

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, that's right, run from the guy who told you there are people who can read your mind and then promised you to teach you how to defend yourself. I seriously doubt people would actually be that dumb.
#+end_quote

Anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, feminists, sjw, etc. And, let's take the case of Dumbledore.

Dumbledore: I think you all should know how to protect your mind. Only one person can really do it and that's Voldemort. You have no hope of ever keeping him out of your mind

Order: Why should we learn then?

Dumbledore: Fair point.

That's what would happen.

#+begin_quote
  Well, someone knew enough about it to write a fucking book about it.
#+end_quote

And what is that book?

#+begin_quote
  d we know about at least three different people who learned about and then mastered both Occlumency and Legilimency probably independently of each other so it can't be that well hidden of a secret.
#+end_quote

Hmmm, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I mean, USSR and USA developed nukes independently of each other, so it can't be that big of a secret. I'll go make myself one now.

#+begin_quote
  No because even a single person capable of untold damage using legilimency if no one knows to watch out for or defend against it.
#+end_quote

In more than a hundred years only three people learned Legilimency in Wizarding Britain, and hell, Snape could have been taught by Voldemort for all we know. That's how rare it is.

#+begin_quote
  If no one in the ministry knew Occlumency, a single Legilismens could topple and take over Fudge's entire government in a matter of months just by digging out the right secrets from the right people and using or revealing them at the right time.
#+end_quote

Legilimency requires eye contact to steal that info and it's never as easy as that according to Snape.

#+begin_quote
  It would be much smarter to just break the power of Legilimency by just teaching everyone how to defend themselves enough to at least recognize an intrusion.
#+end_quote

That would be like trying to protect yourself from a cockroach that comes every 1000 years by arming everybody and their mother with nukes. And the secrets to Legilimency. You are simply going to make a lot more legimency users this way. And a lot more people would like to invade someone's mind than someone learning a skill that might one day come in handy. I mean, people don't care about this planet, or our own lives. Some people don't even wear seatbelts.
