  And if anyone else in the Order knew, they could have taught Harry instead of Snape
#+end_quote

First none of the others would be able to teach Harry at Hogwarts and secondly likely none of them mastered it to the level of Snape. That doesn't mean no one else in the order can do rudimentary Occlumency.

  Hmmm, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I mean, USSR and USA developed nukes independently of each other, so it can't be that big of a secret. I'll go make myself one now.
#+end_quote

Nukes are a really awful comparison to mind reading. Those things are not even remotely comparable.

#+begin_quote
  Snape could have been taught by Voldemort for all we know.
#+end_quote

If you are right and Voldemort was seriously the only death eater capable of reading minds or shielding himself I seriously doubt he would be willing to share that power with Snape of all people who wasn't even his top lieutenant.

  Legilimency requires eye contact to steal that info and it's never as easy as that according to Snape.
#+end_quote

It's easy to get eye contact with people while holding a conversation, especially if people don't realize that eye contact might be dangerous. Besides, if legilimency is really hard to get right then the danger of letting people know about it isn't that big.

#+begin_quote
  That would be like trying to protect yourself from a cockroach that comes every 1000 years by arming everybody and their mother with nukes.
#+end_quote

This comparison is so bad on every level I have no idea how you thought it might fit this situation.

#+begin_quote
  You are simply going to make a lot more legimency users this way.
#+end_quote

A few, yes. However, legilimency would also be far less useful if most people (at least those in important positions) knew how to detect and defend against it.

#+begin_quote
  And a lot more people would like to invade someone's mind than someone learning a skill that might one day come in handy.
#+end_quote

I seriously doubt that. I think a lot of people would be rather squeamish at the thought of someone reading their mind and then blackmailing them with their deepest darkest secrets.

Besides, the Occlumency doesn't have to be strong enough to actually keep an accomplished Legilismens out, just strong enough to recognize an intrusion and break eye contact and stun the person doing it.
