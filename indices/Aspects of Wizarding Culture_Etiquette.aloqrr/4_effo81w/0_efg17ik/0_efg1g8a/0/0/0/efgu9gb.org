But /why/ is it an extremely obscure art?

For horcruxes it makes sense that they are obscure because it makes sense that many people would be deliberately trying to suppress the information. However, despite that it was only Dumbledore who removed all mentions of horcruxes from the Hogwarts library, and there are even references to the concept in Beedle's stories so the information blackout is far from perfect.

However, for leglismency the exact opposite is true because the idea of someone tearing confidential information from your mind without you ever knowing is fucking terrifying and it's far better to learn to defend yourself than to rely on the fact that probably only a few of your enemies know leglismency.

Do you really think it makes sense that Dumbledore, leading a secret resistance against Voldemort (who he knows is a leglismens), would not warn his followers that all their members and secret hideouts and plans can become compromised at a moment's notice without anyone realizing if anyone knowing them encounters Voldemort? And you know, maybe train his inner circle to at least recognize an intrusion even if they won't be able to fight it.

Or that Voldemort wouldn't tell his followers that Dumbledore can do the same?

Or that in the entire history of the ministry not a single ministry worker or unspeakable ever knew about the art and realized how much of a risk it poses to the department of mysteries and the entire government in general?

Considering how Dumbledore expects Harry to learn Occlumancy in just a few months it can't be that hard to learn and it just makes much more sense to tell people about it, so they can learn to shield their minds, than to just idly hope no one bad ever learns anything important.
