  5 people (6 if you count Harry) in the entire wizarding Britan know Occlumency and only 3/possibly 4 know Legilimency

Why? There are 5 Occlumenses that Harry knows of, but why wouldn't there be more? Maybe Madam Rosmerta is a top-tier Legilimens, she just keeps this skill to herself.

Old pureblood families at least would preserve the knowledge of Legilimency/Occlumency, because it's so incredibly useful.
