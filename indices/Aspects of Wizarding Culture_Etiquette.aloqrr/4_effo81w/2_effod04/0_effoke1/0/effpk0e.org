I added the tag. Mobile is a bit iffy for me as I don't use it often.

Society gathers baggage over the years. To those inside the society, a short bow is something you do in greeting dozens of times per day. Or maybe they tilt their head upwards when they see a friend and downwards when they see an acquaintance. The normal things in society can be absolutely pointless yet still hold value. As you pointed out, left-handed people exist, but /social norms make no sense/ therefore it doesn't matter. Wizarding culture seems extremely far removed from modern culture as we are from the 18th century. It isn't realistic for such a culture to not have odd ideas like avoiding eyesight.

It is my opinion that the more illogical the norm, the more realistic it becomes. Like an old shirt. The little details such as stain drops from coffee or small rip at the bottom make it look more well-loved than a brand new T-shirt with two or three massive rips across it.

As a side note, I would expect the eye contact to be more about the formality of the setting as I hinted towards. Lucius Malfoy talking to another noble family rather than Joe talking to Dorphy about the turnips this season. Even if the ability is rare, the intent and meaning prevails.
