Did autocorrect mess it up? Happens to my friend all the time. Could you tell me what's supposed to be in its place

  rs. To those inside the society, a short bow is something you do in greeting dozens of times per day. Or maybe they tilt their head upwards when they see a friend and downwards when they see an acquaintance. The normal things in society can be absolutely pointless yet still hold value. As you pointed out, left-handed people exist, but social norms make no sense therefore it doesn't matter.
#+end_quote

I assume you are talking about a hypothetical society or using hypothetical examples. I could give you examples of social norms that do make sense, but I think I more or less get your point.

  It is my opinion that the more illogical the norm, the more realistic it becomes. Like an old shirt.
#+end_quote

I think it's only in very traditionalistic countries. I can list of a number of norms that do make a lot of sense

  , I would expect the eye contact to be more about the formality of the setting as I hinted towards. Lucius Malfoy talking to another noble family rather than Joe talking to Dorphy about the turnips this season

That's fair

  Even if the ability is rare, the intent and meaning prevails.

It's less that it is rare, but more that it is practically unheard of. Some people know about it, but they also have the ability to use it. Aside from these people you have to search very extensively to find even mentions of it.
