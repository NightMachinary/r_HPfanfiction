I reviewed it, and it seems Snape does suspect Bellatrix of teaching and not Narcissa like I misremembered. There was a Pottermore page that says he was a gifted occlumrns. Pottermore also doesn't mention it being particularly rare if J.K. Rowling's words mean anything to you. It doesn't to me. Her opinions on the subject mean nothing without supporting evidence in the books.

And yes, if she didn't write it in the books, then it is just her opinion. *Death of the Author*. The only difference between what I say and what she says is... Nothing. What we say stands on its own merit. If it has basis in the original seven books, then it is true regardless of who says it.
