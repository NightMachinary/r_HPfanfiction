A number of norms do make sense, but that doesn't mean they all must. Heavily traditional societies like the wizarding world, noble families in particular, would definitely have more odd things.

Legilimency may be unheard of to most, but Narcissa taught Draco occlumency as stated by Snape in the 6th book. What Snape says implies this is a recent occurrence, and we also can gather from Snape that it takes legilimency to quickly learn as seen when he attempted to teach Harry. This at least shows that it is prevalent enough for 1) A non patriarch of a family to know and 2) common enough that the training for occlumency seems known. This is ignoring the possibility that Narcissa herself was a legilmens and was at least proficient enough to train Draco to defend himself from Snape /with the intent of him being able to defend himself from the Dark Lord/.
