Everything was fascinating. I never knew about the watch which actually makes a lot of things I've heard make sense. I had actually previous considered the "point hat" on the Hogwarts requirement list to be a prank as they were never worn except by the fabulously fabulous Albus Percivial Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

I especially liked the Hogwarts houses, the not touching of the wands, portraits as not being the same person, and the method in which they hold their wand. Malfoy uses his fancy staff for example. Moody also spoke of wand holsters although that could just be his constant vigilance.

The portrait thing greatly depends on the fanfiction. My own headcanon is that they may be sentient, but they are more of an outline of the person. Over time, the magic can get more magicky and the portrait becomes its own being totally apart from the original. The Fat Lady Portrait would be nothing like the original person all those years ago for example. They would never be the same person, but they were them too. A mild caricature of the person perhaps. Also, Dumbledore was opposed to living on after death. I highly doubt he would make himself live on after death as a portrait which implies to me that they aren't truly the same person. I imagine the person in the portrait is just a goofy old man who wears funny robes and occasionally spouts nuggets of +nonsense+ wisdom.

EDIT: I imagine the wizard equivalent of the stopwatch would be being incapable of casting a spell (if it exists).
