Yeah --- the Portraits are canonically "sentient, but somewhat two-dimensional". That is to say that they're more than illusions, but they are artificial beings who outwardly resemble what the painter thought the person was like, but are their own person whose personality may or may not be that close to the original. (The original can choose to use Pensieve-like magic or simple conversation to give some of their memories to the Portrait, but they don't have to.)
