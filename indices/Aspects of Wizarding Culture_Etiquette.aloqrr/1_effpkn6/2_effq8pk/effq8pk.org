To add more detail (and a bit of copy paste a response on another comment):

I would expect the eyesight to be more about the formality of the setting as I hinted towards. Lucius Malfoy talking to another noble family rather than Joe talking to Dorphy about the turnips this season.

Like your own example of swearing by ancestors. If the ability to use legilimency is indeed extremely rare, then the assertion is "You are too weak to use legilimency, and I could knock it aside without the slightest effort."

If you want canon support for this example, Narcissa Malfoy taught Draco occlumency. That at least shows that it is known among the more noble families both how to use it. You could even extrapolate deeper in that Snape said that you needed a legilmens to learn occlumency unless you want years of work. Snape's comment to Draco implies that this is a recently gained skill for Draco. Bada boom, we have a decent fanfic idea that even has some canon support.
