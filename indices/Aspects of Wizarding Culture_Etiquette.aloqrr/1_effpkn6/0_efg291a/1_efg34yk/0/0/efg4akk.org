Not necessarily. Since wizards have super-duper healing magic, you could extract half a toad's blood without killing it, etc. Living organ farm.

Plus, some people have pet chicken. We obviously domesticated chicken to murder the heck out of them, but eventually someone went "hey, that's cute, I want to keep it". It likely won't happen to us with chicken now, but it's imaginable that in a hundred years pet chicken may have become accepted as an everyday pet.

No, as funny as that would be, we do know toads are (well, used to be) popular wizarding pets. cf. Neville and Trevor, toads being sold at the Magical Menagerie.
