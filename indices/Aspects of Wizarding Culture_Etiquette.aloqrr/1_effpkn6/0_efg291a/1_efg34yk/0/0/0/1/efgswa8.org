Here's a theory:

Wizards first started keeping toads when some brave or unfortunate soul discovered the hallucinogenic effects of licking certain species. After this, some of the more "spacey" wizards began carrying their drug-toads everywhere, so they'd always be able to trip out on demand.

As with anything, over time the true purpose of the tradition was forgotten, and now many simple keep the toads as standard pets.

You'd get no closer to tripping balls if you licked Trevor than if you licked Neville himself.
