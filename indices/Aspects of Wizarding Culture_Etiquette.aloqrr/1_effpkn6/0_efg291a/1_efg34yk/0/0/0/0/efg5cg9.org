Trevor is pretty clearly a random wild toad Algernon Longbottom picked up in a swamp because he's cheap, senile, and also a psychopathic madman. Why do you think it keeps escaping?

I really like the idea that Neville's Trevor is basically like if decades after owning a dog goes out of fashion, someone wanted to revive the tradition of dog-owning and gifted their kid a wolf. Then wondered what went wrong when the wolf failed to be cuddly, and, indeed, actively tried to eat the kid.
