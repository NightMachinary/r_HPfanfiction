Dumbledore, who is about the same age as Augusuta, /also/ wears /interesting/ hatsI get the feeling the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies dropped the ball here on a wondrous worldbuilding opportunity that hats were really in fashion with early-20th-century wizards.

On the other hand,... Dumbledore is /also/ a really upstanding member of society. Wizards, collectively, are a cartoonishly eccentric bunch where Barty Crouch Sr is the weird one because he wears a gray suit and a tie to work instead of plum robes and a lime green bowler hat.
