It's always been my headcanon that magic owls deliver mail, magic cats keep magical pests (pixies) away, and magical toads have the ability to survive ingesting almost anything, making them useful for testing potions. It would make sense for Snape to see Nevilles toad as a replaceable tool while Neville sees it as a pet if toads were commonly used to test potions.
