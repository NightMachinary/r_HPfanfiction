I don't think the "looking in someone's eyes" thing really works (at least in the canonical universe; some AUs have more widespread Legilimency) because Legilimency is very obscure lore. What you describe may be a power dynamic that could play out between two Dark Wizards, perhaps; but it wouldn't be an ordinary everyday thing.

Other than that, though, you're thinking in the right direction. I like all this.

I think the basic reason not too many social norms are mentioned is because the Wizarding World doesn't /have/ that many --- they're not /that/ removed from the Muggle world in that respect; to a British Muggle a British Wizard is a little eccentric, but not /foreign/. Another reason is that wizards are too eccentric and independent-minded to have much in the way of norms in the first place.

Nonetheless, a few stray ideas:

- It's rude to ask someone what House they were in at Hogwarts if you don't know. If they don't choose to advertise it (i.e. by wearing a green tie to indicate they were a Slytherin), it's not for you to know.

- Do /not/ touch someone else's wand. Even if they've dropped it and picking it up for them seems like the proper thing to do.

- Keeping your wand in your pocket indicates loose manners and a devil-may-care attitude; a proper wizard never parts with his.

- Don't talk to a Portrait-Person about their "original" as a separate person. It tends to throw the poor thing in existential crisis.

- If a witch works with the Ministry, she is to be addressed as Madam, not Mrs or Ms. This goes regardless of her marital status.

- It's extremely embarrassing to stop a British wizard in the street asking for the time; since being gifted your own pocketwatch is a symbol of adulthood for British sorcerers, admitting you've forgotten it at home is a show of immaturity. (Note: Minister Fudge always forgets his pocketwatch at home.)

- Normal people swear by God or Merlin. If you say things like "/by Morgana/" or "/for Salazar's sake/", you're trying to call attention to yourself, rather clumsily. Purebloods will, however, occasionally swear by their ancestors, and /that/'s okay (among purebloods; everyone else thinks it's pretentious and silly).

- How expensive a bribe a Ministry official will ask for depends on their rank within the Ministry rather than on the favor being asked. Even if it's to get you off a murder charge, a Hit-Wizard would be uncouth to ask you for more than 50 Galleons, whereas it'd take at least 500 to sway a Department Head into overlooking that you handed in your report late.

- Wearing the pointy hat outside of Hogwarts (or, for that matter, /inside/ Hogwarts on non-special occasions) is as old-fashioned as owning a toad. Worse, perhaps.
