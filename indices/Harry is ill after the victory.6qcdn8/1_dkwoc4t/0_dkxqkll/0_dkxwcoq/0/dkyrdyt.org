Just a random idea of how there could be magical cancer. Cancer cells work by overriding the cells machinery to produce more cells and not respond to death signals. So what if the cancer could someway override the magic in a way that would prevent it from easily being vanished away. That gets into the territory of mixing magic with science and where exactly a wizards control of their magic resides.
