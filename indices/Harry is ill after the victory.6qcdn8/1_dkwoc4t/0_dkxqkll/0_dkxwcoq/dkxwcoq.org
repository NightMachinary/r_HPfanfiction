Rowling said that Magic has easier/more control over mundane. She said this in a section of Pottermore called diseases and Illnesses. Cancer is caused by rapid cell division of abnormal cells that destroy body tissue. The reason we can't cure it solely with radiation is because it would destroy normal cells as well, but Magic is based on the will of the user and the specific intent of the spell, if your intent is to get rid of those bad cells, it will get rid of those bad cells and only those.

As for 'Magical Cancer' Rowling did say that there were Magical Illnesses and Diseases that could occur, as well as there being Several Curses that have long term detrimental effects on the user, however I'm pretty sure that even those things can be cured (Madame Pomfrey is capable of regrowing MAGICALLY vanished bones).
