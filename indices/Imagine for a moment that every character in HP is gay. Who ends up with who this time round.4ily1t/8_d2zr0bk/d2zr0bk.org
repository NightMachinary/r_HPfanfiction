I think Ron and Seamus would be adorable.

I know Harry/Draco is seriously overplayed, but I think it's pretty plausible.

Pince/Pomfrey

McGonagall and either Hooch or Grubbly-Plank

Flitwick and Dumbledore definitely had a fling at some point, but they're mature enough to move on.

Ginny, Luna, Hermione, and Fleur - I could see any combination of these working out, although Luna/Fleur is a little less believable.

Also, I know this isn't the question, but Hermione and female Percy would make my heart sing!
