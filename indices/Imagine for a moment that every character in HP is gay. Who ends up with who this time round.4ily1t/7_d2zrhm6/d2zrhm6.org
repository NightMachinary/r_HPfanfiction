Righty ho then:

- Arthur/Lucius - the sexual tension between them is obvious

- Pettigrew <3's Snape, but it's unrequited. Peter joined the DE's to try catch his attention. Failed.

- Harry/Colin - he's basically a male Ginny, so it works

- Ron/Roger Davies

- Hermione does a Remus, spends years pursueing a career/life before thinking about settling down, marries a divorced Fleur, who'd married some random girl

- Ginny/Romilda

- Pansy/Astoria Greengrass

- Millicent/Luna - Millicent looks after tiny bullied Luna, Luna befriends lonely half-blood plain jane Millicent - eventually friendship flourishes into luuurve

- Penelope/Tonks

- Remus/Snape - took til after the war, when they both made their peace with the evil beings that they both are, that they finally were ready to date people. Turned out to be each other.

- Miverva/Amelia Bones. You know it's meant to be.

- Bane/Firenze. Bane got really mad when Harry rode Firenze, but that was just because HE wanted to ride him. Yanno. wink wink.

- Hagrid/Vernon. Clearly.

- Lavender spends years trying to get Hermione's attention. Eventually decides to move on, and tried asking Fleur out. Heartbroken when both OoD married each other, and kinda turned on too. Eventually finds happiness with Daphne, who sadly turns out to be a second Mrs Zabini, and Lavender was #8. Oops, I didn't mean to make her life a tragedy...

- Parvati/Susan

- Padma/Hannah

- Neville/Seamus - Seamus was devoted right from Neville's first potions explosions.

- Draco/Zacharius Smith

- Lee Jordan/Oliver Wood

- Fred and George both date unseriously for years, never settle down

- Percy eventually finds himself somehow in a relationship with Cedric. He's never entirely sure how it happened, but he's very happy.

- Cho Chang - Daphne prize #12 - after she got super rich and successful in her Quidditch career, and provided Daphne with lots of money and social opportunities. Prior to that, Cho had had a tempestuous, on and off again relationship with Marietta for years, before Marietta made a very advantageous marriage to Gwenog Jones, who'd retired from Quidditch and did something very important and prestigious. Oops, didn't mean to make her life sad either...

- Gwenog Jones ends up heart broken by Marietta, and dies during a Triwizard Tournament she was judging/running/something

- Molly/Emmeline
