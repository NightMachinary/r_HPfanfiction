Sirius/Remus

James/Regulus

Or, on a good day Sirius/Remus/James because threesome relationships are hot in fiction.

Harry is tricker because there really aren't that many people around his age for him to shack up with.

Ron is an option, but I can't see it, neither can I see Harry with any of his other year mates.
