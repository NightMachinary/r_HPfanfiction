Are you sure the age gap isn't to large? I mean when Harry is 17 they're already in their late 20's and that's quite the gap to cross. Unless your suggesting something when they're all older, like Harry is in his early thirties and is investigating a underground rare creatures and artifact smuggling ring... And brings on Bill and Charlie to consult... Oooh, I wonder if anyone has written this because holy crap do I want this.
