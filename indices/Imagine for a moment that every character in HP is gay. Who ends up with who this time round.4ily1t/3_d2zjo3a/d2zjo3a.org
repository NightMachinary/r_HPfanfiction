Harry/Cedric definitely

Fairly certain I've seen this pairing before: Trelawney/Mrs Figg

Petunia/Marge Dursley (why not)

Lily/Alice (Longbottom, but she wouldn't be called that)

Andromeda/Luna's mother

Ginny/Cho Chang

Narcissa/Blaise Zabini's mother - one of the few ambitious, ruthless women we hear of

Bellatrix/Alecto

Hermione/Luna (especially a Ravenclaw!Hermione who would first encounter Luna as someone being bullied, which would remind her of herself, not through Ginny) or Hermione/Penelope Clearwater

Ron/Seamus maybe, I also love the idea of Ron/Draco

Remus/Charlie Weasley (if we're sticking with the cross-generational thing)

Neville/Colin Creevey, maybe. Colin would settle for Neville, the 'other' boy who lived (!)

Ollivander/Dumbledore

Minerva/Ariana Dumbledore who lived

Sprout/Pomfrey or Sprout/Molly Weasley

Marietta/Lavender or Romilda Vane/Lavender

Padma/Susan (I'd really like to see this one, just due to fanon interpretations of the characters)

Dobby/Kreacher (?)

James/Sirius or James/Severus

Oliver Wood/Percy or Oliver Wood/Flint

Ms Pince/Ms Hooch

Arthur Weasley/Reg

Lucius/Fudge or Lucius/Regulus

(Yes, some of these might be crack pairings, but why not)
