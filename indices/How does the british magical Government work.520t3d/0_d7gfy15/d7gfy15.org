  How does the british magical Government work?
#+end_quote

From what I can tell, bribes.

Seriously though: It seems like the Minister has broad powers and can essentially rule through fiat (such as the Educational Decrees of OoTP). It also seems that Department Heads can create/pass laws (see Arthur Weasley and the Muggle Protection Act of CoS). Whether or not the Department Head drafts the law and it is ratified by a higher authority (Minister of Magic) is too difficult to tell.

As for the Wizengamot: There is absolutely nothing in canon that I am aware of that shows the Wizengamot to be anything other than the highest court, so no legislative nature. As to how they're chosen or appointed? Maybe it's elections (the concept of democracy and republics having existed since Ancient Greece at the latest). Part of me wishes that it has something to do with Divination, but my thoughts on divination really belong in a different conversation.
