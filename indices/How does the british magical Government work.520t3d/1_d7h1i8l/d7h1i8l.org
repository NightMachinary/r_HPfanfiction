The books basically tell us nothing. We know: the Wizengamot is a thing and sometimes carries out judicial roles, there's probably a nobility (possibly ceremonial though), the minister's elected and... that's it.

Heres what I'd say would be good guesses: Wizengamot is a primarily legislative chamber (Harry's trial was a political stunt); judiciary are appointed by commission, Commonwealth law; department heads are appointed by the minister and voted on by the Wizengamot, US-style; and Britain, Scotland and Ireland are united.

Whether the nobility has real political power (if so there would need to be a second chamber), whether the Queen and muggle PM have any authority, and how much overlap there is with muggle law is entirely up to you.
