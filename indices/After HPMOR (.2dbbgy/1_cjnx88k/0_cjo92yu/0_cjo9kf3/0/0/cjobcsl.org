  You seem bitter about HPMOR. You could simply ignore it, pull your fedora down over your eyes a bit whenever it's mentioned.

Not bitter so much as that I find MOR, EY, and his one-man Wiki crusade to be the most talked about fanfiction celeb to be irresistible comedic material. I shared a tongue-in-cheek comment to this sub and received the obligatory downvotes from his army of disciples. Not wholly unexpected.

I've watched the MOR saga since the beginning, including episodes of extreme DLP asshattery (e.g., a user Silens Cursor apparently thinking it appropriate to share publicly private communications with the author that were disparaging to the site, leading to a predictable pile-on before wiser heads stepped in and slapped SC down for being a douche; I think the thread can be found in DLP's "Hall of Shame"), as well as several instances of LW's trolling. I once had the poor judgment to have corrected the guy in a PM on something he had gotten wrong in one of his stories and received a rather condescending response, one which told me what I needed to know about the author.

I've even read his occasional comments to the effect of believing himself entitled to cash compensation for his unlicensed derivative fiction, that his story was really more his than JKR's source. Doubtless, such comments are hard to find online anymore (except as dubiously sourced quotes on various forums), as I'm sure his employers have no wish to be fed CAD letters by JKR's army of lawyers, but they happened.

I don't harbor bitterness, though I do find the author and his antics to be incredibly amusing.
