Eh, I can enjoy the fic without caring about the drama behind the scenes. I'm not going to be scammed out of my money just because I like the guy's writing. It's like saying you shouldn't read or appreciate Lovecraft because the guy was a huge racist.

And DLP hates to death everything that gets "undeservingly" popular, they're not the most reputable source. I too find EY's antics amusing, though.

EDIT: Oh god I'm reading the Hall of Shame thread now, it's fucking hilarious

  What exactly is so wrong about us taking the time to bash LessWrong? What is so bad about retaliating after he talked shit about DLP? Now Silens is accepting blame for starting the bash fest in the MoR thread. What the fuck is up with that? Yudkowsky, the little pretentious shit he is, deserves to be verbally attacked

It's like I'm back in highschool again.
