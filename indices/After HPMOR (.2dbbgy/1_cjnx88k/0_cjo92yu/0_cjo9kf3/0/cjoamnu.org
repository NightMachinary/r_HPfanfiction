I know what kind of salaries CFAR and MIRI pay. They're pretty terrible for the level of expertise involved -- as in, you could get hired by a starving startup and keep the same salary, or go for a startup with venture funding and double your salary, or work for one of the major tech companies in the area and triple your compensation.

MIRI recently added its second and third FTEs. You might reasonably say that Yudkowsky is leveraging his fan fiction to pay for these hires. Unless he's getting a raise that outpaces cost of living increases, though, he's not profiting personally from HPMOR.

As for holding chapters hostage, I hadn't seen that. I have seen him releasing on a specific schedule and accelerating that if sufficient donations go through. I get annoyed when I see authors refusing to publish chapters unless they get enough reviews -- it seems petty. I don't get annoyed when I see authors publishing weekly under normal circumstances and more frequently when they get more reviews -- the reviews serve as motivation to work on the story more often. This is similar, except his employers are also willing to make writing fan fiction part of his work duties if it proves to be a sufficiently useful means of advertising.

  But hey, keep up the downvote brigade, all you classy, albeit humorless, friends-of-Yudkowsky.

You seem bitter about HPMOR. You could simply ignore it, pull your fedora down over your eyes a bit whenever it's mentioned.
