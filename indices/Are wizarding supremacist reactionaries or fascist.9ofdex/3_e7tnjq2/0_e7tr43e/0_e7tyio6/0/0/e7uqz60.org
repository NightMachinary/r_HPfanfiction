*Strasserism*

Strasserism (German: Strasserismus or Stra√üerismus) is a strand of Nazism that calls for a more radical, mass-action and worker-based form of Nazism---hostile to Jews not from a racial, ethnic, cultural or religious perspective, but from an anti-capitalist basis---to achieve a national rebirth. It derives its name from Gregor and Otto Strasser, the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position.

Opposed on strategic views to Adolf Hitler, Otto Strasser was expelled from the Nazi Party in 1930 and went into exile in Czechoslovakia while Gregor Strasser was murdered in Germany on 30 June 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives. Strasserism remains an active position within strands of neo-Nazism.
