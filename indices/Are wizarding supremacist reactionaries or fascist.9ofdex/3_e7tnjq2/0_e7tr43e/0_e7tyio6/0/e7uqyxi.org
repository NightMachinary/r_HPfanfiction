That's a fair point about Hitler, but he doesn't personally embody fascism. There was disagreement early on even within the Nazi party about this, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism][Strasserism]]. But I should have said it /can/ combine far-left economics with far-right cultural views, rather than implying it always does.
