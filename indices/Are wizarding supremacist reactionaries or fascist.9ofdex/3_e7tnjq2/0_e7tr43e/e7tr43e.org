  Technically, fascism is a form of government on the far left of the political spectrum, usually somewhere in between socialism and communism.

That's not quite true. Fascism is generally considered a far right-wing ideology - on the opposite end of the spectrum from socialism and communism. It would only be considered near to communism if you subscribe to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory][horseshoe theory]] - i.e. the far-left and the far-right are closer to each other than to the middle.

Historically, the fascist movements you mentioned were all strongly right-wing and persecuted left-wing Marxists and anarchists.

Fascism presented itself as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position][third position]], as opposed to international socialism and free-market capitalism - the two dominant ideologies of the time.

So to be fair, it doesn't really fit neatly into the left-right paradigm, because it combines far-left economics with far-right cultural views.

But any dictionary or encyclopedia will still classify fascism as a right-wing political ideology.
