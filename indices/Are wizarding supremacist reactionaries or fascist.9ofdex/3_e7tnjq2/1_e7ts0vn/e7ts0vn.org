Nazism as a political system most certainly was new. While it combined old ideas the combination was most certainly unique. There was btw far much more wrong with nazism than just hte killing of "lesser" races. Even when you ignore the obvious stupidity that was at the core of the system.

The comparison between nazism and the current debate on integration and the importance of culture can not and should not be made. It is ridiculous and does neither do justice to the history of nazism nor the current debate.

Nazism has nothing to do with socialism nor communism in any way shape or form. Neither in the way the goverment funcitoned. The way society was governed nor how the economy was run. The ridiculous notion that nazism was socialism is fueled by the american right praying on lack of education on the subject in schools there. The comparision makes zero sense.
