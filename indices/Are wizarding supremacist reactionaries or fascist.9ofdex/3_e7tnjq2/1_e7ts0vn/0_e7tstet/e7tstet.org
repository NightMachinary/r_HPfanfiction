  The comparison between nazism and the current debate on integration and the importance of culture can not and should not be made. It is ridiculous and does neither do justice to the history of nazism nor the current debate.

I disagree. You're correct that Nazism extends beyond just its racist ideologies. But facism believed in the idea of conformity, you either join the party or support it.

Today's debate is still very much about conformity, though less severe than conformity in a fascist state. Is that not what's currently happening in Denmark with the "integration education" laws for Muslims.

Even if no government will ever actually function like the Nazis ran theirs, the ideologies behind the Nazi racial supremacy are still part of today's debate.
