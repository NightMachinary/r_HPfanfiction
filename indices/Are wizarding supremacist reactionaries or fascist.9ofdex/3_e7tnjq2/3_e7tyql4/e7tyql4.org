  Technically, fascism is a form of government on the far left of the political spectrum, usually somewhere in between socialism and communism

That is ridiculous, there's no argument for that. Nearly any exploration of the fascist ideology and policies put it on the extreme right-wing. A high emphasis on tradition - especially with respect to a mythic past and racial purity/supremacy -, high focus on wartime capitalism (pumping loads of money into the military with the purpose of conquering) and support for private ownership of the means of production, etc. The USSR was obviously the prototypical socialist economy and the state owned most industries and the one's it didn't own (agriculture, mainly) were owned by the collective farms.

You're basically saying an individualist ideology and a collectivist one are of the same kind, which is a contradiction.
