I would hesitate to call Nazi-ism new necessarily. It was nationalism, jingoism, and racial supremacy taken to its extreme. The ideas that Hitler espoused(racial supremacy/lesser races) were held in some form by even the Allied countries - see Eugenics. It's just the idea of actively, violently, and methodically killing "lesser" races was wrong. Rowling attempted to make a similar comparison with Voldemort. I'm sure that in canon there are a number of families who believe in the sanctity of pureblood, but find the idea of actively killing Muggles abhorrent. Voldemort was an example of ideology taken to the extreme. This debate still exists today. It's the idea of integration vs keeping your own culture and the question of nativeness. Look at countries in the western world that still struggle with race relations - the US, UK, France, Germany, etc.

Now fascism is a term that gets thrown around, and is often misused. Technically, fascism is a form of government on the far left of the political spectrum, usually somewhere in between socialism and communism. It's the fact that Italy, Spain, and Germany were fascist governments results in a tying together of Germany's ideology and their style of government.

To finally answer your question, I think the Death Eater moment was a combination of reactionary panic and long term thinking. According to canonical history, Nobby Leech the first Muggleborn Minister of Magic, ascended to power sometime after Grindelwald's war and before the first Voldemort war. I assume that and other events served as a catalyst for the extremists who believed in all wizarding superiority, and those feelings boiled over. It's not even clear how much Voldemort himself truly believed in wizarding superiority - he definitely placed his own power and success over that of the movement. But that being said, the political setting, Voldemort's charisma and power, and the feelings of (usually wealthy) Purebloods spurred the movement.
