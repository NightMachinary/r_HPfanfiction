  First Nazism let to the Holocaust. Not only is the Holocaust not comparable to any other genocide it was also in every way shape or form a useless endavour. It hindered Nazi Germany in every imaginable way. This requires such a specific mindset one can't really compare.

Both of those phenomena were present in HP. The Muggleborn trials and stripping Muggleborns of magic was a useless endeavour that lines up with the Holocaust. Considering HP was a children's series, JK's allegory was tamer and had Muggleborns stripped of their wands and jailed rather than killed in Death Camps.

  Second Nazism lacks a coherent ideology. Basically what hitler said went.

The same can be said of Voldemort and the DE's. He was the supreme leader, and whatever he said went.
