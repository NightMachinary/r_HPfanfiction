Regarding your first point: Ah but the jailling of other races and undesirable people is not inherent to nazism. That is actually not that uncommon in history. The Holocaust isn't unique in the killing of a people. The Holocaust is unique because of how they did it.

The difference of the stripping of muggleborns is only useless. As are all forms genocide. No the Holocaust differs due to the fact that he Nazi's really started commiting to the endavour when it was least opportune.

Comparing the treatment of muggleborns to a regular genocide is rather easy. Comparing it to the Nazi's not so much.

Regarding your second point: The way Voldemort is the surpreme leader is comparible but that was not what my point was about. What i meant is that because Nazism doesnt have a coherent ideology comparing Nazi ideology to other ideologies in this case the DE ideas does not work well.
