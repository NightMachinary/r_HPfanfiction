Well nazism doesn't really lend itself towards comparisons. Because of two main reasond

First Nazism let to the Holocaust. Not only is the Holocaust not comparable to any other genocide it was also in every way shape or form a useless endavour. It hindered Nazi Germany in every imaginable way. This requires such a specific mindset one can't really compare.

Second Nazism lacks a coherent ideology. Basically what hitler said went.

The easy comparison between the Nazi's and DE is actually there

The NSDAP had rich benefactors among it's supporters. as does the DE

The nazi's were reactionary in the way they wanted to go back to the glory days of the german first and second empire. As are the DE

The Nazi's believed in the superiorty of their people and culture due race tradition and blood. Same goes for DE

The Nazi's were military minded and didn't shun violance. Same goes for DE.

​

Actually the superficial comparision is very much there but with a deaper understanding of the mechanics of the third reich show a different story.
