Some from old families were opposed to Hitler because he was just a lowly corporal from an insignificant family. That is what I think is an difference Hitler didn't like the aristocracy and they didn't like him. Voldemort attracted mostly a small elite, the inner circle of death eaters who were purebloods when Hitler on the other hand attracted the common man. They are small superficial differences but interesting indeed. You could imagine if a secretive mysterious group appeared in the UK to restore the former privileges of the aristocracy.

Come to think of it the death eaters actually reminds me the most of the KKK because the KKK also had influence in politics and consisted partly of respectable members of society. It was also quite secretive.
