Pureblood as a movement is what... three centuries old by the time of the books? And it was borne out of circumstances surrounding the creation of Statute of Secrecy. There were radical waves earlier, but the current one stems from the political situation and the social changes in the twentieth century. Still for the majority of British history they weren't really in power. So mix of both I would say?
