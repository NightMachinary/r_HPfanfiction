Nazism was new, but it evolved rather evidently out of previously existing phenomena present in Europe (Jew hatred, supremacist rhetoric and views, hatred and distrust of foreigners, aftermath of WW1, etc.), and that's shown to be the case for pureblood supremacists as well. Hell, pureblood supremacy goes back at least to Slytherin and it would be comical to suggest he originated the idea all on his own. Ideologies never come out of nowhere, their "newness" is rather more akin to reincarnation or maybe a sort of cultural version of evolution. Hitler wasn't just blanket "against religion and tradition", that's just a nonsense, nuance-free way to characterize him. The part you're missing is that those Lucius and co. would fight alongside and accept into the fold were half-bloods at a minimum and for those like Bellatrix purebloods only. It wasn't that Voldemort only attracted upper-class wizards (Greyback can hardly be called upper-class, nor could Snape). It was their mythic "common identity" that bound them together largely, explicitly against a select "other". As I said, this went back definitely as far as Slytherin, and surely before that. There's a reason he identifies so closely with his direct descendance from Slytherin (after all, being from a thousand years ago technically all of humanity (definitely Europeans) would be descended from Slytherin). It centers him as part of a line which has always stood against the so-called "problem" that other pureblood supremacists were angered about in the late 20th century. As with Hitler, he gave them someone to rally behind who had, in their minds, a coherent worldview, packed with a solution and geneology that made supporting him (Voldemort) the obvious answer to their society's ills.

It's pretty clear they're supposed to be magic Nazis. But then, fascists are quite obviously extremely reactionary so it's not really an either-or kind of thing.
