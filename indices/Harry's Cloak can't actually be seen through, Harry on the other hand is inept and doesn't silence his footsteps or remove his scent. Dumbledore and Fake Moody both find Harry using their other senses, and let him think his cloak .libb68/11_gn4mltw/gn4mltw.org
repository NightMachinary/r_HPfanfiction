The best explanations I've read are:

Dumbles added some thread from a Demiguise to the cloak. His glasses can see invisible objects, so when he sees the thread, he knows it's Harry. He also informed Moody/Crouch about this.

The Marauders Map recognizes people by where they walk, and there are no invisible shoes of Ignotus Peverell to solve that.

The map can't identify who is under the cloak by can determine that there is some kind of void moving around the school. Because it is unique and doesn't show up as a ghost, the Marauders just label the void as 'Potter.'

Plus sound, smell, muddy footprints.
