My problem with the need to use silencing spells on your feet and no scent smells etc., is it ignores the fact that a powerful diety like Death can hear and smell so his cloak wouldn't be much good to hide from him if you had to remember to silence yourself (don't forget the noise that breathing hard, or your heart racing makes) and make sure no smell, heat, etc., escapes. Plus if I can recall canon correctly Crouch jr as Mad eye can see through the cloak when using the goblin eye (Dumbledore knowing they are outside Hagrid's hut etc).

For those reasons I lean towards the elder wand being used to place some sort of tracking and revealing spell on the cloak. Thinking that no other wand is powerful enough to tamper with Death's gift. And that's why mad eye and Dumbledore seem to be aware when Harry is around under the cloak.

Now I object to Dumbledore doing this as he has no right to mess with Harry's property nor did he have a right to withhold the cloak irregardless of how young Harry is as it is a Potter Heirloom not a Dumbledore one (I can see him holding it back until Harry rejoins the magical world). I especially thought giving it to Harry as a Christmas gift was a bit tacky. "Gee, so my gift from you is your returning my property to me? Wow how generous". /sarc
