/...I remember when Prongs was really freaking out of how Lils could find him even with the Cloak, thinking she had some Magic Sense, or knew some obscure magic. Can't forget his face when she told him it was because he forgot to silence his footsteps, or when Moony pointed out he still had a smell, never saw him get so red! Turns out the Cloak really is so good no matter what charm used he couldn't be found, even by Moody and that eyes of his. Good thing you have your mother's intellect Harry, and doesn't mess up like that.../

As Harry put down the letter, his face was red, as suddenly a lot of things made sense.

He immediately made a note to ask Hermione about silencing and scent masking spells, he would test to see if Moody could still find him then, or Professor Dumbledore.
