Well, it's not like it is. The trope, I mean. I don't really like Albus Dumbledore. He's done some pretty messed up things. But even if I disregard that, he's pretty messed up as a person as well. A lot of actions before and during the series could very well be classified as abuse, negligence, and so many other things /[Eemembers him setting fire to a child's wardrobe]/. He's definitely not perfect. Even if I can see where his plan to defeat Voldemort came from. So I can definitely see him attempting to put a tracking spell on the cloak. And if that doesn't work, then he'd do it on Harry's glasses or something.
