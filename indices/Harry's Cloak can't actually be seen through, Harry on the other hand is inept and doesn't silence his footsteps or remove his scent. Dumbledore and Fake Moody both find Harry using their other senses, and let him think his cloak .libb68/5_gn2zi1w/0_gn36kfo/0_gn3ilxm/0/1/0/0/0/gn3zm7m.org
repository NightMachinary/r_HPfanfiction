This brings up two interesting points of discussion.

One, is Dumbledore personally responsible for Harry? On one hand if he is, then he's fucked up massively with the Dursleys, but him tracking Harry is completely legit, IRL parents do that to young children via phone apps. On the other hand, if he's not responsible for Harry, then he shouldn't do that, but in that case, the majority of the flak usually listed against Dumbledore doesn't hold up - he's not responsible for Harry any more then any other professor, and he had no say about dropping him off at the Dursleys.

And the other one is a question that I've never actually seen asked - did four students actually create a map that can track everyone in a school, or is the Marauders' map just tapping into some existing tracking system which a boarding school /absolutely/ needs, and somewhat canonically has? (Professors /always/ showing up when something happens without any sort of tracker would be a bit weird, imo.) Because if it's the later case, then putting a tracker on the item that would let Harry bypass the system is very much fair game.
