Yeah, I think Dumbledore is an interesting character, but from Harry's perspective he's super overpowered as an ally, which is why so many fics paint him as manipulative or whatever.

Linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) is a really good Dumbledore MC where he basically just says "fuck it, I'm doing this MY way" and it's really good so far.
