Oh yeah, Dumbledore is an asshole. The whole Voldemort problem could've been a lot shorter if he just behaved for once.

But my point here is that him putting a tracking spell on the cloak, when the fic gives no other reason to dislike Dumbledore, isn't anywhere near a bad thing. It's the responsible thing to do.

Even putting one on Harry himself could probably be justified by the end of PoA, imo, if Dumbledore would actually /use them/. The kid gets in the middle of every possible problem. Having a way for Dumbledore to swoop in and deal with it would be ideal. Sadly, fics don't ever go that route.
