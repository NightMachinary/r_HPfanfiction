Well, I have noticed that all those times fake Moody has seen him with is eye, have been times when Harry has waved in his general direction while under the cloak, basically intending to be seen by Moody The first time was unintentional (he forgot he was invisible when he waved at Hagrid, and Moody - who literally can see out of the back of his head noticed) The second time was fully intentional because he wanted Moody to know that the map and egg was his so he could prevent Snape from seeing the map

One could postulate that the cloak interpreted his intention and made him visible to the person he wanted to be visible to...

As for Dumbledore knowing ... all of those times have been basically him using common sense and observation. Umbridge did the same too when she showed up at Hagrid's place. She had observed the three sets of footprints in the snow and deduced that Hagrid had guests. Only she, unlike Dumbledore, did not know that Harry owns an invisibility cloak and therefore let it go when she didn't see anyone else in the small house It's not just silencing your footsteps and masking your scent... being truly invisible takes serious thought, especially when your foe is observant!
