Rowling never really explained what happened in Quidditch training but considering that Wood is an Quidditch fanatic and that Harry returned from training tired and dirty there is some physical training involved.

Training probably consist out of bludger dodging, golf ball catching and flying without hands on the broom. And while it will not give a six pack it certainly will keep your body fit.
