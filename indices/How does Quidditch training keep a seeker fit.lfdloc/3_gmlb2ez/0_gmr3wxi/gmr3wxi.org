Yes. Highest level competitive horse riding of all types, especially at speed, requires significant core strength, and possibly the jockey position, or at least a cross country galloping position, might be similar to a broomstick position. Constant balance adjustments and keeping your center of gravity in the right place through turns, swerves, etc.

Plus the core strength necessary for tricks like the Wronski Feint; have to stay with the broom, even banking sideways etc.
