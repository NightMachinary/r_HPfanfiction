A sixpack is probably the most likely muscle you would get from quidditch, beaters aside. I head canon it as quidditch involves manoeuvring constantly so your opponents can't predict where you are going. I would imagine that this would require you to constantly be shifting your centre of mass, and probably leaning away from the broom a lot, which would require mostly core muscles. I agree seekers seem to spend most of the match cruising, but he may do the same exercises as everyone else because he is a part of the team.
