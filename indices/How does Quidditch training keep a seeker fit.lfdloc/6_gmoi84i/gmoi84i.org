Any good sports captain will have the team performing exercises, not just running drills. Thus, the team members probably run laps around the pitch and do calesthenics as a warmup, in addition to flying drills.

And I don't know about a six-pack, but they'd definitely get strong thigh muscles from holding onto the broom with their legs during all the fancy manoeuvres.
