I'll give you 3 HUGE glaring errors right off the top of my head.

First: 1800 words in 2 chapters. Most of the best stories have at least 5k words per chapter.

Second: Those 2 chapters came 5 months apart. Fics that arent updated at least bi-weekly are really hard to follow. Standard for almost every good fic i have read was weekly.

Third: There is no character listed as a main character. It makes it MUCH harder to find. I always put on character filters when i search for fics.
