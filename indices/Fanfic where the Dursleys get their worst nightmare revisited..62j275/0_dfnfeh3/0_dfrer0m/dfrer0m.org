Thank you for your critique, I will go through it and edit the chapter.

There is a lot of errors in it besides grammar, errors with timelines, attitudes, tenses and lack of explanations.

Keep in mind I wrote the whole thing in one go and didn't have the energy to edit it afterwards. I may have posted it prematurely but I wanted it to be seen first so I could gauge peoples responses.

The world I am writing is the same as the original but in the future so it is entirely plausible that rules have changed but there will be necessary explanations. Mostly that the ministry has somewhat lessened the role of aurors as there is a lacking of dark wizards and instead have increased monitoring of magic around muggles. The increase of cameras and population means that there is a lot more of a chance for muggles to see something they should not have.

The whole concept started with Dudley NEEDING to get a hold of Harry but having no way to do it so had to find a way for the wizards to get to him, in this case to stop him from spilling the beans.

I want to write the whole story from this intro to Emerson going to school but unfortunately have had to start Uni again and my workload has increased so the edits and additions wont be as quick as I had hoped. Hearing a lot of positive comments has been really helpful tho and I will make an effort to at least get some of the story down.
