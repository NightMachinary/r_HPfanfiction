Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

One Voldemort possess Grindelwald's body and one is a doll with soul fragments from horcri created by Touko Aozaki.
