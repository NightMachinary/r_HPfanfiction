linkffn(Weres Harry) Voldemort never learned about the blood protection, and went with a different ritual that ended up catching the attention of the Fae.

linkffn(Rising From the Shadows; A Distant Storm) Lockhart is possessed by the Diadem, Bagnold is possessed by the ring, and Voldemort used a variant of the Horcrux ritual based on Ancient Egyptian dark wizards, which filled the same purpose without splitting his soul.
