Do you believe that he relationship with Narcissa and Bellatrix be the same? Would she still hangout with Crabbe and Goyle? Would Harry and Ron still transform into them? Been a Girl would definitely lead to her getting a Slytherin boyfriend in Hogwarts. Wouldn't that change the story for book 6? She would be more closer to the girls having them closer to her personal life could influence her decisions about been a Death Eater in the end. Would Harry Potter and the Wesley beat her to a pulp for mocking Cedric? Huh.
