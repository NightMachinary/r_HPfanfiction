With the exception of Andromeda Tonks, every Slytherin we get to know was evil. And with the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know the house of came from Slytherin.

Now, that does not make every Slytherin evil, but someone who could be in a relationship with "You're next, mudbloods!" isn't going to be an advocate for Muggleborn rights.
