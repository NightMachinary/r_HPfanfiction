I think a lot of smaller details would change but that the bigger picture would stay mostly the same. Narcissa already loves Draco a lot, so I doubt fem!Draco's relationship with her would be different enough to affect the story.

Her hanging out with Crabbe and Goyle could go either way tbh. But even if she went with new friends, I still don't know what could be changed on the bigger side of things.

I'm not really sure what you mean by the boyfriend in sixth year thing. Draco didn't care about girls much in sixth year, right? Why would fem!Draco suddenly care? Because girls must get boyfriends? lol

And I'm pretty sure Harry and them didn't beat Draco to a pulp for mocking Cedric. They cursed him, just as they would if he was a she.
