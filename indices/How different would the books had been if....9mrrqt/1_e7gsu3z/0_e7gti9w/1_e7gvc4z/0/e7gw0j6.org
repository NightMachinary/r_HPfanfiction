That's interesting. Girls are different from boys when it comes to finding a partner, if we assume she is the "Alpha Female of Slytherin" she wouldn't want to get pointed out by the other girls for not having a boyfriend. Even when females mature faster than males we can't discard the possibility of her boyfriend just been a "pet" that follows her around to keep everyone and herself with the image of popularity. (Another thing girls value over teenage boys.) Poor guy.
