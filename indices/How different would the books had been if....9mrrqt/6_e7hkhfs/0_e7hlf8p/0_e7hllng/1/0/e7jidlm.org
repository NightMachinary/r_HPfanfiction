It's one of those hit or miss things for most people. Bellatrix has a pretty good redemption arc towards the late chapters and it's still a WIP so idk we'll see. It's really a pretty good story so far; it has some nice twists in it.

Some things certainly could have been left out without affecting the story, but I've made it through like 48 chapters so I'm going to see it through to the end lol
