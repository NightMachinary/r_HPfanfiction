Maybe this is chauvinistic, but I cannot see Harry acting the same way towards a a female Malfoy. In fact, I don't think she'd be a main antagonist for him in the school at all. In canon, the girls mostly bully other girls (Pansy -> Hermione, for example), while the boys (Montague, Flint, Crabbe, Goyle, and, of course Draco) are the ones that actively bully Harry (dressing up as dementors, altercations in the hallways, etc).

The only way a girl Draco would have a major role, I think, is if the 6'th year cabinet arc got expanded, but before that I don't think she'd be important to the story.

However, during 6'th year, if she gets drafted by Voldemort as well, then that would set her on a collision course with Harry, and there's a lot that could change; namely, a romantic arc that the FF writer in me is perking up at.
