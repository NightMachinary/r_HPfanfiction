It's possible. Girl Draco could still be competitive and intolerant; she could take the rememberball away from Neville, leading to Harry becoming part of the team. But, generally, during the school year, I don't see her as much of an enemy. They'd still be hostile to each other, but probably more in a general sense.

If you're interested, I'm actually writing a story where Draco is a girl and eventually becomes part of Harry's, hmm, entourage. That's not main the focus of the fic, but it will play a reasonably large role.
