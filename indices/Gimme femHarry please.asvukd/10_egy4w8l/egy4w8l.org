There was one story that started out with Harry going up in the girls dorm (the stairs actually let him up), which ended up with Harry being a trans girl. I wish that I saved the link, because it took the story all the way to the end, where Harry becomes a girl, gets moved into the girls dorm, and still ends up with Ginny.

It was fairly well written, but I haven't been able to find it since I read it...
