Obliviate doesn't erase memories, it merely locksthem away. Harry had frequent accidental magic, and every time Dumbledore came and obliviated him and the Dursleys. This led to those memories coalescing into a separate personality with instinctive grasp of magic and a mistrust for Dumbledore for always locking him away.

Cue 3rd year. The Dementors have an unusual effect and weaken the barrier between Harry and his other, occasionally letting it out and revealing that Lockhart also had a habit of obliviating students.
