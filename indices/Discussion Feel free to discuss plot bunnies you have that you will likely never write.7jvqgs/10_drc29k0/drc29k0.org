Harry runs away from the Dursleys, somehow stops by gringotts and learns his godfather is in Azkaban but not anything more about it, so he goes to Azkaban as like a 6 year old kid. He sneaks in, accidental magic's himself some sorta cthulu-esque-ism, and then eats the dementors one by one as they come to the cell he moves into. he makes friends with Sirius and Bellatrix as angel/devil on the shoulder advisors, declines Hogwarts at 11, and then eats everyone that gets sent to Prison.

hermione joins him in retaliation for surviving a troll attack after insulting Malfoy and showing him up in class. Luna joins them the next year when Ginny Weasley goes missing, Tom Riddle revives himself as a 16 year old.

D. Malfoy gets progressively worse as his ludicrous schemes are enacted and innocent people keep getting blamed/imprisoned.

Dumbledore is losing his shit, and his grip on the wizarding world ever since Harry went missing as a child. The sightings at gringotts plus rumors and wizardry lead to the knowledge of Harry's placement with Muggles, and then his Disappearance from same.

Tom 'Diary-Horcrux' Riddle [T1] leaves Hogwarts semi-stealthily, leaving a dead girl in the Chamber of Secrets and mysterious writing on the walls. He studies the actions of Tom 'Lord Voldemort' Riddle [T0], and finds them lacking.

T0 bumbles about Albania and Eastern Europe after fleeing from Dumbledore (and without Magic Rock).

T1 starts war with Wizarding World, not vastly differently than T0 did the first time. T0 gets mad, starts war with both Wizarding World, and T1. HarryThulu chuckles in his island fortress, snacking on dementors and watching his pets (read: prisoners) do tricks. Dumbledore falls victim to the 2face philosophy, the whole of the magic side of International Statute of Secrecy is embroiled in war. Goblins rebel, magical species do magical things, common wizards are idiots, T0, T1, Dumbledore, Ministry of Magic; these are the sides of the widespread panic, fighting, and magic.

As the the warring becomes too much for everyone involved, HarryThulu comes out of his Island Fortress, eats a lot of people and things, and then Declares himself King of Magical Britain.

epilogue: Harry marries the Queen, becomes King of Both Sides of the Statute, and abolishes it.

sequel: with the phenomenal capabilities of magic added to the wonders of modern technology, Harry becomes a Spaceship Captain, Nomad-King of the Sol system, travelling to alien lands, eating things, and catching pets [anyone/anything interesting] to make dance and do tricks.
