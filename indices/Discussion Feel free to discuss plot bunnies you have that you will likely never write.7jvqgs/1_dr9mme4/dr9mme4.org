After a successful career in the special forces, Harry makes the decision to become a teacher. He's a complete unknown to the wizarding world, having been funneled into the special forces after his uneventful Hogwarts years. He arranges a week to shadow one of his favorite teachers in school (who is ignorant of his military career). In the classroom, he confesses that he was in the british military-- like the special forces, and sometimes worked across the pond. When someone asks if his missions at home extended across the pond, he answers no. This understated, shy young man of few words becomes Hogwart's new curiosity as he learns the ropes of teaching, something he has an innocent passion for, for the first time. You can take the man out of the military but you can't take the military out of the man. At the end of the week, Hogwarts discovers that the man who's been assisting their professor and quietly observing is the man who defeated the darkest wizard of their generation.
