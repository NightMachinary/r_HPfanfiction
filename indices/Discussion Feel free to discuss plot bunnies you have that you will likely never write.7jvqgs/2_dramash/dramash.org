I've got two.

After Sirius is killed in the ministry,. Harry's chase after Bellatrix leads to the time room instead of the atrium, where Harry is blasted into the remains of the time turners and the next spell that should have killed him interacts with the time magic and sends him back to the day his first Hogwarts letter arrives. A time travel fic where Harry doesn't have all of the knowledge of how to beat Voldemort, is no more powerful or magically able than he was at the end of 5th year, doesn't know about Horcrux's, but still does his best to fix things, not worrying about trying to preserve the timeline. Starting with Sirius.

The other requires a slight change in the timeline. As Master of Death, Harry has multiple choices in "Kings Cross". Go on, go back, or go to the first time he ever touched a Hallow. Harry chooses to go back and ends up in the past soon after he was born. With only post 7th year abilities and knowledge he has to try to find the horcrux's and destroy them, as well as Voldemort, in the 15 months before his parents die. The first horcrux he tries to get is the locket, where he finds and saves Regulus who becomes his friend as they try to bring down Voldemort.
