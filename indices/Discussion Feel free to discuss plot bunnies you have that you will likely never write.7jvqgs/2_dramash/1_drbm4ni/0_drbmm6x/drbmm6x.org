Alternate self with a baby self in the world too. I'd have Harry wake up in the forbidden forest. He'd be drawn towards the Hallows and would have to deal with trying to take Dumbledore's wand, getting the cloak from his dad without revealing himself and having to answer a whole lot of uncomfortable questions.

Being drawn to the stone would lead him to the shack, the cup and the diary would be the most difficult. I would have Bellatrix not place the cup in the vault yet to avoid too much recapping and have the diary require either an infiltration of or assault on Malfoy Manor.
