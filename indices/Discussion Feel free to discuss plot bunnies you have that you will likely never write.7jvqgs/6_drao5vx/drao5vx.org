Year 3, a slightly mean spirited fem!Harry can´t keep her mouth shut about how Scabbers must be the dumbest animal she´s ever seen, until she got bitten. In a fit of rage she kidnaps Crookshanks and pits him against Scabbers in a cage fight in an arena that was used for illegal house-elf fights in the 60s and that´s now occasionally used for fights between transfigured animals. The moment Ron shows up to stop this, Scabbers reveals himself as human and triumphantly boasts that now he is the big one that he doesn´t have to fear anything from some stupid cat. He get´s mauled half to death by Crookshanks. Pettigrew is brought to a teacher, get´s thrown into Azkaban, Sirius´ name get´s cleared, everyone lives happily ever after.
