Oh man-- if anyone's right about fusion v. crossover it's you. Honestly, I'd never heard of a fusion before so I guessed!

I feel like the fusion you described is something I've already read a few times before. Reminds me of those, Harry is kidnapped by voldemort, brain-washed or brain-wiped and becomes Voldemort's hand of crime. I don't want to spoil the stories it reminded me of :)
