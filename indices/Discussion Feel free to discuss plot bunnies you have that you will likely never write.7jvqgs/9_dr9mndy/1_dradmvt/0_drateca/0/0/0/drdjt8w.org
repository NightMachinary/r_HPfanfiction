I think my definition of "Fusion" and "Crossover" is... off XD Because what you describe, I would count as the latter, what with MCU charas showing up and playing a major role.

For me, a Fusion would be if Harry where then found by a wizard (Voldemort) and used like Bucky, but without any further MCU input beyond some of the same plot points...
