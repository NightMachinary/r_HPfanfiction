Lol that's way too long of a first act. I figure we'd time jump passed the events everyone already knows via the mcu and just use them to re-frame a few emotional beats. I'm thinking we would take a few chapters for the becoming winter soldier drama, then time jump past the beginning of the winter soldier movie, re-frame an interaction with captain America, time jump to the avengers capturing him and captain America's plan to help him remember he's actually Bucky Barnes. Spend a lengthy chapter on the remembering thread, then a little time re-establishing Harry's identity / perspective on things. Then turn everything on it's head with Colin creavey and an update on the pathetic state of the wizarding world. <maybe this is actually the halfway point!> Next harry visits, learns he can't help alone, and a plan ( drama) is hatched to team up the non- technology based avengers while the tech based ones are sidelined to non-athletic roles like tech support, research and planning. Of course the whole plan goes to the crapper with magic, the wizarding world's over-involved public opinion, and unplanned encounters from old friends and mentors. Enter the third act.
