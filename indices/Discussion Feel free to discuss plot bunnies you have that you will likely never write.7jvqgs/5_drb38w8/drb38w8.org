Harry Potter awoke with a groan, forcing himself onto his hands and knees. He looked around and coughed. What had happened? The last thing he remembered, he'd fallen into the trap door Fluffy had been guarding and into a black pool, but this didn't look like the forbidden corridor at all. He coughed again, unable to catch his breath. The air seemed thick with some sort of gas or smog, and Harry struggled to breath. He tried to call out for help, but only made a gasping sound.

Suddenly, from the corner, he heard a shuffling sound.

"Hello?" Harry said, trying to push his glasses up on his forhead. Then he coughed again, the choaking red fog filling his lungs.

The shuffling sound came again, and a creature stepped into the dim red light. Harry shuffled away in panic. It had a maw full of razor sharp teeth, and four legs that seemed to be spikes. It let out a chittering sound, then charged.

Harry pressed himself against the smooth steel wall, beginning to cough and cry in panic. Just as the creature was about to reach him, the steel above Harry bent, then shattered inward, sending the creature back.

"Exarch, I heard something in here," an oddly accented voice called. "Survivor maybe, and one of those mutated ravagers."

A thing in glowing armor plate stepped through the hole it made over Harry. It had no shoes, instead standing atop of black hooves. A tail poked out from the rear of the plate armor, which was set with glowing purple crystals. The thing raised a large warhammer made of more purple crystal. "Begone, foul beast."

The spike creature let out a warbling wail, then charged the warrior. The hammer came down in a thunder of warm yellow light, crushing the chitinous armor of the beast. It fell in a pool green icor onto the ground.

The warrior turned to Harry, and the young boy almost cried out in alarm. It's face was blue, and covered with bristly black hair, as well as blue tentacles that were bound by a leather thong into a sort of beard. It's eyes glowed with an inner blue light, but they were warm and kind.

"What are you, small one?" the warrior rumbled.

Harry was too weak and out of breath to answer, and he was picked up by the warrior in strong arms. The creature hoisted Harry up through the hole, handing him off to a slimmer, more feminine blue creature who was dressed in silver robes with blue crystals sewn in. "Anchorite, this thing looks to be a child. A blood elf, perhaps?"

The female took Harry in her arms, waving a hand over him. A glowing symbol appeared on her forehead between two horns, and Harry felt warmth suffuse his body. He stopped coughing, suddenly feeling much healthier.

"Are you an elf, child?" the blue creature asked in a warm, soft voice.

"I'm a human being," Harry answered. "I'm not an elf."

"Human?" the larger male in armor asked. "Is that not the name of those strangers on the far shore of Azuremyst?"

The female set Harry down, and he found he could easily stand. He pushed his glasses up, peering at the two strange creatures.

"What are you?" he asked. "Who are you?"

"I am Vindicator Maraad of the Hand of Argus," the huge male answered, getting down on one knee to look Harry in the eye. "This is Anchorite Ysel, also of the Hand of Argus. We are draenei. Tell me, little human, how did you end up in one of the shards of the Exodar?"

"I do not know," Harry said. "I remember falling into a black pool. I was trying to stop Professor Snape from obtaining the philosopher's stone. He's an evil wizard."

"A wizard?" Maarad looked up at Ysel and frowned. "Odd."

"Vindicator!" a new voice called.

Harry gasped in amazement as another draenei rode up on what resembled a small elephant with four tusks. The rider waved to the three. “Vindicator, have you found the boy?”

Maarad stood, glancing at Harry. “Yes, Kessel. I have a boy, but how did you know this?”

“The Prophet, he sent word,” Kessel said. “He is wanted in the Exodar at once, as are you, Vindicator.”

Maarad nodded, hoisting his warhammer. “Very well. Then we must leave at once. Come, young human. It seems you have been expected.”
