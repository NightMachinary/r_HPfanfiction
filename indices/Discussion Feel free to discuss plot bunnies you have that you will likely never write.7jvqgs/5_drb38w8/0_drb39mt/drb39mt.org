The first thing Ron Weasley knew was that he was cold, and that he wasn't at Hogwarts anymore. Shivering, the young wizard sat up and looked around. Where was he? The last thing he remembered was jumping into that black pool with Harry and Hermione, but he didn't see them. He stood up, shivering almost uncontrollably. He looked around, and saw he was on a small mound of grass and rock surrounded by pine trees. The sun was setting, and a chill wind was blowing.

“Bloody fantastic,” Ron said through chattering teeth. He looked around for his wand, but he must have lost it. Where was he? He got out of the wind, finding a small cave to curl up in. He gathered some sticks and bark from the trees, but he was lost as to how to make a fire.

“Come on, come on,” Ron muttered, trying to rub sticks together like the muggles were supposed to do. “Burn! Incenda! Fire! Smoke! ARRGH!” He slammed the sticks together, and a small spark burst out.

“Reth?” the spark said.

Ron blinked, falling back on his haunches. However, as a wizard, a talking spark was not hte oddest thing he had ever seen, so he cupped it in his hands. “I don't suppose you'd mind burning this for me, would you? Please?”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark said, leaping onto the branches. Soon, Ron had a neat little fire going. Warmth filled the cave, and though he was hungry and exhausted, Ron felt pleased.

He sat in the cave for hours, listening to the calls of beasts and the wind and feeling sorry for himself.

“Thanks for the fire,” he told the little spark which was dancing in the flames. “Reth is it?”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark declared, swirling about.

“Thanks mate, but you don't know where I am, do you?”

“Aye, yer lost ya are laddie,” a female voice with a thick scottish accent.

Ron blinked at the fire. “Huh. I didn't know fires were Scottish.”

“What's a scott?” the voice said again, and Ron looked up as a short woman in leather armor with blue facepaint stepped into his little hole.

“Oh, sorry, I thought you were Reth here,” Ron said, pointing to the fire.

The little spark seemed to bow to the visitor. “Reth reth reth.”

The woman nodded, peering into the flames. “Ack, that's a right fine fire elemental ye've managed to bind there lad. The spirits told me I would find a powerful young shaman here, and looks like I have. I must admit though, I did no expect it to be a wee human.”

“Fire elemental?” Ron asked. “Shaman? I'm no shaman, I'm a wizard.”

“Oh, ye frem Dalaran are ye then? Long way from home, lad. Where are yer parents?” the woman asked.

“What's Dalaran? And I suppose mum and dad are back at the Burrow in England. We can't be far from Hogwarts though if we're still in Scotland, right?” Ron asked.

“This is no Scotland,” the woman said, stomping her foot on the earth to emphasise the point. “This here is the Hinterlands, home of the Wildhammer Clan. I'm Myra Stormborn, shaman and griffon rider of the wildhammer clan. Who are you laddie?”

“Um, Ron Weasley,” Ron said. “But you sound like a scot. Where are your parents?”

Myra laughed. “I suppose me dad's back at the Aerie caring for his forge even on a night like this. Me mums likely cookin' supper wonderin' where her daughters got off to again, even if I'm old enough to have a home of me own now. Don't ye know a dwarf when ye see one boy?”

“Um, no,” Ron admitted. “I thought dwarves lived in Scandenavia.”

“Ye have the strangest name for places boyo. Well, come on. Stormbeaks waitin' outside. Let's get ye to a proper fire and some dinner.”

Ron nodded, waving to the fire. He didn't know what was happening, but dinner sounded good. “Bye Reth, thanks for the warmth.”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark said, and hopped up into Ron's pocket. He was warm, but didn't burn Ron's clothes.

“Aye, ye'll make a mighty fine shaman with the proper trainin'” Myra said happily. “Got fire in yer blood ye do.”

“Have you seen my friends, by the way? Harry and Hermione, they're both human kids like me,” Ron said as they walked towards a large golden gryffon. He's never seen one before, but they were supposed to be nice if you'd tamed them.

“No laddie, yer the only one around. They human too?”

“Well yes,” Ron said. “What else would they be.”

“All kind o' beasties around these parts. Elves an' trolls an' mookin. Even got some dragons not to far from here.”

“Oh, my brother Charlie's a dragon tamer. Maybe they'll know where he is at the preserve,” Ron offered.

“I think yer more lost than ye might realize child,” Myra said. “Come on, let's go. We won't find yer friends standing and jawin around here.”
