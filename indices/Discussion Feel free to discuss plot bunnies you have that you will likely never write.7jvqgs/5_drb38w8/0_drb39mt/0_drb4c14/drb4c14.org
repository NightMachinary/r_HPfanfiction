“Hey, what are you doing here?”

Hermione sat bolt upright, gasping and looking around wildly. She was lying on a cold concrete floor, with flashing red lights going off all around here. “Harry, Ron, the water-” she cut herself off, peering around.

“Hey, you're not a gnome,” the voice said again. Hermione spun about to see a young girl standing beside her, dressed in overalls with a grease stained face and a wrench in one hand.

“No, I'm a girl,” Hermione said, standing up. She was just about as tall as the other girl, though the other girls brown twin ponytails stuck up well above Hermione's head. “Like you.”

“No, you look like a human,” the girl said, shaking her head. She reached out then and grabbed Hermione's left ear in one hand, rubbing it. “Yep! Not an elf, so you must be a human.”

“Ow!” Hermione protested, rubbing her sore ear. “Who are you, and why did you grab my ear?”

“I'm Kristine Lee Smallfry, though my friends call me K Lee! Why are you here in Gnomeregan human girl? And obviously, I grabbed your ear to check if it was pointed. You don't look like an elf, but you can never tell without empirical evidence.”

“I don't know why I'm in Gnomeregan,” Hermione said sulkily. “I'm supposed to be in Hogwarts helping my friends Harry and Ron stop Professor Snape from getting the Philosopher's Stone.”

“Oh, you need a philosopher's stone?” K Lee said. “Sorry, can't help you there, but I know some alchemists who might be able too! I'm just a regular gnomish engineer, here to scrounge for parts! Had to beat up a lot of troggs to get them too.”

“What's a trogg?” Hermione asked.

“You know, the big ugly things that look like a dwarf with a really bad hair day and even less hygeine?” K Lee said. “Oh, like one of those there. Watch out, that one's irradiated.”

“Urrgghh,” a very odd man said as it walked toward them. It was glowing green, and it's body was covered in hair. It looked to Hermioen sort of like a neanderthal. “Rahg? RAWWWGGHHH!”

The trogg charged, waving a club and foaming at the mouth.

“Step back human, this one's hostile!” K Lee proclaimed. She dug a gun out of her pocket, and pointed it at the charging trogg. “Taste engineering monster!”

A ray of lighting zapped out of the gun, hitting the trogg which turned into a glowing green chipmunk. The chipmunk blinked, squeaked, and ran away.

“Yes!” K Lee cheered. “The Critter Maker 3000 works! Well, most of the time, anyway. Field tests show about a 70% success rate.”

“What happens when it doesn't work?” Hermione asked curiously.

“Oh, you explode. Or they do. Very messy. I'm still working out the kinks, but that's gnomish engineering for you! A dash of magic with a hefty dose of SCIENCE! Together, those two great forces of the universe can do anything!”

“Wow.” Hermione looked around, confused. “Say, do you know where Hogwarts is? I need to find my friends and stop Snape from getting the Philosopher's stone.”

“Oh don't worry about that,” K Lee said. “We can just make a new one if he steals it. My friend Tally Berryfizz can make you another one if that guy steals yours. The ingredients are a bit rare, but I'm an expert at finding rare ingredients! Why, I was thinking of going through the Dark Portal to outland to try some of those fascinating new materials for my inventions. Say, maybe that's where Hogwarts is! You could come with me. I could use a new lab assistant, mine left after I accidentally turned him into a critter once. He got better, but he had no sense of adventure. Dwarves. What can you do?”

“Well if it's not too much trouble,” Hermione said. “I would like to learn more about this magical engineering. They told me you couldn't mix science and magic, but if you can that would be extraordinary. Plus, I really do want to get back to school, or my grades will be dreadful.”

“I can help you with your grades! I was stop of my class in Arcane Theory and Exposiveering 303. I might not look it, but in addition to being an excellent engineer, I'm also a powerful mage!”

“Is that like being a witch?” Hermione asked.

“Oh no, I think that's more like being a warlock,” K Lee said. “My friend Wilfred Fizzlebang knows all about that. I think I have a book on Summoning Demons for Beginners back in my wagon though. Come on, I'll show you! I could use some imp blood for my latest batch of rockets anyway.”

Hermione followed after K Lee, happy to be on her way back to Hogwarts and her friends. If she could get another Philospher's Stone along the way, that would be even better.
