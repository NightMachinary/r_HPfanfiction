HP as never-aging master of death. RW/HG are in their early one-hundreds after long, happy lives. HP, with the youth of his teens, cares for what remains of the geriatric golden trio before they pass. HP/GW (GW has already passed and they could never have kids). Loyal and honorable to the very end, HP has taken on the role of caretaker for his friends in their last two decades as their health failed, and their kids started families of their own. The aging golden trio lives together in a cabin in the Forest of Dean, where they spent the adventures of their youth, and one quiet afternoon, HP guides them into the warm arms of death before moving on himself.
