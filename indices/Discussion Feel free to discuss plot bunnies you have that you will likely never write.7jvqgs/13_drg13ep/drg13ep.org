Rebirth of magic

It started about 5 years ago, just with the two of them. They found each other in the London Library of all places. A perfectly normal place to spend the day for her. But for him, it was just a warm place among many to pass a hard winter's afternoon. She was at 2nd year Uni, narrowing down some research for a paper on epigenetic inheritence when something gave her pause. She looked up to find a boy staring at her. A boy with vivid green eyes. He looked like a vagabond, unclean and uncouth. But he looked comfortable, not diseased or starving, just poor. One of her father's many fond quotes came to her: "In a country well goverend, poverty is something to be ashamed of". And so with an odd feeling at the back of her mind, and charity at the front of it, she offered him a meal. Thus a friendship was born.

Over time, through shared lunches, and walks in the parks and museums of Greater London, they came to share their own stories. Him, a runaway and street urchin; her, a lonely student. But for all that time, all those walks, they never mentioned to each other (who would believe anyway?) all the little things they had in common. One early spring morning, everything changed.

They were walking along aimlessly, debating the merits of various systems of government, when something gave them both pause. The row of shops along the side were a bit run down, but quite normal, until they came across what could only be described as the scene of a bombing. The site appeared abandonded, with only the largest bits of wreckage untouched by time. They looked around and noticed that the other people on the street refused to even look at the destruction, and simply gave the area a wide berth. For them the pull was undeniable, and they entered the wreck of what looked like an old tavern. It looked like the bomb blast had come from the rear of the building, where an oddly bright amount of light was emanating. Neither even thought of leaving, but instead slowly walked toward the back of the room, and stepped through a hole in the wall, into another world.

Much like the bar, the alley they found themselves in looked long abandoned. It showed clear signs of some forgotten battle. But the area felt crisp... fresh. The very air hummed with energy. "What is this place? And where are all the people?" she asked.

...

Story contines with them finding Flourish and Blots and a shared realization of accidental magic in their lives. In one of the books, Harry finds out some of his family history. Hermione finds a newspaper with a /War with the Goblins/ headline where the article mentions unspeakables working on a "final solution" to tame the goblins. Harry and Hermione would have been around 6 when it happened. They pick up wands, learn some magic, and eventually find a few other muggleborn. At some point, they travel to Scotland and find the ruins of the school. Correspondence in the headmasters office indicates an attempt to strip the magic from the Goblins. It would appear the resulting attempt did something to the humans instead.

After a rebuilding montage, they find the children of the magicals, the oldest of whom was 6 when the calamity happened and magic disappeared from their lives. Only in the last year or so has magic begun to return, but the magicals are equally (if not more so) clueless when it comes to actually using magic. They lived a lord of the flies like existence under the heavy hand of the pure blood children. The pure bloods blame the muggles and muggleborn for the calamity. A war ensues.
