After I am done with my Fight For Rights story I would like to write an idea I have about Harry dying from the Killing Curse in the forest at the end of Deathly Hallows and then going to King's Cross and getting a choice to "Go on or go back," but when he chooses to go back he gets reincarnated into a newborn witch! :) And then he has to learn to accept and cope with growing up all over again, and he has to deal with the struggles of gender dysphoria, and then he goes to hogwarts with ron and hermione's and draco's kids, and then a new threat to the magical world shows up and he has to fight to save it again. :) Also I want to make Voldemort come back way later and that way he and Harry will be almost on equal footing since Harry will have two lives of magic experience when they start fighting again.

Also yes the battle of hogwarts would go different, with Voldemort losing his body again and being a helpless spirit for a decade or two again. :)
