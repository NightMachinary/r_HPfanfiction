The spell that kills Luna Lovegood's mother also winds up killing her father. Luna is either taken in by the Weasleys or the Diggorys--just imagine little Luna wearing a Weasley sweater or else tagging along after Cedric.

Dudley, somehow, is blasted back in time and winds up trying to set things right and save the world from a Bad Future. Only problem is, he has no clue what's actually supposed to happen, and his primary motivation is trying to reconcile with Harry.
