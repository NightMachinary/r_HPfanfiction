The following is a summary on a story I started on FF.net (it's still posted there) but have not completed and will not complete: Following Nagini's attack on Mr. Weasley, Harry and Hermione stay at Hogwarts over winter break during their fifth year and learn Occlumency together. However, as their relationship grows, an intricate web of lies and deceit is unearthed concerning the Order of the Phoenix and Harry's quest in defeating Voldemort.
