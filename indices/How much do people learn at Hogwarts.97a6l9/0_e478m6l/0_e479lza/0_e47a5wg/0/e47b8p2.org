Okay, I've been under the impression that once something was Vanished, it was gone gone gone, but it seems I was wrong. I find that strangely reassuring.

Now, since it does seem that it's possible to Vanish humans ... what sort of state are they in while Vanished? Is it a state of suspended animation? This is very like the old fairy mound legends: Imagine if Fred were to Vanish George as a prank and for reasons, doesn't un-Vanish him for ten years. What state is George in? Is he still the same age, say 15, as he was when he was Vanished? Has he aged? If time did pass for him, was he conscious? If he was conscious, what about his body functions? Food, drink, waste elimination?

This is part of what I find a bit frustrating about writing in the HP world. There's so many things that can be resolved by "a wizard did it". Why is Wizarding society not completely off the rails? You can pretty much steal anything at will, kill anyone who sees you and hide the body, modify memories (the ultimate in gaslighting) and on and on. You don't need Voldemort--all you need is a bored teenager on Saturday night.
