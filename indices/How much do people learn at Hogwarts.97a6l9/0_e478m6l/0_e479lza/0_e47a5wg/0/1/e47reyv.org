My headcanon is that the "reality" of something that's been vanished slowly starts to spread out/break apart. So someone could be vanished and conjured (with much difficulty), but the longer that something has been vanished, the tougher it can be to conjure it, and this is made exponentially more difficult if it's something living. At some point, a living thing that's been vanished reaches a state of non-being that's so metaphysically "spread out" that it can't be conjured.
