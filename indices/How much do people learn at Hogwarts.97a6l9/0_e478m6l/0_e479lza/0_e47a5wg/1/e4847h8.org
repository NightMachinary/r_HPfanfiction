About Dumbledore conjuring vanished stuff rather than summoning non-vanished objects.

  “We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said, pulling out his wand again. “I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case.” Harry extracted his Cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.

The fact that Harrys stuff was supposed to be already waiting at the Weasleys after Dumbledore made it go poof, implies that it was sent somewhere via apparition.

  Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.

McG summoned stuff and it appears to have been teleported to her.

Also the food for meals is teleported from the kitchens.

As to the security issue, I would imagine that there are anti-summoning spells. In books there are a few enchanted objects that are said to have anti-jinxes so it's definitely possible to counter a certain spell. Perhaps not for every object but in an area. Also normal summoning is probably almost as easy for stealing as teleport summoning, considering that objects can be summoned from decent distances.
