I think you're focusing too much on the case studies students use to practice and missing the fact that these are transferable skills. When students learn to transfigure a teapot into a turtle, that's not all they're learning. They're learning to transfigure objects into animals in general, and the turtle transformation is just practice.

This pedagogy is explicitly recognised with respect to Vanishing, where McGonagall has them start in invertebrates at the start of fifth year:

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.”

  She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing (OotP Chapter 13)

They then advance to vertebrates later in the year:

#+begin_quote
  “As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one” (OotP Chapter 15)
#+end_quote

So being able to vanish one invertebrate is considered good practice for vanishing invertebrates in general, and the same for the more complex vertebrates.

To answer your question with the above in mind, what do students learn in Transfiguration over the course of Hogwarts?

The curriculum is as follows:

- Turning inanimate objects into other inanimate objects in first year (match into needle in PS Chapter 8),

- Turning animals into objects from the end of first year (mouse into a snuff box in PS Chapter 16), continuing in second year (beetle into button in CoS Chapter 6);

- Turning objects into animals in third year (teapot into a tortoise in PoA Chapter 16);

- Turning animals into other animals in fourth year (guinea fowl into guinea pigs in GoF Chapter 22), as well as switching spells (GoF Chapter 20);

- Learning Vanishing in fifth year, as above;

- Learning Human Transfiguration in sixth year (HBP Chapter 15);

- Learning Conjuration in seventh year (from the fact that McGonagall refers to Conjuration as N.E.W.T. level in OotP Chapter 13, combined with the fact that we know it is not in sixth year).

So students pretty much learn how to turn anything into anything else (in theory; in practice must students suck at Transfiguration because it's so hard).

There are however a few items which are either not covered, or are covered but we haven't seen:

- Untransfiguration

- Triggered transfigurations (e.g. Fred and George's fake wands)

- Transfiguration fields (e.g Dumbledore's age line which put a transfiguration over an area)

- Transfiguration animation (as opposed to animation in Charms, which is covered)

I imagine a similar situation holds in Charms: they practice just a small number of Charms, but the principles transfer, meaning that they are able to pick up new Charms quickly on the basis of what they have already learnt. Charms however is a much broader field so I imagine it's less transferable than Transfiguration.

Interestingly, this shows why Hermione was right about the HBP potion book: Harry was learning how to make specific potions well, but because he didn't understand what he was doing, he wasn't actually increasing his ability with potions.
