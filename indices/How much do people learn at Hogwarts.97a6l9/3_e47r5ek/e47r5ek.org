I think of it as an analog to real life- you never really explicitly learn personal finance in school, but you do learn the basic arithmetic and algebraic skills needed for it. And simple specific topics (i.e. the geometry of triangles in real life) can easily take up to a month of study, so there must be more that they learn about spells than just their magic and applications. Taure already spoke to this, but it's mentioned that there are entire books written on single spells, so there's likely some form of general magical theory that students are learning in addition to the active practice that they do in class. Moreover, you learn stuff in school that isn't intended to be useful in the long-term, but is more important for training you to think and communicate in a certain manner, hence all the essays we see in canon.

More broadly, the main point of school is to give you a baseline from which you can develop further skills. It also functions to providing structure and acting as an agent of socialization, teaching you about cultural norms and how to interact with people. Hogwarts doesn't need to add Spell Creation or whatever to make the curriculum more difficult.

The amount of time they're in school may also a factor. In boarding schools especially, a big part of the learning goals deal with how students adjust to life outside the classroom and giving them the freedom+additional time to pursue their own interests.

It's also not clear what additional material exists for study, beyond accumulate life experiences - Grindelwald is mentioned to have traveled the world on a journey for powerful magic, Voldemort presumably did the same after his brief stint at Borgin and Burke's after being rejected (but considering that he did apply for the Defense position straight out of Hogwarts, it clearly wasn't completely unexpected for a talented student to almost immediately transition to such a role), and Dumbledore either trained under or worked with Nicolas Flamel at some point. OTOH Snape manages to become the Potions Professor just a few years out of school, presumably with little to no extra training beyond what he studied at Hogwarts.
