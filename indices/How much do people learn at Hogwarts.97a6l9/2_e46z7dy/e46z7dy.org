That seems a bit much, although it might be accurate for later schooling (I can see NEWT student learning one a week). It's plausible that a lot of the spells/potions they learn at Hogwarts are sufficient for everyday life/jobs, with supplementary learning done by themselves.

There is likely many books that can be bought on household spells and healing spells. I believe Molly referred to one.
