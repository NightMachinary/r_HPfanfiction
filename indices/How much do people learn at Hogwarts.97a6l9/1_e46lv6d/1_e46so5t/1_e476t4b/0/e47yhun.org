I mean the books, not the movies. Harry is good enough, but we rarely see him use a good spell on his own. This includes Ron too. It always seems like only Hermione knows anything. I know we're supposed to assume that Harry and Ron are good too, but it would've been nice if they had demonstrated their abilities without Hermione's aid.
