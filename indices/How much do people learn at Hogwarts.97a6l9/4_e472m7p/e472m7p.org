Defense involves both spellwork and creatures, so it's not going to be a spell every class session.

I'd do it as: you start out with only a few spells learned in the first year, because you're getting used to using magic and you're still learning the base concepts. By the end of fifth year, you can learn a spell in a minute from a written description. At NEWT level, you get a spell list at the beginning of the year, and you're expected to know it all by the end. Classes at that level are divided between theory and open practice, where you can get help with whatever spells you're having trouble with.

For household charms, you just grab a copy of /Mrs Fitzmilton's Practical Guide for the Modern Homeowner/. Minor healing charms are probably part of Defense, while more complex stuff is in post-Hogwarts studies.

Herbology is very hands-on. I'd expect students to care for a number of plants, tending all of them each class session.
