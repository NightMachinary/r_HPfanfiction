I kinda like *I Am Lord Voldemort? by Spectralroses* but the Author "nerfed" Riddle's potential due to the soul switch and it's a bit frustrating because the MC second guess his every moves thinking his death eaters will try to betray him while we clearly know that as of 1981 they were all beaten into submission already.
