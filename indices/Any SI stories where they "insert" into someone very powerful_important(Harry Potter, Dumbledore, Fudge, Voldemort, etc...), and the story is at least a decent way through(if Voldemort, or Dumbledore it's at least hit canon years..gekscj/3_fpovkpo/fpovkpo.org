Right people with power can't always go together!!!! Like Harry/ Voldemort just NO! The whole point of the fricking series was that Harry would defeat Voldemort not that they would develop a relationship! Like come on! I also don't get Harry/ Fudge because the whole point of Order of the Phoenix was that Harry and Dumbldore would argue and disagree with him and if you want Dumbldore to be gay with a wizard with alot of power it's Gallerd Grindelwald! Like do you get it!? Well thank you for reading my rant that was about 5 ! So ya LOL ðŸ˜… well hope you understand my opinion you can think differently idc.
