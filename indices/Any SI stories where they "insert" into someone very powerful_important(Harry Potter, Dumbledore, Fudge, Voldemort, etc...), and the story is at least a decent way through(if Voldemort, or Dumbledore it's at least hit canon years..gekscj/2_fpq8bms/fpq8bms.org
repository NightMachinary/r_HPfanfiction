Interesting... I have amused myself previously by writing a bit of a "to-do" list for if I dropped into Harry, Ron, or Draco in the summer before 1st year (currently sitting as a google doc, not currently shared or posted anywhere or anything; part of me almost wishes for the 3rd just for the simplicity of raising fewer alarm bells if I AK the troll while also having access to $, especially with what I'd presume to be risks of scarcrux complications if Harry used the AK while it was still in there).

Here's a thought: roll a d10 (or use [[https://random.org][random.org]] and add whatever to 1990) to determine which year of the 90's you land in (0/10 can result in either 2000 or 1990 if you're using a die, just choose in advance), and create a list of 100 characters who're all alive at the start of the decade and roll percentile (or range 1-100) to determine who you land in. If you get an invalid result (such as Sirius Black in 1998) then either reroll or figure out the AU.
