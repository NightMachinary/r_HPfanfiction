Mongoose always works well for symbolism in destroying Voldemort.

House loyalty and going big and loud can always give you a lion, though its harder to play of as anything other than OP!Harry has to have the best of everything.

Birds are often the best bet. They emphasize an association with both freedom and captivity, the caged bird, etc (cupboard, smallest bedroom, prophecy, etc). Flight also works well in general for Harry.

More "common" birds are good choices, Tawny Owl, Wren, etc. Fitting with Harry's desire to be "Just Harry"

Buzzards double up quite well as the most common bird of prey in the UK that is also known for targeting the adder population.

Magpie are very intelligent birds,can sense danger and are known to become secretive when they do sense danger. They also like shiny objects like a certain boy who on multiple occasions had to be prevented from buying solid gold school supplies.
