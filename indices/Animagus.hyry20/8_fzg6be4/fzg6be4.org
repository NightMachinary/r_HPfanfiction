is harry very socially isolated by his own doing? > non-social animal

is harry very opposed to any form of intense attention? > skew towards nocturnal as well as on the smaller size

is harry most happy on the move or at home?> wide range or warren builder

is Harry averse to conflict> non-prey animal

is harry very curious > skew to animals better known for intelligence/scavengers

it really just depends on what traits your harry has.

also harry has really an almost unique predisposition towards a flying animal due to his severe upbringing and how flight has truly become something he is good at based on his own merits.

that being said though really take a look if you are pushing harry into a bird for what his personality would suggest or just for the needs of the story.

it could have been very easily that harry would have been a very much an agoraphobic person based on having felt safety in his cupboard as opposed to the wider home.

harry also having very little use for a home and instead living with his people might be more of a nomadic animal as opposed to one that keeps a permanent nest.
