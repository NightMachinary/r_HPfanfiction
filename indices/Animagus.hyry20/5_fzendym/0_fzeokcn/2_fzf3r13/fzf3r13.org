It's not guaranteed, but [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Animagus][according to Harry Potter Wiki]] it's fairly likely that both forms are determined by the same traits - the only real evidence either way is McGonagall, who has both a cat Animagus and a cat Patronus.

Notably, Patronus forms are subject to change if the caster is subject to emotional upheaval, such as falling strongly in love - Tonks's Patronus pre-Lupin was a jackrabbit, it turned into a wolf when she and Remus got together.
