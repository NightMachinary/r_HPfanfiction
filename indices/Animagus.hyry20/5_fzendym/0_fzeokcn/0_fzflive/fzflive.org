I think it might be interview, twitter , or Pottermore canon. I'm not a fan of it though. I think it works better to have them separate.

The animagus form is the symbolic and animalistic form of the wizard themselves. Their personality and characteristics given the shape of an animal.

The patronus takes the form of the symbolic and animalistic form of the joy that creates the patronus.

Harry's patronus memories are based on his feelings on family, both found family and the Potters, tied up in his similarities to his father and his own self confidence, giving you the proud stag. It's possible that his patronus could still have been a stag if James had not been a stag animagus, as much of the symbolism still fits, but the connection to his father accounts for the shape.

Sirius then, finds joy in being Padfoot, in his time with his friends before everything went to shit. It makes perfect sense that his patronus would take the same form as his animagus.

Severus is more interesting. We have no indication that Lily had an animagus form, but its clear that his patronus is a representation of his feelings for Lily. I'd argue that Lily's patronus was also a Doe, and for similar reasons as Severuses. Lily most likely powered her patronus via happy memories regarding her marriage. Her patronus shaping to match James. Severus, who had little happiness in his life other than the times spent with Lily, was never able to separate those memories from the fact that she had chosen James over him, in no part due to his own actions, and so his memories of her were turned by that as well, giving him the Doe too.

​

I'd imagine that its not singular events of emotional upheaval that change patronus forms, but changes in the source memory. (In the case of James and Lily, I'd imagine that if James started using memories of Lily instead of his time with his friends to power his patronus, that it would likely self reinforce as a stag given Lily's doe.

​

A neat thought is that if two animagi meet and fall in love without showing each other their animagus forms, that their respective patronus would still change to match their lovers animagus, as the characteristics for ones patronus would be the same for the others animagus.

​

Anyway, just a bunch of headcanon to consider.
