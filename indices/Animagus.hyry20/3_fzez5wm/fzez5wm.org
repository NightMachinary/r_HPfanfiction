As someone else already commented if freedom and flight are big components then you should lean towards a bird. Then you may want to consider a magical bird. Thanks to his lightning bolt you may want to have him be a thunderbird or stormcrow. Of course, like a few other fics you may go for dragon kin so either a dragon or wyvern. Or go to town and have Harry have multiple forms one mundane one magical etc. It really depends on where you want your fic to go and how Harry's forms either helps explain things about Harry's character of helps Harry accomplish the tasks you set up for him.
