It mostly depends on how your story characterises him.

Does he fly a lot? Is he super protective? Is he Slytherin or Gryffindor? Is he smart, or is he athletic? Is he especially loyal?

As clich√© as it sounds, give me a list of character traits, hobbies, favourite animal, etc. or some lines from your story and I can give you some idea of what he would be.

(Or just go with the tried and true bird-of-some-kind/snake/stag/dog/wolf.)
