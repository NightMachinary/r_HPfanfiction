Alright, I'm going to activate over-analysis mode for a moment.

Freedom and flight are closely tied together symbolically, so that puts my starting point at birds. From there, we add the craftiness - which to me would mean a /nocturnal/ bird, given the association between secrets/plotting and night-time. Wisdom plus nocturnal bird points firmly towards an owl of some kind.

Add the temper/strong will, and that would put him as one of the more territorial/aggressive species of owl. Did you know that Snowy Owls are quite territorial, as well as hunting aggressively?

Not to mention, given Hedwig, it'd be /amazingly/ poetic. It's almost like it's made to be.
