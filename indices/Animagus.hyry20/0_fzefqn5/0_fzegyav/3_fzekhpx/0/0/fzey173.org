Elephants have been known to lose their tempers, especially at poachers. Same for gorillas. Gorillas actually have quite short tempers. Some great cats are just assholes and easily angered, like house cats. Crows have been shown to hold intergenerational grudges, attacking a man wearing the same mask as a man who messed with them, as part of an experiment, 20 years later, long after the first generation had died off. Honey badgers are notoriously vicious and mean tempered. So are cassowaries.
