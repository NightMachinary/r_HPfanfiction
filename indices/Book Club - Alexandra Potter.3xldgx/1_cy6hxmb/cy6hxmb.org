  Alexandra Potter. The first year is complete but I'm not happy with the story. I started a rewrite, which can be found in DLP's WBA, but mid-way through the rewrite I realised it was a half-measure so am now rewriting the rewrite. It's so significant as to almost be a completely different story. Changes include: reducing AU elements, structuring and pacing the story properly with a proper plotline instead of just drama, lightening the tone with more friendship and Hogwarts stuff and less plotting and bullying, making Alex and the other kids more likeable, spreading out the Daphne plot over several years. A strong magic focus will remain, but I will attempt to show magic in use instead of conveying it through textbook passages.

You can kinda deduce what I think of the fic from that segment of my profile.

There are two criticisms of the fic I still find annoying though:

1. The depiction of children as mean and vulgar. If anything I understated it. I can understand this making people not want to read (due to lack of sympathy for the characters) but I fundamentally disagree with criticism calling it unrealistic.

2. The amount of discussion of magic. If you go through the fic as a whole, the quantity of magic discussion isn't all that great as a proportion of the total fic (though, admittedly, it is front-loaded). A far better criticism is the format of the magic sections. The textbook stuff was an experiment in authenticity but it doesn't work as a story element.
