Never looked at book club before, but assume there isn't any sort of criteria (I read it a while ago).

I for one liked it. I remember liking some of the world building and characterization of Alexandra and of Dumbledore. Hermione was no problem and felt realistic given the other changes from what I recall. It was heavy on spell theory but then that interests me, if well thought out. Anyway I remember wanting more, so it did something right.
