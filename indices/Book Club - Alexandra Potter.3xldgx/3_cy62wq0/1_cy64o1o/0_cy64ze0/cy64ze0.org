How is that different than canon in regards to DADA? Harry outscored Hermione on his DADA O.W.L. and that didn't upset her. Even as far back as third year, he was able to complete Lupin's obstacle course final exam while Hermione - run ragged by the Time Turner - had to stop because she thought the boggart/McGonagall was real. Again, no mention of Hermione being angry because Harry was more competent than her in a subject. We also have Hermione stating at the end of PS that she values "friendship and bravery" far more than "books and cleverness." JKR cheated her own narrative in HBP by suddenly deciding that Hermione would get upset over Harry's successes with Snape's potions book.
