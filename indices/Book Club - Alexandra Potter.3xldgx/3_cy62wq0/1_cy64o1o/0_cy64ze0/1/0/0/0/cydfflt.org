  wouldn't she rather have all the information?

Sure, and this facet of her character causes Hermione's actions in HBP make even less sense. The same girl who risked a basilisk-inhabited castle to check on a hunch blindly decided on the identity of the eponymous Half Blood Prince, only deciding to discover the truth much later. In my opinion, it's another case of JKR cheating her own narrative.

It's certainly not the first time she's sacrificed consistency in her characters' personality traits in favour of holding back a secret until the final confrontation. The Firebolt incident in PoA was crafted to drive a wedge between Hermione and Harry/Ron so that her knowledge of Lupin's lycanthropy wouldn't be revealed until the scene in the Shrieking Shack. Ron's jealousy in GoF was likely made to delay knowledge of the dragons, thereby giving Harry less time to devise a strategy (Ron eventually did tell Harry, but I'd be willing to bet that Charlie told his brother about the nature of the First Task). Obviously things worked out alright with WereLupin and the Dragon, but in the process JKR confused angst with character development.
