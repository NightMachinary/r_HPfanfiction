You make valid points, but I still think the hermione of HBP would be mad at harry for cheating, but I would also think that hermione of HBP would be able find out who the HBP really was, unless snape deleted all evidence? idk

A better plot point for the book would have been for them to study it and why the things in the book were better to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of herbology and potions.
