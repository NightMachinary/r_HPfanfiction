See, this is where I think she would definitely not do this. To someone like hermione, who ALWAYS seems to have the answer to everything (if she doesnt she looks it up), why would she just want answers; wouldn't she rather have all the information?

kinda rant: there are two types of smart people in this regard: those that try and spend an hour cheating on an assignment (to get it done as soon as possible) or those that take the extra time to do the material, the extended reading, and some extra just to make sure they got everything covered. Hermione comes off as the second. I feel as though Hermione is passionate about eizardry and it wouldnt make sense for her to be obsessive over what might be on the test but rather filling her own curiosity of magic. Maybe thats just me bleeding through.\\
I agree with the ron point and worldbuilding.
