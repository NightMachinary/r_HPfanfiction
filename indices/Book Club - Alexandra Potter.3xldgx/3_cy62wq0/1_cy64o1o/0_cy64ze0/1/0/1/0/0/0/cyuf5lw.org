  Heck, her whole thing with Lockhart was that books said stuff and thus books knew better than people.

Good point, but there is some additional subtext. We know that even before the first lesson, Hermione had already outlined her DADA schedule in little hearts, so that points to a more physical crush to me. He's described as being quite handsome in the books. Even Mrs. Weasley fusses with her hair and acts a bit strangely before the family visits him in Flourish & Blotts. Also, during that first DADA class Lockhart praises Hermione extensively for her in-depth knowledge of his personal preferences and biographical minutiae. Even though Harry and Ron can tell the professor is a fraud, Hermione has just had the wizard she fancies deliver one of her primary motivators - praise. I think that played a larger role in her vitriolic defence of the fop than the fact that he was an author. But you're certainly correct that this was an important contributing factor.

  Madame Rowling would have been better off playing a repeat of what Hermione did with the Firebolt there

Smart idea. It certainly would have been more interesting.
