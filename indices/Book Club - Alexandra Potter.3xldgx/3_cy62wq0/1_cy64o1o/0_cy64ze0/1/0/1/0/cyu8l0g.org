  I mean, isn't it a rather important point of her starting characterisation, that she was devouring all the books she could find for knowledge which either was caused by or did cause her to be so distanced from her peers that she didn't even try to to associate with them anymore?

That's quite a leap. Since the series is almost exclusively told through Harry's POV, we don't know enough about her early characterization to make that call. We know that she loves learning, is highly motivated by praise, and that she doesn't make a very good impression on Harry through her brash display of knowledge about his past on the train and her seeming omniscience in the first Potions class. Anything beyond that is speculation, but I can see where you're coming from.

At the very first Welcoming Feast, Hermione wasted no time in talking with Percy Weasley about Transfiguration. He was describing the nature of their initial lessons but our knowledge of that conversation was abruptly ended because Harry was tired from overeating. Sounds to me like she was making early inroads with another student who valued education. To say that she relied on books alone isn't accurate.

  Not to mention that it happening after the events of the fifth book, where she pretty much challenged an authority figure because of a book (and the whole course too) sucking ... yeah, not the best idea.

Yes, her blind faith in the authority of the book's original author seems quite strange. Despite being so highly motivated by praise, she has a rather long history of flouting authority. She lit a professor's robes on fire because she thought they /might/ be harming her friend.
