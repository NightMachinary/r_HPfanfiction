While I do agree that the plot with the book was ... less than well done, I think Hermione actually wouldn't pester the older students for notes.

I mean, isn't it a rather important point of her starting characterisation, that she was devouring all the books she could find for knowledge which either was caused by or did cause her to be so distanced from her peers that she didn't even try to to associate with them anymore? And after her rescue from the troll she might have, only with the house thing and with gryffindors being mostly less than stellar academically (as far as we know, the only ones serious enough to actually be a reliable source of information probably are all serious enough not to make notes in the books), she still had to rely on books.

That being said, the plot with the book might have been less annoying as far as Hermione's part in it went had we actually ever gotten any signs of her thinking that relying on information nor originally in books was cheating and that this, by default, made it very bad because cheating was “Very Bad™”; but we didn't, for all the times when a certain other character pretty much copied another character's notes and Hermione didn't really care outside of just inserting an idle comment about how they probably shouldn't be doing that. Not to mention that it happening after the events of the fifth book, where she pretty much challenged an authority figure because of a book (and the whole course too) sucking ... yeah, not the best idea.
