  At the very first Welcoming Feast, Hermione wasted no time in talking with Percy Weasley about Transifiguration. He was describing the nature of their initial lessons but our knowledge of that conversation was abruptly ended because Harry was tired from overeating. Sounds to me like she was making early inroads with another student who valued education. To say that she relied on books alone isn't accurate.

Hmm, yes, that's true. On the other hand, though, I count Percy as one of those who are serious and could help her with it but also too serious to make notes on margins in books rather than take what the books say as some sort of holy truth. So not relying on books only but still doing it ... kind of.

I mean, yeah, I did phrase it poorly. What I meant to say was that I think that though Hermione wouldn't shy away from getting knowledge from other people (in addition to books) when she can, limited opportunities or not, I think with most people she would take what the book says above what they would, and with the few people who are serious enough for her to take them as bigger authorities with the subject than the books those people are way too likely to be people like Percy and her who are also the same; thus, any knowledge gained would most likely just be book knowledge but gained without reading the book. Heck, her whole thing with Lockhart was that books said stuff and thus books knew better than people.

Though, of course, I might be taking it wrong, and regardless of whether I do or not it's clear that she is becoming more rebellious with age---as you mentioned---so the sixth book's thing is inexcusable in that regard. Madame Rowling would have been better off playing a repeat of what Hermione did with the Firebolt there, with Hermione being conflicted but thinking that the situation might be dangerous and swinging between her rebelliousness (from what happened the previous year) and her faith in authority (because the book in the second year was bad and all the books in Sirius's library were so maybe that one, too, is dangerous), and with the Prince's spell being something that she'd mark for later study so as to know what it does and repeat in her mind so as not for forget and then use on Malfoy by accident rather than with Harry doing it “just because”, and with her getting angry not at Harry but at herself because she could take from the book just as Harry does but simply does not allow herself to and with every one of Harry's successes coming from the book it reminds her that she too could have but did not.
