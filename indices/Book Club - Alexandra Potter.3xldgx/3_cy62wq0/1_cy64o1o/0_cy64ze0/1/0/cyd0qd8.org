I'd be absolutely amazed to learn that the Hermione from PS to OOtP never pestered any of the older students for old notes, studying tips, and even recollections about potential exam questions. For her to get upset at Harry for using another student's notes feels hypocritical. The entire potions incident feels like yet another hastily added source of angst reminiscent of the Firebolt in PA and Ron's jealousy in GoF. I'd much rather have had an equivalent amount of exposition on N.E.W.T. preparation, possible magical career paths, intense cramming on ways to defeat Voldemort, or a hundred other scenarios rather than 'two of the main characters are fighting a cold war because reasons.'
