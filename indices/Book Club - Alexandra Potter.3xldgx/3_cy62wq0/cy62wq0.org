Not much.

It's an empty story that mostly exists to serve as a forum for the author's views on magic, makes an attempt to lessen the menacing nature of the canon pureblood ideology, and tests the reader's patience with depictions of the average level of carnal knowledge possessed by adolescents. If I wanted to suffer through such blatant author tract, I'd read HPMoR.

Normally, I'd give the author a pass on /all/ of this as it's an AU and he/she can do whatever they want, but I found the characters to be abhorrent. But this is Harry Potter fanfiction and there are a million different tastes. Even if I didn't like it, I'm confident that others will find it enjoyable.

That being said, I feel the need to say a word about the characterisations. The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable throughout the story.

I judge characters on three criteria:

1. Do their motivations adequately inform the reader of their likely course of action when presented with a choice? Does the character exhibit sufficient agency to act on their decision?

2. Do these choices gel with their motivations? With their stated or inferred values system?

3. Do the consequences of those choices make sense within the larger narrative and does the character receive sufficient praise/hostility as a result from others?

The author has done an excellent job with the first two, but the extremely uneven fallout from the protagonist's poor decisions strains credulity. As best I can tell, this is a weak attempt to engender the reader's sympathy/antipathy towards the protagonist.

I didn't recognise Hermione as bearing any resemblance to her canon counterpart and feel that her role would best be served by an original character. Gone is the girl who stopped showing off after the first Halloween, complimented Harry at the end of PS, and generally made life /easier/ for our favourite Half Blood. Instead we're left with a wench with extreme emotional fragility. She seems to only exist to be an ineffectual foil to the protagonist's academic standing. In the final chapter, the two declare a 'truce,' which is somehow supposed to excuse the bad behaviour of both the protagonist and Hermione-in-name-only through several earlier chapters.

The most obvious rebuttal to this is the cynic's claim that people aren't always saints and it's unrealistic for a protagonist to behave as selflessly as the canon Harry and Hermione do. That's certainly true, but Harry's inherent goodness and charm and Hermione's bravery and empathy are what draws readers to his story. These characters have none of those qualities and the story suffers for it.
