  The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable throughout the story.

This is my biggest beef with the story. I can sit through (or rather, skim through) ridiculously long descriptions of someone's idea of what magic is and/or how magic should behave, but if I hate the main character what the fuck is the point of me reading about them? I started - and stopped - reading AP about four times before I finally finished what was posted because of this. I'm sorry, but if I can't find one redeeming quality in a character what is the point in me reading it? It's the same problem I have with the Alexandra Quick series, actually - both Alexandra's are just AWFUL to the point where I felt like I was watching Seinfeld and it was just nothing but George Costanza being a moronic dickhead for hours and hours and hours and I just keep cringing and hoping at some point, Kramer will show up and provide some levity and let me stop being painfully embarrassed on behalf of the character.
