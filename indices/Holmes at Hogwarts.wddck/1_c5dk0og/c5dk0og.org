Note: I'm a Sherlock fangirl, so these are all based on Sherlock (BBC). If you wanted ACD Holmes, they are probably not exactly what you're looking for.

[[http://writingispurdy.livejournal.com/14958.html][The Magic of Deduction]]: Follow John and Sherlock through their seven years at Hogwarts. With lots of Sherlock-characters.

[[http://rachelindeed.livejournal.com/10054.html][The Almost Empty House]]: In my opinion better than The Magic of Deduction, but, yeah, basically the same summary. Shorter, though.

[[http://pandarus.dreamwidth.org/354061.html][The Case of the Unwelcome Owl]]: Where Sherlock /didn't/ go to Hogwarts, but is Luna's cousin. (And that is almost as good, isn't it?)
