Sherlock Holmes is not a student at Hogwarts in this one, but this is a great Holmes/HP crossover. There is at least one sequel you can find on the author's page. Not the current Sherlock set in modern times, alas, but based on the literary Sherlock Holmes, still awesome, so it involves a wee bit of time travel.
