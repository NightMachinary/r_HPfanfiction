Not sure if you've read these, but here are my top few. In order, except for the first three, which are all equal contenders.

1. Stately Homes of Wiltshire: this is such a lovely, heart-warming 'fic full of very sweet Harry/Draco moments. It's quite funny, but mostly sweet, and Draco's characterisation is great. The basic premise is Harry, who's an Auror, has been sent to take care of some poltergeist activity that's been threatening Malfoy Manor. The author nails the dialogue, writes a strong side-Hermione, and writes a really solid, jokey Harry that's reminiscent of canon-Harry (something that I find rare in fanfiction). I definitely recommend, I was sad to finish this one. linkao3(6239806)

2. Stop All The Clocks (This Is The Last Time I'm Leaving Without You): the author's pretty well known for her Drarry, but this 'fic is /amazing/. It's fucking sad, and I spent the rest of the night after reading it feeling bummed the hell out, but it's written beautifully & it's got my favourite kind of Draco/Harry dynamic (messy & confused & oftentimes full of anger). The Harry in this is spot on, it's a really fantastic (if tragic) read. linkao3(1273078)

3. Paradox: this was the first ever Drarry I read. I was mad anti-Drarry pre-reading this, and then it converted me entirely. The author nails Draco in a way that I've never seen before. He's nasty & self-preserving & elitist and it still manages to make sense, the Harry romance part. It's also got a super sweet ending (the story's split into two parts) that'll make yr heart soar, dang. I love this one so much, Draco is perfectly written. It's a time travel fic, w/ Draco going back in time, but it's got this whole interesting thing surrounding the loss of memories (or something, I read it a while ago). Recommend 10/10. linkao3(753415)

4. Written On the Heart: this has the best Blaise Zabini side character, he's such a nuisance. Check this one out for the dialogue, it's one of the very best I've read. Plot wise, it's good, but it's all totally secondary to the brilliant conversations in this fic. This one's a really fun read, definitely recommend. linkao3(9065263)

5. Lumos: this one's got a bunch of wanking, basically. Recommend it tho, it's got a great Harry & a fantastic Draco/Harry dynamic. linkao3(8909155).

6. There is Always the Moon: I haven't actually finished this one, b/c it got a bit... silly, but the first half is such a great Draco that I have to recommend it anyway. Really interesting plot (it's based off someone's one-shot, If The Sun Goes Black, which is great, albeit rushed; I'll link it). Draco's cursed & seeks out Harry's help, basically, but the best part of this 'fic is Draco owning & operating a potion's shop on Diagon Alley. His interactions w/ Narcissa, the shop hand, and customers is a really fun read. Check Always the Moon out for the Draco, check the one-shot out for the Drarry. linkao3(6264406) & linkao3(4707098)

7. All Life is Yours to Miss: Harry and Draco work at Hogwarts, Draco owns a pet beetle, sweetness ensues. Basically Harry ends up paralysed due to an awry Draco-prank. Draco consistently visits him in the Hospital Wing, recounting his day, or whatever, out of guilt-but-eventual-habit. It's a cute premise and it's a cute Draco. Oddly, my favourite thing about this 'fic is Hagrid and his friendship w/ Draco's pet beetle. It's not as overwhelming, IMO, as the the first 3 fics I recommended, but it's still super lovely & the author is well known for her Drarry. linkao3(825875)

Hope you find something you haven't seen before.
