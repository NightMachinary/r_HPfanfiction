I really like this idea. Especially because it could give a little introduction to this side of the magical world even before 'Fantastic Creatures'.

Just two thoughts that came spontaneously: - A LOT of the magical creatures are flying. Harry would probably be better suited to care for them, than Hagrid is right now. - If you came to the third year Hagrid would probably not fail that much as a teacher if Harry prompted him.
