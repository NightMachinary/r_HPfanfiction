Yeah, I first started looking at HP fanfics because I wanted to find good H/G. And while I at first enjoyed quite a few fics, once I read truly good ones I can no longer enjoy any of them because their flaws are quite glaring (bashing, manipulating Hr/R and Lu/T if time travelling, completely ignoring the flaws of the Weasleys).

And the plots are rarely interesting or original.
