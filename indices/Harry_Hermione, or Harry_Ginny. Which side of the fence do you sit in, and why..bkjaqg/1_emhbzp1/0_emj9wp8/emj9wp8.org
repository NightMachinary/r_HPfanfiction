While I'm sold that canon Harry and Ginny are a good fit, I'm disappointed by the current state of H/G fics:

- Too many relationship dramas, not enough adventures
- Too many family fics, not enough guts and glory epics
- Too many Quidditch Ginnys, not enough kick ass Ginnys in different professions
- Too many canon compliant ones, not enough AUs
- Too many Harrys in lead roles, not enough Ginnys as the main character
