Well, i fall on the Harry/Ginny side of the line and here's why:

There was [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][this essay]] on HP Lexicon that did a close reading of the first 5 books to break down why Harry and Hermione might not be suited for each other. It still holds up 15 years later which stuck with me, From its conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  There is an old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. In my opinion, the relationship between Harry and Hermione isn't broken. Hermione performs an essential role in Harry's life and gives him support he desperately needs, both as a motherless boy and as the target of a deadly villain. But Hermione isn't a superwoman. She can't be Harry's mother-surrogate and his sister-surrogate and his friend and his sidekick and his girlfriend. The demands of the different roles are incompatible. Harry will need to add more supporters to help him in his fight, not simply expect his first two supporters to meet his every need. And the ‘girlfriend' role is a natural one to add functions that Harry is mostly missing now.

Also you have to consider if Harry is the right fit for Hermione as well, as Harry doesn't seem to go out of his way to think about Hermione, which this essay will go in great detail to break down. Ultimately, it is well worth a read just for its citations, haha.

As for Harry/Ginny, though this essay doesn't try to advocate for any one final pairing, there is one passage that struck out to me:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is desperately unhappy; he feels as though the memory of it was eating him from inside (OP575/653) [OP29]. But he continues to hide his feelings from Ron and Hermione. This is very reminiscent of Book Three, when Harry refused to tell Ron and Hermione that he could hear his parents when he was near Dementors (PA137-8 [PA7]/183-4 [PA10]). On that subject, it was Remus Lupin's calm listening skills that succeeded in breaking Harry's reserve (PA140/187) [PA10]. Here, Ginny is the one who uses good listening techniques to find out what is wrong with Harry:

  #+begin_quote
    Harry looked at it a moment, then, to his horror, he felt a lump rise in this throat.

    “Are you OK, Harry?” Ginny asked quietly.

    “Yeah, I'm fine,” Harry said gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.

    “You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho---”

    “It's not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.

    “Who is it, then?” asked Ginny, watching him closely.

    “I...”

    He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.

    “I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can't.”

    Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully.

    (OP577/654) [OP29]

  Ginny employs several good listening techniques here. First, she waits for the opportune moment, when Harry is feeling emotional about his Easter egg. She speaks quietly. She watches Harry closely, gauging his emotions, And, most of all, she does a good bit of remaining silent. She lets him stutter and look around the room without saying something. Even after he speaks, she continues to watch him thoughtfully. These are the same techniques that Sirius used, the same techniques that Remus Lupin used, the same techniques that Dumbledore uses with Harry. Silence, patience, gentleness, watching him with a compassionate expression---these are the way to get Harry to talk. Ginny does not ask why Harry wants to see Sirius, or criticize him in any way, or tell him what he should do. She lets him tell her just as much as he wants to tell her, without pestering him for more.

Ultimately just in Ootp, other than Sirius, Harry opens up to Ginny the most. Besides this scene, it was Ginny that could empathise with Harry's fear of being possessed by Voldemort, as she had undergone this very experience. So yea, a Harry/Ginny fan here
