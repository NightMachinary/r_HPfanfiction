This feels so weird to me bc I've been a die-hard Hinny shipper since I was ten and that was what more than a decade ago. Then recently I decided to go back and read the books again with an adult perspective and I honestly can't stop questioning Rowling's attempts at "romance." People keep bringing up that Hhr have no "chemistry," that they're "boring," that they're like "siblings" and I always bought into that bogus. I look back now and I see two best friends who fundamentally understood each other and always stood by each other even when quite literally their entire world was against them.

"I knew you weren't going to be happy if you weren't fighting him," that quote hits me so hard. It's just SO wrong, NO Harry is NOT happy fighting him, he's miserable! (I'm shocked that in HBP he wasn't dealing with PTSD and breaking down tbh) This just highlights that Ginny never really understood Harry....she just bought his "I'm a lone hero gotta do this myself" BS and backed down only to showcase her jealousy at the weirdest moments (that Cho Chang moment in DH...come on Gin theres a WAR going on, be possessive later). Some shippers say Ginny is fiery and strong so she can "handle" Harry, but where when it really mattered, did she stuck by him and do that?

But Hermione saw through all his false bravado. When Harry attempts to go the lone noble hero route, Hermione was there every step of the way and letting him know that it wasn't HIS responsibility alone. She doesn't let him wallow in depression, she pulls him out, she makes plans, she makes sure he isn't alone in the shit story that is his life and damn if that isn't the best foundation for a romance, I don't know what is,

Young me found Hhr to be boring and meh, older me can see the how easily such a relationship would work out and how well they would have suited each other....not as a bunch of teenagers still figuring out what they want, maybe not even during canon at all!...But after they become adults and have a good head on their shoulders, I can see it and I can see it lasting much longer than the explosive, unhealthy R /Hr and rather shallow, teenage romance H/G.

Wow, sorry for the long post. I should really make my own thread and see if there are others like me who've made such a drastic 180 on these opinions bc I feel like all the Hhr shippers when quiet after DH (at the time I rejoiced as a Hinny fan) but now I feel all alone in the ship lmao, 10+ years too later for the Hhr craze
