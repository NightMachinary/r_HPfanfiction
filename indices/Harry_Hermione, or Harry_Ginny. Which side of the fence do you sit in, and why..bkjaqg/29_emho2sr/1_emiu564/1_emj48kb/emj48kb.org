Harry only came up for the idea of being an Auror to piss Umbridge off who was in the room during his career counseling session. After that, I think the reason he went with that was two-fold, first momentum (he didn't have any other ideas) and if he has to fight a war and fight death eaters, I think he just figures Auror makes the most sense.

And even if he thinks that he always has to stand and fight, that doesn't mean he enjoys it or "he is only happy doing it" as Ginny states. He does it because he doesn't know any other way. It would get him killed one day, and Ginny will be an enabler of that situation because she doesn't stand up to him and say "Hey no, how about not going out there and getting Ak'd in the back!", which is something that Hermione would say. Ginny knows the BWL, but throughout the entire series, Harry rails against being exactly that. He wants to be 'just Harry' not a hero from the books Ginny was obsessed with at a very young age.

Honestly, that's my biggest problem with Ginny as a love interest. JKR never allowed her character to grow past that young girl who saw Harry as the hero. Harry is so much more than a hero, and he doesn't want to be seen as a hero. Ginny never gets that in the books. If JKR had made Ginny a more interesting character, more of a main character, and had her grow like other characters in the book, Ginny might have made a good match for Harry. As it is in canon, she just isn't. She the fangirl to a guy who just simply hates his fame.
