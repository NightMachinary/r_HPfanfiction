What...dude, Harry's life mantra is basically "leave-me-the-fuck-alone-why-am-i-always-getting-involved-in-this-shit"...he doesn't go running into danger because he enjoys the thrill, it's always thrust upon him and he has no other choice. His greatest wish is just to have a normal life. Someone tell Book 7 Harry, "well this IS what you were meant to do, since you always love to stand up and fight ammirite" lmao. He has /no other choice/.
