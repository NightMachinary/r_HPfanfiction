You've got a lot of responses from Hinny shippers, so here's one from a die-hard Harmony lover.

HHr is the one I prefer, simply for the fact that it does make the most sense from a canon perspective. They spend the most time together, have each other's back, have at least a little in common (unlike Ron and Hermione who have nothing in common), and they actually seem to care for one another.

Now some will say that they treat each other like brother and sister. I'm sure there are some siblings out there that trust each other and like each other that much, but every brother and sister that I know of treat each other much more like what Ron and Hermione treat each other, esp. those close in age. They bicker and fight and are overly protective of each other. There's not a lot of bickering between HHr in canon that I remember. The only real evidence that Harry thinks of Hermione as a sister is that he says so. But I think that is just JKR being her wishy-washy self. There is a reason why Harry and Hermione look at each other at Bill's wedding when the magistrate says "and they will be bonded for life..."

There's also that Hermione doesn't seem to work with anyone else. Ron really does treat her like a sister, Viktor doesn't talk to her (just stares at her apparently), and Neville comes across as too soft, though in later books he might work as he kind of found himself. Don't get me started on the idiocy that is Dramione. Hermione might be able to forgive Draco for being Draco throughout the series, but she wouldn't forget his actions enough to start dating him. Same with any other Death Eater.

But even if you can't get behind Harry/Hermione as a ship, liking Hinny has always been gross for me and I can't understand how people want to read it. There isn't any evidence that Ginny actually looks like Lily Potter (as someone in this thread already said), but if you've read anything in fanon like "but they'll look just like James and Lily," you'll never read the pairing the same ever again. Even if Ginny doesn't look exactly like Harry's mum, she's still described in a similar manner: redhead, feisty and easy to anger, determined, protective, powerful. To me, the similarities are just too close and make it seem a bit incestuous.

Beyond that, there's the whole fangirl thing. Even as late as the sixth book (which is really the last we see of Ginny in any major form outside of a kiss in book 7 and the epilogue), Ginny is still showing that she *doesn't really know Harry at all.* She says that "I knew you weren't going to be happy if you weren't fighting him," or something like that. Harry doesn't want to fight Voldemort, and he is certainly not /happy/ that he has to do it. Even more, if Ginny really loved Harry and really knew him, she would have stuck by him no matter how much he tried to push her away.

Like Hermione did. Hermione was there and didn't care that Harry tried to push her away. Ginny backed out without a fight and let her grand hero go off to fight his own battles in hope that he'd come back to her. That's not the mark of the type of woman Harry needs, IMHO. He needs a partner, someone who will stand up to him and try to keep him from doing idiotic things, and when she doesn't succeed, she'll follow him into danger, hoping to protect him. If that doesn't describe Hermione, I don't know what does.

I know Hermione has her flaws, I'm not blind to those. But nobody is perfect, certainly not Harry. But I really do think that out of all the possible canon pairings, Harmony works the best.
