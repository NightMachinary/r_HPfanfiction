If i really had to pick one, I'd pick Harmony. Just because Ginny/Harry is that much more insufferable.

But, truly, none of them are interesting or realistic. I love reading fic with Harry and Hermione having a sibling relationship. Where Hermione is still canon and flawed but at least it work adorably in a big sister way.

With Ginny,... well. It's even more obvious that it's just a way to make everyone pair up with someone already introduced. That's all a bit gross, for me.

I don't even understand where the need for Ron/Hermione came from, in the novels. I really saw Hermione being alone and focused on her for a few years after the war. And then blossoming and finding someone fitting for her personality. (But I also cannot understand how she'd end up Minister, she's the girl who made literally zero friend all her school years.)

Anyway. I'd vote for Luna, too. It'd be less depressing for all parties involved and less incestuous in its aftertaste.
