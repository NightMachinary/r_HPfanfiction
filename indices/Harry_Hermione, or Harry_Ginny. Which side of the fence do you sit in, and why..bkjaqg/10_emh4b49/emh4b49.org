I prefer Harry/Hermione, mainly because Ron/Hermione would be a disaster. Opposites attract, but not to that degree. The /only/ thing they have in common is having Harry as a friend. Otherwise they're polar opposites. /Starting out/ with endless bickering does not make a happy marriage, and I can't imagine why so many authors find it romantic.

On top of that, Harry/Hermione always had a solid friendship, except for the Firebolt incident where it turned out Hermione was completely correct the whole time. Ginny doesn't have much of a presence in the books other than as a fangirl and a maiden in distress (which would only exacerbate the fangirl problem). And if she looked like his mother then that would introduce some therapy-level problems. She marries him because she's a fangirl, and he marries her because she looks like his mother? Please, no.

A major problem with the story is that there are 3 main characters, and authors (JKR included) seem determined to pair everyone off. When the 4th character (Ginny) is related to one of the 3, the options are very limited. Throwing Neville and Luna into the mix would work, and would not be unrealistic since they all went to the Department of Mysteries together.

That would pair Ron up with Luna, and both the other pairings would be workable.

TL;DR: I don't care as long as Hermione doesn't end up with Ron.
