Harry/Hermione

Not quite sure why, to be honest. I can't really give an exact reason. I just like both characters and think their relationship /can/ have some very interesting dynamics.

I will, however, also note that Harry/Hermione is probably the pairing most prone to produce utterly shit fics, that is not beyond any realm of canon possibility.
