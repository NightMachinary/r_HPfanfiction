I really really enjoyed the development and relationship between Harry and Ginny in canon, it was very subtle and extremely well done. it fit really nicely with the third person limited viewpoint, and i feel that it grows very naturally. a little bit of what [[/u/FinallyGivenIn][u/FinallyGivenIn]] gets at. i have seen a handful of posts on the [[/r/harrypotter]] sub that point out every single bit of Harry Ginny that i might try and rummage out, really has some good growth.

however, i haven't read one good Harry/Ginny fanfic that picks up on any of the relationship dynamic and development. TBH from reading fanfics i think most readers only spot something when its written like a bludger to the face, and so by osmosis im really into my Harry/Hermione fanfics.

-------

When i first finished the series as a teen i was all for wailing that it should have been Harry/Hermione (and weirdly i read Harry/Ginny fanfics back then). then after some years away from the story and fanfics in my late teens, re-reading canon as an adult and a more discerning reader, picking up all the nicely done bits about Harry and Ginny - it was great. (and now i weirdly-conversely read Harry/Hermione fanfics)

edit: i'll refine that slightly, now i only read +well written+ adult sentence structure rather than YA fanfics that are horribly few and far between and i'll settle for whatever pairing they have.

A well written fic is so few and far between that i would be limited if that was all i read. There are a few fanfic authors that have made it big and quite a few that self-publish, Less than those i would say are actually tip-top quality writers.
