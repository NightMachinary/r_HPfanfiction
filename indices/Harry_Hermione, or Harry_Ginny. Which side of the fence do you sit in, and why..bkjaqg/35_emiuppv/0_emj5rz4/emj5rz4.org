I feel like I'm the opposite situation. Was a massive Hinny fan, but could never get into any of their fanfics bc most of them were so insubstantial and built on tropes and just felt...blank to me? Weirdly, I used to argue with my family and friends who thought Hhr was better ("Read the books, Mom! Ginny is better there, I promise!") and I never even really thought of Hhr as a couple. It wasn't until I unwittingly read a fanfic that included Hhr that I realized "damn, there is a lot of potential here" and I just got so excited about exploring all the complexities and subtleties of their relationship...the same relationship I always as a kid thought was sibling like and boring but which now seems to have the foundation for so much more that I ended up moving to Hhr just recently but it just feels /weird/ after shipping Hinny for 10 years lmao.

Do you have any Hhr fic recs? I noticed you said you read them more.
