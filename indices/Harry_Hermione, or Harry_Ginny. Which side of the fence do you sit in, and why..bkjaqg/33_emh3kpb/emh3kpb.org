Don't get mad - you asked, remember - but I have to say neither, I think they're both equally insufferable pairings and comparably shallow characters for what they are.

The conjoining into "harmony" makes me want to vomit, but Harry getting the hots for what is essentially a discount Lilly Potter almost out of the blue is equally disgusting. I'd honestly rather read straight up incest.

I know I ruffled some feathers here, but sorry not sorry :P

I like the unorthodox pairings like Harry/Luna or Harry/Daphne, although by this point there's really no such thing, everything has been done to death (especially the latter).

Also, the more out of the way a love interest is in terms of Canon, the more liberty I feel authors have to work with. Makes for more interesting stories, as opposed to yet another rehash of the "brightest witch of her age"/"bat-bogey wonder" pairings.
