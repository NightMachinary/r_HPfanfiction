Hermione of course. She's smart, hardworking, charming, funny, brave, loyal and most important of all she treated Harry as just Harry ant not the Boy-Who-Lived. Ginny isn't that smart, not hardworking, somewhat charming in that brash, tomboyish way, not as funny as Hermione and while she might be brave I suppose I hardly doubt she would be brave enough to withstand Bellatrix's torture without breaking down into a useless mess.

Hermione is best witch.

"What about Ron?" I hear you cry, presumably. He can have Lavender Brown, those two were meant for each other.
