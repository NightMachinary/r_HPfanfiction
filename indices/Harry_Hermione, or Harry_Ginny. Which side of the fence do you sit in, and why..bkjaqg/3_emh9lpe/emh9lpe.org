I don't much care what the pairing is, if it's done well. However, Harmony has to be done REALLY well for me to get behind it. Firstly, as someone else said, the ship name is grossly cute. But more importantly, I feel like Harry and Hermione have more of a brother-sister vibe than a romantic one. I love their dynamic when they can just be really close, supportive friends. I think anything can be done well, but I'm much less likely to read a Harmony story.

As for Hinny, I don't have strong feelings either way. If the author does something original with the pairing, I'll probably like it, but if they just get together because they were together in canon instead of having any real development within the fic, it seems lazy and annoying.
