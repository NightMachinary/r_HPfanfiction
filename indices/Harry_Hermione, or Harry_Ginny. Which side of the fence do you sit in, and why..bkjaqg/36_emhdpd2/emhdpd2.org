I'll read Harry/Hermione stories, and I liked the pairing when I read the first 2 books or so and I fell out of that pretty quickly, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read the pairing now. I like it fine enough that if a story that seems interesting has it as the pairing it won't turn me off, but again, I don't deliberately seek it out.

Harry/Ginny on the other hand - I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of. In the books Ginny started out as a fangirl, who finally seemed to get over Harry and move on to be more than a fangirl, only for them to get together completely out of the blue in book 6. Like Ginny was barely a major character, she was just sort of there. And then suddenly Harry is like obsessed with her and apparently Ginny had still liked him all along. It just rubbed me the wrong way, how it was written. If they'd had more chemistry or if Harry had even showed more interest in her in that way before book 6 I think I'd like the pairing better. That said, like with Hermione if I see he's paired with her for a story I want to read it won't necessarily turn me off the story, but I will admit I'm a little less likely to read it

Overall though I'd much prefer to read Harry with pretty much anyone else other than these 2, though I'd read him with Hermione more than I would with Ginny.
