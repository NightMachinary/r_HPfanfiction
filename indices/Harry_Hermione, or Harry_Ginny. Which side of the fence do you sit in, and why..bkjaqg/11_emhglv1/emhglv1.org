I am a hardcore Harry/Ginny fan. Contrary to what a lot of people think, I feel that the relationship developed naturally. Many people criticize the development of the relationship saying that Harry basically woke up one day, and fell in love with Ginny from afar. I have two things to say to that:

1. It did not develop as suddenly as it seems.
2. Even if it had, sometimes that's how relationships form.

With regards to the first point, if you read the books closely, from very early on, Harry takes note of where Ginny is. It's small things, like noting where in the common room she is, what she's doing, rarely specifically who she's with. One has to keep in mind that the books are written from a limited 3rd person point of view- Harry's point of view. We only see the things that Harry sees, and only hear about the things that Harry considers important. Over time, Ginny begins to spend a little bit more time with the Trio. Never enough to be part of group mind you, but she shows up more frequently starting in the 4th book or so, and her involvement increases throughout the 5th, particularly with the start of Dumbledore's Army. She's incredibly involved in DA, and that would have served time for Harry to spend time with Ginny, and get to know her better. We don't really know how much they interacted during these sessions, because we rarely see Harry actually teaching; most of the important scenes surrounding DA take place after sessions; we're told what happens in them and not shown. Then in the 6th book, Harry seemingly suddenly has feelings for Ginny, "like a monster in his chest." It only seems to come on strong and quickly, but I think it's important to note that this is also the first time in 2-3 years that Harry is not carrying a torch for Cho. And over the course of this year, Harry and Ginny spend a lot of time together because they're both on the Quidditch team. And I think THAT'S what galvanizes the relationship: the Quidditch.

​

With regards to the second point, I will refer to my own real life experiences. The girlfriend I had throughout my last year of school, is someone that I had at least known about, if not been friends with, since we were about 6 or 7. So about 10 years. And we had both been on the school's Cross Country and Track and Field teams together for 3 years before that; shared a German class for 5 years, been in various other classes together, etc. My point is that to me, at least, it's not like I liked her for all those years, but those feelings suddenly formed during my last year of school. I can't say with certainty why this occurred, I can just confirm that it was like one day I decided that I liked her. Very similar to how Harry's feelings for Ginny came about.

​

With regards to the Harry/Hermione ship I have one thing to say: similarly to [[/u/rosemarysbabykitten][u/rosemarysbabykitten]], I feel that Hermione works better as a platonic friendship, which is something that Harry needs in life, otherwise he only has Ron. Harry has many friends and acquaintances, but the close friends he has basically number two: Hermione and Ron.
