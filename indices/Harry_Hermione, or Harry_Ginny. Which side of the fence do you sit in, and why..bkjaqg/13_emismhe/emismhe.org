I'm actually a neutral person in regards to ships. I feel Harry had the best connection with Hermione, Ginny, and even Luna and that I'm sure any of those 3 could have been written realistically. Hermione in canon never really learned social tact, despite any attacks on Ron to that behavior. She says things that offend Harry, she acts in what she thinks is the best course without advising, essentially emotionally manipulates Harry to teach, and reacts poorly to Harry beating her in potions and Ron dating Lavender. That being said, she's extremely loyal and will maim to defend Harry. Ginny is a rather supportive character, listening to Harry when things come up. Whether it comes to his need to talk to Sirius or book six and Malfoy almost cruciating him. Her only flaw is that she isn't characterized too much and that she was interested in love potions at Fred and George's shop. Luna is quirky and a bit gullible, but extremely open-minded. Her only flaw is that she's a bit too weird. If she was grounded a bit I definitely could see it happening.
