I have no strong feelings towards Hinny, but between those two I'd rather see Hinny -- because to me, while there's no personality clashes in Harmony nor constant fighting like there is in Heron, the spark needed to ignite a romantic relationship simply isn't there. The books strongly implies that they love each other like you love your siblings, not romantically -- she's the sister he never had.

So I'd say Hinny.

As for the other parts of the trio -- I ship Ron with Lavender more than anyone -- it's not my OTP or anything, but I find it more plausible than any other common Ron ship. Meanwhile, I don't ship Hermione anyone specifically -- just not Ron or Harry (I mostly read fics shipping her with SS, but it's a consequence of me mostly reading SS-centric fics, not because I think he makes for the best shipping partner to her -- perhaps if he'd been her age, but he isn't).
