I'm not too fond of either, really. I always felt like pairing him with Hermione enforces that /When Harry Met Sally/ rule about men and women not being able to be friends. It /could/ work under certain circumstances, maybe, but still.

And I've never really liked Ginny as a character? But I could see it working out /years/ down the line. Like, mid thirties or later. I feel like Rowling murdered Ginny to turn her into Harry's ~soulmate~, tbh.

My favorite ship with Harry is him/a nice, warm cup of inner peace.
