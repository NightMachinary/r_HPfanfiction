I ship Harry/Hermione but I think I come at it from a different direction than most. Because as a kid I was a shy loner who would spend most of my time with my nose in a book and focusing on academics over socializing, I've always seen more of myself in Hermione than any other character in the series. As a result, I have trouble not thinking of the story from Hermione's perspective and in particular asking myself what I would do in her shoes. The truth of the matter is that if I was a woman, Ron would very much not be my type but Harry (and Krum) would be. As a result, I ship Harry/Hermione not because I think it is the best fit for Harry, but I think it is the best fit for Hermione.
