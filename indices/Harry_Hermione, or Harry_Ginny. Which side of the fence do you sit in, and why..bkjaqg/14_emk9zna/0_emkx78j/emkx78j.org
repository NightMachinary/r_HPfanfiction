THANK-YOU. Someone actually gets that there are two people in a relationship, and we should consider both of them when it comes to such a discussion. That's why I always preferred Harry/Hermione over Ron/Hermione, and Harry/Ginny. Ron, and Hermione act more like siblings than Harry, and Hermione ever would. While Harry, and Ginny is somewhat unhealthy on multiple levels, if Harry, and Ginny were maybe given a chance to grow, and develop as people, and actually explore other relationships first I could actually see a healthy relationship there, but Ginny, and Harry had just finished a war between a person that greatly effected both of their lives. Ginny had been a HP fangirl for over a decade, and considering Harry saved her in COS, I don't truly believe such a thing ever went away. After a war they should take time, even years to find themselves again before they would pursue a relationship, because of how this person effected BOTH of their lives. Two people in such a state should not think of pursuing a relationship, at least for the moment.

Harry, and Hermione on the other hand I could actually see working immediately after the war. These two people have trusted each other, and never abandoned the other. They've had fights, but the main one that people point to(broom in POA) was done because Hermione was worried over Harry, not out of jealousy, or spite. Their relationship would be a relatively healthy one. Most importantly is that while Voldemort has effected them both greatly, it's only by association that it affected Hermione to a degree, and even then she was never possessed bo Voldemort, nor did she spend her formative years as part of an insular society fearing even the mention of his name. Basically while Harry/Ginny is unhealthy, because of how broken they both are, Harry/Hermione is more healthy, because Hermione would be able to help, and support Harry, because of her distance from such a thing in some very important ways. Let's not forget that they're both muggle raised, both were bullied in school, and in general just fit better as a couple.
