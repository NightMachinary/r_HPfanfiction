Yeap, The essay i cited does go into great detail the emotional interactions between Harry and Hermione and does bring up some of the same issues highlighted in your post. It is interesting to reread those chapters and see with further detail that Harry's bond with Hermione is not like Ron and it is emphasised that Harry cant spend too much time with just Hermione alone and still be happy
