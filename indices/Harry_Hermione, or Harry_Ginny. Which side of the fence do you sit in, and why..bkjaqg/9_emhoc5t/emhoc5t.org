[[https://owlpostagain.tumblr.com/post/129597015066/why-ronhermione-argue][This fantastic bit of meta]] goes a long way to explaining why I don't think Harry/Hermione works as a romantic relationship. In short, Hermione likes to argue, and Ron is happy to argue right back with her:

#+begin_quote
  “Poisonous toadstools don't change their spots,” said Ron sagely. “Anyway, I've always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape, where's the evidence he ever really stopped working for You- Know-Who?”

  “I think Dumbledore's probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn't share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.

  “Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can't you give it a rest?” he said. “You're always having a go at each other, it's driving me mad.” (OotP, Chapter 12)

Note that they are "angry and offended" after Harry reprimands them - to them, this was normal, acceptable conversation. It's also worth noting that even when they're arguing, Ron always respects Hermione's intelligence, taking it as a given that she's the smartest person around:

  “How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to lend you my notes this year?”

  “We'd fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your conscience, Hermione . . .”

  “Well, you'd deserve it,” she snapped. “You don't even try to listen to him, do you?”

  “We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven't got your brains or your memory or your concentration --- you're just cleverer than we are --- is it nice to rub it in?”

  “Oh, don't give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard. (OotP, Chapter 12)

Harry, on the other hand, doesn't like open conflict, and when (unintentionally) pushed too far by Hermione, he tends to explode at her, at which point Hermione wilts:

#+begin_quote
  “Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did ---” Hermione began.

  “CAN'T'VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU'D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT /DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR/ ---”

  “Well, he did ---”

  “FOUR WEEKS I'VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON ---”

  “We wanted to ---”

  “I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN'T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER ---”

  “No, honest ---”

  “Harry, we're really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You're absolutely right, Harry --- I'd be furious if it was me!” (OotP, Chapter 4)

And here:

  “/You don't know what it's like/! You --- neither of you --- you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own --- your own brain or guts or whatever --- like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die --- they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that --- and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up --- you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me ---”

  “We weren't saying anything like that, mate,” said Ron, looking aghast. “We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't --- you've got the wrong end of the ---”

  He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. (OotP, Chapter 15)

And here:

  “You . . . This isn't a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I mean --- don't you think you've got a bit of a --- a --- /saving-people- thing/?” she said.

  He glared at her. “And what's that supposed to mean, a ‘saving- people-thing'?”

  “Well . . . you . . .” She looked more apprehensive than ever. “I mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn't have . . . I mean, you didn't need to save that little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .”

  A wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry's body --- how could she remind him of that blunder now?

  “. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,” said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face. “Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do ---”

  “That's funny,” said Harry in a trembling voice, “because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time /acting the hero./ . . . Is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?”

  “No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast. “That's not what I mean at all!” (OotP, Chapter 32)

As [[/u/FinallyGivenIn][u/FinallyGivenIn]] points out, Ginny has a better record at getting Harry to open up emotionally than Hermione.
