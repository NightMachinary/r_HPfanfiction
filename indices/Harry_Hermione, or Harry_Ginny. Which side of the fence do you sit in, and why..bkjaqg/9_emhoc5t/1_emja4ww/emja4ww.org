Wow, that first link you gave really made me rethink the Hermione/Ron relationship. I've never liked the idea of any of the Trio shipping together (though I read fics where this happens). However, I really like the idea that Hermione sees all the arguments as just an intellectual exercise and Ron just happens to be a willing sparring partner, rather than the arguments being an expression of tension between the two. If Hermione considers all the arguments to be simply an exchange of ideas then I can see why she'd be interested in Ron, as he's the primary person who seems willing to engage her on any topic of debate.
