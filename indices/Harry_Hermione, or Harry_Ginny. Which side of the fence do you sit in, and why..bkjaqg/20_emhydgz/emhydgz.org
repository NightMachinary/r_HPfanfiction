Harmony. Ginny's spontaneous character development was basically offscreen and Harry's sudden feelings for her just came out of no where. He ignores her for five books and suddenly they're “soulmates” and “his chest monster” nonsense. Seriously? I'd like them more if Rowling knew how to write romance better.
