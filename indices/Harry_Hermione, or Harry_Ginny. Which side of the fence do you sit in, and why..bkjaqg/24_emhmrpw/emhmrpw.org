I have read too many Harmony fics to like that ship. Damn, how many fics have made me hate Harmony (wth even /is/ that name? *Harmione* makes at least a /little/ bit sense!), I can't even count. I get people who like Hermione as a character, I liked her in canon too, but fucking hell how people /murder/ that character!

Take for example Robst fic *Harry Crow*. One of the oldest, most famous Harmony fics out there. That doesn't have Hermione anywhere. Oh yes, there's a character with the same name, but she's a badass who is loved by (almost) every goblin out there because the plot demands it. She's goblinsplaining everything and when her dad (who is named Dan, /eurgh/) has ONE human emotion she gets hysterical and threatens to break off all contact forever and ever and ever. Oh, she likes books too. At least she has /that/ in common with canon Hermione. Canon Harry/Hermione makes sense, they have a similar childhood with bullies and stuff. They both come from Muggle upbringing. But I have rarely seen a fanfic that made Hermione (in combination with Harry) to be a true, real character.

That doesn't mean that I like Harry/Ginny (HINNY???) any better, though. But that's mostly because there's nothing that supports such a relationship, which is Rowling's fault. She dumped Ginny halfway through the series on the reader. At least book Ginny had a /bit/ of a personality. Fanfic Ginny often has none.
