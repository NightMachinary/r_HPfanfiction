Fuck people like that, everyone is entitled to their opinion.

I don't agree with ya mind, because we simply don't know enough about /why/ Luna spouts that stuff. Sure, it's logical not to date someone obviously insane, but it could easily be a young girl who lost her Mother whose just saying that stuff for attention or to bond with her probably genuinely crazy Father or /something/.

We don't know if we're wiping away Luna because just about everyone wears masks- you act different at work than you do at home probably unless you're the big boss- I know I do, who knows if crazy is Luna's mask? When she gets serious she ends up helping Harry every time, the Thestrals, helping him feel better at the end of the year and such.

Never said she needed psychological help though I think everyone at Hogwarts at the end did, I mean my god, they went through a war and I bet not one of them saw a therapist unless Hermione tied up Ron and Harry and dragged them to one.
