I know that this will probably get me downvoted into oblivion, but Luna does not work well as the main character/love interest because she is, at the very best, a believer in mad conspiracy theories, and batshit insane at the worst. I love her in small doses, but she cannot carry a story unless you are writing crack.

While Hermione's arguments were poorly made, someone seriously believing baseless theories (eg Goblin pies, heliopath army) unless proven wrong (and proving a negative is pretty much impossible) is not someone you would want to spend time with. Her creatures are one thing, as they may exist and/or may be metaphors, but her blindly believing what the Quibbler writes is not the sign of

An author can write those flaws away in various ways, but by doing so they take away what makes Luna Luna. You can argue that all she needs is some psychological help and I am inclined to believe that, but even if you "fix" her issues, she stops being the endearing character we all love in small doses.
