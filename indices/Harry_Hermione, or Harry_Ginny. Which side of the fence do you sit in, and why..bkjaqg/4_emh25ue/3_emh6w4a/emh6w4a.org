I really like people's takes on why the Lovegoods are so strange. One fic mentioned that the Quibbler was a coded message for people who opposed the Ministry, sort of like a synonym word jumble proclaiming “Umbridge is corrupt!” which would turn into “Erroads are influencing you right now! Turn to page 4 to learn more!” Another good, albeit sad, one is that Luna's mom put an experimental protection charm on her family and it backfired, causing them to go a little strange. Since she died, there was no one who knew about it or was able to fix it since it was unique.

If anyone remembers which fics these are from please link them! Also, Lunar Harmony is a fantastic name.
