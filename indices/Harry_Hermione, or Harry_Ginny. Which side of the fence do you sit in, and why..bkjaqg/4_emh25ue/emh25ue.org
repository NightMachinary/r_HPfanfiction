Honestly I vote for Harry/Luna when she's either joking, a seer, a lonely girl clinging to her relationship with her crazy Father or something of the sort- hell, I don't even mind it much when she's batshit, I'm a Luna man and if she were real I'd change my name to Neil Armstrong and try to be the first or better yet last man to take one large thrust for man, one larger thrust for mankind.

After all, after the kind of life Harry's led I think he could use some whimsy in his life- even in canon when she wasn't busy baffling him she made him feel better and rather connected in shared problems.

Hermione is too domineering for my tastes- a nagger and control freak. How Harry can stand her after dealing with his relatives... That right there needs a degree in psychology to understand I think, or at least I sure don't get it, though between Hermione and Ginny, well, Hermione seems to grow up some and come to realize rules aren't everything and the world isn't completely black and white while we're never sure if Ginny is after Harry or The-Boy-Who-Lived.

TLTR: I'm a big fan of Luna, Hermione and Harry threesomes aka Lunar Harmony.
