Im on the side of Harry/Hermione its not my favorite ship but i do like it and much prefer it over to Harry Ginny. Im not a fan of the men marry their mothers trope. You never really got to know lilly but looks wise they are both red heads and Harry looks like his dad. So I think there was the idea of the present to a degree reflecting the past. And idk just to recreate that i dont really like the idea.

But that's just why im not huge on Harry Ginny. I like Harry Hermione more because its based on friendship they have a bond that's based on a strong relationship thats been built up over the years. While Harry's relationship with Ginny was just as Ron's sibling. Not even a sibling he was particularly close to. Not till he started to see her as attractive. She developed more of a personality in book 5 but they still weren't exactly close till he hooked up with her.

Not that this is unrealistic or anything but in fiction i prefer romance based on some sort of strong bond that starts maybe even before the romantic feelings and not just the physical attraction. And Harry Ginny just doesnt give me that. Most of Harrys other relationships do even ones not explored that much like Harry Luna.
