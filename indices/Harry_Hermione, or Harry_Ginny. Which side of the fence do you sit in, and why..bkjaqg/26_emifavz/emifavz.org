Hinny, just because a match between the most exceptional male hero and most exceptional female one is so stereotypical Hollywood that anything else is better than that. Also, I don't think what Harry needed most was somebody supersmart, more somebody alive and explosive. And, yes, Ginny is the worst developed character in the books, so here fanfiction stories were needed to finish her as a character. In this regard I think what Northumbrian did is the best available.
