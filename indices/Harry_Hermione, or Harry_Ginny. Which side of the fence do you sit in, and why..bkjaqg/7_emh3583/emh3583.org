Harry/pretty much anyone else other than those two.

He doesnt like Hermione in a romantic sense, and from what I recall from canon he always wished for Ron to be there when it was just him and Hermione.

And Ginny, it just feels kinda out of the blue. They like Quidditch and thats kinda it. She can also hold her own, but again, not such an amazingly rare trait among the Hogwarts girls. I always like seeing a pairing with someone else. Especially Luna.

One thing that really grinds my gear is the argument that Ginny looks like Lily so thats why he chose her. Like, 1. If he wanted a girl with the same attributes as his mother, he would 100% go for Hermione. 2. Besides the red hair, we actually have no clue how similar they look. 3. That reasoning is so annoyingly shallow I just prefer to ignore it.
