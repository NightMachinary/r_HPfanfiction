  And Ginny, it just feels kinda out of the blue. They like Quidditch and thats kinda it. She can also hold her own, but again, not such an amazingly rare trait among the Hogwarts girls. I always like seeing a pairing with someone else. Especially Luna.

seems contradictory. You can't dislike Ginny because she came out of nowhere (which she didn't, btw) and then ship Luna, who literally wasn't even a character until book 5.
