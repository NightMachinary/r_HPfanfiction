Harry/Hermione, although I am also partial to Harry/Luna.

I think for me it is less about how well Harry/Hermione fit together in my view, and more about how poorly Harry/Ginny do combined with the lack of development Ginny experienced, causing her to feel like a last minute addition just because 3 is not an even number if you catch my drift.

Harry and Hermione were ALWAYS a better fit in terms of personalities, life experiences prior to their awareness of magic and of course post magic, and in terms of their personal strengths and weaknesses. It didn't help that Ron often came off as someone with whom Hermione would never be able to live with long term. I think even proponents of Harry/Ginny will say that the likelihood of a divorce there is fairly high.

For those who argue opposites attract... this is true provided the opposites have enough similar personality traits to where its a complimentary situation and not a square peg in a round hole situation. Harry/Hermione had a good mix of similarities and differences. Ron and Hermione were literally strait opposites 90% of the time, and their similarities came out of their friendship with Harry... nothing more. Without Harry, they do not fit.

I also do think that Harry/Luna would have worked well (more so than Ginny) although I also think Luna would have fit Ron better than Hermione by far. Luna had the ability to make both boys think outside the box, and see the forest for the trees.
