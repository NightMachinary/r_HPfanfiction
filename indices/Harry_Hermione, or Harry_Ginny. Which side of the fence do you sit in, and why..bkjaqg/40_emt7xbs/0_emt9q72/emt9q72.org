You, and JKR are completely in your right to believe that, but first of all I have two sisters, and one brother. Do you want to know who we acted like most of the time, if you guessed Ron and Hermione you are correct. Going off my own personal experience, Ron and Hermione act more like siblings, where Harry and Hermione act more like potential partners. You, and JKR can argue otherwise until the sky is green, but fact is that if anyone was going to develop a realistic relationship, it'd be Harry and Hermione, not Ron and Hermione, their relationship actually has a lot of the earmarks saying that it'll be a horrible relationship.

Also since were playing JKR said, did you know she said that the only reason Hermione ended up with Ron is as a form of wish fullfillment. I'll copy&paste the text just below. But suffuce to say that JKR herself stated that Harry and Hermione would have worked better. So from my own experience, and from the words of the author herself, Harmony is both the better, and more realistic relationship.

In an interview conducted by Emma Watson in 2014, the author told the actress that she put Ron and Hermione together because she wanted to see them together, but that in many ways Harry and Hermione would have been the better fit. "I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment," Rowling said.
