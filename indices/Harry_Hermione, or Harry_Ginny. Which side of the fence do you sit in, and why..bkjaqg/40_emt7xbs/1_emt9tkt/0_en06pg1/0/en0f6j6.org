Are you an idiot. Here i'll paraphrase the FIRST PARAGRAPH. "JK Rowling has admitted that she made a mistake by pairing off Hermione Granger with Ron Weasley rather than with Harry Potter in her best-selling books."

She states right there that she should of placed Hermione with Harry. She also states how it's a form of wish fulfillment, and other such things. Also unless Harry cheats on Ginny, it's kind of expected that JKR in her own words, made a mistake pairing Hermione up with Ron instead of Harry.
