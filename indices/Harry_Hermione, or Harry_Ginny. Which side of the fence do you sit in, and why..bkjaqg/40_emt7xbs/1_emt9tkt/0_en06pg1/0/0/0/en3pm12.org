Yeah, your comment/s in pretty much what I also expected from a narrow minded Hinny fan. Just know that the only reason they're together, is the same reason there are so many horrible godlike Harry stories out there, and so many terrible stories in general, wish fulfillment. So the only reason Hinny is a thing is because JKR isn't good at relationships, and falls in to the trappings of what terrible writers do.
