... what decade is this?

With that out of the way, I mostly go for more unlikely pairings, like Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Lily, and Harry/Gabrielle. But I do appreciate level-2-contrarian approaches to Harry/Ginny. There's quite a bit of room for subversive dark interpretations of Ginny, with her unique position in the Weasley family, slight implications of queen-beeishness, and whatever she /might/ have retained from Tom Riddle.

Hermione, well... I like Harry/Hermione more than level-0 unironic fluffy Harry/Ginny, but often it seems to go along with Twu Wuv, mugglewank, and Hermione Solves Everything, all of which I hate.
