I love Draco/Luna! They're two of the most difficult characters to write well, I think, and definitely have a lot of potential chemistry with everyone, Draco being so volatile and Luna with her general take on people.

I suggest this one here every so often; it's my favorite one-shot, and my headcanon as far as events during Luna's captivity in Malfoy Manor goes: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas In Prison]]
