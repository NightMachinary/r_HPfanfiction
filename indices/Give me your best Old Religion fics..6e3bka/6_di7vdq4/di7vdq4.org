I've had British Wizards follow a pagan religion in "Patron", but since they only "returned to their roots" after turning away from Christianity following the Statue of Secrecy and the witch hunts, it's more like what 17th early 18th century people thought paganism was like. Most of them are as religious as modern West Europeans, i.e. not much if at all, even if they celebrate yuletide and such, and at Hogwarts the old gods are called upon for a blessing when a new school year starts. There are the "Faithful" in Britain as well, but they are a minority. Religion doesn't play a crucial role in the story, though.
