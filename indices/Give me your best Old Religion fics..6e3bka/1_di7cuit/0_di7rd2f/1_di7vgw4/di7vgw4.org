I've been thinking about an AU story, post-Voldemort, where Harry attributed the defeat of Voldemort to Dumbledore (who died in the battle), hiding his own deeds, so he wouldn't have to deal with (even more) fame - only to later run into a number of problems for himself and his friends which he could have solved easily, had he been known as the wizard who defeated Voldemort.
