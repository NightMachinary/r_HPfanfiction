One thing that I hate about canon Harry Potter is his desire to be normal. I think, dude, you're literally a prophesied child living in a magical society- the Dursleys were "normal" and he hated them... It just didn't make sense, and it wasn't an appealing character trait. Normalcy just isn't very exciting or simulating. I think I speak for the vast majority of people when I say that they consume media because the situations and characters are abnormal.

It looks like the author can write well, and there's a lot of words... But I'm afraid I'm hesitant to try it. A more appealing and (potentially) inspiring story would be someone who wants to be normal, but gradually comes into his own- and with a mystical magical world, the possibilities for what that is are endless.

I want to know, does he ever get over that desire in this fic? Does he excel? Or will this be a continuous theme, as I assume?
