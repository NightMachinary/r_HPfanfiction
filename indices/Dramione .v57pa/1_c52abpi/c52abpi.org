I've been on Hawthorn and Vine a couple months now, and seeing your post here was the first I'd heard of The Fallout. WOW. I am nearly done with it now and it is AMAZING.

I love Dramione and it's hard to find good, well-written ones where the characters aren't majorly OOC. Do you have any other recommendations?
