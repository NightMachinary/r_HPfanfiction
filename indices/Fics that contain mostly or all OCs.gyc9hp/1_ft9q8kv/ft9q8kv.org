I'm working on a fic with two OC viewpoint characters in the founders era! The founders and (later) Helena Ravenclaw and the still-alive Bloody Baron are characters, but theres so little of them in canon that they're basically OCs anyway.

It's set a few decades into the history of Hogwarts rather than detailing the founding of the school, with two students from different backgrounds coming to the school in a time of huge turmoil.

There's currently three chapters posted, but I have three more written and am keeping a pretty regular two week schedule. It will eventually be pretty long! Probably a couple of hundred thousand.

If this sounds like your thing, check it out! linkao3(23957842)
