Linkffn(13098062)

That's my WIP. Original plot with ideas and figures taken from Celtic myth (no actual gods, just legends translated into historical witches and wizards). There are duels, dark magics, obscure motivations and costly losses. The main character is a younger, more ruthless Dumbledore-type fighting her very own immortal nemesis.

I also know of linkffn(Starnlicht), which is complete. I still need to read it, but I remember liking the writing from the outset, when I skimmed the beginning.
