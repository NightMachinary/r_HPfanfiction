A lot of tribal people had kings or chieftains, not for the sake of land distribution, but for the sake of following a strong leader. And, especially without codified laws such as ours, monarchies make succession clear. By having a known heir for a few decades, you prevent a lot of the cases where people fight for power.

Nevermind that until 1692, the worlds were not separated. The "opt-in" government was not an issue, they had no issue with following a Muggle King (albeit probably with a lot of autonomy). Outside of England, a few city states and to a lesser degree, the Netherlands and Sweden, there was no parliamentary tradition. Monarchy was the way to go for 95% of magical Europe.
