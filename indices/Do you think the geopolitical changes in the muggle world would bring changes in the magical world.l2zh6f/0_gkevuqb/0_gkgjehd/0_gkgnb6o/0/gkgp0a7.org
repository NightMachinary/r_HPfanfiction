Before the SoS it wasn't illegal to show a muggle magic. That is very different from all magicals being eager subjects of the muggle monarchs. The Wizengamot is named after the Witenagemot, which was the Saxon council of lords. It it therefore plausable to suggest that this institution, and therefore at least some element of wizarding self-rule, predates the Norman conquest. Remember that the wizarding world is a lot smaller than the muggle one, and therefore can afford to be more flexible in its governing structure.
