I don't feel the magical world could support monarchies at all. The premise of the feudal system was that the King owned all the land, and then gave it out in return for money/soldiers to enforce his rule with. The magical world just seems too small and decentralised for that to work with. As far as I can tell if you have a wand you are functionally self sufficient, and there is no way of stopping somebody apparating into a random field, putting up muggle repelling charms and living out their entire life without anybody else finding them. Any form of magical governance had to be opt-in, which explains how it was so easy for Voldemort to take over the ministry. With the exception of those who worked there or were being specifically hunted, the most that affected people was who was responsible for stopping shoplifters in Diagon Alley.
