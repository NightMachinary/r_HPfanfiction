Honestly, it is much easier to just use the 1692 borders and roll with that. The war of Spanish succession is perhaps the last conflict which might have bled over.

Personally, I think that most magical nations are still monarchies. The changes which led to democracy (agricultural, industrial and medical revolution) are irrelevant to the magical world, as are most other issues which led to the abolishment of monarchies.

That is not to say that the magical world is full of absolute monarchies, but at least the leadership would pass along the royal line. After all, the separation of the worlds was about secrecy, not about changing government forms.

  One particularly interesting point is, what do you think would happen to magicals in countries that were colonised?

Most of these places would never have been magically colonised. After all, you separated the worlds in 1692. There would be a few trading exclaves in Asia, but those are outposts at most. The only place which would be interesting is North America because there would be no US. Because even if, for some reason, the British colonies revolted, most of the land is French or Spanish claimed. And with magic, it is a lot easier to project force. The French could leverage their whole Auror force to put down a colonial revolt and be back for lunch rather than having them unavailable for months. The Spanish colonial Empire is a lot harder to judge. After all, they lost it because they were devasted by a lot of wars before Napoleon delivered the coup de grace. All of that has never happened in the magical world.

Edit:

Also, quite a few places would have no nations since that concept was only introduced there by imperialism and the independence movements afterwards. Places like Australia come to mind.
