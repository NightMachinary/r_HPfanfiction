My own theory is very similar to yours in the beginning. I too believe that in order for thr SoS to be adopted, it probably would've been in practice for much longer and it was only enacted to hold people accountable and tie up lose ends. That's one of the pillars on which international conventions developed in the past.

With regards to Monarchies, the Divine origin theory was the predominant theory in place with the development of state. One of the reasons why rulers were closely associated with the clergy. They told people they were sent by god to rule.

I don't believe that Wizards would bow to an individual without magic or believe in that theory and hence would have broken off a bit earlier. They would have started off as their own small societies hidden away and grown from there.

Also the persecution of magicals by the religious would make more sense if they refused to follow their orders or be under their control.

I don't believe that magicals were colonised either. I believe they would have escaped or hidden their resources away if only to spite the colonisers or.to protect their own heritage.

However in Asia and Africa, particularly India and China, as per the religious stories and faith, magic appears more integrated into the culture. So how it would have turned out there is still something to see.
