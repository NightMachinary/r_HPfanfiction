I like this as a very interesting thought experiment of how societies could have developed given different pressures. My reading is that the Statute of Secrecy was officially enforced by European wizards from 1692. Logically, for it to have been enforceable, the societies must already have been completely separate, probably for a long time before that and then waited for the final holdouts to die off before codifying it. So I say the last major influences of the muggle world would have been in 1600 or so.

I can't see wizards being major colonisers even before the SoS as the major driving force behind emigration from Europe was escaping from persecution and lack of economic opportunity. For wizards you just need to apparate into a random field, set up muggle-repelling charms and you are set for life. No need to cross the Atlantic for that.

Therefore the fate of magical communities in colonised areas would have been dependent on how much collateral damage they suffered from the subjugation of their muggle counterparts. In the Americas they may have been mostly wiped out by the plagues and genocides, or left untouched healing and hiding themselves with magic. In places with long standing existing 'civilisation' like China and India, they probably were already mostly separated from the muggle world, if only because one day they decided they didn't want to pay taxes, and so stayed like that.

I think that most geopolitical shifts after the SoS would have passed them by, unless you headcannon that there were some magicals working with muggle leadership to impose them. On the other hand hundreds of years of history would have led them to have their own politics. Drawing magical boarders from the late stages of an EUIV game would be as valid as anything, and probably quite fun. Maybe the Catholic Church, which must know about magic, decided to annex Greece, or the British Isles is a single magical nation because a group of Irish wizards conquered England using mercenaries payed for with Leprechaun gold. Then when the mercenaries realised they had been tricked and were out for revenge, the Irish were only saved by the intervention of a fearsome clan of Welsh dragon tamers, and swore fealty in return. Go wild.
