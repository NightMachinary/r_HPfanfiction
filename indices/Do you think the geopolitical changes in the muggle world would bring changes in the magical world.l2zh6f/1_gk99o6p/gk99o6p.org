It has to? Surely? Flamethrower, the author if you've read any of their stuff, really goes in heavy on all the geopolitics of magic so most of my opinions are based on their stories.

But countries with a monarchy surely have a "wizard lord" person? Like Merlin was to Arthur? The Ministry has a "Muggle Government" section. I can only assume that whatever the Muggle country does, the Wizard community has to follow since the Muggles are bigger and more numerous and don't have to hide anything. So I'd a country changes hands, the wizards have to adapt.

Perks of Harry Potter taking place on an island instead of central europe. No border problems. ....Let's not talk about Irish wizards....

The international statute, is kinda dumb and full of holes since Muggleborns are a thing right? If there's 1 witch in a family of 5 and we assume all those siblings then know that magic exists? That's not many generations until everyone has a cousin with magic right? And it only works if literally every single country agrees to do it, otherwise we'd be seeing wizards whenever we went on holiday? Or at the very least talking to locals who knew wizards?

I don't know about colonisation but I can only assume they went the same way as muggle colonisations because you know, racism.
