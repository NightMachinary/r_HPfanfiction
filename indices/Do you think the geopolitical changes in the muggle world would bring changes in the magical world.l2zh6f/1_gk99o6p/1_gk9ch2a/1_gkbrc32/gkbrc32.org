I never really liked this. It cheapens the whole idea of wands just for the sake of trying to give Uagadou some brownie points.

Not even Dumbledore and Voldemort, despite having seen all kinds of magic all over, decided to ditch their wands in favour of going wandless.

There might be some advantages, like not being disarmed (unless it happens quite literally), but I like to think that the average well-trained wand user can stomp the average well-trained wandless user.

The main, seven-books canon lean heavily in favour of wands fine-tuning wizards' magic. Hell, not being able to use a wand is one of the biggest reasons behind the goblins' butthurt-ness.
