Well I get the need to adapt, but I'm wondering how far the change would go if it happened.

Arthur had Merlin, yes, but that was a different age altogether in comparison to the near 1600s. By that time, monarchies were losing power. I'm not sure when Magna Carta came in place in Britain. So it's not necessary that monarchies were supported by the Wizards. There's a high likelihood the magicals had disassociated themselves by thay point and had begun avoiding muggles.

If you look at countries in Africa, Latin America or Middle East, Greece, Indian Subcontinent, all these places underwent changes in regime and administration on a regular basis. Be it at a tribal level, city level or larger.

Isn't it possible that magicals would've gone further into seclusion to avoid being subjected to problems or having their powers misused, and thereby hidden their magic from muggles?

With respect to Colonialism, I'm not so sure. The Wiki describes the African school to be powerful, users of wandless magic and all the students are animagii. So I'm not sure Colonial wizards, if they existed, would've been able to subjugate them as easily as muggles.

Thanks for the fic. I'll definitely check it out.
