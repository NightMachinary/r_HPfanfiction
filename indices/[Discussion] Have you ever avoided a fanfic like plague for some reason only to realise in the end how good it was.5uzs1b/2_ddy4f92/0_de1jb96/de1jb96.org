It was great! I just read this after avoiding it for the same reason. I felt emotional sometimes, so the writing was quality. It had messages and plot and ended up being original as fuck. Definitely dragged and I took three days to read it because of it. I don't know if I have interest reading the sequel though. I'm full thanks. That being said I don't think it's one I'll ever read again like some of my favs.
