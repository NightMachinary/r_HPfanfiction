I kept avoiding Backwards with Purpose like the plague because I generally don't like HP/GW stories, but I finally gave in because time travel is my favorite trope. I was pleasantly surprised, it did a pretty good job, not my ultimate favorite or anything but it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. It even had some feels that stuck with me even now when I can't remember most of the plot, like Mrs. Weasley not sending Harry a Weasley sweater. I thought it dragged on a little towards the end (or maybe it was in the sequel?) but overall it was pretty good considering I was so sure I was going to hate it.
