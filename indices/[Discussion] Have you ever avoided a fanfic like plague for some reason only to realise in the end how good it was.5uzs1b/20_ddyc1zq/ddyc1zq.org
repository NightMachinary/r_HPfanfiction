I have a sort of related story. I am incredibly slow when it comes to starting. For some fics, it's because I just don't want to drop the five consecutive hours reading, get engrossed, and reach the last update from two years ago right in the middle of the story.

For some, it's because I'm currently struggling to write a fic, and don't want to read something /too/ similar for fear of it either draining my motivation or driving me into a corner and writing something different to avoid becoming a poor copy.

That turned out to be a well-founded fear. Not too long ago I decided to start reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House][this]], thinking I had got myself situated enough that it wasn't too big a deal. I got through the second paragraph before I just about had a stroke. I knew Slytherin girl who occasionally crossed the line wasn't particularly original. I knew establishing it by having them knock somebody out for a good cause wasn't particularly original. [[http://i.imgur.com/pgbNoEe.png][I did a triple take when I realized her name.]]

So I'm still avoiding a lot of fics like the plague.
