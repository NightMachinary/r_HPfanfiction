I avoided linkffn(Forging the Sword) even though it's recommended in every thread about "good stories I've might not have read". I picked it up on a day I was sick because I had nothing else to do, and while it isn't one of my favorites, I enjoyed it.

Unfortunately I have still avoided some fics with female!Harry or harems and most of HP/GW or HP/HG.
