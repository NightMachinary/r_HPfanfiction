That's kind of neat. I really like the pairing, but I /really/ couldn't get into this story the first few tries despite it being lauded in that corner of the fanbase because of the incorrect usage of emdash and semicolon in the summary, the randomly capitalized letters, and the unexplained OP Harry at the beginning. It seemed too farfetched, but when I finally read to the explanation, I rubbed my hands and was like, "I can work with /this/."
