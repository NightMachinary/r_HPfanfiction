I avoided [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] because I usually hate OP!Harry and am not into HP/TR fics - I just don't want to see Voldemort redeemed. But I gave this fic a chance through chapter 4, as was recommended to me and I'm so glad I did! The world building and politics were awesome and the harry/Voldemort relationship was interesting and believable. Linkao3(439865)
