[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] and [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] are 2 huge surprises. I never thought I could enjoy reading Bellatrix as the main character, and I never thought HP story would work in a non-magical setting.
