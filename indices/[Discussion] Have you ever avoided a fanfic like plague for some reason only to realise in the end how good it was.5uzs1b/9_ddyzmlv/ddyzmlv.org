I got confused between Starfox5 and Stargon1. I'd read the cupboard series and wasn't impressed, and then I avoided reading Starfox5's stories for the better part of a year.

I didn't understand how the same guy who'd written Richard Castle, Watcher(I'd read it on questionablequesting, before I really got into the HP fandom) could write something as mediocre as the cupboard series.

After realizing my mistake, I read Patron, and loved it, and now I'm reading The Dark Lord Never Died. They're both pretty original, and awesome. The ideas sound cliched, but the execution is great.
