linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle; The Pureblood Pretense) were two fics that I originally avoided, simply because I fem!Harry just felt terribly strange. (Most of the fics I read had your generic DLP protagonist.)

I'm /so glad/ I eventually read them. Instantly hooked. The writing quality far exceeded anything I had read before. Alexandra Quick has become my all-time favorite by a long shot, hands-down. And The Pureblood Pretense is easily in my top-10 favorites.
