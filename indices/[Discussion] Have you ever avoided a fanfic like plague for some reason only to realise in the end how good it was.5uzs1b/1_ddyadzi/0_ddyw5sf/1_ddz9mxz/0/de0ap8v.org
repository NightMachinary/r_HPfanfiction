I just don't understand why it has to be a flower name at all. They could just use Harri or Harriet. I can stand literally any kind of offshoot of the name "Harry" but anything else (that isn't blatantly ridiculous, I just read a story where Harry called himself Lex Luthor for shits and giggles and I wasn't bothered) just comes off to me like "Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way" and totally unnecessary on top of it.
