Yes. I avoided Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches for a long time, despite its good rep at this sub, because I'm not into harem and WBWL. In fact, I don't even recall reading a fic with elements like these before DPSW. But one day I was really bored and thought "well... why not". Ended up finishing it in a few days and really enjoyed it.
