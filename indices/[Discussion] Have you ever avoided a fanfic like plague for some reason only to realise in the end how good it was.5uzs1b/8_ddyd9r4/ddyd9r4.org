As a reader, It took me a lot of time to click on /Make A Wish, Wands and Shields, Junior Inquisitor, Firebird trilogy and Seventh Horcrux/, but I quite liked them after I read them.

Honestly, its FFN's stupid 400 character limit on the summaries which is at fault. No one can summarize such long fics in so few characters, so dozens of decent stories get skipped over because their summaries aren't good enough. It's honestly dumb.
