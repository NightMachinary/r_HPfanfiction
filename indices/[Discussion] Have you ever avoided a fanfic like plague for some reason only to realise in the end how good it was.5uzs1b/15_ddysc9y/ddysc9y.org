I've always avoided The death of today. Something about "arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy/ unusually intelligent/recruited by DE and unspeakables at young age" led me to believe that it is your usual abused!super!harry type of fic. I'm glad that I was wrong, it's a wonderful story. linkffn(5402147)
