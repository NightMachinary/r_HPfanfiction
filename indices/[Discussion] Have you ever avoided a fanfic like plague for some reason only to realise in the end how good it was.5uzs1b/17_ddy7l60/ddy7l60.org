I avoided *Abraxas* linkffn(11580650) for years as Harry/Ginny is not my pairing of choice (I have canon for that), but an author I like had it on their favorites list (and they only had about ten on there to begin with) so I finally checked it out about six months ago. I was completely blown away by just how good that it was.

I had gotten used to Harry/Ginny fics being Ginny worship a la most things on Sugar Quill from back in the day, and this definitely was /not/ it. Heavily fleshed out characters, decent world building, and a nice plot. It didn't make me into a Harry/Ginny fan, but I don't disregard those stories out of hand now.
