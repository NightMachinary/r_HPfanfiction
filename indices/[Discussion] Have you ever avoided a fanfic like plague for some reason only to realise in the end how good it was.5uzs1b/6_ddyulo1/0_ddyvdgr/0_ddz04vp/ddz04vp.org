It's a good question. It mostly hinged on me being unable to take the name Milo seriously (Milo is a drink/chocolate powder where I live and to me seemed very strange for the name of a character) and as at the time I was only looking to read serious/non-crack I instinctively avoided Harry Potter and the Natural 20, even though it was recommended as being suprisingly heartfelt at times.
