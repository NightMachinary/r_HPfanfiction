Oh god. I mean, I could, since I had all of my fics uploaded to HarryPotterFanFiction and FanFiction.Net for years before I took them down out of embarrassment, I managed to copy them all though. I'd like to think that even my Reddit comments can prove that I'm a better writer than I was as a child. People would comment that the characters were way too OOC and I'd cry, haha.
