Does reading back what I wrote as an 11 year old child count? Highlights include one fic being written like a script. In that same fic, I had Hermione's parents die because Voldemort killed them, Hermione sobbing all the time with McGonagall as her mentor, and all three of the Golden Trio lived with their teachers because Hogwarts was really dangerous. Oh, and I had Minerva turn into a phoenix for no reason other than the fact that Dumbledore was giving her an order. Sadly, it just gets worse from there. My 11 year old self just wrote whatever came to mind, no plot at all. Maybe that itself was the plot twist. :P
