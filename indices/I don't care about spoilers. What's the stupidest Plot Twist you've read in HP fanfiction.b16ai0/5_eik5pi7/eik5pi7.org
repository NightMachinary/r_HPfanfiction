There was a a HP/ASOIAF crossover I was following that just completely lost the plot, started out as your typical wizard powerwank and gallivanting across the Essos with a pretty lady, not excellent but better than most crossovers. Then in the space of about 3 chapters it went from Harry the wizard badass and devolved into harems of freed slaves, boring home life and a truly creepy pedophilia angle out of nowhere, the author must have got bombarded because they just tied it all up with a summary of what they would have done after. If for some reason you want to witness the dumpster fire it turned into it was called The Last Hero's Heir, though I really couldn't recommend it.
