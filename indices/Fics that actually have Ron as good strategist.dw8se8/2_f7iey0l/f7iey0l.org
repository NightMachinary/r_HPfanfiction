It's been /years/, but a while back author theelderwand at HPFF wrote a couple of post-DH novels, /Children's Crusade/ and /Stop All the Clocks/, where he wrote Ron as a hero alongside Harry. They're still up on the site.

Caveat: there were a lot of things I did not care for in the fics, I think eldy took a lot of liberties with the trio's characterizations, and I found the Ron/Hermione interactions really OOC, which is a bummer because I am like the first mate of that ship and I love it when I find them written as a functional couple and Ron not turned into some kind of neglectful POS. Anyway, eldy makes it kind of a “ ‘Mione” sorta relationship on steroids if that makes any sense.

But, the thing I did like about what eldy did is that he recognized Ron as a great strategist, and the fics are action/adventure so it's in there plenty. Just keep in mind I haven't read the fics in like 8 years, but they did leave an impression on me for how respectfully he treated Ron. Also, IIRC, it gets a little AU.

I get your frustration. Ron's not a dumbass, he has a brain but as a teenager he is lazy and doesn't apply himself. You know, /like a teenager/.
