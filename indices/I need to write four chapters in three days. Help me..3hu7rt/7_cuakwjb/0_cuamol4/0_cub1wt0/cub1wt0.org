You could also play around more with unbalanced fights, where the different groups/individuals have different goals - for example, one person needs to destroy/steal an item, the other needs to find and protect it. Focusing a lot on someone's abilities to hide, sneak and ambush as well as maybe gather information from others. If there are a lot of pairs where there is no conflict in people outside the pairs, and no-one knows who their opponent is, could be very complex and exciting.
