Oh, and just an idea for the Room of Requirement fights. A battle in an icy mountain wasteland might be interesting. An extended one. Lasting 24 hours. With nothing but their wands to survive.

I can see you doing some really creative stuff with that. How do they survive? Food, wild (magical?) animals? A full day/night cycle? Guerilla attacks? Cooperation, with betrayal?

It would really strain members of a team and introduce a lot of tension. I think it would be awesome. Kind of like Lord of the Flies, but in an icy mountain wasteland-like area with magic and battles.
