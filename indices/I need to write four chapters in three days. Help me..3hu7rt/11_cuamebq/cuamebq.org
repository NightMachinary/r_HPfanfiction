Bruh.

I've been following your stuff since back when Portkey.org was relevant. That's a /loooong/ time. (loljk to Harmony fans)

It's been a pleasure. Really. In fact, HBS is one fic of four that gave me the kick up the arse to start writing too. It's almost a certainty that more than one person out there feels the same way.

That being said, only two things are certain in this world. You want to end it, and we want to see the conclusion. You've made your availability public now, so that should be more motivation than anything. We all hate those fans who think your life revolves around them getting updates on time, but we all like to keep our inboxes nice and airy, lol.

As for Robst, what's not to like? If Drake is 6 God, then that makes him F God. Downvote if you dare. :E
