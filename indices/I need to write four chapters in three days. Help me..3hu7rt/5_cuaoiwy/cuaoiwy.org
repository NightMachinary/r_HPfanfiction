One thing I use to write is to set a deadline/schedule. I also tend to constantly make notes for future chapters and scenes, and write them down. That means I generally do not have much of writer's block to struggle with. Finally, I tend to define goals and means for the characters, then let them act, instead of structuring a plot, so I usually only have to ask myself "what would Harry do now? What would Hermione do? How would Voldemort react?" and half a chapter is just waiting to be typed out. It does mean that my planned plots run away from me often though.
