  What's an idea you want to write but know you will never be able to finish the idea?

It is a story element rather than an idea on its own.

So in the late 50's Tom Riddle knocked up some muggle girl, she then gives her daughter up for adoption. The baby is adopted by the Evens family, and they name the baby Lily. Where this come from in my mind is the whole Lily's sacrifice saves Harry bouncing curse nonsense. The explanation in the books is very bad so I had to solve it in my head another way. I think it wasn't just that Lily sacrificed herself, but a culmination of Voldemorts soul being so ravaged, and him killing his own daughter - which I think probably invokes some old family magic or something when he then tries to kill his grandson as well. I know 'family magic' isn't cannon, but is me giving some credence to the whole pureblood thing, they can't all be complete morons, they surely have a point of some sort. So in this story Harry would be a parselmouth by birth and not because he's a horcrux, Lily was too and either never figured it out, or never told anyone. Harry might not even be a horcrux, the evidence Dumbledore uses to reach this conclusion is that he's a parselmouth and how else would that be possible? I think a great story could be built around this idea, how it's found out, how people react.
