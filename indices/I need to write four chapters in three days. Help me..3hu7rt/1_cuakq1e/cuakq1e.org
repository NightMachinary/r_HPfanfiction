Kwan Li, Hogwarts Battle School is /awesome/. Every day you don't update, I die a little bit inside.

I think you're doing great! Check out linkffn(Magics of the Arcane), I find that it has the type of Harry you're going for and a really well done Dumbledore, with a great magic system and awesome worldbuilding.
