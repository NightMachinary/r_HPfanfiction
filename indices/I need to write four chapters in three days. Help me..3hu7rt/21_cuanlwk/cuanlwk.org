  What's an idea you want to write but know you will never be able to finish the idea?

1 A Harry / League of Legends crossover.

Problem: League of Legends Lore is the absolute worst. THX RIOT!

2 A Harry that joins the Riders of the Apocalypse after his death in the Forbidden Forest and roflstomps Voldemort as the Rider of Conquest. Never made more out of it than a dialouge between him and the Rider of Death.

3 The ultimate crossover. Employing a multiverse-setup I'd have Harry meet up with several other heroes from different worlds in order to destroy Darth Sidious. As far as I got I can say one thing with certainty: Its a Harry Potter / Toph Beifong pairing. The other stuff I got is just dialouge between Harry and several other characters (including: Avatar Aang and Toph [Avatar], Warchief Thrall and Sylvanas Windrunner [WoW], Geralt of Rivia [The Witcher], The Dragonborn [The Elder Scrolls], Gandalf [Lord of the Rings], Jim Raynor and (good) Kerrigan [Starcraft], Vi and Caitlyn [League of Legends], and so on and so forth.

Problem: Imagine the clusterfuck.
