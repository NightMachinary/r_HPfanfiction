Its horribly shallow and short. Most champions are described in simple terms of "He did that because of that and then joined the League", leaving them as complete blanks in terms of character or backstory. The same with the areas/nations the champions come from. The Shadow Isles were literally described with "nobody knows what the fuck is going on there - move along".

But you have to give Riot some leeway here. When the first Lore was made and the foundations of worldbuilding were done, they were a group of independent developer who built a new game onto "DotA Allstars". They were busy making the game work and had no time to think of storylines for their champions. When the second big wave of champions steadily rolled in they were building an E-Sport league. There was just no time and at that point, nobody really cared anyway. Players played because of the mechanics and gameplay, not because they loved to read about the champions they played with.

Riot tries to undo this nowadays. Their latest effort being the Bilgewater Event in three acts. Another example would be the remodelling of Lores around Shurima, following the introduction of the champion Azir.

But in the end, they only try. The stories are mediocre at best and merely give a narrow view of the champions' personalities. Enough if you're willing to work with near-OC's, not enough if you're searching for developed characters.
