I have an idea that I would /love/ to write but doubt I'll ever get to it. My own headcanon as to the disappearance of Sally Anne Perks. She stumbles upon the Room of Requirement in second year and while there gets petrified by the Basilisk. Because of the magic surrounding the particular room conjured, no one thinks to look for her, and it isn't until years later (during the Battle of Hogwarts? Or during Teddy's Hogwarts years maybe?) that someone finds her and realizes she's just petrified. They'll wake her up and she'll have to figure out how to navigate life after being frozen for so long.
