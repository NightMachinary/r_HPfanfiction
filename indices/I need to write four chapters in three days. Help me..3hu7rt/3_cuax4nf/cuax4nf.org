Warning: long comment incoming.

The most famous quote of Ender's Game is this: "In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them."

I would invert this quote. One of my own beliefs is that truly loving a book requires that you pursue a deep and thorough understanding of it, including not only its strengths but also its weaknesses. You don't love a book unless you feel a little let down that the author could have made the book more perfect yet failed. You describe yourself elsewhere in this thread as a self-hating author, and I think this is more or less the same thing. Authors that don't experience regret while writing might as well not be writing at all, imo.

Thus, although I love the Harry Potter books, I also feel free to criticize canon Harry as being rather passive and angsty. Although Flowers for Algernon is my favorite book overall, whenever I reread it I cringe at how incapable Charlie Gordon is of understanding social norms despite his supposed supergenius skills. And when I read Ender's Game, even though I love much about Ender's strong and individualistic character, I also recognize its flaws.

I think Hogwarts Battle School does an excellent job rectifying some of the flaws in canon Harry Potter, by using Ender Wiggins as an inspiration. But I think Hogwarts Battle School also has the potential to rectify some of the flaws in canon Ender Wiggins, by using Harry Potter as an inspiration. This potential is so far mostly untapped, in my opinion. We have not seen much character development in your version of Harry Potter, or at least not as much as we could potentially be seeing. Your character is a lot more like Ender Wiggin possessing Harry Potter's body than like Harry Potter possessing Ender Wiggin's mind. I would prefer more of a balance.

Here is a link to an in-depth critique of Ender's Game that I've found very interesting: [[http://somethingshortandsnappy.blogspot.com/search/label/Ender%27s%20Game?updated-max=2013-04-08T20:27:00-04:00&max-results=20&start=21&by-date=false]] I don't agree with all the arguments made by this critique. I think sometimes they miss the point on purpose, because the reviewer assumes a certain social justice oriented lens of seeing the world that I distrust. Nonetheless, overall I really like this review. It helped me to better understand Ender's Game, to both destroy and mentally recreate its meaning in my mind. Ender's Game is still one of my all time favorite books, but the sense in which I love it now is much more sophisticated than the sense in which I loved it a decade ago.

I think you also would benefit from reading these reviews. Here is one particular quote that really hit home with me, from its review of chapter 8:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "Ender Wiggin is ten times smarter and stronger than I am. What I'm doing to him will bring out his genius. If I had to go through it myself, it would crush me."
  #+end_quote

  How do you know that it will bring out his genius, Graff? It's never given you what you needed before. You've only had near-misses and flameouts. Is this how Mazer Rackham was trained? Actually, why isn't Mazer Rackham in charge of this training? What qualifications do you have that make you so sure your technique is the perfect recipe to make the ultimate military genius? In short, Hyrum Graff, who the fuck are you?

The way in which OSC writes is extremely compelling. In many ways that is wonderful, but it can blind us to certain important counterfactual questions. I'm hoping that you'll be able to use Hogwarts Battle School as a way to bridge the gap between two very different works of fiction, to capture and examine some of the strengths and weaknesses of both worldviews. With this sort of big picture theme in mind for your story, hopefully you'll be able to find some kind of inspiration that guides your writing from here on out.

Make Snape pathetic despite his strength, don't glamorize his failures. Treat ruthlessness as a form of weakness as often as you treat it as a form of strength. Don't fall into traps: question the assumptions of the source material even as you utilize them. For example, is it true that all geniuses must be tortured ones?

Here is another quote I found compelling (despite bias within it) from the review of chapter 13:

#+begin_quote
  EMPATHY EXPOSITION TIME.

  #+begin_quote
    "Being here alone with nothing to do, I've been thinking about myself, too. Trying to understand why I hate myself so badly."

    "No, Ender."

    "Don't tell me 'No, Ender.' It took me a long time to realize that I did, but believe me, I did. Do. And it came down to this: In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him."
  #+end_quote

  What was I saying about unearned characterisation earlier? He murdered Stilson because he didn't understand the difference between bullying and gladiatorial arenas. He made Bonzo's hatred of him worse and worse over the years because he didn't know or care to know what mattered to Bonzo. And he was able to kill him in the end, not because he understood everything that mattered to Bonzo, but because he knew how to goad Bonzo into a disadvantage. That took a bit of taunting about honor, nothing more.

  Let's have at this a little deeper: if Ender truly understands someone, everything that matters to them, then why is he never able to offer them another way out? If he really got what made Bonzo tick, why was there a deathmatch instead of a speech saying 'I know what you really need, and here's how we can do this with neither of us dead'?

I absolutely love Hogwarts Battle School, but if you're going to set it apart from being just a better version of the standard super Harry fanwank, then you need to add a little something more to the direction that the story seems to be heading. This isn't to say that your Harry is overpowered, he's not. It's to say that unless you have some kind of poetic or social message underlying the story, your story will revolve around power and power alone, and in my opinion that would be something of a waste. Art needs both light and dark, your story does have both which is fantastic, but the light is rather scattered and incoherent. If the light aspects of the story were tied into some big overarching message about the importance of love and the weakness of individuality and faux-martyrdom, or anything else at all vaguely like that, this would be extra fantastic, regardless of whether you make this story a tragedy overall or you make it into a more traditional adventure heroism narrative.

Perhaps you are already trying to show the weaknesses of Ender's individuality and disregard for social concerns? Some things, like Harry's relationship with Hermione, do imply a bit of this. But in my opinion, you could do a better job of making this obvious and important and interesting. Don't just show the weaknesses of individuality, then, show the wonderfulness and strategic advantages involved in caring for others as well, how caring for others can strength the self through nourishment rather than through suffering.

I critique because I love.

TL;DR: next time you get stuck, try skimming these chapter reviews for inspiration.
