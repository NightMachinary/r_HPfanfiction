2 and a half chapters, so Chapters 48 and 49 are done while 50 is a little less than halfway written. I will probably withhold updating until I finish all of Book 2. While the longer wait might trouble some, It would be best for the continuity of that last arc.

Of course, no one hindered the process. Every bit of advice, every quote, every contribution helped.

The post from [[/u/chaosmosis]] was very inspiring though. It hit on a lot of ideas that I want to incorporate, so kudos to him/her.
