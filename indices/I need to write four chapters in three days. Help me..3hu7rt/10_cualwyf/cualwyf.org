When I'm writing, I like to use a lot of analogies. For example, when Harry finds a new friend, I write a couple of sentences somewhere about him seeing a bird flying away, only to be joined by a second one. When Harry is in turmoil emotionally, I set a scenario for him being in a wild landscape. A river flowing over rocks with a thundering noise. The story I'm writing now is kind of like an odyssey. Harry is shunned by everyone except for a couple of close friends. He searches for a home but can't find it anywhere.

Hence the river analogy. It's a journey that starts rocky but ends in calm waters as Harry finds his home in the world. Of course, Voldemort doesn't make it easy.

I'm rambling, but did it help?
