Hmm. Interesting question as I fall into the category of self-loathing writers, but I'll give it a shot.

I like to think I'm proud of writing my characters in such a way that they behave in a believable manner. I do my very best to have a cause and an explanation for their actions instead of shoehorning what they do into the plot. I don't always pull it off, but I think I do more times than not.
