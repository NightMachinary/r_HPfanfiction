Well, you're haven't responded to anything in two hours, which is a good sign :D

Anyway, right there with you. Getting my wisdom teeth out today, so I'm sticking to stationary hobbies that won't spill a mouthful of blood in someone's face. I've only got a chapter and a half left; I'm just a notoiously slow writer and this chapter I'm on is probably the hardest I've ever had to write (writing unreliable narrators epiphanies are fun). Have you ever known exactly what you wanted to write, but actually executing it is a headache and a half and you'd almost rather outsource it to a hundred monkeys on typewriters? That's the feeling.
