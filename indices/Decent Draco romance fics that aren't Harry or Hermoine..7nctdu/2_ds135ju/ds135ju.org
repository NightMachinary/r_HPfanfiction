[[https://dgficexchange.livejournal.com/99388.html][The Good People]]: Draco/Ginny. My favorite thing about this story is its uniquely engaging narrative voice that so seamlessly interweaves angst and misery and wry observations and its continuously dry humor. Both amusing and evocative, the story is about Draco's post-war struggles through his personal demons, addictions and the past that he can't run from.

The Malfoy Case - linkffn(10202355) - Draco/Astoria. Case fic, primarily deals with Draco's efforts to overcome his family's influence and stand on his own feet.

Within These Walls - linkao3(927466) - Draco/Seamus. Set in Carrow-era Hogwarts. A clandestine romance set in the background of so much fear and uncertainty, one of my favorites.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=14482&chapter=1][Better When We're Together]] - Slytherin Ron, Draco/Ron. Makes a reasonably convincing case for an out-of-place Weasley developing feelings for an obnoxious, petty, prejudiced Malfoy.

the albatross did follow - linkffn(11128944) - Action focused Draco/Ginny. Draco and Ginny are stuck in an oil painting in which they relive the same events over and over again. Ginny's gotta find a way to break the enchantment.
