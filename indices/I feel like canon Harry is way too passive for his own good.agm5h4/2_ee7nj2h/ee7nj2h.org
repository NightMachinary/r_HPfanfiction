In canon, Harry really does luck his way into almost everything that happens to him. Like in book 1, it's almost offputting how often it happen. He just walks around randomly and comes across plot relevant shit.

-Accidentally comes across the troll

-Accidentally comes across Fluffy

-Accidentally comes across the Mirror of Erised

-Accidentally comes across Voldemort in the woods

-Accidentally comes across Snape nursing his wounds from Fluffy

-Accidentally comes across Snape meeting with Quirrell after dark (twice I think!)

-Accidentally learns that Flamel is involved because of Hagrid

So yeah, I guess it's hard to be "competent" when the plot just falls into your lap. And this is true for more than just the first book.
