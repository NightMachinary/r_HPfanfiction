It's frustrating to me that the troll incident happened because Rowling had to force a situation in which Hermione became friends with Harry and Ron. I mean, I've used the "There's just some things you can't go through and not end up as friends" (paraphrasing) line from the end of the troll chapter in fan fic to parallel a non canon friendship with the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but it's kind of a terrible way to start a friendship. If she was going to force it anyway, why not just force it from the start when they met on the train.
