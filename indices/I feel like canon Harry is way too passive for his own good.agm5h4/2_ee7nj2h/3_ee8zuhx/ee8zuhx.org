Another commenter noted the difference between "acting" and "reacting", and how character growth can be shown by moving from reacting to stimulus, to acting with agency. Ideally, eleven year old Harry reacts to most things and would come across information and bad guys mostly by luck. As he grows, he would begin taking more initiative.

What we see instead is everyone else taking initiative and Harry usually remaining reactive, or having his attempts at acting with agency curtailed. Hermione has the idea to start the DA, and by the time Harry is really into it, Umbridge discovers them. Harry is suspicious of Draco in HBP, but is discouraged from investigating and all but told to be a good boy and not worry by Dumbledore
