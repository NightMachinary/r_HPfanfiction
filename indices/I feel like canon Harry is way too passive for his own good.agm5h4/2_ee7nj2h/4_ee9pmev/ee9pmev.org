OP is referring to Harry's moping and general lethargy in sixth year. After getting a taste of battle and becoming aware of the fact that Voldemort won't rest until Harry lies dead at his feet, Harry decides to focus on Quidditch and girls, when just a year before, he was actually doing his part in preparing for war, albeit in a minor way.
