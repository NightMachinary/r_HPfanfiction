That's a good point Harry is both the chosen one and the Everyman. That said, I don't love most of the DH plot, but I don't think Harry is inconsistent between the patronus stuff and the horcrux hunt.

There's a huge difference between going to a trusted adult figure and developing a skill/solution to a problem versus being thrust into an open-ended, frustrating, and extremely dangerous set of tasks. Just because Harry took charge and found a good solution one time doesn't mean it's inconsistent he didn't another time in different circumstances.
