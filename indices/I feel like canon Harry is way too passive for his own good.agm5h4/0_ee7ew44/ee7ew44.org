I'd say what I was once told in a similar thread.

JK Rowling kept juggling between making Harry "the chosen one" and "a common man". She also had a habit of pushing the plot forward instead of what the characters are likely to do.

Think about this. Harry took it upon himself to learn the Patronus charm just because Dementors where being a nuisance to his games [Probably an exaggeration]. The same Harry would be chilling out in later books especially when a Dark Lord was after him.\\
The first case was the chosen one determined and active about his goal. The other case is a common man baffled and helpless because he never deserved it nor knows how to do it.

This switch keeps happening in the series often. Especially the end, where Harry entirely wins by luck [common man] but makes a point to give a big monologue about how the villain had been wrong all along [chosen hero].

So, we can say as the series progressed Harry started to "react" often instead of "act" ing. Generally, it should be reversed, Where the reactor gets more fed up and starts to act instead of waiting.
