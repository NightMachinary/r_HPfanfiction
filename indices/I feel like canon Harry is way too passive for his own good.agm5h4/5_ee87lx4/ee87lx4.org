Well the message of the books seems to be "If you have sufficiently efficient allies, you can basically be useless and still win". To me the books showcase that you can be a hero without being extraordinary and so everyone can. A nice message but highly unrealistic.

We often see in fics that Ron wants to get out of his brothers' shadow all the while being lazy. But we forget that Harry really wants to beat Voldemort since the end of 5th year without putting anymore effort that before. In fact his most effortful year was maybe the third when learning the Patronus. One could thing that after losing Sirius and learning the prophecy he would be more motivated to learn the most he could and improve but the sad truth is that he didn't even prepare to go on the Horcrux Hunt even after Dumbledore's death. The 7th book should really have been called "Hermione Granger and the two (mostly) useless boys".

Sure he has courage and can basically get some magical survival instinct out of his butt when he really needs it but he's at most average. Lot of fics tell how Harry is humble and says he had help and luck and his friends all say "No you have strength and courage and you're still amazing" but in reality, he has luck and people helping him (if not doing things for him) all the way. Maybe too much. It's nice to read at first or when young but with hindsight it's a bit miserable to see such lack of motivation and will in face of such destiny.

Again the message was more likely to show that everyone can be a hero, that love prevails and that you can't do squat without friends and family. Nice message and not fundamentally wrong. But in the real world Harry would most likely be eaten by the hard truth that is if you don't give yourself the means to success, don't complain when life give you radioactive lemons.
