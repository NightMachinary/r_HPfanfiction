Plus, the fact that Harry is rather lazy when it comes to his magical studies (I mean he basically doesn't give a shit.) isn't helped by the fact that he's in a school that....really doesn't seem to care about educating.

The Defense curse notwithstanding...Dumbledore hires Lockhart, an act which cheats his students out of an entire year of education, all to expose him as a fraud? Like really Albus? You couldn't think of ANY other way to achieve that without sacrificing the time of the children under your care?

Then you have Snape. A man who is, on one hand, probably the very best at what he does. Then on the other...he's a deeply bitter man who utterly despises teaching. How many would be potioneers do you think Snape just crushed all interest out of?

It's always weird to crack open Philosopher's stone and see Harry not only willingly opening his magical texts, but god damn EAGER to do so.

I'd rather the Books excise fucking Quidditch entirely and instead show Harry learning and exploring magic on his own. We are told over and over that Harry is REALLY good at defense against the Dark arts, that it's the one subject he really likes, but we are shown.....nothing? At best Harry comes across as knowing the same three spells he uses ad nauseum. Stupify, Expecto Patronum, and of course Expelliarmus.

Of course, when he learns an actual effective curse, Sectumsempra, he never bothers to use it again. Because /GASP!/ the last thing we would want in a FUCKING WAR, is for our dear Hero to /whimper/ Hurt someone.
