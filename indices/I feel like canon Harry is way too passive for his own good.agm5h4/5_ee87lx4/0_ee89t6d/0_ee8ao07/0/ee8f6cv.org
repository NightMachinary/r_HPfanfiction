I mean, I can understand not going out of your way to kill. It makes sense, and Harry isn't a solider after all. But the series I grew up on was the Animorphs....and they fucked yeerks up.

But there comes a point, when your enemies are tossing out concentrated death and torture in blast form, that you really need something more then "Imma knock your stick out of your hand."

But in the end, it all comes down to how Rowling thinks. We don't see Harry try to absorb as much magic as he can, become as good as he can, simply because she didn't feel it was important.

Which, to be honest, what more could we expect out of someone who seriously push the power of love?
