Damn right. Of course it's a children's book (well maybe not children but teens?) but that show its limitation (and again that's debatable, Inheritance is also plenty good for teens and Eragon kills... a lot). How can anyone (not only Harry) think that it would be a good idea not to kill your enemies that want to torture and kill you and all your family/friends but instead to stun them and give them to be put in custody of a corrupt government which will free them given enough pressure and/or money. It's a war... in these situation a good enemy is a dead enemy.

It's to bang your head against the walls... all the walls... at the same time
