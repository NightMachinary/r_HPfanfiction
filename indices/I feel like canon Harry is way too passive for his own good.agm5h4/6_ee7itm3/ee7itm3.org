  The competent Harry from fanfic sure can be OP
#+end_quote

It's funny that canon characters keep yapping about how Divination is wonky all the time, but the ridiculous not-martyr walk is enabled because of a line from a prophecy. That same prophecy also says that the child will marked as an equal to the Dark Lord - so, making Harry (or Neville, in those fics) OP for their age isn't so bad, as long as the author remembers the gap in experience between the chosen child and Voldemort.
