But why WOULD he question anything and not be passive?

He was raised in an environment that discouraged such behavior, vocally and even violently at times. I mean, if you were raised by the Dursleys and treated the way he was, would you take life by the horns? No. You have been conditioned to be passive, to let others make the choices for you, and not to rock the boat.

In fact if anything, canon Harry is less passive than I would expect from a child raised the way he was, and likely that has to do with "magic" giving him a way to distinguish himself from the Dursley's and "separate" himself from who he was, opening up new possibilities.

I enjoy fanfics where he is more take charge, or at least, much less passive and not like canon, so I agree that canon Harry being more passive is less interesting. But to a large degree, that's what makes fan fiction great. Exploring BEYOND the bounds of canon. But that does not change the reality of Harry in canon and the mental and emotional aspects of his childhood and who he came to be because of it.
