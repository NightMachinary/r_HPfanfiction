  The competent Harry from fanfic sure can be OP, or way too mature for his age, but its just so much more satisfying to see him grow and really be in control of himself than to just see him react to his own life, so to speak.

  Anyone else feels the same?

I'm in the same boat.

The over-competence and over-maturity problems are very real though, and something that generally turns me off a fic.

But I'm still always on the lookout for fics that make Harry more inquisitive, imaginative, and independent without all the Lord Potter-X-Y-Z-Black and level 9000 magical core stuff.

There are just so many things he just passes by or ignores in canon, so many possibilities to explore.
