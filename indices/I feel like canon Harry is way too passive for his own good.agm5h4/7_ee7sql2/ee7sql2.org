My problem is not so much that he's passive, it's that I feel that he's a bit of a bland character in general. In the first 4 books he barely shows any personality except for generic hero traits like being "brave" and "kind". I think that he started having more definite traits in the last 3 books though.

That being said, it's a common trope for stories like this to have a bit of a bland protagonist so I think Rowling did it on purpose.
