One thing that he is shown to be is sarcastic. He makes a great many sarcastic smart-mouthed remarks in the books.

He has a general lack of trust in adults. The exceptions are Hagrid, who he doesn't treat as an adult, and Dumbledore, who Hagrid all but worships. He does go to McGonagall as a last resort, is dismissed, then gives up on them.

He adores flying. It's a major, definining part of his character.

If he's told he has to learn about something, he digs his heels in every time. If told he's not allowed to learn about something, he'll go to great lengths to find out.

He likes treacle tart, chocolate frogs, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms and Transfiguraton. He is indifferent to Astronomy and Herbology and strongly dislikes the rest. He doesn't like the Chudley Cannons but doesn't feel confident enough to support another team, in the face of Ron's obvious fantasism, or is much less interested in Quidditch than he is in a) beating Slytherin and b) getting to fly lots.

If he /wants/ to learn something, he works really hard and picks it up quickly. He hands his homework in on time and doesn't get into trouble for not doing it, but he puts it off fairly often, and he never tries to get into any 'extra credit' work or club. When he learns, it's for a definite, limited purpose, not because he's trying to please authority figures. Intelligent and not really lazy, but not exactly enthused by the idea of academic achievement.

He's very vulnerable to parental figures. Moody says once that he'd make a good auror and that idea gets a hold on him and is still there at the end of book five. Sirius offers him a home after breaking Ron's leg, and he jumps on the chance. Consistently, ideas of family have the strongest pull on him.

He also has a 'saving people thing' where he takes everything on himself and won't seek help and then acts impulsively, which leads to adventure but is less 'brave' and 'kind' than mildly pathological. There's no reason for him to decide he needs to save the Philosopher's Stone. Arguably, he made things worse. He just gets a bee in his bonnet that somehow it's all on him, and that same idea is consistent in all the books. Quite often, if he'd sought help, things would have worked out better all round.

What he /isn't/, is wildly enthusiastic about anything except Gryffindors winning, Slytherins and especially Malfoy losing and flying. I think that's what makes him bland. He has a definite personality, just not the personal drive or enthusiasm that make people engaging.
