This. So much! I've always loved the books, even if some of the characters were dumb or annoying. Because everyone is so human and imperfect, making dumb decisions or just not making any and running away from the actual problem. It's all part of growing up, and why these books are so well loved and talked about even now, over 20years after their original release. All of Rowling's characters are flawed and a bits of good and bad inside them, which contrasts so well with Voldemort as a villain because he embodies the extremes of antisocial personality disorder. So someone with a mental health problem who cannot feel how other people feel is a perfect villian.
