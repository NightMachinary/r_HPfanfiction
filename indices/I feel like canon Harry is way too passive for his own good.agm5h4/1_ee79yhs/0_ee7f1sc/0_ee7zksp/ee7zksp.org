Voldemort reminds me more of Ridley Scott's aliens

" You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility [...] I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."

In any well written fanfic, where the heroes interact with Riddle, he tends to provide the most useful, coldest, practical and unsentimental advice. Not even tainted by Snape's bitterness.
