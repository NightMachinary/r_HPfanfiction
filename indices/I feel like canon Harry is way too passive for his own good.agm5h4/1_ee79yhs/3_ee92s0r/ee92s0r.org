That's a really good point about the tent. It always seemed like they were just stalling - I haven't thought about it in a while, but now that you mention it, I know /exactly/ that feeling after having been through grad school. There's a huge task hanging over your head that's amorphous and terrifying and you don't know what you're doing and you don't feel like you're qualified and have no idea where to even start and there'a a constant paralyzing sense of doom hanging over you all the time. So you do stalk some. You do things that are maybe tangentially related so you feel like you're doing something, but you're not really tackling the main problem.

I guess grad school was rough for me...

But thank you for that new perspective on that section of the story.
