I'm sure people feel the same as you or else there wouldn't be OP!Harry Independent!Harry stories out there. And obviously, if you enjoy reading about that type of character the most, that's a valid opinion.

Personally, I like flawed characters. Harry Potter is a coming of age story where the characters learn and grow into adults. They're human, and for most of the story, they're kids. They make mistakes. When I first read DH I was really frustrated with Harry, Hermione, and Ron for aimlessly moping around in a tent for chapters. Now, ...several... years on from the DH release, I /get/ it. Sometimes your brain kinda shuts down when you're facing down a huge task and you don't know where to start, and you're reasonably frustrated with the task in the first place (not to mention the fact that they're grieving for several different characters at this point). It's a realistic reaction to a crappy situation.

How many of the fanfic writers who write about Harry jogging around the lake, getting swole, and learning deep magic of amazing skill and complexity, are actually super fit and delving into the deepest reaches of muggle science? Not many, I'd imagine. That's because we're all flawed people. Flawed people are relatable and interesting to read about because you see them overcoming similar struggles to you. On the flip side, some people find it really gratifying to read about characters who flawlessly do everything--it's wish fulfillment.
