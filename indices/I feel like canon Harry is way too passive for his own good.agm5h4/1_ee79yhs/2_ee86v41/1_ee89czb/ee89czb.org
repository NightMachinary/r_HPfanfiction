“How many fanfic writers live in a world where the government is corrupt and police are at best incompetent?” ?????? America's government is entirely corrupted out for money and hatred, and the govt has been shut down for 3 weeks now. We also have an extremely violent police force and a mass shooting every three days (on average - lots of psychopaths). Not to mention the many, many developing countries who are in much worse situations. I think for so many fanfic writers the Potter verse's reality is very similar to our own.
