Not to get too into it, but police shootings are essentially executions without investigations or trials. And there are definitely plenty of people being held in jail pre-trial for horribly unreasonable amounts of time because they don't have enough money for bail, sometimes motivated by government officials wanting to be seen as tough on crime.

It's not exactly the same, but it's actually not all that different.
