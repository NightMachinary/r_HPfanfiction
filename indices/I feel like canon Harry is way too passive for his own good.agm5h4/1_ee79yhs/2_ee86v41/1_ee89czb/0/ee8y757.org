While I agree with you for the most part, we still aren't where the Government of HP was. Remember that Fudge executed a man without trial or investigation (and tried another time) and both him and his successor had people thrown in prison without trial or investigation based solely on public opinion. No one with any authority or power in the HP universe was even remotely competent on either side of the war. I'm not going to go into detail here because it's getting late, I'm tired, and others have laid this out better than I could in the past anyway.
