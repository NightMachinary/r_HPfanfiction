Try Spacebattles, he posts more regularly there. But again, he will come up with a story, get halfway through the first act, then abandon it to start over. He tried four times to write the one I mentioned before and gave it up within a month or two of starting over each time, after the first “draft” posted actively for about a year.

Wouldn't be so bad but he then deletes the old versions - some of which were fine stories on their own - and then never quite makes it back to the original progress point in the story before his muse wanders off again.
