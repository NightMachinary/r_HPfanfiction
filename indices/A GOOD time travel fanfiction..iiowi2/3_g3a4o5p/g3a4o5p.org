It's kind of a twist on time travel and more narrative-heavy but I enjoyed linkao3(14021217).

I remember liking Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past, at least, for the first few chapters I read but then I didn't keep going for some reason. I believe it's been taken down from ffn.net but you can google it and find it on the writer's site.

Edit: oh oops I saw you wrote 100k+ and finished and neither of these fulfils both requirements.
