Me too. I understand it, cause I didn't really see where it could have went. So for a main plot it sort of wrote itself into a corner.

I really liked Altered Destiny and has inspired me to start my own AU Fan fiction from that era that I am very slowly writing. Hopefully to start posting in earthly 2021 when I should be complete and just working on editing
