Different strokes. I'm personally in the same boat - the version of Draco in particular just isn't one I'm interested in - but the story obviously works for a lot of people. Depending on what turned you off, it may improve as you dig into it or it may never click.

It's a (possibly) unpopular opinion, but I find other works by the author such as Sugar Water and When the Bell Tolls to be more compelling and a better reflection of the writer at their best.
