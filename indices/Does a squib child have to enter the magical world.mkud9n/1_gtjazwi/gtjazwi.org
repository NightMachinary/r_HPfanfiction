Squibs are IN the magical world, because it's defined as a non-magical person born into a magical family. The question is, do squibs have to STAY in the magical world, and the answer is, "Of course not."

If they don't know they have a magical parent, they would never even know they are a squib (if they even are, as opposed to a muggle). My headcanon is that a squib is not the same as a muggle: a squib is somebody who HAS magic but can't USE it for some reason.

Squibs MUST have some magic --- or Filch could never work at the school. The muggle-repelling spells wouldn't allow him to stay. Mrs. Figg is also allowed to raise part-kneazles, which muggles would not be allowed (unless this is a bashing fic where Dumbledore doesn't care if she's breaking the law because he's her patron).
