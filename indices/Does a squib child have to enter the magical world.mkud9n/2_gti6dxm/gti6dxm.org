They certainly don't need to. I mean if their situation is, for example, similar to Tom Riddle who ended up in the orphanage then they wouldn't even know that one of their parents was/is a wizard (or both, but that's the same situation). They would, preferably, got adopted and it would end with that. No magical world what so ever.

As a squib they also wouldn't receive their letter to Hogwarts (if we are talking about this particular school, of course) because the quill and book, or whatever it is, write the letters only to children who are confirmed wizards (case with Neville where it wasn't sure if he was a wizard or a squib so it waited until it actually wrote the letter for him).

It's also fully up to they parents if they decide to tell him or not. They may decide to live a “normal” life without much magic if they wish so. They could, for example, think that it would be quite saddening for their child.

The only situation that comes to my mind where the child would need to interact with the magical world is a legal reason. Otherwise, the wizards simply wouldn't care about some random squib in a muggle world who doesn't even know about their existence.
