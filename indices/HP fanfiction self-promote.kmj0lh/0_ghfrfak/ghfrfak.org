I'm always happy to review and give my opinion, but I'm a harsh critic. Are you sure you want my advice in particular? I rip everything I read to shreds. Some end up being 10/10 most end up with a score below a 5. But I'll gladly read it and give you my opinion.

If I'm reading it as a review I'll do so as objectively as possible. In the sense that I won't rate a fic 1/10 because I don't like the main pairing. I'll rate it based on how the romance was written.
