Oh boy- I'd really like it if you read it, I don't mind harsh criticism either. There isn't really any romance yet, but I hope to add some (a whole ton, once I start I can't finish) I really haven't done much (3-4 chapters) so the story isn't quite flowing yet! I hope you enjoy it, warning you though- it might be a little cliche, but I'm trying to make it original. Bye! Thank you for considering my story.
