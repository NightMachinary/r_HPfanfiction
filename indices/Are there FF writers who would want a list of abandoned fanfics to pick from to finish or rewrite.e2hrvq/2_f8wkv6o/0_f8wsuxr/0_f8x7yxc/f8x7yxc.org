The reason we are capable of writing Harry Potter fanfiction is because JK has allowed it. If she hadn't it would have been taken down from the sight

The individual about you is talking about plagiarism . “the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.”

Each story written on fanfiction belongs to the author who had created that plot. To take that plot and story and say that it is your own creation will get you in trouble, unless you have the explicit approval of the original author to that plot line/fic.

Does that make more sense?
