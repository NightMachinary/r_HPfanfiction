To each their own, but I really don't see a reason to differentiate between writing fan fiction about original fiction versus writing fan fiction about fan fiction. /shrug/

Also, I don't think there's any reasonable person who would defend plagiarism. Dunno why that's being brought up. My comment about copying plot was just referencing the all-too-common phenomenon of writers essentially rehashing canon with a few changes.

To be explicit: of course no one should plagiarize, and of course any fan fiction written should always credit the original work(s).
