Rowling partly wrote to make money, which she did.

Fanfic writers are doing it for their own pleasure (and skill). As they aren't earning anything for doing it, I find it wrong to steal the plot/writing.

Its one thing if your fic has a similar idea of another, or is motived by x fic. But straight copying it? We don't even do that for Rowling.
