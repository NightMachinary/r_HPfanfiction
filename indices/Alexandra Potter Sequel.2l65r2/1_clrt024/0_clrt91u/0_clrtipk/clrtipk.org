It is starting to get interesting. I had no idea where the story was going at first -- I thought it was going to be Dumbledore in Harry's body but that fortunately turned out not to be the case -- but I liked the last two chapters. It is now clear to me he's going not for an AU, but rather a skilled Harry fic where the simple fact Harry is not the passive idiot he was in the official last book is driving all the changes.

If you liked Alexandra Potter, this very much has the same style so you'll probably like it.
