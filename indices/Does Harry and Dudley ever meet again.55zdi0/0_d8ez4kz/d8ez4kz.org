According to JKR

  Harry and Dudley would still see each other enough to be on Christmas-card terms, but they would visit more out of a sense of duty and sit in silence so that their children could see their cousins.

I think that makes sense to me. They'd visit occasionally but never be completely comfortable. It's a big gap between wizard and Muggle and their rough history would make it even worse. What happened between Harry and Dudley was bad enough, but at least they were kids when it happened. I can't see Harry and Ginny being on good terms with Petunia and Vernon though. I think both sides would endeavor to avoid the other in social settings. At most, exchanging a frosty greeting when absolutely necessary.

My head canon is that the kids get along really well which makes it even more awkward for the parents.
