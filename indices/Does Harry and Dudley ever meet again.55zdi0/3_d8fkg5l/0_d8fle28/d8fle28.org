To be fair, though, Dudley wasn't all that much against Harry; rather, it's that Vernon and Petunia failed to raise him to be a good kid and, also because of Vernon and Petunia, Harry was a convenient victim for him.

So, once he grows up, I can see him even if not trying to make up for it then at least trying to not completely reject Harry. Because they might not be the most compatible of people, but they are family, arguably more than Petunia or Vernon were to either of them.
