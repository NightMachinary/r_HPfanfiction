Ginny annoys me in this. At the start she is pretty selfish (which she acknowledges later), and then goes to someone's (who she has never meet) wedding planning pranks. Even if Marge says some horrible things, I kinda feel doing anything that takes away from the married couple's day is not on. Marge might have deserved it, but did Dudley and Dudley's new wife? Those farts would have stunk up the whole room, and been loud and gross, which once is a laugh, but continuously? A good prank is one /everyone/ laughs at. What Ginny plans and does are not good pranks, it is close to bullying.

Of course she is also incredibly in character, so, I guess I just don't like Ginny.
