Do you want me to respond to this or are you just screaming into the ether? If you just wanted to vent some frustrations, that is your right and you can stop reading my response right here. I certainly did not intend to anger you. You asked "Did Dudley and Harry ever meet again in canon?" I was simply answering that question to the best of my ability. JK did still say it was canon, whether she was bribed to or not (and why would one of the richest people in the world allow someone to pay her off for damaging her credibility? I don't want to offend you, but that seems a little silly).
