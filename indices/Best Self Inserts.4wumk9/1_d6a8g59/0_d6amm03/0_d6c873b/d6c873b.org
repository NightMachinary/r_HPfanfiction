Strong disagree! I hated this fic! The plot is admittedly pretty great but the writing is terrible. It's all written stream of consciousness and the author clearly had no plan for where it was going. I kept thinking it would get better due to all the good reviews and it never did. It was a huge disappointment. Also, a tiny annoyance, but it's rated M just for kissing.
