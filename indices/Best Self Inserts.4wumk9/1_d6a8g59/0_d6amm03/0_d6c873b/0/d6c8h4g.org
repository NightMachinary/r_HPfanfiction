I find that fascinating. The vast majority of people I have encountered have fully enjoyed the story. From what I remember, I loved the conflict he had between wanting to help but also being terrified of making things worse by changing the timeline. I agree that the M rating is a bit much but I did not get the "no plan" vibe from the fic. It was just honestly the only SI that I ever enjoyed.
