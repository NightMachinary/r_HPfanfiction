Yeah the plot was good. But I made the mistake of reading the ANs and he says every chapter how he truly doesn't know where the story is going or plan anything - a good example was how he changed the name of the SI from bud to will - so I guess that made it stand out more to me. But also I hated the weird Harry/Will/Hermione love triangle, the unfulfilling and weird plot with daphne and her dad and the Ron bashing.
