I don't really tell anyone every little thing I do, so I haven't told anyone I read fanfiction, just like I don't tell them I watch a lot of movies, and play video games, or enjoy the occasional drink lol. IRL I'm pretty private in what I get up to with free time, essentially.

None of my friends read anything so it hasn't really came up.
