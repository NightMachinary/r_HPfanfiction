Kind of, yes. There are some moments when I don't really give a crap and will admit to reading fanfiction, but I still periodically tend to make up book titles when coworkers ask me what I'm reading on my kindle (most often I'll just say I'm re-reading Harry Potter and choose a book at random that I'm on). I care way too much of how others perceive me, though, which is a bad habit that I am trying to break.

I use my main (and only) account to browse this sub, though. I don't really care enough to be THAT secretive about it - but I don't go volunteering the info in the first place. If someone cares enough to go looking up what I post, then good for them, I guess.
