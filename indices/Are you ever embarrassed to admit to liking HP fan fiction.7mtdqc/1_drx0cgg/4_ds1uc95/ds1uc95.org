That's incredible. I'm 30 and only a handful of my old best friends from middle school know, because we used to write fics together, passing notebooks back and forth all the way through high school. We were so secretive, I wouldn't be surprised if our friends and classmates thought we were doing something even more embarrassing like writing erotica ha ha.
