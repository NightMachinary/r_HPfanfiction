Every single person who I've told I write fanfiction has assumed I write porn. Every. Single. One. Do I care? Not really. But it's still annoying.

I once met a person at a bar who was reading The Pureblood Princess on her tablet and talking about it with the bartender who was a friend of hers. She did not believe that I wrote it.
