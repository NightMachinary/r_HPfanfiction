Hah, that's funny because I have a specific anecdote for this. Last night I was talking to my husband, and he asked me what my story was about, which is rare because he usually doesn't notice/care. So I brushed it off like, “Oh, it's really long.” Then he says, “I have time.” (We were on the phone and I've been away since Christmas, so I think he's lonely.) So I explain my long fic, but I have 2 versions of the explanation: the one that makes it seem like regular historical fiction, and one that includes all the HP stuff. Naturally I give him the first one...and then he asks, “When does Harry Potter come in?” And I'm like, “Never lol,” because it's true (the setting is pre-canon). He answers, “Well, there must be Hogwarts then,” and I gave him this awkward laugh because the majority of the story actually does take place at Hogwarts, lol.

TL;DR: Yes, I'm embarrassed but my husband has probably figured out I write it, and I'm not actually going to die of shame, so maybe I'm getting better.
