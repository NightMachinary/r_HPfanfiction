Embarrassed, not really. Cautious, yes. I'm older than most fanfic writers I know, and among my friends and acquaintances I have a reputation as a semi-intellectual with a penchant for literary novels, poetry, and a smattering of scifi and fantasy. It doesn't accord with their perceptions of who I am.

Some of my friends would definitely be uncomfortable with the fact that Harry Potter is a children's series, and some of them wouldn't know what to do with the fact that when I write fic, it's often erotic and very explicit. And it's slash. I don't think I have to explain to this sub how flustered and sometimes hostile the reactions can be to the idea of a woman writing gay sex - in which I'll lump femslash, since most non-fans in my circle would find both equally disconcerting.

I've told a select few. They tend to be aspiring writers themselves, and although one was more shocked than the others, they all enjoy teasing me about it and are generally supportive (except for the occasional comment about wishing I'd return to writing my own stories).
