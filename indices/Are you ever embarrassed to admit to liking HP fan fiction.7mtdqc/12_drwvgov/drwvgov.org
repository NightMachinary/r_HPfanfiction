I'm not and never have been embarrassed. I admit to writing fanfic, reading fanfic, and will tell people about projects I've worked on or am working on; mostly, I like to tell people who aren't into fanfic about the history behind it, how it came about, the different kinds.

Fundamentally, people are curious about other people's interests, why they call to them, et cetera. Even stuff like stamp or train enthusiasms can be interesting to a layman if you go for the interesting trivia and don't get too in-depth.

It's interesting to see someone devote a huge portion of their lives to anything, even if it's something we'd never want to be interested in ourselves.

Do people assume it's all just smut? Sure they do. If people are curious about porn, I like to tell them about the weirdest smut requests I've received, or about the biggest, weirdest tropes like A/B/O and knotting. But then, I semi-professionally publish erotica, so it's never going to be a subject I'm shy about.
