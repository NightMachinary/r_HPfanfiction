Very few people in my daily life know I write HP fan fiction. When I first started in 2004, I didn't even tell my husband for a long time. Now, I use him to bounce story ideas off of and he's my alpha-reader. It's kind of a bummer that I can't suck it up enough to tell my close friends about my hobby---I'm pretty chuffed that with my collected works I've written a couple of novels---but maybe one day I'll be brave enough.
