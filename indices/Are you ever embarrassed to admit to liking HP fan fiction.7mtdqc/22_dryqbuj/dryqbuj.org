Whenever I meet someone who says they read fanfic... I get cautious.

Because on my experience there are 2 kinds of fanfic readers, people who read for the plot.. and people who read for the smut.

And I don't want to talk to people who read foe the smut, as they are the reason when ever it comes our that I read fanfic to a new friend, they always think I'm reading some smut on my phone or computer when we are hanging out.
