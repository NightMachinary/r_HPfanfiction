I thought the ship thing would only work at extremely close range, and those engines take a ton of time to charge. Basically either you go fast enough to hit lightspeed and miss, or you time it right and don't. But the engines are not designed for sustained high velocity sub-C speeds, it would rip the ship apart on debris. Also when the falcon dropped out of C into an atmosphere in 7, this proved that past that speed they don't interact with matter according to conventional physics, so it's only in the acceleration part that you would have the force required to do that kind of damage. So it's actually a really short range weapon that should be pretty easy to defend against. Notice how in 8, the general dude orders EVERYTHING at the ships retreating, not the one that would go for a suicide run. This meant that they had minutes of extra time that they should not have had. Headcanon, but as best as I can justify it.
