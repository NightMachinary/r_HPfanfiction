Because the Death Stars are a lot larger than rebel ships. In fact in Return of the Jedi, a ship (though can't remember if it was Rebel or Imperial) crashed into the Death Star and not much happened. And the third "Death Star" was a planet so hyperspace wouldn't do much.

As for force ghost, all Yoda did was time lightning on cue (don't think the force allows control of the weather ) and Yoda was/is a pretty powerful jedi so even if it was possible it wouldn't surprise me. Not to mention some force users can use lightning.
