Sure. Then read "Partially Kissed Hero" and reevaluate.

Or, if you want one of the most popular fanfictions: Look at how wrong Methods of Reality gets the magic system.

And all these problems you name are not as big and can be handwaved rather not easily:

- Luke can force-project because he is a) a Skywalker, who are established to be very powerful, b) Looked at the force in a way that is neither Jedi nor Sith, gaining different abilities.

Force training is a bit of a problem, but I feel like the amount of stuff Rey can actually do kinda fits.

But that all is not the point, most of it are nitpicks that might as well be titled "I dislike the new world building".

Lucas himself changed world building as he pleased, star wars was never known to be terribly consistent with powers.

And even if it was bad, it is not really bad fanfiction, because again: It is not really bad compared with the vast majority of fanfiction.
