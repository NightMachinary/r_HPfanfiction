Force mechanics were completely redone in the +fic+ film: Force ghosts can manifest? Astral projection? Force training doesn't require any, well, training? All the Light and Dark side stuff thrown out in favor of "balance"?

(This is not to mention the deus ex machina of the hyperspace ship-as-battering-ram thing, which would have happened a bazillion times already in the series in drone-captained ships were it a thing.)

I think "really bad fanfiction" might well apply.
