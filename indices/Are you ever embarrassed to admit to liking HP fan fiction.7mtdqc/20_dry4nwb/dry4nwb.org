Well, most of my close friends and family members know that I actively read and write fanfiction, but it's not necessarily something I go around telling people.

The worst memory I have of being a fanfiction writer was back when I was a freshman in High School. I had this thing where, if I got bored in class, I would occasionally write a little bit on my next chapter, just to pass the time.

One day, one of my fellow classmates spotted the open Word document on my computer, and naturally, wondered what it was. Asking me about it, I kind of awkwardly admitted to writing fanfiction. I immediately realized I shouldn't have said that.

The dude I told it to assumed it to be pornography (as people seem to perceive Fanfiction as strictly erotica) and proceeded to make fun of me in front of the entire class.

I spent the rest of that semester being called a pervert for writing something that wasn't even slightly sexual.

So I can understand why people choose to hide their interest in fanfiction. Some people might misunderstand, and that can create some awkward moments.
