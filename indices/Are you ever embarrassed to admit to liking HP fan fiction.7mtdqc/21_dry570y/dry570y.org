i've Been writing a kind of Star Wars self insert since 2010 and one of the characters was based on a friend of mine. At one stage, I accidentally used his real name in one of the chapters and not even my beta noticed. He has some sort of alert set up if his name comes up in new results on google, and BAM he immediately guessed it was me. I was mortified. Seriously, dig a hole and bury myself, momentarily considered suicide mortified.

He was kind of okay about it but I went and changed the name obviously. I've told other people about it, ones I knew wrote their own stories or something and they've always been totally normal about it. Other writers usually understand it i reckon, although one said I should never base my characters on people i know too well.
