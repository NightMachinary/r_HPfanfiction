I mean, I always wanted to see a fic where someone went full Jedi-with-blaster-bolts with spells, only with a physical object instead of a lightsaber.

Can't remember if it's canon or fanon, but that whole 'the Killing Curse can only be blocked by physical objects' thing really screams "You need a slightly-enchanted cricket bat and some good hand-eye coordination to be pretty much invulnerable here." I bet you could pull that off with a decent claymore or zweihander or some such. :D
