Harry never thought a book would help him so much.

Sure, it was /Gryffindor's/ Book, but still.

'The pointy end of a sword can bring an end to many problems' was something simple he would take for life.

He had even made a Dementor disappear with it, it came when he was coming back from Hogsmeade alone and he just did as the book showed and stabbed it in the torso, it screeched something fierce and then disappeared in an explosion of light.

He looked at his sword again, it was beautiful and more appropriate to his size, some students(like Hermione, who reacted oddly when he told how he got it) questioned him, but the school rules allowed it and since he was being hunted by a mass murderer, people decided to leave him be.

When he decided to follow Godric's advice, he had at first tried to get Gryffindor's Sword, but Dumbledore said it would be too dangerous, and that he could hurt himself.

Frustrated and a bit angry, he went to the Black Lake, and asked himself 'Now where could I get a sword?'

Apparently a friendly mermaid(she must have been a mermaid, she was beautiful and came out of the water, even if he hadn't seen her lower half due to the murky waters) heard him and gave him a sword, it was broader and heavier, with runes on the blade and a golden hilt with jewels.

He /did/ try to deny it, but the lady just said it was his for as long as he needed it, so Harry decided to accept that he had been lucky for a change and took it.

No Regrets.
