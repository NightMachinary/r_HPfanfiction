I was really disappointed in that sword prop. Given Godric lived circa the 11th century, I figured it would be an Oakeshott Type X sword. Broad-bladed with a fuller, the transitional form between the Viking sword and the knightly arming sword of the middle ages.

I was also amused how the prop changes sizes throughout the movies, from something that's single-handed and sized appropriately for a 12 year old Harry, to a meter-long blade a much older Neville uses two-handed to kill Nagini.
