Hey same...I was looking for a wbwl fic and I found I'm not a hero and that got me into haphne as well. I then read his other ones and I've read most of them several times...though I do wish he'd have only 1 or 2 fics at one time and stick to them...he has about 6 different ones currently active and that does make it quite annoying dealing with updates
