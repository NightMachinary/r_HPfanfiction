Often people with extreme views assume others hold extreme views. The Longbottoms might be seen as worthless cripples that aren't even wizards any more, only their old name is worth anything. If you're convinced of their worthlessness then why would they be worth anything to anyone else. They're sacks of meat not hostages.

Alternatively none of the Death Eaters involved in Hogwarts wanted to admit they couldn't control a teenager and thus no action was taken. Dawlish was sent after Neville's gran but we don't know if that was for Neville's actions or her vocal support of Dumbledore and Harry.
