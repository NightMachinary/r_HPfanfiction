#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is 18 years old and he doesn't know who he is. It may be a bit dramatic to say something like that, because he realises he is Harry Potter. But he's just a random guy who doesn't even know what he likes to do for fun, now that Lord Voldemort has been defeated. Or, the one where Harry Potter doesn't know what to do with himself after the war, so he becomes an architect, makes new friends, falls in love, and accidentally changes the world.
