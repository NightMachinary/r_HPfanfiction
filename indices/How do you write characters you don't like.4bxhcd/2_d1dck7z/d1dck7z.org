Usually I try not to make them the focus. For example, I don't really like Rita, so when I wrote my most recent year 4 fic, I barely showed her at all. It might show weakness in my writing ability, but it's mostly my own personal thing that I don't like reading about characters I can't stand, and it's exacerbated by the fact that Rita's not really a villain, just an morally-ambiguous reporter. It's the same sort of reason that I don't really write Umbridge or Snape into my stories either, and I'm not so weak-willing to resort to bashing. I just won't write them.
