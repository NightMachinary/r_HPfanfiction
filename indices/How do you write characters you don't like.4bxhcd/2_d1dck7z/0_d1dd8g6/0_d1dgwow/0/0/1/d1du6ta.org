Because it's a potion rather than a spell, I do think it'd be different. It would depend on why the Polyjuice wears off in the first place. Is there a time limit to the magical power within the potion? If so, that would suggest the potion would wear off after the designated hour regardless of death. I doubt that's the case, because we've already seen that something as simple as non-human hair can make it overwhelm the time limit.

Is it a biological issue then? That the potion needs to run it's course, so to speak? If it's reliant on a living, fuctioning digestive system, then it probably wouldn't wear off at all. Unless the stomach acids are continue functioning post-mortem long enough to wear away the power of the potion, so to speak. I'm not that educated about human biology and decomposition to know. But then, could the process of decomposition itself affect the potion, making it wear off sooner/later?

If it's more reliant on something like circulation--using the cardiovascular system to pump the potion around the body--then it could go either way.* It might rely on the blood to carry the potion around the body to power the transformation, in which case they would change back sooner than the time limit but probably not immediately, or it might just need to be in the blood to work, in which case they'd probably stay transformed. (At least until they were embalmed, although I personally headcanon that they use spells for preservation rather than embalming fluids.)

*Slight tangent: It'd be kind of interesting if Polyjuice is treated by the body as a weak infection and the effects wear off because the body has healed the "infection". That would certainly affect whether it wears off post-mortem, but it always generates some interesting questions as to how different people react to Polyjuice. Would the time it takes to wear off differ based on an individual's overall health? What happens if your immune system is incapable of fighting it off? Would you get stuck as the person you changed into? Would it kill you, whether immediately or gradually?
