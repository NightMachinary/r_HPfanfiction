This is something I've been thinking about lately. I was reading A Difference In The Family (linkffn(7937889)) and it got me wondering about magic and death, but specifically about polyjuice. In that story, at some point during 4th year Snape begins to suspect Moody is being impersonated, but he can't think of who it might be. If he had just killed Moody outright, then Voldemort would not have regained a body after the events of the Triwizard Tournament. But how does a dead body behave under the influence of polyjuice? Do they stay in the same form, or revert back instantly, or revert back after the potion would have worn off normally? It would be tricky if you killed someone you thought was an impersonator, but had no evidence because they retained the form of whoever they impersonated.
