They stay dead in their animagus form, namely a smear on the floor and digesting in Trevor's gut. Admittedly, that's the easy way out and I could have had her turn back human after death, but the fallout from that wasn't something I wanted to deal with in the trod-on fic, and it would mean killing poor Trevor in the other one. Personally I think that would be a more terrible loss than Rita dying.

Vaguely related, but in the trod-on fic, I have werewolves turn back to human if they die while in animal form. I'd argue that a magical person reverts back to their natural state of being in death, and animagi are, in essence, still a natural form. It might not be human, but it's still a form they're suited to, and one they entered in by choice, so they're not forced back to being human after death. Werewolves, on the other hand, are forcibly transformed and being a wolf is very much an unnatural state of being for them, so when they die they revert back to their "normal" body.
