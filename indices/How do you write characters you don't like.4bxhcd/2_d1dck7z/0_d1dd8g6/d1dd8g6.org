Reducing them to small parts is definitely the best, IMO, if they really have no need in any particular story. Certainly better than bashing.

I've done the same with Rita in my currently-being-posted fic; an OC owns the Prophet and has power enough to stop articles getting published, which gives me chance to just render Rita redundant and not bother with her as even a minor antagonist. But in a couple of other fics, I've had her get carelessly killed while in her animagus form, once by getting trod on and once by getting eaten by Trevor. It's not a major point, but I just spare a sentence or two for it. I mean, if you're going to run around as a beetle, it's an unfortunate risk...
