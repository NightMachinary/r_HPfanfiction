It depends /why/ I don't like the character.

I'm not a big fan of JKR's treatment of the press in the second half of her series, so I tend to write the Prophet as more neutral than its canon counterpart. To that end, I usually just omit Rita Skeeter's involvement in any plot. My OC for that is usually a 'Constance Goodword' in the byline, which I hope is appropriately Dickensian for the HP universe.

Many wonderful people love Draco and Lucius, but I can't stand them so I tend to make the Malfoys rather unpleasant people.

I think neglecting a character just because you don't like them should be avoided unless you have no other choice or they play a bit part.
