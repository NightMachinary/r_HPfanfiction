The only character I absolutely loathe and can't write without bashing him over the head repeatedly is Snape. Most of my work is post-Hogwarts and next-gen so I'm lucky that he's dead by that period. I had Neville cringe over poor Albus Potter's middle name and comment to Hannah that they should name their future children after more deserving people.

There's one story where it makes sense for Snape to have some what of a role and I know I have to address the issue at some point, but I've been dragging my feet over it. It's a re-write of the series from Harry's sister's POV. I have two scenes that Snape's in and he ignores the OC, speaking as little as he can get away with. The way I re-wrote POA didn't need him at the climax of the arc. I'll probably write his motivations in more of a negative interpretation, without fully bashing him. Like show that his "love" was more of a one-sided obsession that Dumbledore used to gain his loyalty.
