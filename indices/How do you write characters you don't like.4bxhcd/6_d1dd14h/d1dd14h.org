I typically try to make sure that they won't be necessary for the needs of the story. If that's not possible, then I include them but limit their 'screen time,' since I am trying to write them in character but might fail because of my personal feelings. The less they appear, the less likely that is to happen.

When /that's/ not an option, as is often the case with, say, a character like Dumbledore (someone who is a major player, I mean), I try my best to write them fairly - balancing the good and the bad. It's difficult, but I try my best.

I never kill anyone off because I don't like them - I kill them off because it fits the needs of the story. The story is all-important. My feelings should always come second to it. Otherwise I'd have written a bunch of stories about Umbridge's violent death, hahaha.
