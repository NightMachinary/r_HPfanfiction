In my stories, Ron is always removed somehow. Sometimes the new situation puts him on the sidelines by force, sometimes hes unable to do something, sometimes he's dead.

But I can't really write him very well. Its always been a walk along the edge between boring and bashing with him for me, so I decided that I just won't deal with him alltogether.
