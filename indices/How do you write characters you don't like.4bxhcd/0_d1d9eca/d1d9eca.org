Reinterpret them. Make them more interesting without changing their function. Perhaps Gregory Goyle has a side-interest in architecture, so when he spaces out while gooning for Draco, he's usually looking at all the archways.

Give them pets, hobbies, personal peeves ['I hate chocolate' "I'm sorry, that's just wrong. I was thinking of going easy on you, but I'm going to have to kill you now."], unexpected moments of clarity. Make it fun for yourself and it'll be fun for the readers.
