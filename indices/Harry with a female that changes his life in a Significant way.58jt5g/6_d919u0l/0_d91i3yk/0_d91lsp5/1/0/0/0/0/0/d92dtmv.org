I believe the reference is to the blatant spoilers located in the summaries for books 2 and 3.

#+begin_quote
  Lion's Trilogy. After Ron's death, Harry and company face their sixth year at Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Says that in the first part, Ron dies somewhere in their fifth year.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore has died and left Harry one final task. With Daphne, Hermione and Neville at his side, Harry intends to end the war started the night his parents were killed.
#+end_quote

Another death in the previous part being outted by the summary (even if it is Dumbledore in the sixth year).
