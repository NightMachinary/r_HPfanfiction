I like [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] and it's sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] for this request.

It's an early example of Harry/Daphne and one of the few Jeconais stories I can stomach - this still carries his signature "everything works out like a fairy-tale and look how cleverly I wrap it up" move but it's got style, and I think it's more well written than his earlier (or most of the later) work.
