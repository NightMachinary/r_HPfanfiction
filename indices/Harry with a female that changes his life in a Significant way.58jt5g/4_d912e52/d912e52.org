I would say *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), fits your criteria pretty well:

- The girl was a Slytherin, from a dark pureblood family, and his former nemesis.
- She turned his life around, although the same thing applied to her as well.
- No character bashing, Dumbledore was kind ok.
- Pretty long, almost 400k words.
