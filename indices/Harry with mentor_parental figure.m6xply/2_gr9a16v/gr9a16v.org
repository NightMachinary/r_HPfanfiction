[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][*Dead Man Walking*]] (~ 57k) Regulus becomes his mentor of sorts. Though I am fairly sure the work is abandoned same as [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668?view_full_work=true][*C'est La Vie*]] (~ 102k, Bill is mentioned as past mentor, Harry is under apprenticeship of the Ancient Runes teacher. But I don't think she counts as parental figure ...) The author is still active just not in HP.

Otherwise in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667][*In the Name of the Brave*]] (~ 80k) Harry sees Regulus (a teacher in this) as this sort of person to respect and comes to him in need. But so far (also incomplete /sigh/) he isn't his mentor or anything so perhaps not what you are looking for. If the author continues it one day, I am sure their relationship is gonna evolve in a more personal way.

I know there is this long wbwl story in which Harry is older than his brother and (I think) in Ravenclaw. His mentor/parental figure is an old man and Harry manages to achieve a starter career in Quidditch while still in school. I'm sure I could find it if you're interested.

Lastly, I remember one where Harry is a little transfiguration prodigy and is under McGonagall's apprenticeship. But I dunno where to find it.
