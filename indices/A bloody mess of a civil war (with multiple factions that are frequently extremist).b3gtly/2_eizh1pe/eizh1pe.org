Marriage law Revolution maybe? It has the Mugglenborn going full French/Russian Revolution against the purebloods after the second war and an attempt to institute a marriage law. It is still a pretty clear case (Evil Government vs people caring about human rights), but as with any proper revolution, blood is the water on its mills. And the good guys can get pretty extreme with their persecutions, although they are not entirely unjustified.
