I do want to introduce questions and moral conflict over muggle science and technology vs. magic. Resentment by some muggle-borns that the wizards do not help muggles more with their advanced medical treatment (healing flesh wounds quickly for instance) but also remain hopelessly ignorant of muggle knowledge. I won't however be doing muggle/wizard battles or face-offs between the rival technologies.
