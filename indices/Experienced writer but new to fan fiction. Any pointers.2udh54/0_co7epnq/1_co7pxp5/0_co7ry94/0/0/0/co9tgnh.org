I don't think this is the only (or even the most likely) way to interpret this part of canon.

Despite being "pretty hopeless about Muggle knowledge," Wizarding society nevertheless remains effectively invisible to Muggles, with all their surveillance equipment, IR goggles, closed circuit television, cameras, camcorders, the Internet, and whatnot. While commercial GPS, a.k.a. "Unplottable locales and the Fidelius mean nothing to me," wasn't in place by the end of the series, it was only a few years out and one suspects the Wizarding world had plans for how to handle it.

My head canon treats much of what we see in the stories as emblematic. For instance, Dursley abuse is very likely hyperbole, a story told for emotive and comic effect by the author to, as [[/u/Taure]] notes, make the contrast between Muggle and Magical worlds seem greater to the reader.

Similarly, Arthur may be playing up his purported lack of Muggle knowledge as a private joke, a bit of affected eccentricity, and not genuine ignorance. It would be a Columbo-esque, disarming way of learning about the Muggle world through asking seemingly innocent questions without setting off warning bells (aside from "this guy is weird"). It certainly makes more sense to interpret things this way--and, as a meta-point, considering it another instance of JKR's penchant for humor over strict logic--than imagining that despite maintaining a pronounced personal and professional interest, Arthur remains utterly ignorant of the Muggle world throughout his decades of exposure and immersion. (He does deal with Muggles in his day-to-day.) Muggleborn children somehow are capable of navigating the Magical world in a few years, yet a qualified Wizard can't figure out how to use a 'fellotone' after decades? I don't buy it. The guy would have to be the world's biggest moron (for which there's little evidence in canon).

If this is Arthur's natural behavior around Muggles and Muggle-born/-raised in his day job, it's plausible to me that he might naturally fall into a similar pattern during his off hours. As an example of what I mean, I know a former CIA officer of twenty years with the agency who reflexively "handles" her social contacts in, one imagines, much the same way as she did her agents in her day job. If you know what to look for, it's clear how she's manipulating and steering conversations and interactions with her social contacts, though it's very smooth, very subtle. I honestly don't think she even knows she's doing it anymore, the patterns being so ingrained.
