Arthur Weasley, working in the government department in charge of cursed Muggle devices, isn't said to be incompetent at any point. In fact, wizards seem dismissive of his Muggle device obsession despite his job. Yet he knows pathetically little about them after years if not /decades/ at the job.

If wizarding society is that way after /centuries/ of uninterrupted social order and supposed advancement, it doesn't seem likely to change and is practically a wilful part of their presented cultural identity.

That points to the /society/ of magicals in general being pretty hopeless about Muggle knowledge, even if some Muggle-born /obviously/ know way more than that.
