Meh. Just giving my opinion with respect to the magic thing. You (the third party reader not named [[/u/denarli]], who obviously agrees with me based on his/her comments on the issue of not nerfing Magical peoples excessively) are entitled to your own opinion (and your inbox full of hate mail when you make Muggles pwn everything magical because guns, nukes, and GPS).

To [[/u/denarli]] (whose post I totally did read, honest) I'd only say that writing HP fanfiction just for the sake of trashing the magical world went out of fashion about 8 or 10 years ago. I don't think the advice given is unsound or inappropriate.

Edit: added clarification (sheesh).
