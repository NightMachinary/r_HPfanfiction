The default assumption is that the charms work the way we have seen them working. Creating limitations for them isn't "sticking to canon", it's adding to canon. In the absence of canonical limitations, there's no reason to think bubble-head charms wouldn't work in a vacuum, that brooms function via thrust, etc.

We know the Firebolt is capable of going 150km/hour from PoA. We don't know if that's it's maximum speed, but it gives us a ballpark figure. 106 days was derived from that.
