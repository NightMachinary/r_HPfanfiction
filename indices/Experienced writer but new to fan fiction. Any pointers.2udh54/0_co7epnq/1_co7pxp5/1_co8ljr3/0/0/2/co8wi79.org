If you're sticking to canon, it's all baseless speculation. We just don't know enough about how magic works in canon to say whether it (or apparition) would work. We don't know if the bubble-head charm would work in a vacuum, if a warming charms are strong enough, if a broom could maintain a constant acceleration high enough to break free of Earth's gravity, if shield charms would protect you from radiation, if there's anything magic could do to let you survive reentry, etc.

How did you come up with the 106 days number? Afaik we don't have any actual numbers on broom speeds/acceleration.
