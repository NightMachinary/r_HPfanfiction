Escape velocity assumes that gravity is a factor; if brooms work by completely ignoring gravity (i.e. they don't function via thrust) then this is not a problem.

It's extremely unlikely that brooms function by thrust. If they did, they would be the only magic we know of that works via a physical rather than magical mechanism.
