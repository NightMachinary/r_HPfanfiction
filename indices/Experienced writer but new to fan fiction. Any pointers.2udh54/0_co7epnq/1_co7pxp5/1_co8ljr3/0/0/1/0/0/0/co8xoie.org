I'm not aware of any info on apparition in Pottermore, but JKR did once say in interview that intercontinental apparition was possible but could only be performed by those most skilled in apparition.

My own headcanon, based off Voldemort's apparent inability to apparate between mainland Europe and Britain in DH despite the distance being much shorter than London to Scotland, is that distance is not a factor but some elements of geography are, e.g. large bodies of water.
