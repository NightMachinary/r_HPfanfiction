From /Quidditch Through the Ages/: "Apparition becomes increasingly unreliable over very long distances, and only highly skilled wizards are wise to attempt it across continents."

If intercontinental apparition is only possible for the most skilled witches/wizards, it seems like trying to apparate to the moon is inadvisable unless you want to splinch yourself so bad your innards are scattered all across the sea of tranquility.
