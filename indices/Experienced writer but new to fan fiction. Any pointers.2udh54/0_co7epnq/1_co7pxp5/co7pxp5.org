  Avoid setting up a situation where Muggles pwn everything magical. This rarely makes for a good story and more often than not pisses off readers who read Harry Potter fanfiction because they enjoy reading about magic.

I agree with this with the caveat that muggles shouldn't be portrayed as inferior either. There are things that technology is simply far better at than magic such as communication and information distribution. Technology put a man on the moon. So many fics go too far in one direction or the other.

Also, as a side note, I'm really starting to detest the argument that "writers shouldn't do X because readers like reading about magic". I feel like I've seen it used pretty frequently lately.
