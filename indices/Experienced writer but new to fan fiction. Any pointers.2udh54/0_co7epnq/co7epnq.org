Welcome (back) to the fandom. I feel somewhat qualified to address your query, given that I've played in both fanfiction and original fiction (I've sold twenty or so pieces of the latter) and have 100+ nonfiction articles to my name. In terms of advice:

If a character is well established in canon (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Dumbledore, Snape, Draco, etc.) and you aren't departing meaningfully from their canon portrayals, don't waste words on lengthy character descriptions or walking us through how a character thinks if it could be reasonably guessed at by knowing canon. All prospective readers will be completely familiar with this and your efforts are better spent on other aspects of storytelling. This is a bit of convenience fanfiction writers have that original fiction writers don't.

Avoid setting up a situation where Muggles pwn everything magical. This rarely makes for a good story and more often than not pisses off readers who read Harry Potter fanfiction because they enjoy reading about magic.

Slash stories should be telegraphed well before the point of insertion.

Try to find a unique angle for your story. With a million or so HP fanfiction stories out there, it isn't easy, but it will probably give you more views.
