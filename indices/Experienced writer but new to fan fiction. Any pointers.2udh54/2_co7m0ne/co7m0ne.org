Ok first you need to forget the canon charactetization, then of course you need to misinterprest and blow out of proportion the character flaws of the characters you don't like.

Dumbledore manipulates harry ? HOLY SHIT HE MUST BE AN EVIL OLD COOT WHO STEALS HARRY AND GIVES LOVE POTION SO HE CAN CONTROL HIM BETTER!!!

Then you need to give harry an awesome power, like, a giant human shaped patronus that can kill dementors, dual animagus form one being a dragon and the other Naruto's Nine tailed fox

Then you need to get him chicks, and the more the better, so get every named female character into his harem excet Ginny fuck that bitch.

Now you need to get him some really good dosh which is easy, just have him make freinds with goblins! so he can open the Potter family vaults where he finds sirius will' so he can now become Lord Potter Black Gryffindor Prevell

now that have all those good ideas just stop wirting there is no more to write...
