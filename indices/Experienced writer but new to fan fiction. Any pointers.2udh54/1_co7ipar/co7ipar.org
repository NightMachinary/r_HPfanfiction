I'd suggest trying to keep the canon characters' personalities mostly intact, and build on top of the canon's magical system instead of introducing an entirely different one. These, I think, are the two main things that keep a fanfic relevant to Harry Potter universe and to the majority of HP fanfic readers' interests. Otherwise it feels like an alien story that only tries to disguise itself as an HP fanfic. This is, of course, only my opinion.

Other than that, I could also recommend reading/sifting through these articles and discussions:

  Do you know of any current demand for a specific kind of fiction or something people are waiting for?
