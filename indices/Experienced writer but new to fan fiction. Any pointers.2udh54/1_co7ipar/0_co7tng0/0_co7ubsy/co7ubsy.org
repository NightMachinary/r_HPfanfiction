  I wouldn't expect too much success [..] FF.Net just has too much momentum behind it that means people will always post fics there, otherwise they'll be missing out on reviews/views.

You'd have better luck asking active writers, since there can be details that are noticeable only from the content-creator's perspective. I myself would either publish only at ff.net, or simultaneously at ff.net+[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]]+[[http://archiveofourown.org/][Archiveofourown.org]], also telling the readers which platform should be preferred for discussions and such.
