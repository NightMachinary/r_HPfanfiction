Have fun with it.

Seriously, if there's anything lacking in more recent fanfiction is the sense of fun with magic. Most use it to turn Harry into a power fantasy, some just barely nod towards it like a replacement for technological conveniences. Many don't even bother bringing it up as they're focused on the relationships between the known characters.

What we need are more stories like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]], and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]], where magic is hinted to be so much more than what we've seen so far.
