Like _Pers said, avoid making muggles superior in everything. (The "but a pen is so much more practicable than a quill" annoys quite a few readers by now.)

Generally I'd say it's harder to get readers if you have many OCs and if the story takes place mostly in the muggle world. I don't know any popular ones like that, e.g., but if your plot is interesting and the writing good I don't see why yours shouldn't be the first. To garner more attention you can either recommend your own story here or maybe post it on darklordpotter.net in the work by author section - the second option has the advantage that you usually get more qualified feedback there than on ffnet (where reviews usually consist of a cry for MOAR).

I guess I don't have to mention it if you usually work with original fiction, but character bashing (manipulative but incompetent Dumbledore, money stealing Weasleys) is not very popular.

If Harry is your main character, I think readers prefer him to be more competent/talented/hard working than in canon.
