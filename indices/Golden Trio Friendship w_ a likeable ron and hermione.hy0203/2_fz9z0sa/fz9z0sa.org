Some of Bobmin356's (RIP) stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]

I'd recommend "Saying No" which starts serious and becomes crackficcy but no pairings, "The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic" which is canon ships but not canon method of defeating Voldemort, "Dumbledore's Army" and its sequel. Also "Healing Harry" ([[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Healing_Harry/Healing_Harry/]]). Most of these are H/G and R/H pairings.

"Not Dumbledore"--kathryn518 (told from Ron's POV; canon relationships) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]]
