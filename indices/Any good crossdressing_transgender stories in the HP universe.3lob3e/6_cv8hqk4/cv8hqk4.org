I just remembered another fic, although anyone easily squicked by slash and gender issues should save us all the trouble and stay away. The pairing is Severus/Sirius, and Snape is a trans!man. It's intense and absorbing and emotionally persuasive, although I confess I still felt a bit distant because I can't quite see Snape as trans. But Snape's gender dysphoria is handled with great attention and sympathy, and the writing is vivid, dramatic, and emotional. Also quite funny and sometimes lewd.

Here's a link to someone else's more in-depth review: [[https://localfreaksficrecs.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/harry-potter-rec-sexing-the-pumpkin-and-pumpkins-are-not-the-only-fruit-by-ratherbrightred/][rec for Sexing the Pumpkin]]

The story is only on LJ, as far as I know.

WARNING: the journal layout is BRIGHT RED (see also their LJ handle - truth in advertising!) and painful to the eyes. Be prepared to copy/paste or convert, because ouch.

ETA: corrected a typo. The redness must have addled my brain.
