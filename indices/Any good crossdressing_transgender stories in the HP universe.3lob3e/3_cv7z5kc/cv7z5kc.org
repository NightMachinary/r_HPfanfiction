Two Snape/Harry crossdressing fics, one for each of them. YMMV for the pairing, but the writers and the stories are excellent.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/515206]]) Full disclosure, I beta'd this fic. It's strangely beautiful, erotic, crude, and atmospheric. Note: it's also locked to AO3, so you need to be a member of the archive to read it.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/997569]]) This is more of a character study, with a fascinating, depressed, queer Snape and a lovely, warm, unashamed Harry.

Hmm, what did I do wrong links-wise? Is the bot unable to pull the information because one fic is archive-locked?

ETA: Figured out my link issues.
