Oh yes, I absolutely agree!

There are so many truly excellent stories in the Snarry ship - I personally think it is because the majority of authors are adults or more "seasoned writers" and their works are truly well written. By nature their relationship is difficult to write and make realistic, so again, I think the authors that write for this ship generally take more effort and care to keep them in character without sacrificing their not-so-platonic relationship. And what again is interesting is seeing their (the characters) difference in years, experience, personality and view points. They're so different yet at the same time, they share similar traits.

So many stories for these two are absolute classics even without the Snarry tag and I am happy to see how many new stories live up to the well-written reputation.

Snape is my favorite character and I always defend him to the death while acknowledging his less than stellar traits. Of course Harry is my second love, so perhaps that is why I like them together as well. Besides, their interactions in the books always tend to steal the show especially with the increasing complexity of their relationship through the years.

Their dynamic is just so interesting and always makes for an excellent read - when written well!
