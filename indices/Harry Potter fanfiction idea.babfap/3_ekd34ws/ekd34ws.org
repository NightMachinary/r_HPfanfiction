It actually sounds like a very simple, yet very interesting idea. I would read it. I think it will come down to how you execute it and characterization. I have a huge fan/critic of characterization so it would have to be done correctly, but from the way you seen to actually analyze the characters it seems like you would do well in that aspect.

Can't really say much that hasn't already been said, link the story when you've posted it and I'll give it a read and a review one way or another.
