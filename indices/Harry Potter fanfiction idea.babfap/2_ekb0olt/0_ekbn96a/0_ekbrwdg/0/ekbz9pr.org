Harry in canon leads well despite having leadership thrust upon him. Symbolism and parallels I think are important. That being said, I don't like the canon relationship. Ron leaves and is forgiven, Hermione runs roughshod over the two with good intentions. I like a Hermione that looks out for the reckless behavior, maybe helps a bit with time management, a Ron that lightens the mood, but will always defend Harry, and a Harry that will always help his friends. I want a trio that will compare to Dumbledore, Bellatrix, McGonagall, Voldemort, Snape, etc.
