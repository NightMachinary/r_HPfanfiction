You indicated that that the fic is going to be adventure, so I think you need to outline the plot itself, and not just the ways you would improve Hogwarts and canon in general. You've got your characters covered, but what will actually happen? What is the story going to be about? If you are going to follow stations of canon, having Maths and English and Dueling and Enchanting electives won't save it from being a boring story. You cannot avoid dealing the philosopher's stone, but you can deal with it differently or introduce some completely new conflicts. There's even less reason for CoS plot to stay the same. Maybe Harry is the one who ends up with the diary? Or Malfoy gives it to another Weasley? Or doesn't give it away at all due to some events in the first year? Surprise your readers.

You can introduce absolutely any change you want, but it must serve the story. Even when you are adding a new elective, don't add it just because Hogwarts students need to know warding, for example, but think how you can use it to further you plot or develop your characters.

Having Harry be friends with more people might make it harder for you, because now you have to juggle a bigger cast. Remember that you need to have character arcs for all your important characters, and not only have Neville there so he could provide exposition about wizarding customs.
