If you follow the same stations in canon, I won't be interested, and especially NOT if your smart/powerful Harry still gets stunned by Wormtail in the Graveyard.

Also, if there's ever a repeat of CoS, the Basilisk should kill, instead of the super lucky sequence of 6 petrifications.

Otherwise, your idea looks good, but please use paragraphs whenever necessary.
