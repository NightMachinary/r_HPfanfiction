My idea is some events needs to be fixed. The philosophers stone will be in the school first year, the diary will be unleashed second year, the Triwizard is being organized, as all those events are independent of Harry. The way all of them resolve however... The chamber of secrets needs to be done properly. I need to justify why Tom Riddle only killed 1 person for instance 50 years ago. I'm not adverse to killing people though. but there must be a reason why no one suspected a basilisk.
