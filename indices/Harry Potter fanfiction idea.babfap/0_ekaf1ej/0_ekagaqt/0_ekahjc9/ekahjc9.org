Fair enough.

I harbor great dislike for canon CoS plot, because that either assumes Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore or Idiot!UselessAdults!PlotDevice!Dumbledore. Both options are bad. Let's just consider this:

1) Dumbledore was very certain that Hagrid was framed.

2) Dumbledore had to know the ghost of the murder victim, Myrtle Elisabeth Warren, was haunting that particular bathroom.

3) Dumbledore could ask only a few basic questions to identify the true culprit and the entrance to CoS:

#+begin_quote
  "Please tell me Miss Warren, what actually happened before you died?"

  "I heard a boy hissing near that sink, and I went there looking. Then I saw a pairs of big yellow eyes, and I just died."
#+end_quote

This is not some highly sophisticated detective work, this is the most basic common sense. I even heard excuses that because she haunted a girl's bathroom, men could not go in to investigate. LOL, I mean what a fucking moron and negligent shit head do you have to be if you let such triviality impede a MURDER INVESTIGATION?

4) Now if Dumbledore asked and Myrtle absolutely refused to talk, multiple times even, then the canon plot had a little bit more excuse. But not by much, because the monster was called the SLYTHERIN'S MONSTER. What was Slytherin's symbol? A snake. What was Slytherin's specialty? Parselmouth. What was the King of Snake? The Basilisk! And what killed people without trace? The Basilisk!

See, the all wise and super intelligent Albus Dumbledore should at least be able to make this almost basic logic deduction, right?

5) Therefore, if the Dumbledore you are writing is not of the Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood type, you need to assume he knows it could be a Basilisk down there, and he would take immediate actions after the first attack, such as flooding the castle with roosters.

6) Finally, petrification in Basilisk attacks is the exception, not the norm. To get 5-6 petrifications is either a chain of extremely lucky events or Tom Riddle intentionally avoids killing.
