Thanks for reading. Right, at this point I am seting the scene and he just has gotten the book, so all the fun things are still to come. Writing Hoid into the HP universe was fun, though. :D

I picture Harry as an elderly wizard telling somebody his story. It is quite hard for me to find the right 1st person POV voice with him. I might still tweak that a bit in later chapters.
