Definitely interested to read this type of fic, seeing as I am halfway through the 2nd Cosmere book.

Not to much has happened so far so can't really comment on the story itself other than your writing is good, maybe a tad bit towards the selecting proper sounding words than is usual in normal human thought, not sure if there's a reason for your Harry to be thinking that way or if you just enjoy a voluble vernacular.
