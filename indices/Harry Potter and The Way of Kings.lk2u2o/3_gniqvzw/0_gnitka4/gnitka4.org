I havn't read RoW yet, so safe for that. If there are any spoilers for Oathbringer, they will only concern the workings of the magic system (if at all? I don't remember a lot of new reveals regarding that between WoR and Oathbringer, especialy with the Ars Arcanum annexed). The chapter I have out already should be safe. I will see to tag spoilers accordingly.
