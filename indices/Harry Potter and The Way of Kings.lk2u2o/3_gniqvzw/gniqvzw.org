Definity interested in reading this but i've not read Oathbringer or Rythym Of War yet. Will there be any early foreshadwing/spoilers for those books, or is it safe for a while?

P.S., you should pick someone, maybe his besft friend, or future love interest, and make them a Mistborn, just a thought :-P
