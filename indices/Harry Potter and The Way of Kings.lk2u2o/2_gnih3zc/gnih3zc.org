I've been meaning to read The Stormlight Archive books but haven't gotten around to it yet(probably because I spent most of my reading time on fanfics). Is any background knowledge on that necessary for this fic, or is it pretty understandable if I just assume Harry read a fantasy book with a unique magic system and tries to imitate it with his magic which leads to cool abilities that HP wizards usually don't have?
