As of now, it reads well fandom-blind. He meets a mysterious guy who gives him a book. And I think you could continue reading fandom-blind, but it will include lots of spoilers to WoK and you wouldn't get all the subtle details where the two worlds blend (which is what makes writing this fic so much fun). As to how exactly the magic systems will work together (or not), I will not spoil that here. :)
