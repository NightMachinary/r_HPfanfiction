Honestly, it might be the way they fall together, like it's not clean, it wasn't planned, but it's perfect.

It might have something to do with the fact Neville will fight for her and Graces is more reluctant.

It might be because although Neville knows that he's not in love yet, he's falling fast, and that Graces doesn't go the same way, she's in denial for more than half the fic!

All in all, the fic is just so amazing and you should definitely give it a read!

(Sorry for the rubbish post - not even a summary! - but I've edited it now) :)
