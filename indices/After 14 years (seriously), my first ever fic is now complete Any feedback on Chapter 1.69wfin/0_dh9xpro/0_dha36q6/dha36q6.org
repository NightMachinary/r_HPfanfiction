  Nearly a quarter of a century had passed How many years is that? The use of "century" exaggerates the time span, which is probably what you aimed for. I'd have used "decades". Still a long time period, but more believable.

A quarter of a century is 25 years. 23 years-ish has passed. Seems perfectly reasonable to say 'nearly a quarter of a century'. Not ambiguous at all. 'Decades' sounds longer to me.
