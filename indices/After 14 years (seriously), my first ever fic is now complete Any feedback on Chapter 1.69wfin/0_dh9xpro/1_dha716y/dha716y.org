I think the "distant," quality of the writing that mention is probably just OP's writing style, honestly. I didn't mind it, actually i thought it was pretty fitting for Sirius and where he was in his mental state at this point.

Agreed that that one scene needs an act break, although that's probably just a formatting thing.
