  A canon-compliant re-telling of OotP from Sirius's perspective. Sirius finds a Dark artifact in Grimmauld Place that forces remorse upon its user. Determined to inflict this punishment on Peter Pettigrew, Sirius quickly finds that the effects are impossible to avoid experiencing for himself. New chapters every week!
