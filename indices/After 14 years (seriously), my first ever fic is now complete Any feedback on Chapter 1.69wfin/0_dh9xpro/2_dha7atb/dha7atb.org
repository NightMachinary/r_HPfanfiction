Thanks! I'm okay with it feeling dream-like, but I can try to loosen up the prose a little if the writing's too distant. It is supposed to be from his perspective after all, so that's probably a good note.

There is indeed supposed to be an act break there, but I can't get it to save that way for some reason. I've given up and posted to Ao3 and the formatting is working fine there. linkao3(10853391)

I see your point about finding the birdcage. I'll mull it over and see if there's a less contrived way to get to that point.
