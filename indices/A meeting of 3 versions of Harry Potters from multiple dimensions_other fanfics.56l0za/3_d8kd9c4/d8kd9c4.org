I could swear I've read a crackfic where Harrys from different universes get accidently summoned, including a somewhat scary Healer and a Dark Lord Harry with a skeletal pet on his shoulder...

It was ages ago and can't seem to remember anything about the title, might try searching through my favs later on.
