No one suggested Tea Time Series? I'm disappointed.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time series]], stared with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]]. It's CC compliant but totally disregard its characterization and stick with the original books. The first story is full with family fluff and the setup for Albus/Scorpius relationship, but the second one moved to a darker side with a new dark uprising. What I liked is how both the next-gen and the original casts are both important in their own ways, there's no useless adult and the children have their own 'war' at Hogwarts.

If you like next-gen stuff you might also enjoy the ones below:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3954448/1/Questions-and-Answers][Questions and Answers]]. Not really canon; Percy, Charlie, and George married different people and has different child, other than that everyone is pretty close to their canon counterpart. It's more of a slice of life stuff that covers */everyone/* from the extended Weasley family, heck it even has a well-written subplot for Parker, Percy's son. I think Albus isn't gay here, but he's friend with Scorpius, but Hugo is bi and Dudley is gay.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7961051/1/Inter-Arma][Inter Arma]]. More James-centric, than Albus-centric. AU where the goblin rebellion started immediately after the war ends. I liked this one because it's similiar to The Tea Time Series, there's no useless adult and they're not really OOC; the children are pretty useless tough.
