I really enjoy the Albus in Stygian Series, but there's no Albus slash (there is some romance between female characters). He is also not majorly angsty at first but as the series progresses he does definitely take a very angsty turn. Still the black sheep and still has issues feeling he has to live up to Harry, like Albus in the Cursed Child. Also strong friends with Scorpius but not romantically so.
