Well, The Accidental Animagus has the Dursleys sent to jail pretty early on. They don't factor much in the story after that, but Petunia appears in the final chapter, where she's turned out a bit better. Pretty satisfying outcome, really.

...Is it strange that I want to see a fic with Vernon and Petunia being de-Grinched? In the sense of learning to accept magic instead of hating Harry and everything, via song and dance and whatnot?
