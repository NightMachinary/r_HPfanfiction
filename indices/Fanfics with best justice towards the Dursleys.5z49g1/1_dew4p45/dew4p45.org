A lot of fics with Bellatrix Lestrange on Harry's side have a good Dursley judging. Most of the time it follows the "you reap what you sow" mantra and have liberal amounts of curses thrown around.

And considering the crimes they are guilty of it can be pretty justified. They are human trash after all. They kept a child starving in a cupboard after all while having four bedrooms available. That can be counted as many cases of attempted murder.
