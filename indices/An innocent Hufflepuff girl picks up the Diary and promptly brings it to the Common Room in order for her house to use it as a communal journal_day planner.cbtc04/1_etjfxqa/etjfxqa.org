Tom Marvolo Riddle was a stubborn person. Cruel, yes, and willing to harm others to reach his goals, but he was, above all, strong-willed.

Even a mere /fragment/ of his soul, of who he was /as a teenager/, should have been enough to overpower most adult wizards, let alone the mere child who first wrote into his diary.

But, even if he was a genius, the spell matrix that allowed his Horcrux to replay his memories, to communicate with other people, to /have a personality/, was not designed to cope with more than one, two people at the same time.

The older students were suspicious of the diary, of course, but their suspects were put to rest as the spell matrix broke down, worn off by the constant onslaught of minds and souls and the /mundane, *inane JOtTiNgS OF hOuSe H̺Ư͒͑͢f̴̴̪͛̒͗̀f̼̺̖͔̿̾͛̀l̷̰̃̓͘ͅE͎͍̗̲͙͊̓͂͘P̴͙͕̮̑̂̓̈́̾͢͠u͚̹̫̇F̗̌̊̃f͇̦͉͇*/.

The diary became quiescent, whatever personality it once displayed /gone/, but the Horcrux was still there - and with every brush of the fingers, with every tear falling on its pages, with every drop of ink soaking its paper, fragments of the contained souls left it.

Tom Marvolo Riddle was strong-willed, but not strong-willed enough to take over dozens of people.

And yet, the fragments of his soul lingered.

Not strong enough to control the children who interacted with him, but strong enough to influence them.

And even if Hufflepuff is known as the house of the duffers, of the underachievers, Hufflepuff is also the house of those who work hard. Who are loyal, who support each other. Who keep in touch after school. Who are patient.

Who can bide their time.

 

*Edit:* seeing the prompt I couldn't help but think of Wizard Lenin in /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/, but I didn't get far enough for the CommiePuffs to stage their revolution. They'll probably change their house colors at some point, though.
