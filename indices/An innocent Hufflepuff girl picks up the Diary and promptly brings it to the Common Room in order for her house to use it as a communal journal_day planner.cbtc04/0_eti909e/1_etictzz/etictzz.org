According to Cursed Child, all Tom has to do is find the right way to humiliate Cedric, and he'll turn evil.

.

*ACT III, SCENE V*

#+begin_quote
  *SCORPIUS:* He wasn't supposed to do it alone. Cedric was supposed to win it with him. But we humiliated him out of the tournament. And as a result of that humiliation he became a Death Eater. I can't work out what he did in the Battle of Hogwarts --- whether he killed someone or --- but he did something and it changed everything.

  *SNAPE:* Cedric Diggory killed only one wizard and not a significant one --- Neville Longbottom.

  *SCORPIUS:* Humiliating Cedric turned him into a very angry young man, and then he became a Death Eater and --- and --- it all went wrong. Really wrong.
