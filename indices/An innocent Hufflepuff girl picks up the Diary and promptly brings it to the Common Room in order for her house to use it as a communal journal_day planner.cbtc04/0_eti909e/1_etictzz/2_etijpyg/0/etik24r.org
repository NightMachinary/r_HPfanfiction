It feels kind of cheating to say that, since Ebony's appearance in My Immortal is deliberately over-the-top, but it's 100% serious in Cursed Child. By that, I mean Delphini's "gorgeous silver hair". Her parents are Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Lestrange, both natural ravenettes. (Finally, an opportunity to use "ravenettes" in context. Always wanted to do that.)

*ACT III, SCENE XVII*

  *RON:* He hasn't run away --- he's having a quiet moment --- he's got himself an older girlfriend ---

  *HARRY:* An older girlfriend?

  *RON:* And a cracking one at that --- gorgeous silver hair. Saw them on the roof together, near the Owlery with Scorpius playing the gooseberry. Nice to see my love potion being used well, I thought.

  */HARRY has a thought. And then he has a dozen more. And none of the thoughts are good./*

  *HARRY:* Her hair --- was it silver and blue?

  *RON:* That's it --- silver, blue --- yup.

  *HARRY:* He's talking about Delphi Diggory.
