Okay, but consider that the express is also used for the Christmas and Easter holidays. Since the castle is almost empty for Christmas, let's say 80% of the student population. For Easter, let's go with the same number. So the total number of student riders the HE has in a year for beginning/end of term and the holidays is: 280/(2+2/.8+2*.8...) which comes to 1456.

For a total of 3000 pasties produced per year, you just need to have an average of 2 pasties consumed per rider, per ride for it to work out. Setting aside Ron-types who can eat a half dozen just on the ride there, I imagine there's a lot of people who eat and take one to go, since they aren't served at hogwarts itself.
