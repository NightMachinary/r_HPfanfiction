Among those two, I think Draco's gotta be the choice. It gives a different enough perspective while retaining the essential boarding school theme. Ron's would be the exact same as Harry's, except missing many of the exciting bits. So I don't think that would work at all. People have brought up Dumbledore. I don't think Dumbledore would work either. Too eccentric and elusive. Very few writers could pull Dumbledore POV off imo

The /best/ alternate POV, however, is Ginny or Neville during Harry's 7th year. That's by far the biggest chunk we're missing from the series: seeing Hogwarts under the Death Eaters, how the students cope with it/thrive under it, how they find the strength and courage to defy the Carrows. It would also be interesting to see how Snape would be subtly undermining the regime, or alternatively, maybe Snape is more playing both sides than Dumbledore realizes and that shines through. Either way, we needed way more Snape in Deathly Hallows considering how essential he ended up being for the endgame.
