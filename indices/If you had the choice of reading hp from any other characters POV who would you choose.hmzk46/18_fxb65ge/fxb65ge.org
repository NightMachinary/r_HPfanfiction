For the full canon story, this is a boring choice but probably Hermione....Oh, or Voldemort! In all his incarnations. I was trying to think of who is around for most of the action bits after Harry.

For fan fic I love Harry-centric, so with fics I actually like to go completely the other way and see outsider/OC POV.
