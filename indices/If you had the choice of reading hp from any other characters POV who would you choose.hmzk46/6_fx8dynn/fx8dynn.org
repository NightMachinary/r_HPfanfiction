Umbridge is one good idea, to have story from the point of view of evil person could be interesting (although, exhaustive to write, C.S.Lewis said that writing The Screwtape Letters almost consumed him).

Or somebody completely else: something like linkffn(Daphne Greengrass, Side Character by LinzRW), linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot), or not be Slytherin-centric linkao3(Somewhere in the Background by Q_loves_you), linkao3(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes), or even to some extent linkao3(A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic).
