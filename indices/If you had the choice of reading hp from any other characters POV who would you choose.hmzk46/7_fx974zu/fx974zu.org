I think that it changes from book to book.

- PS : Probably Hagrid tbh, potentially McGonagall

- CoS : Madam Pomfrey or Professor Sprout

- PoA : Without a shadow of a doubt Lupin or Snape

- GoF : Maybe this is a cop out, but Hermione

- OotP : Luna probably, or one of the Weasley twins

- HBP : Either Ginny or Dumbledore

- DH : Neville, Ginny, Luna or Lupin
