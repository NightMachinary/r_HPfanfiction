  for Hermione I think she's to much of a baby

Have we read the same books? She had a bad case of teenage stupidity in HBP, as did everyone else, but calling the woman who, at one point, was one of the two people still fighting for the good cause in a hopeless situation a baby does her a gross disservice. Tactless I'd get, cruel/ruthless even (Umbridge's fate in the forest anyone?), but a baby? Pretty much everyone else is better described with that term.
