Unfortunately, Luna does not work as a main character since you'd have to take away her Lunaness in order to make her somewhat sane. Because in canon she's basically one of those 5G Corona, Nazi Moonbase, Lizard people run the government type of people. Which is great for comic relief, but would annoy everyone after 5 minutes.
