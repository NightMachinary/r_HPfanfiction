Linkffn(Blindness) isn't strictly WBWL as Harry's still the BWL, but Dumbledore assumes that Neville is the boy of the Prophecy after finding out that Harry was left permanently blind by Voldemort's Avada. Neville saves the Philosopher's Stone, defeats the Basilisk, et cetera et cetera while Harry and Hermione (who left Hogwarts after almost getting killed by the Troll) decipher the mysteries of transfiguration.
