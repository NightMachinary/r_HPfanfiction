A fic where the rest of the magical world is explored through a character driven and exciting story.

In it are:

- Mentions of magical places like Babylon, Atlantis and others
- A variety of magical creatures with their own cultures and ways of hiding from muggles
- Harry, Hermione and Ron as the original trio, or just Harry.
- New magics, deeper lore, a compelling history of magical beings on earth and mystical explanations for magic in general.

Not in it are:

- Horcruxes, Voldemort (had enough of him as the villain) and the usual suspects
- Blatant Mary-sueing of a region. May it be a wet Weeabo dream of Japan or the patriotic circlejerk of the US wizards.
- Super powerful Harry
- Lord Potter
- Awkward, written out sex scenes
- Harem
- The usual suspects (Mpreg and all that fuzz)
- Mothafuckin Magical Cores

What could be fun, but has potential to fail spectacular:

- Romance (maybe even with another magical race)
- Shamanism, Voodoo and other branches of magic. (The Wild Hunt in Central Europe would be a fun thing to explore)
- A variety of OC's
