I read the Hero trilogy probably five years ago so I don't remember too many details, but I remember the first book was great, the second one was okay but sometimes confusing, and the third one was fantastic.

I HEAVILY recommend checking out the authors real works, especialy the Reminiscent Exile series. The first book is short, but holy crap is the second one good
