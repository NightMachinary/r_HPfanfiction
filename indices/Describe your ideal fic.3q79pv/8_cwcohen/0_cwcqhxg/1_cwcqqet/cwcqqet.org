I got up to about the tenth chapter. I was a bit put off by the length of the chapters and the writing style, first person and a lot of swearing, but it was pretty cool. I don't know if I'll finish reading it though because it's not necessarily what I'm after, seems very action focused. Also, the sequel Heartlands is incomplete, so that sucks.

I hear the Hero trilogy is also really great, but I haven't read it.
