I suppose I should start. My ideal fic is a mostly character-driven fic based on atmosphere and world building. Think Dark Souls, and that type of decadent, high fantasy atmosphere where you're roaming around a dead, dying world--that's the brand of atmosphere I like.

I've always wanted to write a story like this. As in, since maybe like two years ago. Still haven't got around to it because that shit is HARD. I have so many cool ideas for it too, I could have the first part of the story set in Atlantis, and that could be something like, I don't know, the final outpost of a now extinct civilization, and the characters would end up in a different world and try to find their way home and there would be ruins and castles and villages and temples and forests and, ugh! Nobody writes stuff like this! It's all romance and same old let's go to Hogwarts but a little bit differently this time.

That was a bit more of a ramble than I'd planned, but I think the point has been made.
