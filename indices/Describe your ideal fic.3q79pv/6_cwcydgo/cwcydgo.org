My ideal fic is one that actually uses and/or explores the more extreme, deeper, or just plain /older/ forms of magic. Legitimate white and black magic, necromancy, druidic magic, ritual magic, sympathetic magic like voodoo. The /primordial/ things. I remember in one fic I read, Harry was getting a tour of the Department of Mysteries, and the Unspeakable guiding him pointed to a scale model of the Earth and said "Don't touch that. The last time someone bumped it, Mt. Krakatoa erupted. We're still not sure if it was a coincidence."

What I'm actually attempting (slowly) to write is something that's been swimming around in my head for a while.

See, one thing that's been bugging me ever since I started reading fanfiction is that the number of actually /competent/ Harry Potters are few and far between. Mostly they try to stay true to canon, not that I'm saying they shouldn't, but canon Harry was angsty and lucky, nothing else. After five years of schooling, he barely knows as many spells. If he didn't have a brother wand, he'd be dead. If he weren't so damn attached to the disarming spell and disarmed Draco, he'd be dead. He /did/ walk to his damn death. If Voldemort weren't so attached to the Killing Curse, Harry would be dead.

It just gets ridiculous at times.

I don't want luck, I want to see a war torn /badass/. I want to see a fic where personal tragedy /forces/ him to make something more of himself.

To that end, what I'm writing about is 3 different Potters. Each get messed up in different ways. Each come out of it far greater than anyone could expect. And when their own stories end, they get pulled through a trans-dimension portal to fight in cannon Harry's stead, they /deal/ with it. Not everything goes right for them; a lot of things go wrong, in fact, because while they may be competent, they're fighting on the losing side. But I will most definitely enjoy having them bring the fight to the Death Eaters.
