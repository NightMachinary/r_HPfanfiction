Okay, let's see. Good grammar is obligatory and not really even worth mentioning. Good writing clearly isn't obligatory for fanfiction, but the story would need that too.

I'd definitely want the ideal fic to be multi-pov. I don't think Harry alone provides a good enough slate to write the ideal fic, but you can't have a HP fic would Harry POV either. I think the characters I'd want to have a POV would be;

- Harry,

#+begin_quote
  for rather obvious reasons. Shows the story from a young perspective, and it's a POV inside Gryffindor (possibly other house. I think in /the/ ideal fic he'd be Slytherin).
#+end_quote

- Hermione,

#+begin_quote
  but only if Harry isn't actually in Gryffindor. Without Harry in Gryffindor I can see Hermione being alone and probably lonely too, which would make her a far more interesting character. She'd also be a good POV from Gryffindor if Harry wasn't there.
#+end_quote

- Draco,

#+begin_quote
  provides probably the most interesting Slytherin POV if Harry isn't sorted there. You could argue for a less important Slytherin POV, maybe Theodore or Daphne or whatever, but I think you could write the most interesting story with Draco. You don't really want to have too much POV from the top-players, but having someone that's closely connected to them would be interesting. I'm coming back to biased writing later, but for now I'll just mention that this would hinge on the author being capable to write a good Lucius. Someone in his position should be more Tywin Lannister and less Gilderoy Lockhart, as fanon likes to write Lucius.

- Remus,

#+begin_quote
  if you want to write a good story, you can't just have POV from kids. Remus is probably the adult in the best position to write a POV from. Narcissa could work too, if you want an adult POV on Voldemort's side that isn't directly in the line of fire - I think Lucius would be too open. I likened his position to Tywin earlier, and you would notice if you've read ASoIaF that there are no Tywin POVs. You want the manipulative and powerful players to be outside the readers view - otherwise you'll miss a lot of possibilities for intrigue and plot threads.

  Back to Remus, he's not severely restricted in his movements like Sirius, he's directly affiliated with Dumbledore but not stuck at Hogwarts, and he's a part of an oppressed minority. He's also shown to be quite poor, while almost all other characters have at least a relatively comfortable amount of money, except the obvious token poor family, the Weasleys. After Yudkowsky I'm sort of sold on the idea that the wizarding world is already almost post-scarcity, but I digress.
#+end_quote

- Someone with Grindelwald,

#+begin_quote
  if you want to introduce Grindelwald as major player, you'll need a related POV character. You do not want to use Grindelwald himself as a POV character, because of reasons previously stated. You would probably have to find either a canon character to affiliate with him (a Voldemort related character fleeing to Grindelwald?) or introduce an OC.

  Personally, I'd love Harry to be affiliated with Grindelwald, but that's rather specific. Someone previously on this subreddit mentioned that maybe Grindelwald's ideology was in support of the muggleborns against pureblood elitism and muggles both, in which case you could have a muggleblood disillusioned with wizarding Britain leave and join his cause. A lonely intellectual Hermione could be very interesting, but I think she'd need some serious conditioning in order to join the wizarding nazis. She'd certainly fit in though.

Next, I think the most key aspect of /the/ ideal fic would be a skilled and relatively unbiased author. I'm not sure I've read a fic that isn't either super-liberal "all-purebloods-are-idiots-and-inbred" to a degree that makes Rowling's canon morals seem tame, or "everything Voldemort said was correct and purebloods /are/ indeed the master race." These stories are usually slash too.

What I want is something written by someone that manages to stay unbiased and /doesn't/ push their real-life beliefs in the story. Firstly, because these are fictional characters, /not/ an extension of them, and secondly, because real life morals and ethics aren't 100% applicable in a fictional setting. Real life racism is one thing, where there's almost no differences in "races" and it's mostly a scapegoat for other ideologies, but in Harry Potter there's an obvious and incredibly fracturing difference in the races.

The ideal fic would definitely have to handle the muggle question. Characters like Dumbledore, Remus or Hermione would probably see the muggles as equals, in face of all logic, Voldemort and his supporters I think would see (note; this is a generalization. In the ideal story, I /expect/ every character to hold their own beliefs and morals. *NO* black and white.) the muggles as pests to be exterminated, and Grindelwald, I think, would want to rule them for the greater good.

The challenge comes in handling this appropriately. Modern western ideas tells us that Dumbledore is in the right here and that we must reach egalitarianism at all costs. And in an ideal real life situation, you are probably right. But in this setting? Hiroshima, Chernobyl, 1939, 1914, Holocaust, Industrialization, Colonization, Deforestation, Extinction, Dresden, Gulf of Mexico leaks, Fracking, Coral bleaching, Arctic melting, Desertification, Witch burnings, Crusades, Jihad, Inquisition - I could go on forever. There's one word that ties all of the above together: Muggles. Take that as you will.

Did I convince you above? Would you, as a muggleborn, become convinced by the argument above? I know I would. "/Everything on Earth would be better off without the muggles, except the muggles./"

To wrap up the ideal fic, I'd want satisfying endings, no deus ex machinaes or protagonist bias, well handled relationships, and realistic character growth and arcs.

For brownie points, have Grindelwald's end-game be a massive leyline ritual that restores Earth to it's ancient more magical state and obliterates all non-Magical "corruption." If you write the scene where New York falls apart and returns into an untouched swamp well, I may or may not love you forever.

I also probably forgot a lot of stuff but I'm tired and this is already long enough.
