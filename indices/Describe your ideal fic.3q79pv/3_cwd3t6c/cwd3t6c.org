I also want to read a book where the prophesied one isn't the BWL, isn't the one 'marked as his equal'. Like Volde goes for Neville, Neville is the BWL. James and Lily are killed by death eaters, marauders die, or Sirius is in Azkaban, doesn't matter just that they don't take Harry.

So Harry is shipped off to the Dursley's, except without the threat of death eaters coming after them in retribution the Dursley's don't keep Harry they just dump him off at a church or something and he grows up similar to Tom Riddle. He'd be the one 'marked as his equal'. Still not sure what to do with the 'power he knows not' though. So he'd be more like a competing dark wizard than a hero.
