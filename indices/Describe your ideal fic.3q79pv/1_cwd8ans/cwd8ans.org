My ideal story:

- Is Harry-centric, told from third person limited.

- Is set during Hogwarts years and tells a divergent storyline from canon (completely divergent, not a rehash with altered elements).

- Is a mixture of mystery, coming of age, and adventure, with some action, romance and politics.

- Tells a contained story each Hogwarts year which also contributes towards a developing 7 year arc.

- Characterises Harry as canon but emphasises his positive traits (determination, bravery, nerve, a cool head, strong willpower, great at making deductive leaps and solving puzzles).

- Has a clear character arc for each of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

- No bashing of anyone. Canon characterisations all round, though it's okay to put slight twists on people (e.g. making Voldemort less crazy). Most importantly, that means no evil or incompetent Dumbledore. Also no inexplicably helpful uberGoblins.

- Puts Harry on a path towards having a level of magical skill roughly equivalent to his parents, but does so through playing to Harry's strengths of practical learning, making personal deductions about how things work on the basis of experience, intuition and practice. Harry does not turn into Hermione 2.0. He's already curious and enthusiastic about learning magic in canon, he just excels most in a practical environment (see Patronus Charm).

- Romance elements involve a succession of relatively non-serious relationships, not "Great Love". No OTPs that last the entire stretch of Hogwarts, no early marriages.

- Explores new locations within Hogwarts.

- Lots of material depicting Hogwarts as a magic school, not a warzone (i.e. coming of age elements). Lessons consist of more than a teacher giving a three minute speech, answering a few questions then sending kids to their next class. Lessons involve *[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=845116&postcount=145][activities]]*. Teenagers act like teenagers.

- Explores the history of magical Britain but through titbits not infodump.

- Develops a greater idea of the international wizarding world.

- Has a new DADA teacher each year who has some connection to larger events.

- Expands our knowledge of magic but doesn't provide any trite explanations such as "magic is X". Magic is explored primarily through magic in use rather than abstract discussions.

- The tone of the canon magical system is kept, including but not limited to: no magical exhaustion, no wish magic or shortcuts to power, no powerful wandless magic, no explanation of magic in physical/mathematical terms nor forcing magic to act analogously to physical forces (thermodynamics, I'm looking at you), understanding of magic playing a key role in its casting (either through understanding of theory or through intuitive understanding via experience).

- No sensible character at any point suggests that Muggle weapons could be used to overcome magical foes.
