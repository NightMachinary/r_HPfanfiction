I'm not exactly interested in what made people afraid of uttering Voldemort's name, but generally, what made them so afraid of him. I want to see what horrendous atrocities he committed in order to be so reviled. How exactly the average wizard reacted to him. How he really displayed his prodigious power? because just Imperioing and Crucioing people isn't that special. What he was like before he "showed his true face" (as Sirius says)... and for that matter, when and why did his face began looking like a snake's. (I know that Horcruxes are involved, but suspect there is more to it, because Dumbledore told us he "underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations" and that's before all the Horcruxes come to light.)

Rowling informed us that Voldemort's rise was truly horrible, that he traveled the world and acquired powers and "consorted with the very worst of our kind" (/who were they?/), that he pushed the limits of magic further than anyone before him (I don't think that he's just talking about making a Horcrux x 7 here). But she never really shown us examples of all this, only threw us some token chewed bones.
