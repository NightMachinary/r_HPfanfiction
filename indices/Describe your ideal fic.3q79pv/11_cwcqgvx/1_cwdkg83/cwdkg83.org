  What made the wizarding world so terrified of the Dark Lord's name?

linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) Explains this really well if you haven't read it. Basically Harry in this alternate dimension is a death eater, but a really ruthless and skilled one. People stop saying his name, they just call him /Him/ a lot. I think its Dumbledore who says 'Its a small step from /him/ to you-know-who.

Basically overall I don't think it was a magical taboo thing like in DH, I think the wizarding world and just a superstitious lot. The taboo wouldn't have worked the first time when a lot of people said his name, and he wasn't in control of the ministry anyway.
