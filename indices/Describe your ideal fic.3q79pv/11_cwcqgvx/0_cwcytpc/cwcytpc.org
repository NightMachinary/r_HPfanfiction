  What made the wizarding world so terrified of the Dark Lord's name? An account of Voldemort's first rise through the eyes of Auror Edgar Bones, full of gruesome detail and ruthless bloodshed.

I'd always wondered about this. Learning about the Taboo made sense of the fact that everyone flinched when his name was said, as saying his name basically called down death upon you. Anyone would flinch at that. Dumbledore was always encouraging people to say Voldemort's name, but in retrospect it was /very/ much unpolitic, even antagonistic, of him to do so, not even counting his other declarations of Voldemort's return. For an experienced statesman, this seems very strange. Frankly, I'm not sure Rowling even knew /how/ to make him politically savvy.
