My favorite fics are the ones where Voldemort is hiding in plain sight and immediately resorts to violence if something falls out of line.

- Voldemort's wraith cloud thing decides to pay a visit to Harry at Privet Drive to see what he's doing. He accidentally absorbs the horcrux in Harry's scar and gets a 6 year old body that looks related to Harry. He decides that the best course of action is to murder Dudley and Vernon, pretend to be Harry's illegitimate American brother and get adopted by Aunt Petunia so he can study whatever the power he knows not is.

- Harry ended the war with an unbreakable vow with Voldemort that neither would directly or indirectly attack the other (or something like that) so both of them are immortal. 100 years later or so, Minister of Magic Draco Malfoy forces both of them to work together to investigate some disappearances in France. The ending of this one is really great.
