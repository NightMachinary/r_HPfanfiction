Decent idea, but your grammar isn't great. Probably because of mobile. I look forward to seeing what you do with a proper keyboard and without being rushed/bothered while writing.

One thing bothered me a bit: You open up with two very serious sentences and then say 'various other bits she didn't wanna contemplate'.

It seems like an odd juxtaposition where you're using serious language talking about dead children and lakes running red with blood and then you swap to less serious language for half that sentence with 'various other bits' and 'wanna'. You could've just said 'blood and sweat' or 'blood, sweat, and viscera' and it would've worked better to my brain.

I'm not trying to throw stones I'm just curious if anyone knows what the proper term for this is, if it even has one, and if I'm just making it up in my head.
