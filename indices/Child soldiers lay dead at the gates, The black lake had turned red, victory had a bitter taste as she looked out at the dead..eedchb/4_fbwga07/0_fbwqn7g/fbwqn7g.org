It's not a bad fic, but thing that made me drop it was;

chap1 spoiler: Voldemort joins on the travel back (unsure how completely, as I dropped it before that was explained)... I don't enjoy fics where the antagonist has the upper hand and things don't work out^{or seem like they won't}, so this one didn't do it for me.
