This is my fic, it is the middle one in a trilogy that is actually almost as long as the entire seven HP books. The OC is the daughter of Severus Snape and Bellatrix Lestrange (Making it an AU). I am linking the middle one because it is the one that follows the OC through Hogwarts. I pride myself on a sympathetic but true to character portrayal of Snape, and it's mentor!Snape as well, if that's your thing.
