I would have said the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom, since he might have been until recently (and wasn't that just great?).

The series of fics by sweasley that follow Teddy and Victoire through school are one possibility linkffn(The Start by sweasley), but they are also sort of not OC (even though practically nothing was/is known).

You might try the Alexandra Quick series by Inaverarity. Four of seven books have been complete, and its an AU magic in America story, but it is probably the most original answer to your questions.

You might try looking for stories about Sirius's daughter fics. There are several out there that follow her growing up alongside the main characters in Hogwarts.
