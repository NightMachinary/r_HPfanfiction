It's likely I am slightly misremembering, since I read it a while ago. I do remember thinking it was an good coming of age story and I enjoyed reading it, but I realized that Harry's one-sided adolescent attraction being used as a weapon to manipulate him was about the maximum level of “shippiness” (I have a low tolerance for romance and sexuality in HP fics in general) that I would tolerate for such a prompt. It is unlikely that someone has written a fic that treats their relationship like Limpieza de Sangre did without devolving into even more explicitly shippy territory, and I don't want to read something that apes that fic's premise anyway.
