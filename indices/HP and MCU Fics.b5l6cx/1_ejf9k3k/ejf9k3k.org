[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]] - Really good but I lost interest by the time the author thought it was a good idea to add a 3rd girl to the harem and then a possible 4th one, that's just too much dude and it felt really forced.

If there was a way to skip all the romance in this fic it would be one of the greatest crossovers.
