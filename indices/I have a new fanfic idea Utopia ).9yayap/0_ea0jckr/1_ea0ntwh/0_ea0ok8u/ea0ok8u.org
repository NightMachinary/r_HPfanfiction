It explores a first contact between humanity (in the distant future) and two other races.

The first race is less technologically advanced than humans (but still spacefaring), and has a culture centered around adults hunting and eating their own terrified children. They're not sadistic, though; their distant ancestors produced lots of babies with the expectation that only a few would survive, like fish, and when they first developed agriculture, with about the intelligence of apes, they found that by only allowing a few to survive, those few could be better cared for, producing overall better outcomes. That winnowing, For the Greater Good, gradually came to define their society, their language, their entire view of the universe.

Of course, the humans are horrified by this, especially when they learn that the children's brains survive for weeks, in sensory deprivation and great pain, after being swallowed. Some of them want to gather military forces and go to war against the baby eaters, but although they can all see problems with that, no one can see an actually good and acceptable solution.

Then the second race appears. They're much more advanced than humans. Their brain chemistry is quite different, allowing them to think at much higher speeds. They have eliminated pain and suffering and engineered their bodies to continually feel pleasure, and they are horrified by humanity's failure to protect its own children from pain, injury, and death. /To them, we are the baby eaters/, and they want to intervene.

I recommend reading it as a test of how open minded you really are, whether you really take people as you find them or whether, when all is said and done, you think everyone else should share your values.
