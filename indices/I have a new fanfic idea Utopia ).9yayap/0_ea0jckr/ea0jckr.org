I was going to suggest that you read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which is not at all what you describe, but has a protagonist who would understand your point of view.

However, I actually think that you should read [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8][Three Worlds Collide]].
