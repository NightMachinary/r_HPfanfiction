Cheers. Idealistic but surreal. Utopia is a concept of Greater Good. Not everyone will share the idealistic ideas, not everyone will want to adhere to the laws and ideas that govern your Utopia. They could easily throw the world into chaos by chosing to change the existing system through 'Propaganda of the deed', the foremost tool for changes in a (to them) tyrannic system. Those believing into the idea of your Utopia would call their acts terrorism. To them it is the fight for freedom.

Utopia is not universal. It cannot exist without the tyranny of enforcing its rules.
