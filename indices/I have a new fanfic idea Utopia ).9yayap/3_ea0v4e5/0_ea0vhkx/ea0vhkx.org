But I did say it would NOT be "enforced" in my fanfic. :) The WORLD is free and accessible to all, but everyone still has the CHOICE to accept it or not. So no it is not tyranny, it's just offering them the choice of good living standards in the society. Yes it is not different anyway from living in America having good schools and also vaccinations even though those are mandated because it would cause harm if they were not. Yes my utopia magic world would not enforce anything more than normal societies do! :) Unless it was to explicitly not allow harm of others like vaccination refusing.
