I was not proposing a total merging into a single community, just allowing them the opportunity if they wish to. Just like we allow gay people, black people, or disabled children to go to a school with all the majority white kids if they want to. Just like we have china and japan and canada, but people are still free to come and go and live in all these places if they wish to. We have american asians, we have japanese canadians, british africans. I do not mean throw everyone into a huge merging, I mean let them stay separate but give them the opportunity and the freedom to come together and cross if they want to. They would be a minority student population of Hogwarts, but you would still see them.
