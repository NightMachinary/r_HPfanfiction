  Centaurs and mermaids getting accommodations to attend Hogwarts
#+end_quote

I see this idea a lot from authors who espouse equality and I don't get it at all. Would centaurs or mermaids /want/ to go to Hogwarts and learn from people whose magical tradition is so different from theirs?

Even funnier is giving them representation in Wizengamot (a wizarding group for governing wizards) like some fics do, and pretending they're all one big happy community. Being a part of the government would mean they have to obey its laws, and I don't see centaur tribes ever paying any heed to wizarding law as they gallop around their forests. Same with goblins, whose culture is in some ways diametrically opposed to wizards'.

Even if you come up with a set of laws that would be somehow accepted and adhered by every species, and merge everyone into a single community with a single schooling system and government, that seems to go counter the lofty idea of diversity you were going for in the first place.
