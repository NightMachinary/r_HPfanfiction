It depends on whether Voldemort is actually buying into the "pureblood Ã¼ber alles" ideology, considers this a cultural and not racial question (so, muggleborns can be assimilated if they're removed from the muggle influence early enough), is simply using whatever pretext works to gain and keep power, or a mix of such choices.

I've written a story where Malfoy takes over Britain by faking Voldemort's survival in 1981, and he has the muggleborns removed from their families as soon as they are spotted, obliviated if needed, and raised as janissaries personally loyal to him while he is nominally pandering to pureblood bigots. Dumbledore took the remains of the Order into exile to France, but has preparing his return. And when Voldemort returns and Malfoy doesn't want to give up his power, Dumbledore sees his opportunity - and uses Ron and his brothers as well as Harry as his agents. Ron and his brothers go undercover in Britain, and Harry and Dumbledore start hunting Horcruxes.
