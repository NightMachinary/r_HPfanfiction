linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) has a very similar vibe to what you're saying, although it has an immortal Salazar Slytherin in charge, a caste system in place, and Tom Riddle as a former military man and the current headmaster of Hogwarts. It updates slowly, but is so very worth reading!
