Hm... While Riddle and his followers proclaim very extreme views about muggleborns, in real world such politics don't survive long. International society may tolerate them while they are playing in boundaries of their own country, but it can intervent if they try to go outside. In case of Magical world there is a very carefully guarded Statue of Secrecy.

Combining this together I can imagine that in long term Riddle's controlled government wouldn't apply any extreme measures to muggleborns. With mundane world becoming more complicated with each year, it's harder to hide all traces of a child (memory charm isn't enough) -- mass disappearances (or killings) will get attention of non-magical government that can lead to the SoS breaking, which is unacceptable.

I can think that muggleborns will be required to attend a school (or courses) in order to teach them magical control, then they are sworn to secrecy and excluded from Magical world. Everyone is happy.

As with Hitler that Riddle's fall can start with him trying to spread his influence outside of Britain. In this case other countries will take actions (start a magical war?) against him.
