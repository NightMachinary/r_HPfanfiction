[[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] , I'm pretty sure this is your cue.

Anyway...I'm not sure it would end well; if you have a pureblooded culture that knowingly and wilfully insulating themselves against muggle influences, that would make maintaining the Statute of Secrecy very difficult. Especially if you assume that they reject ties with the muggle Prime Minister and other members of the government.

(As a side note, I have to question just how MACUSA managed to keep magic from being revealed in the 175 years of Rappaport's Law prohibiting any intentional interaction between magical and non-magical.)

There's also the question of various magical creatures; how would they fare under a pro-pureblood culture? Would they resist and try to break the Statute of Secrecy as well? Would they end up being exterminated?

I mused a little on purebloods eventually destroying themselves, once. About how 'muggleborn' was a meaningless distinction, after they had gotten rid of all the mudbloods they'd start on the half-bloods for not being 'pure' enough, then the poorer pureblood families, etc, etc.
