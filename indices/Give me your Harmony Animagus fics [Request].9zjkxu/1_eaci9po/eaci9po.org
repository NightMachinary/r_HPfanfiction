The first fanfic I ever read was linkffn(More Than Familiar) because someone posted about it being a horrible fanfic in [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]]. It's a weird mix between horrible and hilarious. They both become animagi and are in a relationship with Hedwig. Who also ends up being an animagus, but that doesn't make it any less weird.
