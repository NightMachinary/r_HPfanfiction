I did. It's a really good story, and the sequel is shaping up nicely too.

And now imagine that instead of the character that White Squirrel wrote there - Hermione, eager to please and impress and develop in the magical world - we have another muggleborn, unable to find his niche after Grindlewand's war but wanting to spread his talent to help the muggles. That's the sort of thing I meant.

I don't have the maths skills to be able to write such a story. "The Arithmancer" is well-done for many reasons, not least that it mentions all the topics Hermione studies without needing the reader to understand them.

And anyway - it was just an idea.

Although if he were to use the muggles to solve arithmancy problems that had the wizarding world stuck... hmm. I can see how this might go now.
