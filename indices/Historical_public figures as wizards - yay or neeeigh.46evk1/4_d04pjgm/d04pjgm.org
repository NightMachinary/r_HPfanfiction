I don't think I've seen any stories where this has been done well, but there's no reason why it couldn't be, although I imagine it would be pretty tricky. If there's a good reason why a historic figure should have been a wizard (or squib) then it's fine.

Take [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s][Paul Erdos]], for instance. He had a reputation for real eccentricity in his time (that WP article has him called "The Oddball's Oddball") that would fit with the eccentricity of wizards in the muggle world. Could he really have been a gifted Arithmancer, determined to help muggles as best he could? Not sure how that could become a good story, admittedly...

I don't have a problem with fanon extensions, though. For instance, we know the Prime Minister is told about magic - it seems logical that the Queen would know too. She doesn't have to be a squib herself.
