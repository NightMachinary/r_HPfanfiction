Nay. I honestly hate this quite a lot, as it ruins immersion. Usually it's done as a throwaway line, like saying Newton, or the Queen was actually a squib. I can maybe buy a wizard trying to claim a muggle's discovery as their own because they are prejudiced, but for it to actually be true is dumb.
