I don't mind magic being another branch of science (in fact I'm writing a Sherlock & HP crossover where Sherlock is trying to rationalize/prove this very thing), but I dislike cheapening past accomplishments with magic. There are definitely some historical figures that I wouldn't mind, like a few Egyptian alchemists or eccentric painters. I've even read before of a famous Nazi scientist being mentioned as a wizard and the author made a believable case for her idea. But generally, I doubt many political figures would have had magical origins, otherwise their policies and war tactics would be noticeably different.
