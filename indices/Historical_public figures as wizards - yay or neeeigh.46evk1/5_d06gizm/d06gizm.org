As much as my rational well-educated non-magical mind says that I should feel insulted by these authors' ideas, it's hard for me to follow that up with genuinely affronted feelings. Let me explain that a bit:

Wizards have been capable of what I believe to be a diverse and world-breaking set of magic spells, at least when you consider the time and place we're talking about here. If you compare our real past's literacy rate in Britain, which was (in parts significantly) below 20 percent until at least the mid 16th century, then you get an inkling for how different these two societies must have been. The difference in education alone is massive, since children from established magical families would have either tutored their offspring, looked for apprenticeships or sent them to Hogwarts.

Now, it's certainly true that in today's world these wizards would not be capable of blending in or appearing very smart for that matter, but 500 years ago your average wizard would be as well educated as any noble. Without the Statute of Secrecy in the way, wizards would not have separated themselves entirely from the non-magical society. There can only be one logical conclusion I've been building up to: the chances are good, that some well-remembered historical figures were wizards or if not, they should have been.

I don't think the theory of the /stagnant wizarding society/ applies, because a) we don't know any details about the wizarding world back then and b) I only consider an ignorant society to be stagnant and I believe /that/ only happened after wizards cut themselves off from non-magicals.

For all I know, wizards could have lived at a relatively stable 18th century standard of living for the past thousand years. They were certainly capable of that and I could mention lots of examples to back it up. Lets not forget that the 18th century is the exact time-frame, which we consider the birth of the modern era. The industrial revolution could have happened a very long time ago, if wizards had ever deemed it useful. With a small and long-lived population however, they never had any impetus to deploy their magic in an industrial scale.

This shouldn't be taken as a criticism of our own non-magical society. Indeed, I'm proud of what we have managed to become and achieve from our humble beginnings as tree dwellers on the African savannahs a long, long time ago. People who are offended by the "/wizards are responsible for some non-magical advancements/" idea often do not consider the circumstances as I have laid out. If you take a number of well-educated wizards and let them interact with non-magicals in their daily lives, you'll inevitably find a particularly smart one every now and then. I fail to understand how this could be offensive.
