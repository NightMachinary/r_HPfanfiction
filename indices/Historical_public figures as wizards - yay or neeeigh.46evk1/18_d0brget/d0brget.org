I just feel personally offended when a story does that. I remember couple of fics where Einstein, Newton, Galileo are suddenly wizards for no reason at all. Why would you do that? Are muggles insanely stupid that they can't have their own scientists and can't learn about laws of nature on their own?

It's like turning up on someone house and claiming it as your own. It's like the author doesn't realize that everything around them is the result of these "muggles", the computer, the internet, the satellites and so on. What will you claim next? that transistors were invented by wizards because they felt bad for muggles, or that Google is secretly run by tech-witches?

Now I know it's all fiction, but seriously don't write this kind of stuff.
