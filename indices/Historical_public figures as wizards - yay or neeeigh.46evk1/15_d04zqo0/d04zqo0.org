I've never personally come across it but I could imagine that it can be done well. I have to think of Assassin's Creed and how in that fandom templars and assassins have basically been running the world behind the scenes (or tried to at least) for centuries. If it's done well, it could be quite interesting.

But I also see how it could be done horribly but that is the case for almost every fanfiction trope so, yeah.
