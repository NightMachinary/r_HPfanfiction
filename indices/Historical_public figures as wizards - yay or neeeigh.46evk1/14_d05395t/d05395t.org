I'm pretty hardcore in the wizards > Muggles camp, but even I draw the line here. It just feels cheap to appropriate those achievements Muggles do have and attribute them to wizards. Like a kind of wizarding insecurity by proxy. Wizards have no reason to be feeling insecure and neither should the people writing them.
