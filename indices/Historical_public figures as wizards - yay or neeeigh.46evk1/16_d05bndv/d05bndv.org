Within the context of /Harry Potter,/ I would say that I am opposed to the idea.

But I am not opposed to the idea entirely. There's a fantasy series called /Grimnoir Chronicles/ that has magic completely intertwined with the mundane world.

Wyatt Earp, Stonewall Jackson, Ratsputin, Babe Ruth, John Moses Browning, General Pershing, Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Thomas Edison, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, and Buckminster Fuller are all wizards.
