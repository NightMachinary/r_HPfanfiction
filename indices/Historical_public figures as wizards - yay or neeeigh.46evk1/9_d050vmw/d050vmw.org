I like the idea of /some/ historical figures being wizards and/or squibs, but not worldwide. Each country will have different issues between magicals and non-magicals. Some countries/cultures may have less issues with magicals and non-magicals mixing (such as native americans, african tribes, perhaps the chinese) than others (pureblood dominated britain, etc.)

Cultures with less stigma could easily have wizards sneak in to affect change to muggle politics, start or end wars, etc. So some figures may be true wizards. But other cultures with large amounts of prejudice ignore the muggles as much as possible, and would ostracize any wizard that tried to integrate is a worthwhile fashion.

For example, i could see america wizards being more willing to mix with muggles since they may have left britain to get away from the pureblood mania. But they may have shyed away from all interaction due to the heavily religious nature of the early settlers that led to the witch hunts.

To sum up: if done right, and /with a purpose/, magical influence of non-magical events and culture can add a lot to a fanfiction world.
