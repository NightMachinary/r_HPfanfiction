I've never really come across it myself; guess it doesn't turn up in the kind of fics I read. I'm not completely against the idea as long as it's not overdone (within a single fic, that is), but if I was going to do it myself I'd probably pick artists and authors over scientists and political game changers or royalty. Except for Queen Vic. She was a werewolf.

I would not be surprised if there's a pre-HBP SS/HG fic that involves Hermione discovering pureblood!Snape reads a particular Muggle author, probably Dickens, and being all "Ha! You're not completely anti-Muggle, you read Muggle literature!" and Snape just gives her a look (or, y'know, probably sneers because this is fanfic) and informs her that Dickens was actually a wizard. (Also possible with HG/DM, but personally I can't see Draco being all that into Dickens. Or any author that went about pretending to be Muggle.)
