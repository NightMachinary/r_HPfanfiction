It depends. Pre-Statute of Secrecy, you'd expect a decent number of historical figures to have magic, simply because magicals would have been somewhat valuable to kings. After the Statute of Secrecy, it's much less likely.

Either way, you have to make sure that it's a figure for whom it makes sense. You want someone who has certain oddities, someone for whom having magic would make everything make much more sense, not less. Most scientists don't fit, and anyone under serious scrutiny doesn't work at all.
