I like it. It ties the world in with our own more, which in urban fantasy is always good. In canon the only tie in to the muggle world is some leftover myths and fabels, but a whole separate world that occupies the same territory as us would have more crossover than that, even with something like the statute of secrecy.

It's not that hard to imagine wizard having more freedom (in both time and means) to do what they want and discover things. And with artists, the greater available audience completely justifies why /good/ artists would also perform for muggles.

I can also imagine a society that is so strongly focused on the individual as Magical Britain seems to be, to produce more eccentric individuals that also have an impact on the muggle world.
