Personally, I find it insulting. It kinda feels like the underlining meaning is that muggles truly are helpless without wizards to lead the way. It fits into the pureblood mania, that muggles are below wizards. I can understand that maybe a few figures were or at least had magical ancestry, but not much. The muggle world blossomed while, at least Great Britain's, the magical world seems almost stagnate.

How many times when we read the books, did you want one of the muggle raised kids shout at Malfoy or other pureblood pricks, that muggles have been to the moon, how far have wizards flown? Just for purposes of shutting them up.
