On your request as canon as possible is a little tough and pretty subjective. If you mean as canon as the first 4 books (and maybe the 5th) that's pretty easy as I always saw a romance building between Harry and Hermione. I was thrown for a loop when the 6th and 7th books put Harry with ginny and hermione with Ron as I couldn't see either of those couples making it.

It might be easier to point you to authors who have a few good Harry/Hermione stories rather than individual stories.

So pretty much anything from

Broomstick flyer and her husband merlinsapprentice

Bobmin / bobmin356

Canoncansodoff

RobSt

Rorschach's Blot

Harry50

Hermantumbleweed

Ares.Granger

Mathiasgranger

If you like Broomstick Flyer's stories then check out the authors she likes and the stories she likes and you'll get a ton more stories to investigate/read. (Doing that with the authors I like is how I built up my "collection").

So this should keep you busy reading for awhile.
