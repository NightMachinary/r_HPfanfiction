To me there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest - Vox Corporis. It was written before DH was released, or at least started back then, so a lot of the later canon isn't included (no Horcruxes, no Hallows, etc.)

It has almost no action (i think 2 chapters have fight scenes, out of maybe 60-70), but DAMN is it a realistic and touching story. Starts after the Graveyard and runs to the end of 5th year, if memory serves.

Someone recently reposted the whole thing on FFN.
