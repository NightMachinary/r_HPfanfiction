I always took the Elder Wand transferring to Harry as it actively wanting to be his (didn't mean to make it lowkey sound like a thirsty bastard oops): he owns the other two Hallows, isn't a punk bitch (I'll come back to this in a mo'), and, if we take Dumbledore's interpretation of "Master of Death" as the intended canon explanation, then Harry is definitely better suited to it than the only other person actively seeking it out (that we know of).

Depending on how aware and intelligent wands are (Olivander kinda dodges the question when Harry brings it up), the Elder Wand might have been aware that Dumbledore intended to break its power by dying undefeated, and thus jumped at the chance to switch its allegiance to Malfoy in HBP. Since he's kind of a pathetic loser, though, it ditched him at the earliest opportunity, that being when Harry disarmed him. (Then Harry came up with a different plan to break its power and it instantly regretted all of its life choices. Or, alternately, since Harry was, however briefly, the owner of all three Hallows, it deemed him worthy to make that choice and decided to roll with it.)
