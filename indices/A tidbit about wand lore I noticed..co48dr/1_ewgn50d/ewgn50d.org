The Elder Wand doesn't follow normal loyalty patterns. Remember that the first Peverell brother was killed in his sleep, not dueled or disarmed at all. The Elder Wand only seems to care about who 'defeats' the owner, no matter who the owner is.

Practicing Disarming doesn't matter, because the owner of the wand intended to be Disarmed and there was nothing at stake.
