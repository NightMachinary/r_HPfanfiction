Loyalty changing with a single defeat is probably unique to the Elder Wand because it is very disloyal.

Other wands can change owners but only if the new owner uses it for a long period of time AND if the wand chooses to accept the new owner, just like it chose the original one. The wand of Neville's father never worked that great for Neville, but it worked good enough that nobody noticed something wrong. Harry's replacement wand worked well enough for fights because it accepted him but he still preferred his original one that he was used to.

The Elder Wand immediately chooses whoever defeated its previous owner. Other wands choose wizards in rather mysterious ways which is why finding a good one takes so long.
