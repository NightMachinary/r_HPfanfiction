I think how much magic an average adult has is a bit subjective and it depends on what kind of school you want to make Hogwarts. Some make it a the only school in the UK, some make it for the elite, some say it's good by UK standards and crap compared to the rest of the world.

I do recommend linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday) which takes place during OotP from McGonagall's perspective. It shows her dealing with unruly students, her fellow teachers and how the teacher's life is /never/ done. One of my favourites and very in character.
