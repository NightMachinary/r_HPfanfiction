Not quite the same but The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie is similar. The ministry forces any purblood male over 15 or half bloods that are the last of their line to marry. The girls families are offered gold to entice them to sign their daughters up and they use magic to find the most compatible pairings. No one is really happy about it. Really good read as is most of Spookie's work
