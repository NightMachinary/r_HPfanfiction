Well, yes. If you were thinking about a smart, resourceful, powerful but most of all fully learned wizard. In effect, just about everything Harry Potter usually is portrayed like in fanfiction.

Take a second or third year Hogwarts student, put him in Westeros or somewhere else on that world and you'd be surprised how little of an unsurmountable challenge that wizard will present to any group of half-way decent fighting men as we know them from ASoIaF. The more notoriety that young wizard gains, the easier it will be to defeat him.

I think Rowling's story up to and including the Tri-Wizard tournament showed perfectly how little prepared an under-aged wizard truly is for life outside the safety of Hogwarts castle. No doubt there were plenty of dangerous situations to overcome for Harry and his circle of friends, even in their early years, but those were rather different from what his life in George R.R. Martin's created world would be like. The many situations where Harry faced his danger in a one-on-one manner like he did at Hogwarts would very likely allow him to overpower any such opposition in Westeros, true. I don't think that this is the point though.

Neither Harry, nor I suspect most other Hogwarts students at that age, are capable of surviving in a potentially very hostile environment if they are by themselves. Would such an adolescent wizard be capable of detecting poison or defend from an arrow shot at him from an ambush? Both are a valid concern, because there is no indication that young wizards even know how to hide themselves from non-magicals, much less be able to defend themselves from groups of them. Much of what happened in Dumbledore's Army during Harry's fifth year doesn't fill me with confidence either, when you consider the kind of spells they chose to train themselves in as a defense against potential Death Eater attacks.

Then there's the issue of magically combating a larger group of enemies, who would be quick to stick a few holes into any wizard they can get close enough to. If one disregards that the only truly awesome area of effect spell (the Patronus charm) isn't applicable against humans, as per Harry Potter canon we have no indication that any third year student would know or be capable of casting those kinds of spells. The most common kind of magic is only moderately powerful and usually targets singular objects or people. That's a serious if not fatal drawback once you stand against a dozen warriors with swords, spears or other pointy weapons.

So yes, after thinking about it for a little bit, I can see many reasons why an unprepared adolescent wizard from the Harry Potter universe would have difficulty surviving there, much less be over-powered except for specific circumstances.

In that situation I'd also rather take Hermione, because she has a good memory and she is very well read. Well, maybe if Harry had a multi-compartment trunk with a huge library and no aversion to actually read a few textbooks I'd think differently, but those are some rather well-used clich√©s ;)
