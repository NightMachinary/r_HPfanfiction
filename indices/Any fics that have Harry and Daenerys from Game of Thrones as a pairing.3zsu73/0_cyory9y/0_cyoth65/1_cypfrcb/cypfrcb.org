The longest idea I manage to write ended up at around 40k words before I realized it was going nowhere. I've found there two be two major hurdles, in that Dani is 13 in the books to start with, and that there is a canon perception that Magic magic is largely thought to have died out when the dragons did, so having a singular wizard exist would make him OP.

So, you go with the show ages, which is fine because otherwise there's some serious pedo problems, not to mention that GRRM doesn't like fanfiction so that means you should use the GoT show rather than ASOIAF (though I usually just take the best ideas of both, like, the Lady Stoneheart plot is dumb in the books, while Barristan Selmy dying randomly in the show is also dumb.).

Now, I personally find it more interesting when it's Harry going to the other world, rather than the lamesauce that is Dani going to Hogwarts. But, then you have a singular person with wizardry in Westeros or Essos. I don't think it's impossible to make work, since the common folk won't know his true power and will assume he's just another shadow-binder, or a follow of the Red God. But, it likely will take a better writer than me to pull it off convincingly.

Anyways, my best premise pretty much just Harry looking for an apprentice, which means someone with the blood of old valyria. The only way Harry can convince Viserys to hand over Dani to him instead of Drogo is to give him some dragons, so Harry searches around until he finds one in the shadowlands beyond asshai. Otherwise, Harry would have to deal with Drogo's sloppy seconds, and we don't want that for our hero, do we?

So, as you can see, there's a reason this idea never went anywhere, because it's pretty bad.
