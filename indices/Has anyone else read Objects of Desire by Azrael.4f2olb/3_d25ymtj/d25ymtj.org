I'm not a huge fan of any Snape/student pairing, but I might give it a shot. As much as I love this subreddit, I wish their were ones with more specific pairings that were more active. Drarry is a huge fan base, and [[/r/Drarry][r/Drarry]] has 12 subscribers. I like canon compliant fics too, but I see harmony o here all the time in a fic that sounds good otherwise and it makes me sad
