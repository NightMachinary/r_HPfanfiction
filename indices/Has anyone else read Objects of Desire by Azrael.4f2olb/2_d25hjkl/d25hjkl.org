  X. Let it be known that magic can do almost anything if the will is there, except get Harry Potter pregnant. That requires a mind more fucked up than Demon God of Chaos's.

  Clarification on Homosexuals: Male and gay characters are allowed, so long as they are relegated to being secondary characters and are never Harry Potter; he has never showed signs of being homosexual - ditch that shit, suicide girls.

  Cupdentarding the Clarification: Changing the hero to a girl to get around this ruling is stictly forbidden. The main character has a penis and it will only be permitted to enter the opening on a female's body. Aforementioned female must be one-hundred percent female and not a polyjuiced Draco Malfoy, curious as to how the opposite sex lives.
