Does this refer specifically to /any/ piece of literature in which our main character Harry Potter assumes the form of the opposite gender, or just those in which this is done in order to write homosexual fiction without it actually being homosexual? For instance, if one were to introduce two different instances of Harry Potter, change one of them to the female form, and then introduce a heterosexual relationship between the two main characters, would that be acceptable?
