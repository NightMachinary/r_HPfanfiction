I actually thought of something a little more easy like switching someone's brain with something like I don't know a piece of wood or other internal organs with other things or if you want to be really dramatic about it and also action-packed someone throws a killing course at say Hermione and Harry gets all amped up on power and uses an entire support pillar he switches it with something like the atoms in the air I don't know something ridiculous and dramatic and he switches it with a support pillar to protect her from the killing curse just to look all super badass cuz people do that and fanon
