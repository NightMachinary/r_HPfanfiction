Harry loved flying more than anything else. The freedom, the speed, the danger, it was all so amazing.

After the Dementor game had happened Harry got to thinking. He was lucky, lucky Dumbledore had been there to cast that spell.

Arresto Momentum slowed him enough so a fall from a few hundred meters didn't turn him into a crepe on the pitch. Harry spent some time learning the spell, better safe than sorry after all.

Then he realized he would need to learn it wandlessly.

Shite, that's going to suck.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Staying after Charms class Harry waved on his friends waiting to talk to the professor.

"Sir, I was hoping you could help me. After I fell during the game I've been learning the slowing charm. Well, I want to learn ot wandlessly now. So if there is another fall I will be okay."

Flitwick looked at the boy as he thought. He was a powerful practical caster and had good head for theory.

He had to admit falling from cloud level while being chased by dementors would likely be a powerful motivator.

"Alright Mr. Potter, I reccomend you start with the Book 'Stolen Sticks and Other Failed Focus Findings: Wandless Wizards Working With Mastered Magics'"

Flitwick told him where to find the book in the library and sent the boy off. It was not wandless magic for all, it focused on mastering spells individually without a wand. Something a 3rd year could learn with hard work.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry stared at the hole in the castle walls and decided discretion was the better part of valor.

What the hell had happened? He overpowerr the AM spell wanting to see how long the ink pot would stay floating in the room.

Instead it had blasted away faster than a blink and the castle had a fist sized hole in it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Experimenting around over the next month told him whatever was going on with the spell was consistent.

The objects always flew the same direction. Slighty upwards and west. The more he overpowered the spell the faster they went.

Harry had no idea why this was happening but all this working with directions had a side effect. Harry was now constantly aware of what direction west was in relation to himself.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

*Alternate Take from this point on also available below this post.*

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Malfoy and company continued their bullshit as the track curved. With a flick of his fingers Harry cast a lightly overpowered Arresto Momentum at the troublesome trio discreetly.

Watching the idiot squad fly down the hallway was a great way to end the school year.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Staring at himself where he floated above the stairs he knew he was in trouble now. Dudley had pushed him down the stair and he snap cast AM wandlessly without thinking.

When no owl arrived by dinner that night Harry realized the ministry did not track wandless magic.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

His relatives were frozen in fear as Vernon looked up from the bottom of the stairs.

Harry had used a lightly overpowered AM and smashed Vernon into the stairs a few times.

"No more chores, no more locks, all the food I want and you touch me I break every bone in your body until you are broken mess. Only warning, deal with it."

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Circling the arena Harry made his way to the western edge. Flicking out his fingers he cast AM on the golden egg. Thank goodness the spell was colorless, silent and had no light show attached.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

At the graveyard Pettigrew closed his eyes raising the knife to his hand. Harry knew what was going to happen to his horror.

"Flesh of the servant willing given, you will revive your master."

Oh bloody hell no! Harry desperately cast a massively overpowered wandless Arresto Momentum at the Cauldron.

It disappeared into the sky leaving a sonic boom in its place that smashed Peter into a gravestone.

A ruddy big snake showed up fairly soon afterwards and it soon joined the cauldron as a reverse shooting star.

After a few minutes he got free. Picking up a broken headstone he smashed the bones of Peter's limbs.

"Run away this time you stupid fucking rat!"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dumbledore had went on and on after the ministry finally found him hours later. Voldemort was surely back or some shit. Harry disagreed quite heavily and that had made him a good friend of the minister it seemed.

Whatever all he knew was while Tom may be immortal, he was immortally flying through space at thousands of miles an hour away from Earth.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry Potter was approaching his 300th birthday. Thank goodness for aging potions. According to every expert he had dealt with over the years him sending Voldemort on an extrasolar trip had frozen the prophecy. Which had frozen his aging, at 14, until the prophecy was fulfilled.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The great space age had happened, Arresto Momentum had been the keystone spell to it all. It affected inertia, gravity, and even time interacted with an object.

Digging deep into the arthimancy of the spell had been a dozy. How the hell the spell had been developed to begin with was a damn mystery.

It somehow bypassed relativity in the most convoluted way imaginable. Seriously the spell was the holy grail of space travel.
