That would've still been something both heavily abusable and [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e1hxc2/im_trying_to_write_a_story_that_will_eventually/f8ryxo7/][pretty obvious for the native population to figure out.]] Want to mess someone up who's flying on a broom? Cast AM at them to make them instantly decelerate to 0 relative to you and experience something akin to a severe car crash. Want to mess someone up /while/ flying near them on a broom? Fly as fast as you can towards them, and cast AM at them to give them a whiplash and a bunch of acceleration g's, that would then either drive them into the ground or in some other random trajectory that'll end with them eventually hitting a wall or the ground, etc.
