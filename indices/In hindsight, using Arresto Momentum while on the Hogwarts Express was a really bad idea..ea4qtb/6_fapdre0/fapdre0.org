I played with this in a drabble one time. Harry had a banishing hex that cancelled momentum first, to give whiplash effects and increase how hard it hit, and so on. When duelling Voldemort, he cast it with his off hand, and fucked up the motion - so it cancelled all momentum, not just relative momentum like it was supposed to.

Essentially, the spell would have stopped Voldemort's motion relative to the planet, and he would have shot up into space at escape velocity. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the spell ended up liquefying him before it could get that far.
