Then the "really bad idea" part could be Harry trying to make his own brooms after this revelation and getting targeted by the Big Broom industry. Even worse if it's +the mudblood+ Hermione who gets to figure it out and gets targeted by some DE stakeholders. The latter would also explain Lucius' spending spree on 7 expensive brooms just to purchase bragging rights for a second year brat: being a stakeholder allowed him to skip the resellers and purchase them much closer to their production costs (if not even cheaper than that).
