Funny, but it'd have to be using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference#Absolute_space][the target's relative frame of reference,]] not an external one. Otherwise even using it when just standing on solid ground would've had disastrous consequences due to the momentum of Earth, our solar system, our galaxy, etc.

So using an Arresto Momentum on an accelerating object while being on a moving train would only make that object lose its acceleration /relative to the moving train/.

The spell could probably even be used to stabiliise / negate violent accelerations / decelerations of a vehicle that's currently hosting the target, and prevent inertia-related injuries like [[https://www.dolmanlaw.com/whiplash-painful-physics-action/][whiplash,]] essentially functioning as a perfect seatbelt.
