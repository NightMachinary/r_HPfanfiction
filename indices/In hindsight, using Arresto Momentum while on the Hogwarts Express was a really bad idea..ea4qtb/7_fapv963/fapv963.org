- Earth's rotation on its axis: =~1,610 km/h=
- Earth's rotation around the sun: =~107,800 km/h=
- Sun's rotation around the Milky Way: =~828,000 km/h=
- Milky Way's movement through space: =~ 2,100,000 km/h=

If /Arresto Momentum/ referred to stopping someone's momentum relative to space itself, they'd almost instantly be atomized (what with travelling through the train and, subsequently, our atmosphere) and flung through space (from our perspective) at just a bit faster than 1% the speed of light. Which is, relatively, very fast.

This is, of course, assuming they're fortunate enough that the Earth is rotated at a point which doesn't, when a full stop to momentum is applied, relatively have them attempt to go /through the planet/.
