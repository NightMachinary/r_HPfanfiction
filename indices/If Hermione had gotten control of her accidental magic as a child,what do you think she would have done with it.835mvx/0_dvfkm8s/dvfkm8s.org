Hermione likes knowledge, but she's motivated to make others follow her guidance. It's not just that she wants to be right about things- she craves the acknowledgment. I think her pre-Hogwarts magic would be focused into drawing the attention of others when she wishes to be heard, so that they listen to her and praise her for being correct.
