Try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). Been my favorite for the last year or so. After linkffn(What You Leave Behind) was abandoned, it's supplanted it in the magical exploration genre.

The Untitled Tome is a large scale au that rewrites the British wizarding world, and has a very curious and inquisitive Harry. It also involves organized duelling, a deeper exploration into wizarding culture, and no Voldemort. I really recommend it

Edit: Just realized you specifically asked not to receive retelling of Harry's hogwarts years. Didn't see the not. Apologies. Still recommend the fic though.
