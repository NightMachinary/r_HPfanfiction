Ron's not as dumb or as much of a dick as people think. Remember that for two years, he wasn't even using a wand that choose him--imagine how that would stifle him academically.

Also, in the movies he got completely gutted as a character. Many of his nice lines in the books were removed. I think the Ron hate is a bit unwarranted. Sure, he's flawed--but he's a good friend despite them. Think about the train ride in the first book. He's willing to share one of his only sandwiches with a guy he doesn't even know.

Most people only seem to focus on the flaws that he has as a person (most of them correct themselves as time goes on) which is also realistic.
