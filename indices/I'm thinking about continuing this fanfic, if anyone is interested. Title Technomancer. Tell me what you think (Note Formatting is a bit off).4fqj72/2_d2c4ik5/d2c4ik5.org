Yeah... Not sure where all that Ron-hate is stemming from. I think it's more than overdue for him to get a well-done treatment as a Villain Protagonist.

I like it. The writing is solid, there's a good hook at the opening, and it hints at turning something I generally hate ("Technomancy") on its head. Hope all goes well! :)
