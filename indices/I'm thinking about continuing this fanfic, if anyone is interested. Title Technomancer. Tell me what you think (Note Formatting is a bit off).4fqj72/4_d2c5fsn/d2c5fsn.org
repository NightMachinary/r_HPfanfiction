I like it. I usually find Ron to be the character I find easiest to dislike (other than The Toad, of course), but I think I might enjoy this portrayal. The development of someone from not knowing what electricity is, to technomancer extraordinaire. Hope it goes well! Post again when you get it up on a site.
