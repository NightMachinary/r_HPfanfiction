I think canon Dumbledore was just pulling another lie out of his ass with that "I don't care about the prophecy - but Voldemort does!" crap. I mean shit, if he REALLY didn't believe Harry needed to be the one to kill him, or destroy the horcruxes, he never would have based /ALL OF HIS PLANS AROUND HIM./ He would have told him to sit back, live his life, have fun, and I'll take care of this myself kid. But he didn't. He obviously believed in the prophecy. Just like in sixth year when every time Harry came to him about suspicions on Draco, he kept lying to his face about "I take this school's safety seriously!" when he KNEW he was letting a murderer keep attending the school and making attempts on student's lives.

Basically Dumbledore says the fucking opposite of the truth.
