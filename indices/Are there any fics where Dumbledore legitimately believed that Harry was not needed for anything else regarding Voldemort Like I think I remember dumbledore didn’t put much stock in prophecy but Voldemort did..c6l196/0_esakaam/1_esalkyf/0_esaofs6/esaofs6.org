But didn't it get implied/stated dumbledore didn't know how Voldemort was alive until he saw the diary and began to suspect what it could be? If we take that as true and it's a Dumbledore that doesn't care about the prophecy or even that he didn't want to even try to teach Harry to beat Voldemort because he should have a childhood and because what are the chances that Harry could learn enough that he'd have a chance against Voldemort?
