Of course it all depends on the context and the character development you've done for each girl, but if it were a blank slate, I usually would rather read Susan over Padma. That being said, I've really really enjoyed several H/Padma fics, and am always excited for more.

In other words, whichever you pick, I'll likely read your story and enjoy it :D
