Ive always thought harry could tell the twins apart. Thats why they dont prank him. But it could be an interesting surprise that he reveals to parvati when shes surprised he knew it wasnt padma. Theres alot of fun to be had with it. Like maybe snape gives padma an underserved detention so that she cant meet up with harry and parvati takes her place or something
