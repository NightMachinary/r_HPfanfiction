Woah, i think i've got just whatcha need. Me and my friend's work. The names are altered tho. "Harry Potter and the Broom of Death" Story short: Harry Potter's beloved broom "Lightning" suddenly broke few days before the Quidditch match of Hohward. Dumbledr is sure that the broom will be fixed. Instead of his "Lightning" Harry is given an old "Torpedo-1" from the closet. The broom is soooooooo slow... When Harry was checking out it with Ronol Veasley, the broom suddenly made a backflip (Harry fell off), vibrated and flew away faster than 2 electronic "Lightnings". They try to find help from everyone who Harry trusts and knows but to no avail. Then Dumbledr remembers about the unknown mage Bordyak Booking, and the curse on every broom that comes from him... Also, i need time to translate it from Russian, but i have 1 chapter done if you'd like
