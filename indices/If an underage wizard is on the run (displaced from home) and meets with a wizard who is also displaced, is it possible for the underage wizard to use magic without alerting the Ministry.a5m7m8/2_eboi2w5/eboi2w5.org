Yeah, the trace probably picks up all the magic but it isn't ever obvious who did it unless it is a muggle-born or lone wizards using magic outside of magical society. It would be pretty clear-cut in cases like Harry being attacked by dementors -- he was the only wizard around -- and might be further argument for "pureblood elitists" who can effectively get around the trace, since they are almost always surrounded by other wizards. Half-bloods and muggle-borns are far more likely to get caught and since the Ministry is very strict on the Statute of Secrecy, probably only seriously pursues cases that take place in front of muggles.

The Weaseleys could probably get away with it, but it's not really in their character to skirt the law, besides the fact that they are overall looked down on by the ruling-class of wizards, so they'd have to keep their heads down more than other pure-blood families.

I might be mis-remembering this, but doesn't Dobby use a bunch of magic in the Durseley's house to get in Harry in trouble?
