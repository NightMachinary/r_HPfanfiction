I remember reading a fic with Tom Riddle's day job was teaching and dark lord at nights. It was about 4 horseman of apocalypse. Fem Harry. It was actually a great fic. It's sequel's name was something like masquerade or masquerading. If you know what I'm talking about let me know. I'm too lazy to find it
