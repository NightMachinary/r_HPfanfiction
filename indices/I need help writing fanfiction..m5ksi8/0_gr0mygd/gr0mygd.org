Honestly? Everything depends on where do you want to go with this story. How does Harry learn about not being the Potters' son? Why did James and Lily adopt Harry, if they could have their own kids? How did the Potters react to Harry's true parentage? Is Voldemort insane and evil because Tom Riddle was evil and a bit insane from the beginning or maybe when he regains his sanity, he would try to repent for his evil deeds? Honestly, you can go in so many different directions with that idea, that it's insane.

About the effects of love potion on Harry, it could make him less emotional? Like he can still feel the full range of emotions, yet they are muted.

About one of the siblings, it honestly depends again on where do you want to take this story and how old is that sibling. It also depends on the type of relationship Harry had with them, because if Harry already seemed unfeeling towards anyone, then maybe that sibling felt like Harry was planning on betraying the Potter family, or something similar.

On the topic of Marauders, make them have their own lives, yet still treating each other like brothers. So they will meet each other often and do some pranks. Of course said pranks would be more mature than how they acted in school, but let them have fun at each other or people around them.

On the topic of Harry, again it depends. Does he still wants to be a part of the Potter family? Does he meet up with Bellatrix to learn about his biological mother and maybe ask her about his biological father?

So to summarize it all, everything depends on where you want to take that story.

Also, please don't change Harry's name into Harrison. It just makes him sound more edgy. Moreover, Harry is perfectly fine and normal name and Harrison sounds more like a name for Harry's son, so if you really want to somehow utilize it, then give it to, well Harry's future son.
