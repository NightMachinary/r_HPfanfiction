Hmm. Well, that's the big question, really. And the answer is, it varies. A lot.

- The main thing is to make sure that either the two worlds mesh well, or that the abilities of one world are equal to or are at least counterable by the abilities of the other world. For example, take The Havoc Side of the Force: Harry's use of magic disrupts Force users' focus like a screeching violin, but the Force users have precognition, which evens the playing field a lot.

- Another thing is the choice of the setting. In most cases I chose to put HP characters in other worlds, rather than the other way around. This is because I find the other worlds more dynamic and enabling than itty bitty Hogwarts. I wouldn't take Edward to Hogwarts, Harry dies and Truth chucks him into Amestris. Aang doesn't go to Hogwarts, Harry goes through the Veil and ends up in the Spirit world. And so on, and so forth. This is personal preference, so I'm definitely not saying something set at Hogwarts can't be good, just that I find Hogwarts less, ah, motivating than anywhere else. Also, HP tends to facilitate multiverse travel more than other 'verses.

- One more thing is that in order to find a good story, you sometimes have to go outside of the setting you're used to. What that setting is and how far outside you go is up to your judgement.

My own personal plot bunny that you're welcome to use is Harry getting AK'd in the forest and seeing Truth. Truth takes the horcrux as payment for Palm Alchemy knowledge and sends him on through to Amestris where he lands on Izumi Curtis' doorstep. He doesn't speak the local language (similar to German, isn't it?) and he can't do magic anymore, either. Now he has to reconcile scientific Alchemy with reality bending Magic. In addition, being Master of Death gave him 3 "boons", basically Philosopher's stone level of transmutations, in the form of the DH tattoo, to be used at his discretion. (Ohay, Izumi's cured. How about that?) Each time he uses a boon, one part of the tattoo disappears.

Hope this helps!
