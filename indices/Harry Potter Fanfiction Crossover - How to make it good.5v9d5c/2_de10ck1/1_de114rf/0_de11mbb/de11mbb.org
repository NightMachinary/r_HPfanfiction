Write out a mock conversation. Its generally only two people talking with a third maybe interjecting. Having people there for their wit and jokes starts to feel forced. If everyone tries to have their say then it might feel too slow. How often at parties etc does everyone try and chat? People branch off into twos and threes mostly. it might work bringing everyone if they separate and alternated group per chapter. Imagine if Harry went as a guide with some and Ron and Hermione went with the others? Would that work better? It might make the dialogue feel more natural and its generally a trend in poor writing that it doesn't sound like things people would ever say out loud.
