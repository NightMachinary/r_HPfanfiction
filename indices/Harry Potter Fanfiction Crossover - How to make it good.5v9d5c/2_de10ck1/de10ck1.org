I don't know much about the three options but some general tips from someone who reads quite a lot of cross overs.

- Don't try to bring in too many characters. There just isn't room on the page for everyone. Stick to the important people or those you want involved.

- Work out if you want the world fair and balanced. Harry Potter wizards bend the world to their will and regularly to the impossible. A lot of what they can do to each other is stopped by their shields and the like but against regular people they're basically gods. Linkffn(11120132) is well worth a read if you haven't read it. It also points out that what is normal in Harry Potter is completely over powered (he's not entirely normal for a wizard though). If you're bringing people into this world how do they compare? There is nothing wrong with something being stupidly powerful but making something that should be strong weak for the sake of plot might annoy some people.

- Make sure everyone you bring over, or every aspect has a purpose. Some things in different fandoms are cool. Compromising your plot to force in the cool thing can hurt your story. Unnecessary detail or justifications can be a huge turn off for readers.

Good luck and I hope you enjoy writing it, remember at the end of the day its you who matters. If you like it do it.
