I agree wholeheartedly with [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] and I'll add this: J K Rowling wrote chapters to drive the story. The characters and the magic were written to develop the plot. And while this gave us the world we know and love, it left a lot, and I do mean [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png][A LOT]] of things underdeveloped. It's the primary reason we have so much HP fanfiction.

A character driven story has its own flaws, of course. There will be actions necessary to drive the plot that a characters just... wouldn't do. That no one in their right mind would or wouldn't do, or even consider doing at that moment. If you force them to do it anyway, this is called "Holding the Idiot Ball", and it can really take people out of a story.

So you have to come up with a balance. Find outside forces to act on your characters, and find reasons for those characters to act back. Or, use the characters themselves. Use their flaws and their virtues to put them in difficult situations. And if you can't do that, find someone else who WOULD involve them in these difficult situations.

EDIT: And, in the end, if you can't do any of that, think about finding another path to where you want to go. There's a reason one of the common rules of writing is "Kill Your Darlings".
