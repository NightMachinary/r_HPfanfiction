Hold up.

  drive the story and not the characters

Those two aren't mutually exclusive. Characters drive the story and story drives the characters. These are two elements that cannot be separated. You start out with a situation and characters react. The world reacts to the input of the characters. The characters react to the new situation. And so on and so forth.

Anyway. I wish you the best with your fic.
