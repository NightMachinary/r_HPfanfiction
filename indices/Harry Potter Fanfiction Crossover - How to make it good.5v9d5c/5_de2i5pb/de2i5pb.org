I actually prefer crossovers that do the opposite of what you're planning. I like for Harry to be taken out of his world and placed in another. Harry as a character is more flexible, and fits in other scenarios better, in my opinion. Usually if someone brings outside characters into the Hogwarts setting they either stand around being useless lumps (everyone around them can pretty much bend the laws of nature to their whim, so why are these new guys needed?) or it is one of those "Sherlock is secretly a wizard" things and I absolutely loathe those.

One thing to keep in mind is power levels, as other people have mentioned. Even 5th year, super angsty and not even completely trained Harry is pretty much God Mode for almost any other fandom. One thing a lot of writers do is separate Harry from his wand. Either it breaks and he has limited usage or he loses it and he has to make due with very limited abilities that don't require a wand. Another solution would be to have the very environment be hostile towards magic. So whatever makes magic work in Harry's reality is missing from the second reality, thus his abilities are greatly reduced.

Other than that, I agree with the suggestion of limiting the characters crossed over. FMA has a LOT of characters, for example. Decide which ones you'd actually need and leave off any that wouldn't really add to your story's plot. Yes, Nina was cute as hell, but what else does she have to add to your story's progression? If you can't think of anything, leave Nina behind.
