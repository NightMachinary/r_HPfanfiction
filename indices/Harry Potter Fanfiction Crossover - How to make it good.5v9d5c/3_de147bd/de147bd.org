My favorite crossover worlds are LOTR and Star Gate. Fallout and Terminator are also good IMO, but those two fandoms are too small.

I'm not a big fan of HP/GoT crossovers unless I want to read some curb stomps. Those GoT Muggles had no chance going against Imperiuse Curse, Obliviation, Legilimency, Apparation, Bombarda, and Fiendfyre.
