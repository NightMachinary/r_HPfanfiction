Good point on the lack of Frozen material. Most of what I was drawing from it was Elsa, Anna, and Hans (there's a theory that Hans is actually an enchant mirror as in the origin tale it was a mirror that was the antagonist along with Elsa).

I also love Avatar. Since you're an Avatar fan, allow me to ask you this: would it be better to have the whole Gaang, a few of them, or just Aang? I have several plots for these two series crossing, but they change dramatically based off the cast.
