I think you should have the whole Gaang, but maybe just a few of them for different points. Meaning, you don't have to have them all in every chapter or plot line, but you can trade them out. Of course, it's totally up to you, since both ways of just having Aang or having all of them are good ideas. For me personally though, I need Zuko in my fics haha.
