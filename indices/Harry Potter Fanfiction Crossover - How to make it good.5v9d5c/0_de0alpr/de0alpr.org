I'd go with Fullmetal or Avatar. It's not that Frozen and Harry Potter wouldn't be cool, they just don't go together as well.

For one, their content is drastically different. Harry Potter is much darker and somewhat more adult. And most importantly, Frozen has a more limited number of characters and plot to work with.

Avatar and Fullmetal both bring their own nuanced story lines and characters to the table. Elsa and the cast of Frozen are great, there's just less material to work with.

Personally, I think an Avatar/HP crossover is the way to go, but I'm just biased because I love Avatar.
