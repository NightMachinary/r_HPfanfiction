Even standard Harry would be able to offer something in the ATLA world. His broom puts him at or near Aang with his glider, he can disarm any melee wielded or archer, he can cause small explosions, Sectumsempera can cut right through toonforce, he can stun pretty much anyone, and, depending on how much you want to give the Patronus, he might even have a defense against spirits. Even when crossing over with a world with massive power differences, there are still ways for the weaker side to contribute.
