All of these worlds sound like huge territory for Harry and friends to cover. He isn't a 'bender' and he isn't the avatar himself, so he would be pretty useless when it came to actually helping. Unless you go the fanon 'Master of Death, Op Reality Warping' route, which in that case, a fic doesn't matter. I would rather have seamless transition into the world, like, the people are already there, and have been there, and have history that seamlessly goes into the Harry Potter world, such as other stories about Magicians/Wizards/Sorcerers. Other than that, crossovers always felt like a waste of time, you either add too much to the world itself, or take away a whole lot to the point where the fic feels like it takes place in a claustrophobic box.
