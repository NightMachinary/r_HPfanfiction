linkffn(Prologue to a Revolution)

The war against Voldemort is over. The war against Pureblood bigotry has just begun.

Harry and Hermione have to run a country. Ron patrols the skies in his flying tank. The Delacours need rescuing, and Viktor Krum is accused of plotting to overthrow the government, so he stops the rumors by overthrowing the government.

Oh, and Germany has a wizard Nazi problem again.
