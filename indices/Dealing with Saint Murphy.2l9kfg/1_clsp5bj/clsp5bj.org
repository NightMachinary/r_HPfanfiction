I think 'hat-tipping' is the idea that the author is such a fan of manners and chivalry that they have the main character act like a Victorian romance novel escapee. Also expecting that the excess of manners will be seen as adorable by blushing nymphettes and intimidating dowagers alike is part of the crime.

On the Murphy's law suggestions... a temporally-displaced Tom isn't likely to try fitting in using funky modern lingo. That said, any time you want to throw some wrenches at the character, try thinking about what would happen if Peter Pettigrew or Gollum or some other reprehensible subhuman character were in this position, then feel free to think up painful and humiliating things for Peter to suffer.
