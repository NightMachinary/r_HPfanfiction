So I didn't read your fic (feel free to post a link!) but I can think of a few things that could wrong for Tom:

- someone recognises him. An old classmate (who might blackmail him), or Slughorn (who might panic and run straight to Dumbledore or Amelia Bones, or send out a warning to his old Slug Club alumni to protect them), or Hagrid, who tells Dumbledore, or even a random muggle from Little Hangleton who notes his ridiculously striking resemblance to the old Tom Riddle Sr (he might ask Tom about it, or he might go back to LH and gossip about old Tom Riddle's bastard son having a kid, with who knows what repercussions!)

- his complete lack of knowledge of common events for the past however many years gets him in trouble. I'm sure a smart guy like Tom looked up major events, but I mean little things, like Star Wars, or a particularly amazing quidditch World Cup accident that literally everyone knows about.

- his old-timey speech gets him noticed. Maybe he uses a few slang words which were particular to Hogwarts students when he was there, but which fell out of use and was forgotten decades ago.
