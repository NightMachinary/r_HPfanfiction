For reference, its August between Harry's second and third year. Story follows a Tom Riddle that escaped from the diary. Prior to his escape he'd spoken with a number of the main characters, but the person that died that he might live was Lockhart... Who's wand he promptly stole.

<Edit> I added in my rough draft of Tom's time alone in the diary. I'm pretty sure there's a variety of little errors in both.
