Yeah... one of my points of internal debate is whether I want to show anything that goes on outside of Tom's field of vision or not. Do I let the readers know that Dumbledore is suspicious and has moody tailing Tom? Or do people only find that out later when Tom notices?

Is it more interesting to be blindsided along with Tom? Or to know that things aren't always going nearly as well as he assumes they are?

Also is it just me, or is it somewhat depressing that Harry agreeing to live with someone he just met is not only in character, but like, directly canon?
