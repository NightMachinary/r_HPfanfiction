Sorry to enter this discussion late, but I'm a firm believer that keeping the scope minimized can only help. Chekov said that anything that is not relevant to the story should be removed. Once you broaden the scope too much, you are at risk of ruining the potency of the conflict.

You should write notes for yourself (in a timeline format), but only make people understand what happened when it is relevant (Scabbers is actually Pettigrew! Harry's visions were a trap! Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him!). It creates a lot of drama, and makes people understand that the scope of things is much larger than what you present without too much exposition. It's a literary trick, but a surprisingly efficient one.
