While there are a few typos and missed words here and there, this looks /great/! Tom's internal dialogue is interesting and flows well, and I really liked the diary time skips.

As for the whole Saint Murphy things, I think it would work very well for your Tom if he did have a string of everything going right. He gets overconfident (one of canon Riddle's flaws) and then something comes back to bite him in the ass.
