This is come of the best advice you can possibly get. It's also important that the antagonist wins throughout the story. The antagonist should be better than the protagonist, or there's no sense of actual accomplishment from the character in the story.

It should seem to the readers that the antagonist could actually come out on top. Otherwise stories come off too much as waiting around for the protagonist to win.
