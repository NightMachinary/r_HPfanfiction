- Advances in law enforcement. I'm sure he got away with underage magic in his time, but the entire first war happened and the Aurors probably had to up their game.
- Records. There are magical records of every magical child in the ministry. The moment someone asks him to identify himself it won't stand up to scrutiny.
- Current events would be lost on him. He'd have some serious problems in idle chatter. This may not seem like much, but he was charismatic and charming, and this would quickly expose him as odd. That's attention he doesn't need.
- His face is known. Not only by Slughorn and Dumbledore, but by everyone who followed him in the first war and wouldn't be partial to his return because now they have too much to lose.
- The Dark Mark possibly wouldn't work for him. While Voldemort marked his followers, his sixteen year old self didn't.
- Getting money may not be simple when his knowledge of magic is so outdated, and labor laws probably banning children from working in the magical world (not an underage waiter or clerk in canon, even during summer).
- Where is his wand?! No one knows, except possibly Pettigrew. And would Pettigrew reveal himself to a sixteen year old? Would Ollivander supply him with a new one, knowing full well who he is?
- What is the source of his power? He was brilliant but so are Dumbledore, Hermione, and Snape. While possibly exceptionally powerful, it makes more sense that he furthered his power by decades of delving into the dark arts which he hadn't done to a great extent at sixteen.
- spirit!Voldemort is still out there. And he won't like the competition or sharing power... or could possibly take over his body if he ever finds him.
- The Weasley twins have the map, and suddenly a new name appears. So many ways this can go either amusingly or horribly wrong for him.

In short, there are plenty of ways things can go horribly wrong... from the most mundane things ("Weird Sisters? Are they Dark Ladies?") to the most horrible (spirit!Voldemort is hunting him down and can sense him anywhere not secret-kept, forcing him to live on the run from the ministry who send half the Auror force whenever he does magic, the Order is sniffing out his hideouts, and himself without a source of income and with outdated magical knowledge - while all his old supporters try and kill him on the spot because their lives are now comfortable and war is something they don't want).
