Whenever I want to read on my phone (which I do, every single day) and its a fic that I'm invested in, and longer than 30k words, I just download the fic as EPUB and transfer to my phone. I use a great and light app called FBReader, which has a bunch of configs from background colour and margin sizes to font sizes/type. And its free. I only ever read from any website when its the first chapter (to see if I like the story/grammar isn't horrible) or updates on stories which happens usually once every two days, with the amount of fics I follow and are ongoing.
