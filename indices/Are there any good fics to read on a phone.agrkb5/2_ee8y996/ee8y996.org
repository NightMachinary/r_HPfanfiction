I pretty much exclusively read from my phone, unless I am sneaky reading in class on my laptop. Much easier. Also, a good idea is to make use of the recent tabs function on Chrome. You can open up Chrome on your phone, open recent tabs in your menu, and then directly open a tab that you have open on any other device with Chrome that you have logged into.
