I'm currently reading the Linear Circle series (I believe I'm on part 3) and Harry's a father in this series... it takes a while, though, before you actually meet Harry and get to that part. Totally worth the wait, though, when you do get to the part where he's a dad; I love his fatherly instincts. No terrible dad jokes yet.
