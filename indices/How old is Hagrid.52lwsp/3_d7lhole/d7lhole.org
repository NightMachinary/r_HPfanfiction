This always confused me. Why she set the events of Hagrid's expulsion 50 YEARS in the past from the events of COS. I mean, Hagrid's part giant, so it's totally possible that he looks great for being 62! And Voldemort is barely a person at this time so he gets that as an excuse. But Slughorn teaches Tom Riddle as a child? How old is he during HBP? 80???
