Hmm, I have to correct myself, it appears. When I went and re-read chapter 18 of /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/ to look for the reference I thought was there, only relative and not absolute numbers were to be found.

I did some more research on the 'net and couldn't find any other information about the 1881 birth-date than [[http://web.archive.org/web/20070911000516/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/wotm.cfm][this reference]] on Rowling's webpage from September 2007. It's as much or as little canon as the '150 years' quote from seven years earlier :(

Unless there is some information I'm not aware of (like the mention of an age, ie of Grindelwald at a known point in time like at his defeat in 1945, the age of Dumbledore's school chum Elphias Doge, etc), then you can really pick and choose between either age.

Edit: it appears pretty clear, that all of those year numbers in both official and unofficial sources like the wikia wiki are based on the assumption that Dumbledore was born in 1881. If you want him to be 150 years old, you also change many other dates, like when his mother died, when his father went to prison, when Ariana died, when Grindelwald was born, etc.
