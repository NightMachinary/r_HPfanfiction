Let me state it this way. Unless JK publishes a book stating the age of Dumbledore then i can pick whatever number i want. Because until its in written published form, BY DEFINITION OF THE TERM CANON its not canon. Its taken as canon. Pottermore is as close to a new work as we get so we label as canon. But if i was using the term for a paper that i was going to publish, the term canon will only refer to that which is written published and sold. There are way too many inconsistencies any other way.

That being said, the interview coming directly from JK is more canon than even Pottermore. We dont know who publishes on Pottermore, and we dont know if JK has to approve it. However as stated above we dont seem to give a fuck about if someone posts there that isnt JK. We just take it as word of god which it clearly isnt.
