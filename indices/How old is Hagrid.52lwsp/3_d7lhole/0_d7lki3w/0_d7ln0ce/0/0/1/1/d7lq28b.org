If not close. You figured Dumbledore is about 150 when he dies. So if we take it back to when he's 17. If we said she was a minimum of even 30 or 40 when she administered his test that would make her at a minimum 170 something 180 something. I say that is a minimum because I can't remember how that the scene is described in the book but I thought they were some younger people who gave the test as well as obviously the older people. If you take into account though that they are all older than you probably at least 200
