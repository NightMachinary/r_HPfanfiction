JK Rowling is the founder and owner of Pottermore. Regardless of whether or not she actually writes the words, the contents of Pottermore exist through her approval and are canon and trumped only by the books themselves. Robert Jordan did not write the last three books of the Wheel of Time, but that doesn't mean they aren't canon to that series. I don't care what definition of canon you like to use, canon just means that it's officially part of the story's universe. Beyond that, Pottermore is published. Just because they're not charging or collecting it into novel form doesn't mean it's not written and published online. Until Rowling either writes another book in which it states that Dumbledore was born on a year other than 1881 or she changes the information on Pottermore, Dumbledore's canon birthday was in 1881.
