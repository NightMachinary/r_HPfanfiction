Not really. Griselda could be as "young" as, say, 125 years. The only frame of reference we have of her is a quote that says she was the examiner for Dumbledore's Transfiguration and Charm N.E.W.T.s back in the day. There's nothing that says she had to be old to get that position, it's not impossible that she was a new hire in the ministry education department.

There is definitely some conflicting information about Dumbledore's age, because Rowling once said (in a 2000 interview) that he was about 150 years old. Several years later, in the last book of the series, references place his year of birth in or around 1881. This sounds a lot more reliable to me than her random ramblings and makes Dumbledore around 115 years old at the time of his death.

I have two things to say about the age wizards can live to. The long life expectancy is probably not the rule, but witches and wizards certainly have the potential to live long lives and be active even as a centenarian. On the other hand, there are plenty of Black family members that only lived some 50 to 80 years. The movies showed a newspaper that mentioned the so-called /Ministry of Divine Health/, which named the wizarding life-expectancy at 137.25 years. I would certainly not call that canon, but they went to some thought and effort into making this ([[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:DailyProphetMakingOfHP1.jpg][source]]). Edit: I don't think this was ever seen in any movie, but the screenshot was taken from a making-of bonus feature.
