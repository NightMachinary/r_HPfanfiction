Hagrid was expelled during his third year at Hogwarts, while Tom Riddle was a prefect at the time, if I remember that correctly, so he'd have been at least a fifth year. Since Tom Riddle was born in 1926, that would make Hagrid's birth year around 1928. In comparison, James and Lily Potter were both born in 1960, so they were around 32 years younger.
