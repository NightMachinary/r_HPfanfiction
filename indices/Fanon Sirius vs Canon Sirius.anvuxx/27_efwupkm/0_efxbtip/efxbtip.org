I don't know why you're being downvoted. It's totally fair to like a variety of character interpretations, canon or fanon. Typically I prefer more canon-compliant/realistic depictions of Sirius, but I don't mind the more lighthearted versions either depending on the fic. I mean that's what fanfic is isn't it? Making the characters your own 🤷🏻‍♀️
