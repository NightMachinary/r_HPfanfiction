I rather like fanon Sirius. I like the womanizing, prankster, always full of jokes, rarely serious Sirius.

I also love canon Sirius, dark and brooding, still with a hint of mischief.

I can differentiate (and appreciate) them both. I like that writers add their own twist to the characters. Otherwise I wouldn't be reading ff.
