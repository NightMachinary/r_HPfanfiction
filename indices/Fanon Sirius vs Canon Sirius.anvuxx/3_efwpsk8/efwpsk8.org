Fanon Sirius fascinates me. He runs the absolute gamut from sparkly dumbass happy-go-lucky Sirius to cruel, sadistic, cold Sirius. And those are just in the fics that are TRYING to be canon-compliant, not AUs where Sirius had a happy childhood or something happened to make his terrible life even worse.

The happy-go-lucky idiot was covered in great depth here, but I think the cruel humorless bastard is just as inaccurate.

That's not to say he can't be cruel. The werewolf prank, and his lack of remorse even after he'd had years to consider what it would have done not only to Snape but to Lupin? Cruel. His treatment of his family's slave? Cruel. (If mitigated slightly by the fact that said slave is a symbol of everything that made his abusive childhood a misery and constantly pushes his buttons down.)

But I often see it written in fic that "Blacks don't apologize or forgive." I don't mind seeing Narcissa or Bellatrix describe herself that way, but in the very first set of scenes in which Sirius speaks, the words "forgive me, Remus" cross his lips unprompted. And a second later when Remus asks for forgiveness in return, Sirius not only says "of course" but "grins." (The grin may be related to the fact that he thinks he's a heartbeat away from murdering Pettigrew, but still, there's literally never any indication that he doesn't actually forgive Remus for the next two books, no matter how many fics insist that a truly in-character Sirius would kick Remus to the curb instead of moving Remus into his house.)

He continues to show remarkable patience and emotional maturity in GOF. The scene where Harry finds himself "talking more than he had talked in days” to Sirius about everything that's happened for two hundred pages of story while Sirius “let Harry talk himself into silence without interruption" just isn't indicative of someone who makes a snap, self-centered judgment every single time. (Those scenes in GOF are also another testament to Sirius' intelligence, since he comes very close to unraveling the entire plot with very little information.)

He's also self-aware enough to call his 15-year-old-self an idiot, while simultaneously loyal/generous enough to try to protect the reputations of not just James ("he was a good person... he grew out of it") but Remus ("not Moony so much... you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes").

His sense of humor has some broadness to it beyond namecalling. (However: "Snivellus" is actually a clever heat-of-the-moment creation for an eleven-year-old.) Re-writing Christmas carols to be about hippogriffs is funny. So his nicknaming his 30-something self "Snuffles." And I'm not sure I come down with those who are absolutely certain he never made the Sirius/serious pun since it's canon that he spent his adolescence infuriating his parents and the house-elf by constantly claiming that the House of Black is "getting blacker every day, it's filthy."

Sirius may be a character that no one fic writer can recreate to the satisfaction of a significant percentage of the fandom. We see him be patient; we see him be impatient. We see him be cruel; we see him be kind. We see him be cold; we see him be warm. We see him be callous; we see him be generous. We see him be careful; we see him be reckless. We see him seeking isolation when he's pulled under by depression; we see him vibrant and outgoing. We see him be humble; we see him be arrogant. (Tangent: I love that moment in the OotP flashback when he says he's going to get "at least" an Outstanding on his OWL. Yup, he's so damn bright they're going to invent a new category of scores for him.)

I sometimes have a hard time resolving the person we see in GOF (cautious, rational, lecturing about how a man should treat his inferiors) with the one we see in OotP (reckless, frequently said by other characters to be too lonely to be reasonable, antagonizing Kreacher). No wonder fanon's all over the damn place.
