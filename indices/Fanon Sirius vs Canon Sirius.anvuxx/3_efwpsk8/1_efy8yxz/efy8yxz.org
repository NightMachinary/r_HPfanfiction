  Sirius may be a character that no one fic writer can recreate to the satisfaction of a significant percentage of the fandom. We see him be patient; we see him be impatient. We see him be cruel; we see him be kind. We see him be cold; we see him be warm. We see him be callous; we see him be generous. We see him be careful; we see him be reckless. We see him seeking isolation when he's pulled under by depression; we see him vibrant and outgoing. We see him be humble; we see him be arrogant. (Tangent: I love that moment in the OotP flashback when he says he's going to get "at least" an Outstanding on his OWL. Yup, he's so damn bright they're going to invent a new category of scores for him.)

This paragraph right here is exactly why I love his character so much.

  I sometimes have a hard time resolving the person we see in GOF (cautious, rational, lecturing about how a man should treat his inferiors) with the one we see in OotP (reckless, frequently said by other characters to be too lonely to be reasonable, antagonizing Kreacher).

I sort of feel like Rowling wanted to get rid of him as fast as possible.
