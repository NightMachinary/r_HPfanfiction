also like... i dont judge my friends by their "usefulness"? True, the audience tends to see the exciting bits of their lives, but theyre school friends, not a professional team of fighters. Ron and Harry have lots in common, they talk about things like girls and schoolwork and quidditch. 98% of the time, theyre just pals, and I don't think Harry would drop his best friend even if Ron /never/ helped in a fight
