Thank you! =)

I really love this idea of Sirius rebelling but in outrageous ways, or sometimes just subtle ones. No in-between. There's the everyday subtle disrespect to his mother by yawning whenever she talks and then the other ones like the muggle posters.

I LOVE Blvnk, her art is all gorgeous and she deserves all this popularity. I always wonder about that too. Imagine that drastic of a change, not just physically but emotionally and psychologically where he'd sometimes just sit and reflect about his life and how he's changed. I've never actually seen a fanfiction dealing with all the psychological drama of Sirius adapting after Azkaban. He never even had a chance to do so.

Tonks did describe him as still handsome so, that's a plus I guess. But he would be significantly less so. Sirius would have just gone from 22 to 34 really quickly and just adapting to all that change would be draining. But I do agree he was very fixated on Harry to take care of himself, which makes me even more upset.

I just wanted a happy ending for him, he just died though. And it wasn't even a dramatic send off!

I did that point you mentioned in an edit, actually! It just makes it all the more impressive. I never really understood the Sirius = Ron parallels. If anything, he's more alike to Harry than Ron.

  I wonder a lot about how Snape's and Sirius's relationship in potions classes

I wonder about those too! Sirius could've been extremely good as well, but as good as Snape? I mean, he was correcting textbooks. I like to think Sirius was somehow this good, but in Charms or Transfiguration.

As for fics, there's the Unbroken Universe, it starts with linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin), I really love it, although it isn't perfect. Someone already recommended the Black Sheep Dog series, but other than that, I don't have any. There was this one too, linkffn(the ones left behind) but I read it a really long time ago, I don't know if it's as good as I thought it was. Im always looking for good ones so if you too know any of them, please tell me, thanks! Edit: linkffn(Renascentia) is also a really good one
