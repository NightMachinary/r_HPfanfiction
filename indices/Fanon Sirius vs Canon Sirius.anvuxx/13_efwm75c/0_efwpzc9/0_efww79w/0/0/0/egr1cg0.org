I always wondered about why they live there as well. Apparently they're a very old family I think, so I believe that their house has been there before the neighborhood was built, and they just decided to remain there.

I love your headcanon, do you have a name for that family? Also, on an unrelated note, I find it extremely hard to find 'magical' surnames and even names. I don't know why I struggle with it so much, and how Rowling manages to do it. I doubt there's a Wizarding family called 'Spencer' for example. It just seems... off. Do you know what I mean?

What if Grimmauld Place was sort of a 'store' for their magical artifacts before they moved in? I mean in the books when they were cleaning the place the house was flooding with odd trinkets and artifacts. I wonder what a cursed robe was doing there. I just think of them as a generally mentally unstable family. For Sirius, he gets it from Walburga. I think he and his mother were far more similar than he'd like to admit. Regulus is more like Orion.

You know, I never got the interest about Arcturus. I don't even know who he is and where he came from. I'm pretty sure he was never mentioned in the books. Either that, or I really need a reread. I also like your second headcanon. But I like to think sometimes that the Blacks lived there across many generations and eventually killed off every family that moved in these houses, so it gets a vibe of a haunted place. Every time the families die. So I think by the time Sirius and his family were there, there weren't actually many neighbours. But after Walburga died and Sirius was imprisoned, the stigma died off.

I see the Blacks as sort of a family that's extremely feared for mental instability/intelligence but also ridiculed because of their belief that they are royalty. Also, racist in a way that even most purebloods would think is mildiy ridiculous, even for pure blood supremacists.

I like the Leaky Cauldron being the backdoor! I actually really love Diagon Alley, it's one of my favourite parts of the books. It always gives me the warm, fuzzy feels when I reread them so I find it sad when it isn't really explored or skipped over. Do you have any other headcanons about it? I see it being sort of a quirky alley (duh) with a Victorian era theme. But I think it's way more colourful.

I feel you, I actually wrote this post before school started again. I was sort of not taking school seriously before and now I'm just so stressed out and I really regret it, I don't do anything I love or browse this community anymore. I just sleep, eat and study. Repeat cycle. When I do visit the subreddit, the good stuff and discussion has already passed. So I'm sorry for the late reply, I was just stressed out with school. I also have four huge books lined up in my shelves... still unread. I also don't write or watch anything anymore.

I actually found the Slughorn dialogue really creative and brilliant, which is why I asked if you wrote fanfiction. It was sort of colourful? Does that word make sense? English isn't my native tongue so I don't know if it's right. But I guess I need to apologise for the Fleamont/Slughorn/Lily/Eileen/Snape waffling that was going on there

Edit: people like to think Sirius spoke fluent French. I know name origins don't mean anything anymore but Walburga's is German, so I just entertain myself with the idea of Sirius speaking German instead or romancing people with French.
