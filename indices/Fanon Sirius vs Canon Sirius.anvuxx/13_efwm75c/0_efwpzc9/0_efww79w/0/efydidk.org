  Yeah, I think that's also because it's really difficult to write in a sensitive, non-cliche way that's true to his character.
#+end_quote

You know, now I'm actually thankful those don't exist, the last thing I want is a Sirius letting his heart out and weeping in Molly's arms at an Order meeting because he was sad ;(

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah, but I meant - he doesn't really care if other people view him as attractive (he couldn't care less if anything), it's more about how he views himself. 22y-old Sirius probably put a bit too much of his self-value in the way he expressed himself aesthetically, so losing that would be... very strange.
#+end_quote

I get what you mean now, I also believe he used his looks to charm people, but in less malicious ways than Tom Riddle. I think his flamboyancy was expressed through his looks, but not 70spunk!Sirius. I don't see him dressing like that, but it probably factored in his being 'carelessly' handsome.

#+begin_quote
  Again, overall he doesn't really care about it that much. It's a minor issue. But I do figure he kind of, mentally cringes a little bit whenever he sees his boney-skeleton-like face reflected somewhere in Grimmauld.
#+end_quote

And to be honest, who wouldn't? It's a drastic change, however apathetic to such issues you are. I can also see him sort of not truly taking in how much time he spent in Azkaban until he sees his reflection for the first time and then it truly sinking in how much time has gone by, so his looks also would sort of remind him of what he's lost; not just his looks, but his best friend as well.

  It would be interesting if Slughorn started favouring Sirius a lot during the first years compared to Severus (despite Snape being much better), since Sirius is 'obviously from a prestigious family and evidently talented'. He doles out a ton of personal feedback to Sirius, but Sirius doesn't really care that much about potions compared to eg. Charms/Transfiguration. He's interested, sure, but not enough to really utilize Slughorn's help as much as he could.
#+end_quote

What's interesting about Slughorn is that he looks into charisma as much as talent. Dumbledore says to Harry after meeting him that: ' he used to handpick favourites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent'. I think people often forget this and just see 'talent' and go on from there. Apparently charisma was also an important factor for Slughorn and while Snape might have been more talented than Sirius, Sirius was way more charming than Snape, for sure. So Sirius has brains, talent and charisma. Snape has brains and talent, even if his talent outweighed Sirius's at potions. I think he wanted Sirius, but he refused. There's also the unspoken factor like you said, coming from prestigious families or having famous relatives.

Snape was more talented than Sirius in potions and there's a strong possibility that he was more talented than Lily as well, but Lily had charisma. I mean, half of Slughorn's praise for her is about her personality too, not just her talent for the subject. Who would've thought washing their hair and displaying a bit more of his house;s traits would have made him a bit more worthy in Slughorn's eyes? Certainly not Snape.

#+begin_quote
  I could imagine that kind of favoured treatment really provoking Snape, especially since Slughorn is his head of house, and should if anything at least treat him fairly.
#+end_quote

And that just supports Remus's statement that Sirius and James were the 'best in everything' although they might have not been at Potions.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, Sirius just happens to have read a book in the Black library about this, and he just shuts Snape down. It could be an interesting minor thing to have added to the build-up of the whole marauders/snape feud.
#+end_quote

I like this, but is the Black library actually canon?

#+begin_quote
  (But it might be a bit OOC for Slughorn, since he's supposed to be good at spotting talent?)
#+end_quote

Like i said, he also spots multiple other factors. Lily might have had natural talent for it, as well as Siirus, but Snape might have had the brains and wanted to upstage them, so he just wound up being prodigious at the subject and better than the both of them by researching the subjects and wanting to impress Lily and upstage Sirius, so he started altering potions by hard work.

But my entire headcanon actually doesn't have any of them actually talented at the subject. Fleamont Potter was supposed to be old and we know Slughorn was too. So Fleamont and Slughorn might have been in the same year, and potion rivals. They both became extremely successful potioneers and Fleamont taught at Hogwarts for a short while before Slughorn did, and among those he taught was Eileen Prince, who had natural talent and he helped her with it more until she became as good as him, if not better. Or he might not have taught at all and she was just someone working with him.

Then Eileen had Snape and Snape and Lily would go to his house and look through her old potion notebooks and see all these alterations and shortcuts and ingenious ideas, so they adopt them and go to Hogwarts with these tips and instructions and use them in class. They just sort of have a look through Eileen's book for each year and bring those along with them, making copies of the book. On the other hand, James has Fleamont's help and later Sirius does as well. So the two duos just wind up being rivals at school, but Slughorn doesn't acknowledge James's 'talent' because he wasn't exactly friendly with Fleamont Potter.

So the real potion geniuses were actually Fleamont and Eileen, not Snape, Lily, Sirius or James. It's just a fun little headcanon though and I don't know if it makes sense or not.
