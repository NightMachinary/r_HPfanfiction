It seems I was rather lucky because I didn't encounter these extremes. Well, Sirius as a womanizer is definitely fan's favourite thing. I've seen the author trying to explain this by saying how his family didn't love him so he kept jumping from one girlfriend to the next in search of affection. I actually heard from a psychologist that a man's relationship with his partner depends on the kind of relationship he had with his own mother. There's also that terrible abuse thing, where his mother beats him so much that he has visible injuries and has to move carefully. I think fans blew this one out of proportion. For some reason I'm always annoyed when authors choose to portray Sirius as having a special bond with Remus. I don't know why, but I can't stand it.Maybe it's because I believe Sirius prefered James over Remus, and with that whole prank business, any kind of special bond is destroyed. So that's my rant, a bit late, but better late than never.
