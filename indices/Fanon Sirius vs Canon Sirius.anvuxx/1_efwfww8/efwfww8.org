To add to your comment:

I have a version of Sirius in my mind, that is often not displayed in fanfiction. In so many stories I read he's a womanizer, I do not see him this way, I think the reason a lot of people do, is because the guy spent 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, so they want him to have some sort of fun, even if it comes off as womanizing.

I see a character; who hates his parents, and defy them at every turn, however; I also see someone who loves and cares about his brother Regulus, but after Sirius gets sorted into Gryffindor, and Regulus gets sorted into Slytherin, Sirius is uncertain how to talk to his brother, and so they drift apart.

It was also funny the first time for the are you serious? I am Sirius! Joke, but after the 100th time it's gotten old.

Kind of similar to how the Weasley twins often talk one sentence after another, it was funny at first; but now it's gotten old, I have different personalities for Fred and George, and while they might do the complete a sentence thing every now and then, it's not every time that they talk. (More often than not; it's to annoy their family).

Like that, Sirius likes to joke around, but he can in fact be serious. He cares about his friends; and in my headcanon; like how Harry looks up to his friends, and likely considers them family; Sirius looks up to his friends, and think of them as family.

(Probably one of the reasons why Pettigrew's betrayal stung him so badly; he hadn't expected someone he considered part of his family, to do that).
