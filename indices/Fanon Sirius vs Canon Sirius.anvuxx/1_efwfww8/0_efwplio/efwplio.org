The “womanizing” is such an odd point in fanon because it's generally so poorly handled. I think post-Azkaban, it's as you said, people want him to have fun. I can respect that, so long as the inevitably thirteen year old author realizes that one night of mediocre sex does not cure twelve years of torture and fourteen of isolation (spoiler alert: they generally don't).

There's so much room to run as an author with pre-Azkaban Sirius because we know next to nothing. But fics tend to just lean on the womanizer fanon portrayal like it's canon, when it's anything but. The posters may be a sign of a horn dog, excuse the pun, or it may be that he wanted to piss off his mom. He may have loved to sleep around because he was an uninhibited guy, or it may be that (as I conceive it) he never got serious with anyone because he didn't have the healthiest view on intimacy following his upbringing/didn't think he /could/ get involved with anyone because who would marry into his family/didn't want to reveal himself so deeply when he had James and the others for that. Or, maybe his loyalty showed, and he was actually the biggest romantic and most dependable boyfriend in the world. All of that gets left unanalyzed in favor of: Sirius is a canon hottie = so he sleeps with anything that moves.
