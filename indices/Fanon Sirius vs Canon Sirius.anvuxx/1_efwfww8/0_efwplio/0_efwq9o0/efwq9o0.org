For the posters I tend to think it was more to make his family (more importantly his, mother;) mad, and maybe a little bit was because he was attracted to them (but he was a teenager at that point, what straight male teenager wouldn't be?). I'm a female and even I know that.

But yeah, pre Azkaban Sirius is normally such an eye rolling experience, because the author goes with the typical lazy Sirius, who wasn't good at school, with the incredibly lame are you serious? I am Sirius joke, who was also a womanizer. It gets so unbelievably old and not how I see pre Azkaban Sirius at all.

If anything; I go with the opposite; of him never having a girlfriend, or only ever having one girlfriend (In that case; it's normally Marlene McKinnon), but with the no girlfriend case I tend to go with, a lot of it is because of what his family stands for; and the girls might like the way he looks, but tend to not want anything to do with him, as a person.
