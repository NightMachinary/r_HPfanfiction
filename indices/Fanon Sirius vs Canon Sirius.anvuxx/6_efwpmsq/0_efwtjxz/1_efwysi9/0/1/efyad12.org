  All the marauders, Lily and Snape are made out to be very exceptional wizards, and it always came across to me like an author who has to make all of their favorite characters super special.

I thought I was the only one who thought that! Rowling has a bad habit of making everyone in that era a 'genius', even Pettigrew was unwittingly above average.

  Or if Lily was genuinely not all that gifted but instead just a hard worker, I'd find that interesting also.

A lot of people make her skim her lesson and suddenly become a magical savant, entirely forgetting that Hermione too worked extremely hard. So I believe she was a hard worker but less so than Hermione, she had a social life as Rowling confirmed that she too was popular. She was also mischievous. Basically, I see her like a Harry who worked hard and /actually got support from people he loved./ Lily thankfully had loving parents so i don't see her that obsessed with reading and studying and being on top. She was more chill. James wouldn't love someone too uptight.

I find that a lot of the times where people dumb down Sirius and James are also when they want a 'Lily = Hermione' moment, and no, thats not how you do it. You don't make someone dumb so another one comes off as impressive.
