  Do you have any specific headcanon about which characters are genuinely standout in terms of their talent and capabilities?

I have a headcanon that their year didn't exactly have dim people or downright failures. But I do believe Sirius and James were at the top, with Snape. Lily among the top girls, not necessarily the first and Remus and Peter behind those. I mean there's other people we don't know as well, these aren't the only characters after all.

I already covered Sirius in the post. But Lily is NOT a stick in the mud, or Hermione no. 1, far from it actually. We see her breaking her mother's rules in the very first memory of her, sneaking around he sister's room with Snape. Slughorn later calls her vivacious, which also means bubbly and extroverted and a fun loving person. He also calls her charming, so she isn't a socially awkward person, nor does she have her head in a book 24/7. She's also cheeky, which again hints at her mischief. However she wasn't rude since Slughorn fondly remembers her as such. She's also funny, and really passionate about standing up to her friends and people of her kind as evidenced by SWM. Slughorn later calls her brave, and a very likable person. Rowling also calls her really popular and well-liked. She befriends the outcast and defends him until he crosses his boundaries, so she doesn't let people walk all over her.

You can tone down her passion about muggleborns in the fic, since Voldemort never existed! She can be more in the background or takes it upon herself to manage bullying around the school.

Lily is really more defined by her amazing personality rather than her abilities, so I'm always surprised when people go out of their way to assign her traits that she was never hinted to even have! If anything, Lily isn't like Hermione as nearly everybody likes to claim but more like Ginny! Of course, she isn't a carbon copy, but the similarities between their personalities are far more than Lily and Hermione. Bottom line is that Lily and James were extremely similar people, not drastically different. Or the perfect example of opposites attract. There's actually a post that addresses this perfectly, I'll try and find it for you!

Dumbledore also says that Harry's deepest nature is like his mother's. So he's not outright like her, but he's more like her than he is to James. So I believe she does have a saving people thing. Another thing that interests me is the fact that the hat barely touched her hair and she was immediately placed in Gryffindor. I truly believe she was the perfect example of a Gryffindor so you can look at their traits, and add them to Lily in a very blatant way. Also, Gryffindor flaws would be interesting on Lily. She could be extremely reckless or hot headed. She already shows recklessness in the first memory, when she jumps off the swing. She was also a normal girl, she was actually very emotional and open about her feelings. We see her crying twice, get all passionate once and we also see her provoking her sister and if I'm correct, she was from those bunch of giggling girls. She also had a group of friends, so she wasn't a loner. So she was 'just like the other girls' which is a concept that I hate, but I guess you get what I mean?

As for James, he isn't a suave jock who charms his way around everyone! In the first memory we have of him, he is doodling his crush's initials, keeps ruffling his hair around her, keeps looking at the girls at the lake and then actually makes his voice deeper when Lily talks to him. He then not so obviously sulks at the fact that she has stated she actually hates his guts. This guy is a dork. A dork who's potentially the top of his class and a fantastic Quidditch player. You can make him the goofier of the James-Sirius duo, and also the more light hearted. I like how he's portrayed in Promises Unbroken but he was really stressed with wartime, so I don't picture him like that exactly all the time. His character arc is mainly someone who gains some maturity, whether it be the war or his parents or Sirius running away, something forces him to mature and I find it really unfair that people think it's only because of Lily. His entire life does not revolve around her. I also think as a popular guy he didn't just walk up to Lily and ask her out. Every. Single. Time. He did make a fool of himself whenever she was around, but not directly to her. Like remember what he did to Snape? He could try to gain her attention through multiple different ways. James also befriends the outcasts, like Lily! Lily befriended Snape and James befriended Sirius, Remus and Peter. Again, they're extremely alike.

As for Peter, he's not a dumb brick who's always eating cheese in the background. He was a talented wizard, just not outstanding and overshadowed by his friends. He's extremely likable in the Unbroken Universe and was. A guy who turned to Voldemort because he was winning and hoped he could offer protection to his friends. I like this motive, which makes Pettigrew appear more human. He was cool enough for the other three Marauders to hang out with him, so I do think he had a sense of humour and mischief. He seemed to be the one who could blend into the background, so he could be a wonderful liar who gets his friends out of tight spots. We don't have much about Peter but he could be anything.

As for Remus, he has a very dry sense of humour, he's also witty and is actually also up for some trouble. In his first lesson, he turns boggart Snape into Augusta Longbottom and hurts Peeves. He seems to be quiet and his strength comes from that. He isn't brave or strong in an obvious way but he's just as strong as Sirius and James. He also has a lot of self loathing that makes him think he isn't worthy. Something that I find interesting about him is that he uses all the opportunities he has, he's resourceful. Dumbeldore admits him to the school so he works as hard as he could for his education, we see him studying so he's obviously grateful for the people in his life and those small chances he has, so he uses them to the best of his abilities. He's also a prefect and the conscience of the group, so he could be the sensible one but NOT a stick in the mud. Remus's kindness is also very strong and apparent. There was a wonderful write up on Remus in one of the rank downs actually and I have it saved. Wait I'll link it for you.

Good luck on your fanfiction!
