  Basically, I see her like a Harry who worked hard and actually got support from people he loved.

Yep, I can get behind that. Reasonably bright kid whose diligent about their work but not particularly obsessed, and certainly no savant/genius.

  I find that a lot of the times where people dumb down Sirius and James are also when they want a 'Lily = Hermione' moment, and no, thats not how you do it.

Do you have any specific headcanon about which characters are genuinely standout in terms of their talent and capabilities?

As a secondary question:

I'm working on an AU and whilst I feel I understand the differences between the fanon and canon versions of most of the main cast, I'm very shakey on the Marauders + Lily. You got time for a sparknotes breakdown of your interpretation of their canon selves?

I'm obviously going to take certain liberties when I write my AU versions (because of changes like Voldemort never happening and none of them dying), but I think it's important to know the canon version before you veer off.
