I'm not gonna lie, but I actually tend to prefer stories that don't make out any (or at least most) of them as being geniuses.

It kind of feels... unlikely (or more like incredibly author driven) that pretty much everyone from that generation was a lowkey super intelligent and gifted wizard.

All the marauders, Lily and Snape are made out to be very exceptional wizards, and it always came across to me like an author who has to make all of their favorite characters super special.

I do understand why it frustrates people who are very into canon compliancy, but for me it's always been immersion breaking when all of them are treated like they're geniuses.

That being said I enjoy reversals of expectation. So for example if Peter and James were the two overtly smart/gifted ones, I'd find that quite interesting.

Or if Lily was genuinely not all that gifted but instead just a hard worker, I'd find that interesting also.
