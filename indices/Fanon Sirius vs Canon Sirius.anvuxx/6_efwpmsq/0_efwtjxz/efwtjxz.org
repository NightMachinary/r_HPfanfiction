While I think it's objectively wrong to make Remus the "genius" of the group, I think there was so much brilliance to go around that who was the most intelligent and magically gifted becomes almost irrelevant.

Peter, who everyone involved agrees was the weak link in the quartet, still managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he managed the magic needed for Voldemort's resurrection. /And that's the group moron./

Remus, meanwhile, somehow managed to keep up with his classes despite missing a few days to a week every single month for seven years thanks to his super-secret illness. And he did well enough to end up performing all sorts of magic-- from Apparition to Patronus Charms to duels with Death Eaters-- that we're told many wizards can't manage. I don't know that we can take his own commentary that he's "not an expert" or "not much of a potions brewer" or "James and Sirius were sooooo much brighter" as gospel because of his own mindset. (He tells Harry that he's not an expert regarding dementors and Patronus charms, that turns out to be essentially untrue. Okay, so Remus' father was the world's leading expert in all of that. Remus still appears to be an expert compared to, oh, everyone else we meet throughout the books.)

James and Sirius' intelligence has been covered at length in this thread. But even accepting them as the brightest in their year, they obviously chose to round out their gang with other very bright boys... even if they were more problematically and less obviously bright.
