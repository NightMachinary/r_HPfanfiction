  Peter, who everyone involved agrees was the weak link in the quartet, still managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he managed the magic needed for Voldemort's resurrection. And that's the group moron.

I never saw Peter as untalented like lots of people would like to believe, McGonagall called him slow, but that might've just been transfiguration, for all we know he could've been a genius at charms or arithmancy, maybe even ancient runes. He's not moderately talented, but above average, however, I believe he and Remus were overshadowed by Sirius and James. He managed to kill twelve juggles with a curse and he was still the weak one in the group, as well as managing to bring back Voldemort, even if it was under his instructions. This just makes the other three much more impressive.

So when I see a fanfiction where Peter cannot even cast a first year spell I immediately click out.
