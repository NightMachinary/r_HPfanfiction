This isn't a rant, it's the gospel truth. Hyper, overly joke-y Sirius absolutely grinds my nerves, because he clearly has a dry, cuttingly sarcastic, and occasionally dark brand of humor.

Truth be told though, the things you describe about canon Sirius is precisely what makes it difficult to for people to accurately write about him. He's a character full of contradictions, and we see both the best and worst in him in the short time that we know him. He's a genius but hindered by his circumstances and mental health. He cares so genuinely and fiercely for the people he loves but is prone to uglier fits of temper. He's mischievous and witty, but is sobered by the burden of 12 years in Azkaban on top of 2 different wars. He's renounced his family and their ideals, but can't avoid the fact that he was raised/indoctrinated in that environment for a significant portion of his life. It's a lot of complexity to tackle, but I think it's a shame that more writers don't try to, because it's so interesting to think about and unpack.

Regarding him being actually similar to his family, I really have to thank The Black Sheep Dog series for putting the idea in my head that Sirius didn't actually make that clean of a break with his family, and that his family probably groomed him with a lot of effort prior to Hogwarts. It makes sense too with Sirius's response to James's comment about Slytherin in the train---like it really comes off as this understated "excuse /you/" tone haha. I'm sure Sirius was naturally a rebellious kid, but I bet his family probably chalked it up as a personality quirk until he actually started picking up pro-muggle views at Hogwarts.
