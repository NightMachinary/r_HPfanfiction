I 100% agree. If anything, Sirius started out as a bit of a Draco Malfoy with, perhaps, more charm (for an 11 year old boy, anyway). As you've stated, he was haughty and proud and, as the first male Black of his generation, would have been groomed as the future patriarch. The only thing I would add is the scene where James, Sirius, and Snape meet for the first time, because I think it says a lot about Sirius as a child:

  "Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, Wouldn't you? James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.

  "My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said.

  "Blimey," said James, "and I thought you seemed all right!"

  Sirius grinned.

  "Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"

[As an aside, this scene is supposed to mirror the scene where Harry and Draco meet for the first time and Draco says he'd rather leave than be a Hufflepuff. I think we can deduce a lot about how male heirs of pureblood houses are raised between the similarities in Draco, James, and Sirius's behavior as children.]

Sirius didn't go on rants about how much he hated his parents and Slytherin. He even seems almost offended by James' statement against Slytherins. But, using his charm, he quickly diffuses the situation. Sirius on the fence - he is aware of his family's legacy and doesn't mind it (yet), but he also possesses that familiar rebellious streak and the desire to be his own man. /Maybe I'll break the tradition/, he says with a grin. It's lighthearted. James and Snape are so serious about their houses, and Sirius does not care.

I find that Sirius more interesting than the fanon Sirius who somehow developed a strong, distinct, polar opposite moral compass as a child in spite of the company he would have been around most. I think it also adds an interesting layer to Sirius's hatred towards his mother. It's not just that he disagrees with his parents, but that he feels betrayed by them. They kicked him out - the heir they doted on - showing that their love was conditional. In retaliation, he lashes out by being the most pro-Gryffindor, anti-Slytherin person he could be, to Snape's detriment.

I do have a soft spot for fanon Sirius. I loved reading one shots that had a cheerier, alternative version of Christmas break than the one we got in OotP or AUs where Harry grows up in a happy home, but it's frustrating when you want a nuanced, more canon-compliant version of Sirius and he's no where to be found.
