I mean Fred/George's entire character was based around pranks.The Marauders however simply got into some form of trouble that made knowing where people were at any given time useful.The only scenarios off the top of my head was the group was interested in cataloging the secret passages.Pottermore itself states “Together they roamed the grounds as animals, exploring every nook and cranny of Hogwarts.”
