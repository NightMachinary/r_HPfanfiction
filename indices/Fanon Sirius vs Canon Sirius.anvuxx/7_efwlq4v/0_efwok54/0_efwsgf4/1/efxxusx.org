Don't forget the detention that Snape made Harry do, going through the old detention cards from his father's years. The two (or four) of them got in enough trouble at school that Harry saw their names on the cards often enough and his heart would skip a beat. I think that Snape meant to show Harry that his father and Sirius were bullies, but I also have to wonder how often Snape's name would come up on those cards as the victim and instigator.
