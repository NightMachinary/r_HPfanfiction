Hagrid said they got into trouble, which could mean any number of things like mouthing off teachers, getting into verbal/physical/magical fights with other students, wandering in areas that are out-of-bounds, breaking curfew, skiving off class, sneaking into Hogsmeade on school days, getting drunk/providing drinks for other students in a school, or stealing potions from the infirmary or the Potions professor, to name a few things.

Harry himself is guilty of nearly all of these things, but nobody calls him a troublemaker.

But nope, James, Sirius and Remus (and Fred/George) have to be "pranksters".
