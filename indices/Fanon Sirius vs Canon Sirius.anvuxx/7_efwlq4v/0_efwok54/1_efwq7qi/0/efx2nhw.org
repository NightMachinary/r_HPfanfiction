  Fred and George's pranks and messin' about can be mean-spirited at times, if you look at their worst ones (Ron's spider bear, Montague stuffed in the Vanishing Cabinet)

The number of actual "pranks" F&G do can be counted on one hand. The spider bear one with Ron, I think that was when they were 5 and Ron was 3 - you could excuse that as not being intended as a prank. Children can be just as cruel as anyone else.

The Montague one, though, that's assault. The guy gets trapped in the vanishing cabinet for days or weeks. F&G were over 17 at the time.
