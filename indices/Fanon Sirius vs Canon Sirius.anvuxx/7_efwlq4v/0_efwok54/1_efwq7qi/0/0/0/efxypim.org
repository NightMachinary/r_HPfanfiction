Does a grocer actually grow the foodstuffs he sells, or is he just a guy running a grocery? What about the milkman? Or the owner of a restaurant - does he cook all the food it serves, or does he just own a business?

Starting and owning a joke shop is just that - doing business. Their joke shop is not just stocked with "prank" stuff either - they sell things like minor love potions, instant darkness powder, shield hats, pygmy puffs and a bunch of other things. Do you think they go around slipping love potions here and there because they sell them? Or that they help Death Eaters (who use instant darkness powder in Book 6)?

No, you won't.
