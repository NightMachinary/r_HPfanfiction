Fred and George's pranks and messin' about can be mean-spirited at times, if you look at their worst ones (Ron's spider bear, Montague stuffed in the Vanishing Cabinet). Fanon takes it to another level by turning mean-spirited pranks into full-on sexual assault.

As soon as I see fanon!Marauders flipping up girls' skirts and other sexually charged "pranks", that's when I tap out. Snape's pantsing was a one-time thing, and it was never meant to be funny in or out of its original context.
