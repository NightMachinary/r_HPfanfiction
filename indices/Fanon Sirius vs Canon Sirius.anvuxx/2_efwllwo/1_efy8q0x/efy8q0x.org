His contradictory nature is exactly why he's my favourite character! He's one of Rowling's most complex characters and I don't think she herself even realises that at all, she sort of did throw him under the bus, so to speak. She did underuse, a lot. People really like to cheapen one of her most interesting characters. Now when most people say that Sirius is their favourite character I wonder if they mean the Sirius from the books or fanon!Sirius.

I wasn't even sad when he died, just angry and I'm still salty about it. I think he should've died in 6th year, that way the plot could progress as much as it did in the original series and he could've had a little bit of happiness.

  I can't imagine canon Sirius ever once laughing at that, to be honest.

As a child of 11 or twelve? Maybe, but after his third year? No, unless the situation makes the joke sound extremely clever then I don't think he'd laugh at it or use it at all.
