I wonder what sort of person Sirius could've been if he got to live normally, with his friends still alive and well, living up to his greatest potential, both character and ability-wise. I can also see him sort of like a magical equavilent of Indiana Jones, just working independently away from Gringotts. I mean, imagine him tumbling through some ancient temple looking for a lost artifact or something?

I've actually noticed something else about Sirius's name! The star is also sometimes called Lokabrenna by Nordic people, which means 'Loki's torch'. Loki is the God of mischief and Sirius was a marauder who was always up for some adventure. I don't think it's a coincidence.

Thank you so much! =)
