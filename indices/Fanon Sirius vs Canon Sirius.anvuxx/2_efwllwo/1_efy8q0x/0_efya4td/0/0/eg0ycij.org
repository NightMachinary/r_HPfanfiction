    I can see him sort of like a magical equivalent of Indiana Jones

It's funny you mention that. I'm attempting to write a fic now set in the period between POA and GOF, when he's off hiding somewhere warm. In my story, he's in a jungle and that's exactly one of his thoughts: that when he was a kid, he wanted to do this; to be an explorer of sorts, hunting treasure or cool animals in the wild, and it was another thing in his life he never saw realized. So I, too, see him that way.

(Story is slow going though because I'm trying to do justice to his dark post Azkaban mood and I can only write so many words before I'm depressed myself. I'll probably never finish hah)
