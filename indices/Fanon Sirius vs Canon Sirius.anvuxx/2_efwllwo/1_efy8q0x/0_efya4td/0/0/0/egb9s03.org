I haven't read many of those, if at all actually. So I'm actually really interested in your fanfiction, especially because you've got a good grasp of Sirius. I always thought Sirius had loved to travel, but not as tourism, rather like some sort of an opportunity to cook up more mischief and have a little bit of an adventure.

Good luck on your fanfiction! I hope I can read it when you're done with it. How long are you planning to stretch it out? Up until he arrives in Britain? When the Order reunites? I actually also love fanfictions where the Order reunites and everyone learns about his innocence. I often wonder about the reactions and how Dumbledore came about to tell them. They've had this version of the truth in their mind for almost two decades! And suddenly they're provided with a very long and borderline ridiculous story.
