Absolutely. He's my favorite too (for canon, as well as his fanon potential). He's an endlessly fascinating character to me. In the right fanfiction author's hands, I as easily see him as the grizzled Minister for Magic at the end of the Second War as I see him sitting in Buckbeak's room, muttering, slapping nargles from his head by HBP. He is /complex/ and /smart/ and I'm so appreciative of your post that highlights that. Anyway, take a gold and thank you for joining me as a missionary for our lord and savior Sirius Black ðŸ˜‚

(You're right, an eleven year old Sirius may have laughed at anything that came out of James's mouth. He does have a dorky humor at times. I guess I've always just pictured him as a bit self serious about things that tie him to his family, like the astronomical names. I could easily see him go full Walburga if someone were to laugh at it: "but that's my name? It's a constellation? What are you, stupid?" and never giving the joke a second thought)
