I honestly thought it was incredibly shitty of Dumbledore (and I defend Dumbledore sometimes) to basically put Sirius on house arrest and how his death panned out. I think his storyline would have been more interesting if Dumbledore, who still had a fair amount of power before the end GOF, threw his wait around and got Sirius a trial---maybe even abroad, as he was head of the ICW.

Dude was wrongfully locked up in a prison for over ten years, not only is that a human rights violation, but it's even worse by the standards of the prison. Then he gets out and sees that Dumbledore got off Snape, a marked death eater who was up enough that he interacted with Lord Voledmort, completely off and found him a job, that Lucius is walking around home free, etc.

I can't imagine being wrongfully locked up, and seeing the people who actually committed crimes, walking around free would drive anyway half mad and bitter. Like imagine someone locked up and wrongfully accused of being a nazi and tortured for ten years, and then they get out and see SS officers strolling around, with complete freedom. I feel like canon Sirius should have been more furious.

Anyway, I think canon Sirius would have been more interesting if he was free and managed to build a life for himself in a few years (and had counseling), but died in the final battle. It would still be tragic, but not the tragedy porn that JK concocted. But I think she wanted Teddy to parallel Harry, hence killing off all the Marauders.
