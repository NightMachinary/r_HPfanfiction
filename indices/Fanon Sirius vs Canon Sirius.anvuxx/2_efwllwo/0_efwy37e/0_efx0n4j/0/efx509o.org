Yes, I sort of thought at the end she really only wanted to focus on Harry, Snape, and Dumbledore and sort of let the other characters development by the wayside. Like Ron, Tonks, Remus---I thought they became rather thinly sketched. I always kind of assumed Sirius was in total shock when he handed Harry over, which makes it even worse on Hagrid and Dumbeldore's part.

Haha, no, I'm not the FFN writer...I didn't even know there was an FFN with a similar name. I actually picked it because it means eagle, and I like birds and figured there were a million eagle handles and few altairs, and that it also the name of a star in my favorite constellation. I later learned that it was apparently a common name in various video games.
