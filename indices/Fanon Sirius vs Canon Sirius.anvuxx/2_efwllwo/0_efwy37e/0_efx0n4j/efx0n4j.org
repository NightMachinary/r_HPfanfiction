    I feel like canon Sirius should have been more furious

I could write a Ted Talk on Dumbledore and Sirius and that would be its conclusion.

Dumbledore steamrolled him in every conceivable way; it is amazing to me that Sirius ever showed him respect. It's one of the reasons that I have such a tough time with fanon!Sirius who rebels for the sake of rebellion against any and all authority figures, because his canon self decidedly does not. I don't know what custody rights look like in the wizarding world (is there a similar concept to legal guardianship?) but if they even remotely parallel the muggle world, Sirius should have trounced Hagrid at Godric's Hollow, snatched Harry, and ridden off into the sunset with his middle finger waving down to Albus. Harry was /his/ to raise; Dumbledore be damned.

Rowling seems to have no idea of the character she created. There's an interview where she essentially expressed shock that people were upset at his character death because she found him to be only a “brooding presence” in the book. It almost seems like she didn't know what to do with him and his arc could have gone somewhere much more interesting if he got to build a life. It would have been nice to see him have at least one year that wasn't unmitigated bullshit.
