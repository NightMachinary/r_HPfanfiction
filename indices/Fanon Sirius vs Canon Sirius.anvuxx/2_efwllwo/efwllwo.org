Nice analysis. Sirius is a tricky character to write because his in-canon self is so contradictory. He can be very cruel, but there are also moments when he's shockingly kind and open-hearted. He's very serious, brooding and haunted; he also calls himself “Snuffles” without irony. He's arrogant but seems to lack confidence that others care for him, self-involved but puts his friends (and most especially Harry) unceasingly first. And the list goes on. It's one of the reasons he's such an interesting character, perhaps Rowling's most complex, but is so easily flattened and can read OOC when one trait is built up at the exclusion of others. You have to touch on all of this, and more, or you don't properly have a Sirius in your story.

His humour is also horribly done in fanon. It's such biting, sarcastic wit---again, a reflection of his intelligence (and anger)---but people always go for the “Serious?” “No, I'm Sirius!” pun which sets my teeth on edge. I can't imagine canon Sirius ever once laughing at that, to be honest.

Where the hell the sugar high child in fanon came from is beyond me...
