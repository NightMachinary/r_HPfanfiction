  A lot of Fanfiction has been focused on Sirius' negatives to really appreciate his positives. It's the other way round with Snape and it baffles me why that happens.

The first reason is Alan Rickman (although I do love Gary Oldman, but he wasn't the perfect Sirius by any means), and the other reason is that casual movie-watchers love a good tragic 'romance' and that was exactly what Snape had, so they'd sympathise with him.
