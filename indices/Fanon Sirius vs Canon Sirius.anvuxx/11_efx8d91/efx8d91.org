A lot of Fanfiction has been focused on Sirius' negatives to really appreciate his positives. It's the other way round with Snape and it baffles me why that happens. I adore canon Sirius and drop anything with Fanon Sirius like a hot potato. If there are a lot of fics exploring the layers to Snape's personality, then there should be MORE of Sirius' too. I try my best to write a canon-compliant Sirius and I wrote a three-page character information about him on my notepad for reference. It's nice to see people like you WANTING justice as others are not doing so.
