Not really. I'm assuming that the original war was mainly guerilla-style combat, with only a few battles that weren't totally one-sided. It was mostly about ambushes with overwhelming force, with all the numbers on one side or the other. I mean, why bother fighting all the enemy forces when you can ambush one of them when he's in the bathroom and Imperius him, then have /him/ fight for you? Why duel a Death Eater when you can Disillusion yourself, track him back to his base, then Summon his wand while he's asleep and snap it?
