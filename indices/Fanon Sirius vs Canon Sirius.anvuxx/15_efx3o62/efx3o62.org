  He defeated every Death Eater he was battling up until Bellatrix, who he was battling until he got too cocky. I won't say he would've defeated her because we've got no solid proof he'd have done so, but he could've held his own, definitely, until Dumbledore arrived at the very least. They were equals up until then and Bellatrix managed to go through Kinglsey in a shorter amount of time than Sirius, who prior to this was duelling three Death Eaters at once.

Considering that this exact thing happens again with Bellatrix in Sirius's role and Molly goddamn Weasley in Bellatrix's, I'd say that it's pretty likely. Not taking your opponent seriously gets you killed in wizard duels even if they're far below you in skill and power.
