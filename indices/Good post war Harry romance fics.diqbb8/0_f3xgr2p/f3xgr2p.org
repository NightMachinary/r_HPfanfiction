Most fics I am aware of without H/G or H/Hr are more limited towards who can be paired with Harry (i.e. many of the other 'pairings' are dead, black-marked by the war, or are with characters that canon-Harry in hogwarts never really had time to interact with much):

- linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-Dude): post-war Harry/Daphne, arguably the most reasonably written Slytherin relationship in many ways.
- linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad): post-war Harry/Daphne, not as good but decent time-waster without any serious issues (other than the boring DoM stuff).
- linkffn(Grow Young With Me): probably know this one, but basically Harry and an OC after Ginny kicked the bucket.
- linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality): another post-war fic with Harry/Daphne, with Harry as a quidditch player instead.
- linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup): a break with Harry/Luna, though Luna is a bit different from canon (warning for some troubling past), and Harry as a quidditch player essentially divorced from Ginny.
