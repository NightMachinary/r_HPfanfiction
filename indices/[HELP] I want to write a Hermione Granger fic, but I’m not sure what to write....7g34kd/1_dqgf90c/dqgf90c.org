I think Hermione is quiet the interesting character, because she is complex.

I would love to see how she would end up if some things where different :

- What if she was sorted in Ravenclaw, accentuating her book-worm part ?
- What if she was deeply traumatized by the troll incident in first year, focusing on defending herself ?
- How her fierceness could reveal itself, before the 4th year, Edgecomb and DA's business ?
- What if she get her hands on the Jedusor book, instead of Ginny ?
- How her bossy+intelligent personnality could develop in another era ?

In my opinion, dark Hermione or such an AU is more interesting because it is plausible with the her character.
