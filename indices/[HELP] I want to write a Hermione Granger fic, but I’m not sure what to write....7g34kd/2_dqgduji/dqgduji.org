Check [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]], a Magic-less AU, for a very good take on her.

Hermione is, according to JKR, "borderline genius". She also pretty much has the best moral compass of the characters - she is the only one who condemns slavery, for example. She wasn't the best with people in her early years, but she outgrew that. In 5th year, she organised the DA, and post-Hogwarts, she became the Minister for Magic. You don't achieve that if you don't know really well how to deal with people. She's also insecure about her looks, and has a temper. And she will do what she considers right no matter the resistance - fortunately, she usually knows what's right better than anyone else.

I'd like to read stories focusing on her, without turning her into some damsel in distress, or bashing her by validating the pureblood bigots. And certainly no drivel about house elf slavery being anything else but evil. Let her actually use her brain to wreck the canon plot, and change Britain.
