Writing smart characters is actually not easy. Too many authors make the mistake of developing a supposedly genius character, only to dumbing him or her down to jam their plots through, resulting in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot][idiot plot]] trope.

Please don't do that.
