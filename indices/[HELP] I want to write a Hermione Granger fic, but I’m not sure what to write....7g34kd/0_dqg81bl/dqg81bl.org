I'd really like a story where Hermione marries a muggle. This is because I still can't find that one shot/drabble I read years ago featuring that premise so I might as well request someone to write another one and make it more than a one shot.

From what I remember, Hermione and her muggle husband are both achievers in their respective fields, Hermione in the magical world and her husband in the muggle world. Both are fascinated about what each one is doing but because they work in different worlds, they don't meddle in each other's work affairs. This causes Hermione peace and contentment because they're both on the same level intellectually but she's come to the point where there isn't a need for her to "prove" herself to her husband; they just simply enjoy being with each other and respect each other.
