Hermione traveling back through time to raise her honorary little brother Harry (she is nearly a year older and was stuck in a "protective big sister" role for most of the books) and spare him the Dursley abuse. Meanwhile, she goes Horcrux hunting (and Death Eaters as well) while doing her best to play matchmaker to get Harry together with his future wife (Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, Cho Chang, Penelope Clearwater, any other non-mainstream choice) who was brutally murdered in front of Harry back in the future.

An indifference towards the Weasleys would work best for this because neither Weasley wank nor bashfest seems suitable.

Maybe she initially wanted to prevent James and Lily from dying but couldn't do it or was unable to find them in hiding.
