Hermione is self-righteous, arrogant and completely lacking in social etiquette. She's also very clever, hard working and has a strong sense of loyalty combined with good intentions. People like me dislike her because not matter how well meaning she is I find her irritating. For me to read a Hermione story it would have to be a journey of self discovery.

For a voyage of self discovery wrapped under the guise of something else I'd recommend a morally grey world with characters just as clever as her. If you're simply looking to have a cheeky wank over how great she is then it won't be popular here but will probably get plenty of favourites on FFN. I want her little world view stripped away and for her to reflect that perhaps she was rash, that perhaps she didn't know all of the details and it had consequences. In the series too few of Hermione's bad or questionable actions have consequences.

Hermione is a gryffindor at heart. She leaps without looking. She does more looking that the others but throughout the series she's more than willing to dive in face first to find out what is happening. House-elves are an obvious example of where she immediately leap to a conclusion. Its an obvious one. Slavery is bad. There is an argument however that house-elf slavery is more nuanced but Hermione ignores that in her moral crusade. Is she right? Its never clear really but that doesn't stop her, she goes against the house-elves themselves because she believes she knows best. If she does or doesn't is irrelevant, its that part of her character that you can take away.

Stories are driven by conflict. Hermione creates conflict. As a person she's abrasive. She leaps to conclusions that hold up when presented with immediate evidence but she can overlook things that disagree with her. You could easily have a story where Hermione has to essentially get over herself to save the day. To realise that sometimes good people do bad things. She herself does plenty of morally questionable things in the series, kidnapping and extorting Rita Skeeter for example. Take Star Trek for example from the ones you've listed. She'd probably love the idea of star fleet, the federation and its ideals, but what about Section 31? Wouldn't they want to know more about her and her powers? Could she ever accept the necessity of Section 31 in the preservation of Starfleet? Could she ever go down that path to save star fleet at the cost of her soul? How would she react to the knowledge that they allow others to live in near Utopia? Would she campaign against their existence regardless of what they do for the good of star fleet simply because of their methods?
