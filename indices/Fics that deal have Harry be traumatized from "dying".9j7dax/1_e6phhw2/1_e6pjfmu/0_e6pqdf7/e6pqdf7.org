No problem. :) I wanted to write a story about Harry coming to grips about being on the cusp of the afterlife with his family and Voldemort in the rearview, only to have it pulled away. Would have released another chapter, but upon rereading my initial third chapter I felt I needed to do it better. Hopefully tomorrow~
