"Good" may be a bridge too far, but Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/]]) is perfectly enjoyable. It has some genuinely interesting plot points and great banter, but everything else ranges from "meh" to "please, no." Also, it hasn't updated in six months and left off on a cliffhanger, which is always fun. It's worth noting that the author has claimed that the story is actually complete and just needs to be cleaned up, but given how messy the published version is, I find that explanation less than satisfying.
