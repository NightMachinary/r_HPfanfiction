Linkffn(Euphoria)

This is the standard for 4th year H/F fics. Nothing bad about it, nothing too special either -- just a very vanilla and well written GoF romance.

Linkffn(The Halfblood Romantic)

This is a H/F 6th year fic, where Fleur comes to teach at Hogwarts. Very well written, but it's stopped at a point where they aren't yet together, and at this point it's a tossup as to whether or not there will be more chapters.
