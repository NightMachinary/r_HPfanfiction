- I don't know if you know [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] from FFnet (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on).

- My first long story I have read, which persuaded me that amateur writing could be worth reading was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124).

- Later I found stories by mzzbee starting with “Petunia's Letter” linkao3(11676102), but that's rather fringe story, I am afraid, but I liked it very much.

- Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][series]] “Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly” with very unorthodox next generation (and very unusual Harry).
