  Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived to Defeat Voldemort, Head Auror of the MLE, finds himself stuck in his 11-year-old body after a potions accident. How does 28-year-old Harry deal with being a First Year, with Voldemort rising back to power, and himself a Horcrux again? How does being sorted into Slytherin affect his relationship this time around with Snape? EWE. Slash.
