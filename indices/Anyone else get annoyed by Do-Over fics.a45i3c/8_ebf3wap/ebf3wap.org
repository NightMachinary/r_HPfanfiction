I've enjoyed a few Peggy Sue fics, but haven't read much that was really a curbstomp. The one that stands out to me, resolving everything really fast, was actually Hermione, not Harry (linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them)).

The ones I've really liked have traveled a much thornier road, like Nightmares of Futures Past, or Backwards With Purpose.
