I remember reading this premise for the first time about 12 years ago, when there weren't quite as many fan fics going around.

Can't remember which one, but it was a completely new concept - and blew my mind.

I've since read about 20 of essentially the same story, and there are lots of issues with it, but at the time it was fresh, new, clever, and insanely brilliant.

Lots of conceptual ideas were/are like that. Its funny how when you read Fan Fiction for so long ( its going on 15 years for me now.... Jesus ) when you go back and re-read fics you remember loving you realise they're not quite as good as you remember. Usually because someone has taken the idea, and written it much better in the years after. Its rare that the first person to come up with an idea also writes it with the best writing, characterisation, etc.
