There's one fic (or perhaps a series?) where he goes back in time and because he has gone back in time and therefore knows what is going to happen he (accidentally) changes it through his actions. I believe he got Sirius out of Azkaban a year early for example and that changed stuff and then other stuff happened that didn't happen last time because he did stuff differently but he wasn't expecting things to change because why would they?\\
I think that may just be one of the worst fic descriptions I have ever given though.

Does anyone have the faintest idea what one I'm going on about?
