One of the best time travel/do overs I read had the time traveling character struggle to fit into the time period they arrived at. The character felt out of place at times due to social customs and geopolitical situations. In this fic the character was ridiculously overpowered (with a good reason) but suffered from some amnesia so she couldn't remember everything, sometimes bits and pieces would come to her.

I think in a redo fic, not everything should go the character's way. Otherwise it can get really boring without any real conflict.

One of the more interesting do overs I read wasn't in the perspective of the main time traveler. It was his parents wondering what is up with him and why he's acting so weirdly.
