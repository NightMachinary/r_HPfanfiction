linkffn(Strange Attractors)

This isn't really a do-over, it's more of a time travel. Hermione is the Time Traveler and prior to TT she was an Unspeakable. This makes her a very powerful witch by Hogwarts students' standards, and the fic doesn't gloss away from that.

Like you I like to read do-overs where everything goes the MC's way and all the problems are solved quickly. But it's so much more interesting if not everything goes the MC's way or if they've completely messed up the timeline.
