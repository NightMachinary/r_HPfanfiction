One thing I would like to see is a fifth year DOMs Harry wind up back in school not in the marauder era but with fifth year Bill, Charlie, or Tonks. Such that he is finishing school either as young Harry is starting or before that.

Another concept I have is four different Harry's all starting in 1991. A post DH, a DOMs and one that had just taken the port key out of the graveyard along with 11 year old Harry.

Wherein the central conflicts center around the different Harry's whose world are each slightly different from cannon and had different summer 1991 experiences
