The problem is, I have yet to find even one well written one. I have read extremely good do-over fics in other fandoms, but in this fandom, there just seems to be an abundance of horribly written ones, so yes, extremely annoying. But really, give me one good fic and I'll be content to have had enough of the stupid trope XD

The part about posing as a young child (it doesn't help that most writers seem to have barely entered puberty at the time of writing) when your mind is >20yrs old also makes it hard for me as a reader to take anything seriously. Why is that even necessary? Why not go back as an adult and interact mainly with the adults? Or go back at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts for example to the Marauders Era just before they finish school or something, so that they will be of similar age. I imagine that in both cases a certain chemistry (in a friendship/family kind of way) can be created that makes the story compelling to read.
