Yeah, that fic has some pretty big issues which is especially painful considering how many good things it has going for it.

The entire premise of having multiple time travelers on opposing sides in a universe heavily set against Harry is super compelling, and I love how it basically tells the stations of canon to go fuck themselves, and way the fic involves Hermoine's parents is pretty amazing too.

At the same time most of the whole harem stuff just makes me super uncomfortable, Ginny's part especially. The way how, in one of the latest chapters, she tells him she doesn't want to kill and is ashamed for it before resolving to do it anyway to please Harry, and he just nods off on it as if it were a good decision, and the fic then tries to present him as noble for not forcing the issue and leaving her an out (while still subtly manipulating her not to take it) is just so eurggghh.

Also IIRC the age issue does in fact exist. I'm pretty sure Harry comes from a timeline where Voldemort won in year 7 and ruled for several years, it's just John who thinks that Harry returned after year 4. Granted, Harry spent all that time rotting in Azkaban, so it's questionable how much those years affected his mental age, but he certainly acts like an adult in most situations.

I'm still debating whether or not to drop the fic because despite all this I still really want to see what happens and have a certain amount of investment in the characters who aren't Harry.
