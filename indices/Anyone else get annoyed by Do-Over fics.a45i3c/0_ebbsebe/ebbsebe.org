The thing I really take issue with are the ones where a mentally adult Harry uses his past knowledge to get into the good graces of his past love/loves. They of course would later enter into a relationship with him. What's that one, Chasing witches and dodging prison? Harry does exactly what his brother did and uses his knowledge to bring them onto his side. He literally creates a divide between Ginny and her family in a Harry or Weasleys scenario. Ginny is ten in that situation, while Harry is a fair bit older. 15-16 maybe. It doesn't have the age aspect but he's still taking advantage of them. I never really got back into it after I realised that.
