I love it when it is executed in a logical fashion (Harry kicks everyone's arse). An utter annihilation, a buggering for the history books. Bringing a tank to a fist-fight. Those can be quite cathartic to read once in a while.

Much worse are the fics which add some artificial challange along the way because the author has not properly thought the whole idea through and realised that it would take roughly 20k words to write the whole thing, but they want a lot more (since longer = more favs) and there isn't enough teenage drama in a one-sided slaughter.

A proper do-over would probably look very different than most people imagine, simply because 11-year-old children are not very interesting conversationalists and Harry would get fed up with them within a week. The whole "let's befriend Ron and Hermione again" arc wouldn't work out very well, all things considered.
