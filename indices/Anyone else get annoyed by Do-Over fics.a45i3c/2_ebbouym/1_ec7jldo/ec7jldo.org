What I just cannot comprehend is that after all these years and with all those fanfiction writers, there doesn't seem to be one or two properly written do-over fics. Sure, fanfiction writing is for everybody and in the case of Harry Potter, many younger children write their stories, but in every fandom there are a few very talented writers out there who write complex, lengthy, logicially thought out stories that are amazing and can be read again and again. I would have thought there were more of them in this fandom just because of the size of it.
