I'm pretty sure I've seen this somewhere; I don't remember the rest of the plot, but I recall that James Potter wanted Harry back after he showed signs of magical ability (maybe he was thought to be a squib before? I don't remember), and threatened the Dursleys in some way (false allegations of child abuse, possibly) to get Harry to come with him. Kind of villainous in that fic.
