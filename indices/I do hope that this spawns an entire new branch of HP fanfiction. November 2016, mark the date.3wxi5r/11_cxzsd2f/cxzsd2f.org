Im not that excited... the actors arent the best so far... they arent spending the money they did before, so they are REUSING an older set from a different movie... BUT I do think the characters and the story will be acceptable. I dont think It will be great.. Nor will it be the amazingness that was Harry Potter. No I think its gonna be good at best. JKR had lightning in the bottle and due to so many factors I have lost faith in her ability to create a story that wont make me want to rip my hair out.. /cough/ horacruxes /cough/ but It will be entertaining at least.
