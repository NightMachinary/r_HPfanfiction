  *THE EIGHTH STORY. NINETEEN YEARS LATER*. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child officially opens at the Palace Theatre London in July 2016. *It is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series* and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.

It's canon, no turning back. We have EWE (Ending, What Ending?) now we'll have PWP (Play, What Play?). But there will also be fanfiction based on it. Don't deny it. It's ok to cry.
