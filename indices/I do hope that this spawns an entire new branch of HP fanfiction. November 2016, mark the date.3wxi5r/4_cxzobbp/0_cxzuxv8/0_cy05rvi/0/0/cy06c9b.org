Ah, yes, I do the same with the previous movies.

This case is a bit different, however, in that the movies are going to be inspired by the book (so to say) but not an actual adaptation of the book's content, not a direct one in any case. And with the play giving us a precedent, there is a possibility of the movies being treated as canon by Madame Rowling herself.

I hope that won't happen because the past movies had really broken the expectations in that particular regard (keeping to canon, that is) and not in a good way, but oh well, can't say either way this time.
