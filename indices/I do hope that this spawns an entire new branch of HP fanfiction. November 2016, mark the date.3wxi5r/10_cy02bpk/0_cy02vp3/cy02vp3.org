I'm pretty sure that these are barely edited, quickly rendered first shots. Its still 11 months to the final movie.

Coming from this industry I can just imagine how some producer was like "We need a trailer NOW!" and some artists looking forward to christmas scrap together some half-done scenes, place/crap a bit of Nuke and After effects magic on it, and there it is, ready to be shown in cinemas, just before Star Wars.

Most people don't even see stuff like that. Its all just "ooooh, shiny" with the normal folks.
