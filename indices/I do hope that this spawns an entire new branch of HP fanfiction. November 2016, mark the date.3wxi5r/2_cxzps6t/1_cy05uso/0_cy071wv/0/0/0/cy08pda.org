I don't know; considering that Cruciatus is supposed to subject the target to the perfect pain, which whatever it means I presume can't really be improved upon via a spell upgrade, the notion of this spell being amplified is just silly.

But in any case, I only started with the first one (“Avada Kedavra Maxima”) as a crude joke, which I presume you to be aware of but I'll just note it now since my jokes seem to sometimes be incomprehensible and I don't want you to think I'm seriously complaining now.

Well, thanks for trying to guess how the whole thing would work, and for replying at all, in any case. I appreciate it.
