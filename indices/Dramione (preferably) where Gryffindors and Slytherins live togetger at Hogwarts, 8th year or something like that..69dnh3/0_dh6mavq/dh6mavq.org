Are there any 8th year fics that are actually good? I don't mean guilty pleasure readable but genuinely well thought out post-war society fics focused on the Hogwarts student body?

Most of the ones i've seen were just wish fulfillment for certain pairings and everyone being all lovey dovey with absolutely no conflict or plot besides some Weasley bashing...
