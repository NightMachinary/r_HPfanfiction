  Post-Thor, canon-divergence. Loki doesn't survive his fall from the Bifrost and winds up reincarnated on Midgard as a mortal magician named Lucy with no memory of her previous life. Her decision-making skills have not been much improved by the transformation._____“Do I even want to know why you think I'm your missing brother?”“The similarities are startling,” Thor managed. She looked pointedly down at her chest, then back at him, her lips pursing. He knew the look in her eyes, the set of her mouth, the tension in her jaw. Oh, how he knew that sharp, angry, hard face. He could practically hear Loki hissing “You idiot” in his ear.“You deny it, then?” Hogun asked.“Seriously?” Lucy's left eye twitched slightly. “I have at no point in the last thirty years seen or experienced anything that would lead me to think I'm a dude, an alien, a god, or any combination thereof. So yeah, I'm going to have to go with denying it.”_____Irregular updates. Thanks for reading!
