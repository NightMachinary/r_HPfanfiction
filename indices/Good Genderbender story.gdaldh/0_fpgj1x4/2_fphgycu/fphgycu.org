  “I think we've got a lot to figure out. But together we'll get it sorted.”Harry kissed her forehead.“Together. Sure.”It didn't sound any less impossible when Harry said it. But then, impossible was their speciality, wasn't it? Or, the one where Harry is a trans woman, and she and Ginny are still in love.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely. Despite a name and gender change, Harry Potter wasn't someone who would let their family suffer for no reason. Lyra was a Black, and Blacks protect their own. Time travel, genderbending - fem! Harry, slash and fem slash, same-sex pregnancies.
