I managed to find some. Just want to warn you that it's been a while since I've read most of these so I can't exactly promise that they're good, etc. From what I can remember, To Reach Without is kinda angsty and the ones by Racke as well as Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool sort of gloss over getting turned into a girl but they might be worth a look anyway. Hope some of these have what you're looking for.
