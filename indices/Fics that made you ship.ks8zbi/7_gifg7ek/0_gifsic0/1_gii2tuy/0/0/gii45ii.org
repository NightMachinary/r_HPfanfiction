Yeah I think the problem behind it is that it was hugely popular. As such a lot of a bad fics were written where they're just lovey dovey perfect and it really falls flat.

People also don't like the idea of her ending up with her childhood bully. Mostly because we like to think those shitty evil bullies never change and end up sad miserable adults.
