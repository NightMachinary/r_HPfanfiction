I totally believe that people can change from their past prejudices! In fact I hold onto that so dearly for draco especially with all the subtext in the books about him really regretting his choices and forming his own views towards the end. I just always believed hermione might be the type of person too stuck in ways to look at him and not feel trauma. But i do think there's definitely a very right and very wrong way to write them as lovers.
