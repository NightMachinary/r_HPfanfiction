Those are all totally valid points and I respect your views as well! The reason I dont like hermione with harry is strictly that I think their friendship is so wholesome and healthy and I hated that people ran with that in the movies and shipped them. Like just let people/characters be friends! Not everything is romantic. Of course I understand people writing FF about it, thats a different story.

As far as ginny, I think at first she WAS very fan boy of him, but she drops that after a few years, which is when harry actually starts to really notice her. I think out of all the characters in the book, her sass is the only one that can match harrys (besides maybe Ron actually). She's also got this level of rightful humbling with harry. Harry in either Order or HBP (I don't remember which book tbh) is like venting and yelling about voldemort constantly penetrating his mind, how he took so much from him, how there's NO one who understands what harrys been through and ginny is basically like hey fuck you dude I was controlles by his diary for a whole year and almost died because of it. Because it's so tone deaf of harry to act like he's alone in his struggles and to not open his eyes to how many others it's effected. I also love their breakup in HPB because she doesn't cry, she doesnt fight it or pout. She just accepts it because she loves him so much. She knows he might go off and die or come back not be with her, but she knows he needs to do what he has to and the full on support and adoration for his journey is miles and miles beyond mature for her age at just 15. I agree that JK isn't the best writer but I do think we get a lot of special moments that show how powerful ginny is in her own right, not just when it comes to magic, and idk thats how I think it is.
