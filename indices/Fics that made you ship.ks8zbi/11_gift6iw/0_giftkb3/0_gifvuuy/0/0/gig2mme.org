That's the same reason I don't like Harmony that much. My issue with Hinny isn't the fangirling or anything like that, but because Ginny doesn't get to be there. We get one book where they have an interesting relationship, with sarcasm, witty banter, and legitimately caring for each other. We get to see Ginny as a pretty cool person. Then they break up. Then we get an epilogue with them being happy together. To me, offscreen romance isn't worth caring about. But that's more of an epilogue issue. With post-canon stuff, Ginny just ceases to be good, and so does Harry. She's too perfect, none of the spitfire that she was in book 6. She's like this weird, virtuous saint. Ginny from book 6 doesn't except Harry back with a big kiss after Voldemort. She hexes him. And then they go hold hands and be insufferable somewhere. It's less the pairing itself, more the works that it features in. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain
