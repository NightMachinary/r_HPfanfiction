Well, that's just continuation of the same trend. You have point A (actually, the last time Ginny really shows up is at the end of the book six, then she is just briefly mentioned in the background), and then because chapter 37 is missing, we don't know anything until the epilogue (WHAT?). Yes, both Ginny by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Mrs Granger]] made a great job to bridge this chasm and to make Ginny into a believable person.
