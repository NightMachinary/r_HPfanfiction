O I dont hate hinny and yes I read the books haven't fully watched movies actually but could you explain it to me maybe because I don't truly understand harry ginny making sense since all I saw was leaving fangirl stage becoming friend and then I dont think she ever got over HARRY POTTER while they were dating I cant quote it but something like you would only be happy chasing/fighting him(voldermort)if you really knew harry you would know he doesnt like it at all I personally feel it was just jk Rowling bad writing that led to love potion theory and the reason it doesnt make sense to me but that's mei just feel like this ginny and hermione were the only real romance options for harry if we go by canon to book 6 but then we have book 6 where hermione becomes ooc(unrational)vehemently denounces what information comes out a book and calls it cheating for following a books instruction of course she was right in the end because jk Rowling seems unable to write her as being in the wrong but let's look at hermione before close minded(lowkey sociopathic book 3 birches)(birches in replace of bitches)and let me remind you what happened in book 3 hermione was right once again no matter how much of an asshole hermione is jk rowling cant write(I'm pretty sure it wrote write as right earlier on sorry) her as being wrong(sorry for long post btw) and I genuinely dislike hermione I however don't have a real opinion of ginny besides quidditch player fangirl who(as I explained earlier)went away from fangirl but still isnt over HARRY POTTER(the caps are supposed to be dramatic slayer of Voldemort bs) back to what I was saying I still think hermione makes more sense because she was Harry's friend for 7 years she knows harry like really knows harry(while ginny doesnt make sense to me I firmly believe it was just jk rowling bad writing that's Just me I firmly respect your opinion btw
