Have you read the actual HP books? Not to sound rude at all, I respect everyone's opinions! I find people who have only seen the movies hate Hinny, which I get because I hate movie Hinny too. But books Hinny make SOOOOO much sense to me. She's the only one who can match Harry IMO. Ginny is difficult to write in fanfic too i think if the author isnt drawing from book ginny.
