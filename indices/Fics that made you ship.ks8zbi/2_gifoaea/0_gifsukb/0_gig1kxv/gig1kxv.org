That makes sense. I really wanted to include it because of how it changed my perspective from Daphne Greengrass being some Ice Queen, to a much less charged romance. I don't like the true love trope. Love is love, take it where you can get it.

Not to say I like the, emotionally damaged people find their own broken form of love, because I don't. I mean just, love being nice. Like you meet someone, you talk, and you go get coffee. Not just a couple of crazed rabbits seeing how many times they can not make children.
