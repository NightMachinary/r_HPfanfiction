It"s crazy to me how much traction Daphne has made in the FF world. She's hardly a blip in the books but fan fiction make her and like Theo and Blaise seem SO much more involved lmao. I'll look into them! It"s a bit hard for me to get into fics with characters like that because then it feels like an OC, but I know they're not, and I want to be able to draw on references of the type of character they are and can't.
