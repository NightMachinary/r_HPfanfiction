I actually just started Manacled! I've never been a big dramione shipper either, as I said. But I actually watched this tik tok the other day (and it's the reason I finally read the drarry fic) where she said "I hate book/movie draco but love fic draco bc fic Draco can be anything or anyone he wants to and doesnt NEED to rely on his back story". And I like book/movie draco to a degree but always told myself that there was no way hermione would ever fall in lovs with draco. Forgive him maybe bit nothing more, but that tik tok made me realize I was missing out on so much great writing bc I couldn't get out of my head.

I actually go for more darker fics (not as dark as this one but still). I actually wrote a generally happy fic one time with a very sad/bittersweet ending because I don't always like sap ðŸ˜‚ so think once I get used to the harshness of Manacled, I'll probably really enjoy it
