The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie made me ship Sirius and Hermione. They are so perfect in it. And I love Remus and Hermione in it as well. It's probably my favorite fic of all time.

Manacled by Senlinyu made me a dramione fan. I always avoided Draco/Hermione fics but it kept getting recommended to me so I gave it a go and i was hooked. Its completely different from the style I usually go for. I usually go for very happy fics and over the top happy endings, but this one is very dark. But if you are okay with dark, it is worth the read.
