/In medias res/ openings are a common device in novels, particularly pulp genre novels, and are normally employed with the purpose of planting just enough interest in the reader's mind as to impel them to read on and see how events got to where they are. Perhaps one of the most effective examples I know is the story many on here may know: Joe Ducie's (joe6991's) /Distant Star/ (first of his /Reminiscent Exile/ trilogy), where the protag meets a time-traveling version of himself (who proceeds to die), setting in motion the events of the later chapters. Joe wisely doesn't do a true /in medias res/, but nevertheless pulls off the same effect.

While there's a temptation for an author to use such a device, it's now pretty well established as an example of lazy storytelling (on par with the horribadness of a first-person narrative's description of the protag following their^{†} looking in a mirror and describing what they see) and a completely unnecessary crutch 99 times out of 100. And I'm guilty of it myself--/A Mother In Law's Love/ would have been far less hackneyed had I left the initial scene in chronological order.

Incidentally, /Bungle in the Jungle/, one of the prime examples of this device in fanfiction, would also have benefited from a chronological telling. In fact, jbern learned from this experience; he had originally intended for /The Next Lord of Kobol/ to have begun from Harry's POV in a battle with Cylons, then gone into flashback mode, but realized the story was far better told traditionally.

^{†} Singular 'their' and 'they' are grammatically correct in this instance.
