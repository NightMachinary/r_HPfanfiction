Twice in a row, linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) is a good answer.

Sirius escapes from Azkaban early and takes Harry in. Eventually (and keep in mind that this is a long, long fic, with multiple sequels, and is still a WIP) Harry becomes an animagus under Sirius' tutelage.

Also, linkffn(Harry Potter and the lady thief by starfox5) is a good one where Hermione becomes an animagus.
