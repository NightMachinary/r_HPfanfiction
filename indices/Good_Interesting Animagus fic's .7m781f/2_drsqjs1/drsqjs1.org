I don't read a lot of long fics where an animagus form is integral to the story. linkffn(4942221), linkffn(2869358), linkfnn(4447256), linkffn(9406877) are four that immediately came to mind, but please keep in mind the year they were written. lol I can't guarantee how well written they are, but at the time (come on, 6 years ago...), I liked them enough to add them so... (sorry if Harry/Draco isn't your cup of tea.)

linkffn(12618429), linkffn(10884162), and linkffn(11585513) are a bit more recent. linkao3(3177607) isn't really animagus... per se.... it's very interesting, though. Unfortunately incomplete.

Hopefully that gives you some options. Sorry if not. I'll be the first to admit I have low standards since I've read so many (at this point all i want is new stories to read lmao).
