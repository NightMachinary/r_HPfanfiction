I quite like Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler. linkao3(719529) The same author has another series which I quite like, Mischief's Heir.

Steve and the barkeep linkffn(8410168), it's only about 34k but I've seen it recommended a few times and enjoyed it.

On ff.net you can browse/sort all HP crossovers at once, there's a button near the top of the page where you choose the second fandom. Hopefully that made some sort of sense. I know it isn't the same as having people recommend but you might find something that catches your fancy.
