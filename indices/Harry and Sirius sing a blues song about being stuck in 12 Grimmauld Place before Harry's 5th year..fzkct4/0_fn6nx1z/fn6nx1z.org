Harry had learned to love Blues music over his 4th year summer. He had come across Sirius listening to it and joined him. Just relaxing and let the music flow as they took in to sounds.

Sirius had begun teaching Harry how to play the guitar. Magic made learning an instrument far easier than normal.

The Black family house had a large garden, remarkably well maintained considering the house elf in charge of it, in the rear of the property.

They had lit a bonfire that night in the center where all the paths met. Sitting by the fire they strummed tunes and sang classic blues songs into the night.

It was midnight and they were still playing when things changed. The fire grew especially dim and they heard the sounds of foot steps approach their spot.

Figuring it was one of the order they continued on as the person approached. It was an elderly white gentlemen wearing a fine suit and tie. On this early day of the month of July he struck a chord as they realized the song they were singing.

Harry breathed out the lyrics as he looked at this stranger. Suddenly aware of the stories sung by blues singers.

It was midnight on something that could be considered a cross roads. They were two musicians playing music in a cross roads at midnight.

Gulping he sung the next line.

"The devil wears a suit and tie"

The man smiled as he looked at the two wizards playing music this late at night.

"Well what a wonderful talent you boys have. As Mr. Dumbledore is so fond of saying, music has a magic all of its own."

Sirius had put the pieces together and desperately hoped they made it out of this mostly intact.

Harry nodded and then remembered his manners. No matter if it was the devil himself or not his relatives had made sure he understood his manners.

"Could I offer you a butterbeer sir?"

Harry stretched out his arm offering said bottle to the man.

The man smiled and took the bottle from the young wizard.

"I thank you young sir, it's not often I find such hospitality this late into the night."

Harry shrugged and shook his head.

"Manners are important sir. Pardon me as well." Reaching out his hand again he offered it. "Harry Potter, and this is my godfather Sirius Black."

Sirius was alarmed at that, giving your name to some of the more primal powers was not a good thing by any measure.

The old man smiled and shook the young man's hand.

"I go by many names young man, though tonight perhaps you could humor an old man and call me Mr. Dawnstar."

Sirius startled at that, it seemed tonight they were playing host to not a devil. No, of course they were playing host to the main man himself. Lucifer had showed up tonight, the First of the Fallen.

The old man pulled out an old battered guitar case and opened it slowly. From within the smooth velvet lined case he withdrew a well aged guitar. Smoothed over with the signs of a well used instrument.

Collecting themselves they listened in as he began to strum. After a bit they both joined in. They were lacking compared to the devil of course in skill. But still they soon found themselves playing and singing along easily enough.

The music flowed through the night time air as they played. Songs of choice and loss, songs of family and love, songs of a simpler time long forgotten.

As dawn broke over the garden the song trailed off into the early morning light as they finished playing.

The old man smiled in enjoyment. The two wizards had been on edge at first but they had soon let it go and simply lived in the moment of the music as they all played together.

Putting his guitar away he looked at the two wizards and made a decision. He had come to this little crossroads out of idle curiosity at first. He had stayed to see the wizards shift about at first. Then he had genuinely enjoyed himself soon enough.

He was no longer the same as he had been all those eons ago when he had rebelled against father. With the passing of time he had grown to see what his father had seen that first time.

Humans were unique and their gift of choice was truly special. He had given up personally tempting them with choice many years ago.

Now he enjoyed seeing humans live their life full of choices and what they would do with them.

Even he had found choices in his existence after spending so much time with the mortals.

So he made a choice now as the ray's of dawn washed over them.

Smiling he reached out and took the hands of the wizards.

"What an ungracious guest I have been not even bringing a gift to this fine meeting."

Sirius narrowed his eyes in thought. Here was the moment he had been worried about. Powers great as the one before him rarely interacted with mortals without leaving something behind.

The only question was what it would be this time. Boon, bane, both or something entirely different he had no idea but knew he would find out soon enough.

"Young man, you truly have a gift for singing songs that *speak* directly to the heart. Do keep it up, I expect wonderful things from you in the future."

Harry smiled and firmly held the handshake. The night with the old man had been a pleasure. The songs sung still lingered in his heart and filled him with something special.

A heart filled with love of family, fierce acceptance of life's woes, and a resolve to weather the storms of life.

Reaching over the old man shook the hand of Sirius and smiled a sad smile.

"You are a man lost in the sea of time drifting about looking for home. I am sure you will *see* the shore soon enough."

Sirius finished the handshake and thanked the man for his kind words. As the old man turned to leave he stopped as Harry spoke up.

"It was nice singing with you tonight sir. Perhaps we could do this again next summer?"

The old man stopped and turned back slightly. Tilting his head he let a smile grace his face.

"Young man, that sounds rather nice. Perhaps we will meet again next summer."

With that the old man walked away, disappearing around the corner.

The two wizards looked at one another and shrugged. It had been a long night though neither of them found themselves tired in the slightest.

They packed up with own guitars and made their way out of the garden into the house.

What had they been gifted this night? A boon, a bane, or something else perhaps? Only time would tell.
