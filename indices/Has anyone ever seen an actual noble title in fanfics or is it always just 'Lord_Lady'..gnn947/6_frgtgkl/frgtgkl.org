After searching for references for you, I find myself glad that most fanfic authors stick with earls and dukes, because searching for Baron nets far too many hits for the Bloody Baron.

In the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]], the Queen bestows/recognizes several magical-only titles in the proper format. One of the things I like about this particular one is that not everybody is an earl or duke; there's a range of ranks. The Blacks are the magical descendents of The Black Prince, Edward Duke of Cornwall; Sirius would be 67th in line to the throne except magicians are barred. Sirius is named Magical Duke of London County. Harry (now named Nizar through a binding adoption) is named Magical Earl of Old Castleview over Hogwarts and its associated villages. Salazar deSlizarse (you'll have to read it to find out how he's still alive), who already held a Castillian title, is named Magical Marquess of the Highlands, excluding Nizar's lands. Several students whose families once held Muggle titles (lost when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect because titles have to be acknowledged by the Crown) have them reinstated.

  The Queen's words are swift and precise, as if she does this every day: Adele Greenwood regains her family's title and becomes the Lady Adele, Magical Baroness of Greenwood in the Yorkshire Dales; Blaise Zabini becomes the Viscount of Magical Worcester, which held no title for magical nobility in the past; Draco Malfoy regains the Wiltshire title of Baron, becoming Lord Draco of Magical Wiltshire; Daphne Greengrass is named Vidame Daphne of Magical Northumberland, accompanied by a restoration of some of the family's original land that had been swept up by the creation of the national park. Astoria automatically earns the title of Lady Astoria as Daphne's younger sister, which causes Daphne's eyes to widen in surprise. The title of Remus Lupin's mother's line is granted back to him, naming him Baronet over Magical Powys in Wales.
