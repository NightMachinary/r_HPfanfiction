There's a couple that do. Though most are fictitious peerages. In Reboot by Kallanit Hermione's last name is actually Graynge not granger and her father is the Earl of Wolsingham. (Dumbledore had her change to granger to "fit in").

Other stories I've seen sirius referred to as The Earl of Blackmoor.

In the story Harry Potter and the Daft Morons by Sinyk they have the family of Justin Finch-Fletchly being the Earls, Barons Dukes etc of Kendal (which is a real peerage - I believe created for folks close to the royal family).
