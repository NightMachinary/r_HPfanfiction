I've seen a few, but the upper titles are generally from the muggle side. Justin Fitch-Fetchley seems to wind up being the heir to a noble title pretty frequently.

hpffa(The Harem War) Harry is a duke.

hpffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons) Justin Fitch-Fetchley is an earl iirc. His Grandpa is a duke, and part of the royal family.
