This sounds like me. My bookmarks bar is insane. Thank god Chrome will save your bookmarks if you log in - I just got a new computer and wanted to cry thinking about trying to save all those fics. But I didn't have to, in the end :D.

I keep meaning to Google doc them all and save offline copies of my faves but it's just such a massive amount of work I keep putting it off...
