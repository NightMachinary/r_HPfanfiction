I download everything that sounds promising or that I liked. I then sort the epub-files in categories based on era (Canon, Marauders and Next gen) and, if I have enough stories to fill a subcategory, in subcategories. I prefer to read on an e-reader, hence all the downloads, but even if I've already read a story online I'll download it if I liked it. I've only started doing this recently, because I hate remembering a fic but not being able to find it again. It's not perfect, but I know that even if I start a file with reviews I'll just abandon that after a while because I get lazy.
