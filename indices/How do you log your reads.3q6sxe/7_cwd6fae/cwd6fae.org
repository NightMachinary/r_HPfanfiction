Making use of a spreadsheet or downloading everything you read and keeping an archive seems like the way to go.

That said, I am lazy so I just use bookmarks. Firefox has a neat bookmark sidebar that allows to search for something you have already read, and it gets even better with an addon that has a 'find target' function. (It basically shows you the exact spot of that bookmark you just searched within its folder, which is really helpful if your folders are as large as mine.)
