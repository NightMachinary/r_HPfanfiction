I keep a word doc, just with the pertinent details and links of each fic, and I download stories as well. Recently I've decided a word doc isn't ideal and I'm converting my list to excel, with a few extra details and an "out of 5 stars" rating. (I really, really suck at reviewing things, so a star rating is the best I can do.) I'm logging them on delicious as well to have an online bookmark archive, but as I'm re-reading things in the process of doing this it's a bit slow going so my word doc is still the primary log.
