I like the ones where I get to hear the person's thoughts and they ramble on why they liked something or why they hated something and I actually understand /why/. I also like hearing their favorite parts and its especially better if they quote sentences from the story. Ones that take the time to thank the author for updating is really nice too.

I don't like reviews that are just like "pls update!" when I just updated two hours ago and update frequently because it feels so demanding. I mean Im glad you're eager, but telling me to update when I just did isn't really that fun to hear.. I /do. have a life you know.
