I like rambling reviews that tell me weird crap about what my story made the reader think. The ones that wander on for paragraphs about how in the reader's childhood, they heard an adult say something, and how paragraph two of chapter two reminded them of that. You know, the ones where you sit there and go, "I just impacted this person's life. Dang."

I used to have a fic up about Ginny after CoS which implied TMR had been a sexual predator, and had basically spent the year grooming Ginny, and now she was trying to cope with the aftermath. Got some rather heartbreaking reviews from a few women saying they'd done similiar things to get past similiar times. They said they felt like they were not alone from reading it, which made me pretty happy that I could help. Those were probably my all-time favorite reviews.
