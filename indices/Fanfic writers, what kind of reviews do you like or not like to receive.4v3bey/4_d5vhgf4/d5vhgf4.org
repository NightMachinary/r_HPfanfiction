If it's positive, I have no criteria. Maybe someone reads this stuff to clear their mind from a bad day, and a "nice" is really all they have left to give. I feel like I don't really have strong feelings yet about my reviews, but when I am a reader, and I see a review that argues the reviewer's head canon, or is unkind, or is just wishing the story were a different story, it really annoys me. Honestly, that irritates me more than anything I've gotten for my own writing thus far.
