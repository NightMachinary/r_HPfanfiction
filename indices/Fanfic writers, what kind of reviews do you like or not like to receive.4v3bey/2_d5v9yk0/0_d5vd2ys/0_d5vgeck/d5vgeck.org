That is definitlly a compliment! I've always found it interesting that people associate sexual orientation as such a defining feature to someone's character especially as they're growing up. As a lot of people who identify as something other than straight don't figure it out until they're a bit older than Harry and he himself didn't really have that much experience in romantic love and relationships.
