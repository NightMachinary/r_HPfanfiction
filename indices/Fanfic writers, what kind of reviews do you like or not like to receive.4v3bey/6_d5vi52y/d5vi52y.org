*Positive:* I got a review that said a plot point was "done more skillfully here than by JKR herself, I think". That was really nice to read, although I would definitely not throw something like that around a lot unless you mean it.\\
I also love when someone notices small, subtle hints or analogies I put in thinking nobody would get. That makes me really feel like readers are reading between the lines and thinking about what I write.

*Negative:* I haven't really gotten any negative reviews, but if I had a boggart, it would take the form of a review that told me my ideas were unrealistic or tried to find plot holes. But then again, that's more related to my fear of failing as a writer. Hmmm... other than outright mean reviews, I also wouldn't want to see one that said "so and so isn't gay". If I cared, I wouldn't be writing the story!
