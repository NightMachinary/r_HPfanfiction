I really love Esama's D.S.S Requirement ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346]]). It also has a sequel. It's such a cool idea and I would love to read more.

I also am really loving Relentless, We Survive by Araceil ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710152]]) which is training the DA but very differently. Kinda a crossover with Assassins Creed, and also a Harry/Ron/Hermione ship. It's not complete and hasn't been updated in a year but definitely worth a read.
