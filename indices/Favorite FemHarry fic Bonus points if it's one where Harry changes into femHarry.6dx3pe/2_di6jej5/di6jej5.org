There's really nothing on the level of linkffn(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn). If you've ever partaken in illicit substances and you had a situation where your brain was literally a lake of dopamine... well that's what this story does to me.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is also quite good.
