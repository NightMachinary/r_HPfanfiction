There's a writer called Antosha who put out some steamy stories, but they are limited to registered readers. Worth a look (and the registration).

When I have a yen for these types of stories, I usually search for likely pairings- Hermione/Fleur, Hermione/Pansy, Hermione/Luna (sensing a trend yet?). The problem is that these rarely include anything more than the romance and some associated angst to drive the main character outside of her usual thought patterns.

(A Butterfly Effect is a good rec that goes beyond the usual fulfillment scenario)
