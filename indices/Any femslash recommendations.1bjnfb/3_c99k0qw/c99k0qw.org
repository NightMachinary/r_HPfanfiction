[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8587736/1/In-The-Long-Run][In The Long Run]], HG/GW. It's one I'm reading at the moment, unfortunately it's not updated very often.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound_With_Silver_Threads][Bound With Silver Threads]], LLP/OFC. Been a while since I read this, but I think I liked it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]], HG/GW. A time travel fic that I can definitely recommend.
