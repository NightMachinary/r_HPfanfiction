Important thing about names and nicknames; most of the time, other people name you. The Marauders didn't come up with those names to make them seem cool, mysterious, or powerful. They were taunting each other. Only superheroes and villains get to name themselves (if the press doesn't do it for them), and the cheesiness of that arrangement shows in what they tend to come up with.

Dr. Doom; Lord Voldemort; Madonna.
