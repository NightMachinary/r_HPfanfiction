The only alternative horcrux hunt fic I know of is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux]]

I haven't read it, but it's the same author as "Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion" and "Harry Potter and the Curse of the Damned", which are major classics in HP canon-compliant fanon. I remember they were the first fanfics I ever read, back in 2005.
