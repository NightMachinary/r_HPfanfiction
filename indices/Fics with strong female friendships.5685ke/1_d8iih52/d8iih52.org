Linkffn(Yule ball panic by philosophize) and the sequels are femharry/Hermione fic that'll fit the bill. I find the whole thing a little preachy, and there's a lot of telling-over-showing, but it focuses a lot on Jasmine and Hermione's relationship, their friendship with the delicious, feminism and women's magic in general. It's not quite finished, but the author updates every week and is almost done.

I also can't leave without posting linkffn(Weasley girl by hyaroo). The friendship between fem!Ron and Hermione is great.
