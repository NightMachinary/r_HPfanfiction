Well, the best fic that I could think of was /Faith and Understanding./ Sadly, it has been taken down, but it was wonderful, chronicling the friendship of Ginny and Luna.

Ginny and Luna meet on the Hogwarts Express. Luna's reading /The Quibbler/ and mentions that above all else, she values honesty. They study together and sit next to each other in class. Ginny sticks up for Luna when she's bullied. Luna spends time at the Burrow one summer. They drive each other crazy. Ginny actually coins the term "Loony" but turns it around and uses it as an affectionate nickname.

And the tone...it just worked. Ginny and Luna train for Dumbledore's Army together in one scene, and then sprawl barefoot in the grass to watch the clouds.

To mention a fic that is still intact, /A Night Without Stars/ is fairly solid.

There's also /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ Luna's point-of-view of Order of the Phoenix. Considering it was written before Half-Blood Prince was even published, it holds up very well. While it's Luna-centric, her friendship with Ginny is an important sub-plot, the idea of friendship itself is foreign to Luna.
