There are plenty of "powerful!harry-gets-training-from-dumbledore/secret-organization-and-at-least-1-or-2-girlfriends" fic out there.

You need to look for the older fic's, the ones that were written before book 4 came out. OBHWF (one big happy weasley family) fic, Harry and company go back in time and meet the founders, Harry lives with Sirius after 3rd year, etc.

Hard to pin down, but all easy to find. You just have to be willing to look through a lot of crap if you are trying to find anything on FFN, I'd suggest checking out a few different stories on fanficauthors.net, most have descriptions that are easy to interpret, and you can tell by the publish dates when they were started. Look for fic that were first published pre-2000
