Any such trials would likely lead nowhere regardless of which side is on the offensive.

In order for Harry to be charged, he'd have to be extradited to the Goblin nation and be charged by them. Not happening considering his position after the war.

Goblins would only be able to do that if they went to war with the Wizards over it. Which they might very well do if they think they can win.

Harry isn't going to be able to counter charge Gringotts for war crimes without going to war with them either. That's how war crimes work after all. Sure you can charge them, but you can't actually do anything with said charges unless you beat their nation into submission in a war.
