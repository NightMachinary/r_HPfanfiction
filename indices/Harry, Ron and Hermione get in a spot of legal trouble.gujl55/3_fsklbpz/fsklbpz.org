Let me see if I can convey how I imagine this going:

Harry chugs veritaserum and takes a seat in the witness chair "Oh gee, you see, we'd discovered Voldemort created a number of artifacts to prevent himself from getting killed. One of them was entrusted to Bellatrix Lestrange, who stored it in her Gringotts vault. So! We devised a way to get it out and destroy it. After bribing one of the goblins, we infiltrated the bank, while being hunted by the corrupt government at the time, might I add, penetrated the vault's defenses, and retrieved the object we came for. At that point the goblin we bribed betrayed us. He prematurely took the payment promised to him and immediately alerted the guards to our presence. The guards, naturally, swarmed our position where we had to fight them off for a time. Ultimately we made our escape by stealing one of their guard dragons, enlarging the passage tunnels, and flying away."

Let me point out exactly what this says:

- Gringotts security, at an all-time high, couldn't deter three teenagers
- The Gringotts vault of a VIP couldn't deter /three teenagers/\\
- The full Gringotts security team /couldn't capture three teenagers/
- A dragon, that was being used as a security measure on the vault, /got stolen by three teenagers/
- A goblin was bribed, took the bribe, and immediately betrayed the people who bribed him (/goblins aren't trustworthy enough to be corrupt/)
- *Gringotts was aiding the Dark Lord*

I mean, of course you have the whole "disliked minority vs beloved national hero" angle, but event without that, when presented with the facts of the incident, the goblins look nothing short of greedy, untrustworthy, malicious, and incompetent. I believe anyone with an ounce of sense would try to bury the incident, rather than bring attention to it. Could you imagine how the goblins would react, when asked whether this is an accurate summation of events "Uh... no?"
