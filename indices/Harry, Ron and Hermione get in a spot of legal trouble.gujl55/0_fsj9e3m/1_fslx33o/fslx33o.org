This wouldn't work out how Harry would want it to. The Goblins practiced neutrality, at least from their perspective.

Being a criminal isn't grounds for a bank to terminate their business with you. Indeed, being a criminal, even one who has been arrested, charged and sent to jail, does not void your financial responsibilities, such as loans, rents etc.

While the creation of a Horcruxe may be illegal, the possession of one surely isn't. After all, numerous characters from the good side have possession of them for prolonged periods and no one assumes they're breaking the law by doing so. So you couldn't claim that Gringotts was harbouring an illegal item.

You could potentially get Gringotts on allowing for transactions to occur that are of a criminal nature, such as bribes, but you'd have to prove that Gringotts was aware that this money was being used for that purpose at that time. If you can prove that they later discovered (prior to the charges being levied) the true nature of these transactions, and didn't inform the government and terminate the offenders accounts, that they were participating in illegal activity.

That being said, I'm fairly sure that Gringotts is also its own nation with its own laws and treaties with the Wizarding governments, and that the banks are not on Wizarding Government lands, but rather are on Goblin lands. They may not actually have a law in their own government that mandates they do something like this.

At this point you'd have to try and levy war crimes on the Goblin government itself, and history has shown us that the only path this leads to is either:

A. War

B. All governments ignore it like it never happened and media forgets about it too

On this note, do the Goblins even have extradition laws with the wizards? Because if not a death eater could just sit on their land and the good guys wouldn't be able to do anything.

And on THAT note, if extradition laws do exist, and if this went to a trial, Gringotts are going to immediately do a quid pro and ask why Harry and his friends aren't being handed over to the Goblin government to be charged for having broken into a foreign governments building and stolen from it, as well as destroyed much of its property, endangering the lives of Goblin citizens and impersonating someone to gain illegal access to their bank accounts.

The point I'm making is, at best, such a trial will go on for ages and lead nowhere, at worst, you end up with an international war on your hands that is far worse than Voldemorts little war.
