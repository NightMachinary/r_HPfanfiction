Well, you need to explain why the Ministry doesn't laugh in the goblins' faces (or worse) for daring to go after the three war heroes. Perhaps using the ICW as a way to put pressure on the new Ministry? Making Gringotts powerful enough to take on the Ministry would probably be going too far ad make people ask why there's not a new goblin rebellion instead, and turning the Ministry against the trio seems a sure way to drive them into another war against the Boy-Who-Lived and his many friends.
