If they are strong enough to get their way by force (or think so), then the trial is pretty much just a farce, though.

In any case, I think it's more important to decide just what laws apply in the actual trial, and if individuals fighting in a war are actually responsible, if the Ministry pardonning them is a valid defence, if Gringotts cooperating with Voldemort negates their claims against the trio, if the dragons were legally kept in the first place, or mistreated, and whether or not a Death Eater vault hiding a Horcrux is a legitimate target in a war. Much of that depends on whether Gringotts is extraterritorial, or part of Wizarding Britain.
