Making things even more complicated are sites like AO3, which suggest that people who are not the original authors post properly cited stories that have disappeared from other locations on the internet. Also not sure how I feel about that.

In my experience, big, popular stories often disappear when the people behind them get publishing deals for other, original fiction pieces, and then start trying to "sanitize" their writing history. Might not be what happened here, but I've seen it before.
