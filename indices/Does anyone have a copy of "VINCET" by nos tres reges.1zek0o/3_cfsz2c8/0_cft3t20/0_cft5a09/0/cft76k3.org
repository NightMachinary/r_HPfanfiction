That's not true in the case of Fettucini/Oblong/MrJoe/SerpentSannin. Supposedly, if one is to believe the comments he made on DLP at the time, he was accepted into a university writing program and decided to rid himself of "childish distractions" like writing fanfiction. Granted, he was a narcissist who changed his stories about as often as he did his monikers, but these comments were made concomitant with his leaving fanfiction and removing his last story.

Several fanfiction writers out there have published professionally or semi-professionally (joe6991, jbern, Perspicacity, hgfan1111, Cassandra Claire, to name a few). Only a couple of them have bothered removing their fanfiction from the interwebs. Publishers appear a lot less anal about it nowadays and many like how popular fanfiction authors come with their own fanbase numbering in the several thousands, with a ready means of marketing.
