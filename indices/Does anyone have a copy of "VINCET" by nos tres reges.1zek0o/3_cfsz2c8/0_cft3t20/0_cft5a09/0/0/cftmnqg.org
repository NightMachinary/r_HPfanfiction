Cassandra Claire removed her works because:

A. Some of them are NC.17. Authors don't usually want that on their track record. Slightly ironic because her RonxGinny fic title ended up being used for her Draco Trilogy !realfic adaption (like Master of the Universe to 50 shades of grey).

B. The Draco Trilogy is a mass of plagiarism

C. TDT is reused heavily for TMI (first 3 books) and TID. Characters, general gist, important plot points, the entire falcon scene in City of Glass. The later 2 started developing its own plot though.
