It appears that Nos Tres Reges has chosen to erase themselves from the world of fanfiction. Their account has been renamed Deleted00000001 and the related Twitter page is no longer extant.

I'm not sure how I feel about that- on one hand, a person should have the right to a clean slate and control of their intellectual property, in as much as they can claim any ownership for a derivative work. On the other, the stories, having been shared, are now a part of the life and experiences of many others along with the author(s), so removing them seems selfish, especially since it costs them nothing for the stories to continue existing.
