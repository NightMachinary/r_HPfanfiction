Just trying to put a critical eye on the analytics- the intent and presentation was very cool. Also I'm jazzed that you referred interested parties to Cauterize, as that's the fic I recommend as a fanfiction entry point.

If you choose to re-run the query, it might be effective to select from stories with most hits, but that's a hidden value and it favors those stories posted earlier. Whatever you do choose, though, I think it's important to include your details in the article or a reference doc for those wanting to understand the scope of the analysis.
