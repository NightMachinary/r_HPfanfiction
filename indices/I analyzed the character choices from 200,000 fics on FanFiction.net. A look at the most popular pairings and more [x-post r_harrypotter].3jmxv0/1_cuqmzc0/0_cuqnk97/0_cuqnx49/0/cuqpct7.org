No I welcome any technical questions. I think it's very important. I can't tell you how many times I've looked at posts on [[/r/DataIsBeautiful]] and wondered how the data was actually collected.

I'd definitely be interested in looking at hits. Can you sort by it with the right page request? Or would I have to request it for each fic individually?
