Analysis and statistics is always a game of choices, so i had a few thoughts about your choices in the analysis.

1 - 200,000 HP fanfics analyzed: how did you filter this down? Did you only include stories in English or skip those with an 'M' rating or ones with less than 500 words? What was the filter?

2 - Counting the number of characters listed will give you a false bias. The fanfiction.net engine only allowed two characters to be listed until a few years ago, and they added the bracket for pairing later as well. Many of the secondary characters weren't available until recently, so stories made before the change with ex.: Harry/Daphne had no recourse but to list Harry/OC or Harry alone.
