Forever knight on portkey. My favorite harmony story. Starts really fluffy but decends into a wonderful world of darkness. The prologue is great and on rereads, i normally start at that point in the story. Its is beautiful. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]
