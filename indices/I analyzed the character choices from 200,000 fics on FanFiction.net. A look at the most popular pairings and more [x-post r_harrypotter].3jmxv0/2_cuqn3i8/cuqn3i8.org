Draco's popularity is expected, but who the hell writes this much James/Lily? May be it is because I avoid Marauder era fanfics for most part, but I had no idea the pairing was so popular.

Also, did not expect this much Ron/Hermione. More than Harry/Ginny even, which was definitely unexpected. It seems that I might have to branch out a bit more.
