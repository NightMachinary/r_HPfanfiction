  After a tumultuous Fifth Year for the Golden Trio, Dumbledore agrees to give them access to Order information. With that, Hermione is given an assignment---to be the handler for a secret faction of the Order that is comprised completely of Slytherins. This is the story of how---instead of blindly rejecting all Slytherins as a lost cause---Dumbledore went out of his way to bring them in from the dark, and how the brightest witch of her age took them to new heights. Full disclosure, I still don't know who's ending up with who. Sorry in advance.

  "All her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope."(From 'The Rainbow', D.H. Lawrence)It was definitely the worst of times. Follow Hermione as she navigates through the quagmire: saving the world, getting top grades, falling in love, lust, and a whole lot of trouble; and comes out of it hopefully at least partially sane
