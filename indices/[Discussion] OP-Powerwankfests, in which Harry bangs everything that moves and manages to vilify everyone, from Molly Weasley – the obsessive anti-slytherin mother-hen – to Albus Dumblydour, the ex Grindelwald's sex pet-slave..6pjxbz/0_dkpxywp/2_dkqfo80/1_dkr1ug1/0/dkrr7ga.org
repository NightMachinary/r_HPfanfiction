Well, if you want prose that evokes powerful imagery and is poetic, check out Charity, Thou Art A Lie, linkao3(9496913). If the idea of the fic itself squicks you out or doesn't sound interesting, just read the last chapter and skip the rest. It's a great example of the writer's prose without including any of the parts of the fic that would bother people. To be completely upfront, it's a fem!Harry / Voldemort pairing and there is some non-con in the 2nd work of the series.

If you want something that is emotionally evocative, I would check out Session Transcripts, linkao3(270848), while I personally related a lot of Hermes, I think anyone with an ounce of empathy would care for Harry in this story. I read it in one sitting and cried more than once.

For a one-shot, check out The Girl Who Lived (Again) linkao3(7900501), it features a trans!Harry and gives a powerful view into the life of a transgender person. When she asked Sirius how her parents would see her I sobbed.

If it isn't clear from my recommendations, yes I'm trans lol, but these stories are good examples of writing skill regardless.

If you want something (almost) canon-compliant, try a life of smoke and silvered glass linkao3(11457669), the only big difference is that Snape apologizes to Lily later and this affects his opinion of Harry, even if it doesn't affect his actions. It's basically a retelling of canon from the perspective of a Snape who doesn't hate Harry for his father and instead loves him for his mother. I think this fic in particular is noteworthy because if I remember correctly the author was not a big fan of Snape before writing this, so it's an interesting spin on a redeemable Snape.
