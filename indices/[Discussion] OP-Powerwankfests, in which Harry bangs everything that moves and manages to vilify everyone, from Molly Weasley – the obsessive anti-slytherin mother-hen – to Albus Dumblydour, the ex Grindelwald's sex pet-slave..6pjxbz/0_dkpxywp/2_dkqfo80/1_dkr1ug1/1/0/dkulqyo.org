In this case, it may very well be taste. I've read most of what you listed (only one I haven't is ffnbot!slim(The Prisoner's Cipher) and ffnbot!slim(What Lies Beneath) - and maybe ffnbot!slim(The Accidental Horcrux)? They sound familiar but I don't remember reading them) and I wouldn't rate any of them higher than SoH, at least for me.

Reasoning: Firstly, for SoH, I don't mind the angst. As I remember it, the second half of canon (book 4.5ish onwards) is pretty damn angsty and having read it as a teenager, I identified with that. So even while my angst tolerance is a lot lower nowadays, it feels in line with canon. Don't remember there being that much telling, so I'll need to go back and reexamine that, as I feel sensitive to that issue nowadays.

For the others:

-I found ffnbot!slim(Circular Reasoning) interesting, but read it way back (2ish years ago) and have never felt compelled to read it again. I felt like the story was going nowhere and Harry wasn't really changing as a result of being sent back. While that might be a realistic portrayal of what happens to someone like him getting a second chance, it wasn't interesting to read.

-It's been a while since I read ffnbot!slim(A Study in Magic), so I'll go back and read it again soon, but it doesn't stand out in my memory especially. I think I had trouble connecting to the characters? Will edit once I can provide more info.

-ffnbot!slim(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is awesome, no dispute there, but it didn't hit me in the feels like SoH. I read it much, much later though, so maybe I hit a saturation point on favorite fanfics?

-ffnbot!slim(Back Again, Harry?) is probably the most readable TT story I can think of (besides ffnbot!slim(The Unforgiving Minute), but it's a one-shot and different from most TT due to the time constraint) and I very much enjoy it, but I don't remember loving it in the same way as I do some other fics, SoH included.

TL;DR: Ya, it's probably just taste. I think* that once a work hits a certain level of technical quality (not breaking basic writing rules), whether it's well-written gets a lot harder to define, because the format of the writing starts to blend with the content and depending on how you like the content, that may affect your analysis of the writing.

*As someone without an English or writing degree. I'm sure if I had more exposure to the rules of writing, there's more classification on the technical side.

Double Edit: Forgot to mention ffnbot!slim(What You Leave Behind), which is in fact stupendous, and perhaps higher than SoH in my rankings.
