Just wanted to update and say thanks for suggesting Accidental Horcrux. I had NOT read it and boy was it great. I'm eagerly awaiting the next update to Chrysalis now.

I also had NOT read A Study in Magic, and stuck with it for a while, but I gave up when it got to fourth year and the author was stealing dialogue and description straight from the books AND putting it into OC's mouths instead. I can handle some canon rehashing, but that was egregious.
