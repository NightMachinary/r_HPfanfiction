Apologies for the delay, haven't been reading much lately. I just finished linkffn(Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is) which I thought was just okay. Probably won't read it again. I like to try recently updated fics, so I gave linkffn(The Bond of the Orphans) a try: first few chapters seemed alright, but then it got really OC heavy and I found it very tiresome. Would not recommend.

I would recommend linkffn(The Phoenix and The Serpent) though; this isn't a fic I see rec'd very often, probably because it's real old. It's very AU because it was started before OotP was released, but it's very well done. It introduces an OC antagonist who's got a rivalry with Moody, with an excellent battle between the two. It also manages to have a "Power He Knows Not" that is diametrically opposed to Voldemort's abilities and believable for Harry to learn in the time frame. This is probably even with What You Leave Behind for how much I want an update, but the author hasn't been active for years, while I know Newcomb still shows up on this subreddit at least sometimes.
