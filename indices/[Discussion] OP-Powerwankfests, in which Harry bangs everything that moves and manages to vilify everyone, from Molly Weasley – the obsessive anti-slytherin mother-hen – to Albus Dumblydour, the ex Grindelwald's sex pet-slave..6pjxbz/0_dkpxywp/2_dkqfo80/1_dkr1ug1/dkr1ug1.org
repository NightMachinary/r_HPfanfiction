Curious (not trying to be rude), could you list some fics that you'd consider better written than SoH? I still view it as superb, even after having been reading FF heavily for a couple years now (though it's hard to say if that's the writing or just when I was introduced to it), so I'd be interested to see if it's just a taste difference or if there's something I'm not seeing about the fic.
