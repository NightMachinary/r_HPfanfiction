While many of the issues can be attributed to angst many of the things you find incomprehensible can also be attributed to a lack of command over the language.

Not every fic is written by a native English speaker. With many of those you don't even notice that they aren't written by one (linkffn(Stages of Hope)), but with others you notice it pretty fast.

Also most authors of fanfiction are amateurs. Writing is a skill that takes practice - a skill amateurs are less likely to have. And even with some practice you often find errors only after going through the document 4-5 times. This process isn't enjoyable as it is very technical compared to the creative flow of writing forward.

This also leads to many plotholes, becauese ideas always sound better in your head than on paper.

So a lot of what you said can be attributed to "lack of investment into the editing process" - the tedious and boring part of writing - yet one of the most important ones.
