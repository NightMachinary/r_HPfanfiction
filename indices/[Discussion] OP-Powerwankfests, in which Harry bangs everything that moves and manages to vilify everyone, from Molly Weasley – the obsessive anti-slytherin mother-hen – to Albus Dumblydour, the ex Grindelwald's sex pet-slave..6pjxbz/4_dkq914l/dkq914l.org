What turns me off the most is when people whitewash Death Eaters and obvious evil aspects of Wizarding Britain. Reading drivel that's effectively "the KKK has a point" and "slavery is not evil if the slaves are not white" makes me sick.

With regards to canon, don't fall into the stupidity of worshipping it. Too many here are unable or unwilling to admit that canon is not perfect. JKR all too often treats her characters as plot devices, who act as the plot demands, not as their character would. Try to take the characters as they are described, and go from there - don't look at their actions in the books to form the characters, since those actions are often OOC.
