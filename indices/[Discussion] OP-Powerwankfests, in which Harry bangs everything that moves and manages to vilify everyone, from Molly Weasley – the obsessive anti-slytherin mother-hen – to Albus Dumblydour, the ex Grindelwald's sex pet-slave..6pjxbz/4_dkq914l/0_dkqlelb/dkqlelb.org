Yeah, there is "viewing things from another side" (and using shades of grey instead of JKR's often unintentional black and white) and then there is wanky-devils-advocate. I enjoy stories where villains are shown as people instead of presented as cardboard cutout monsters (ie: Lucius Malfoy was a DE, but he also loved and cared for his son and wife very much), and I also enjoy stories where the heroes are not saints (ie: Hermione wiped her parents' memories without their permission and sent them away, removing their agency and potentially fucking up their minds permanently). I like complex characters and difficult choices.
