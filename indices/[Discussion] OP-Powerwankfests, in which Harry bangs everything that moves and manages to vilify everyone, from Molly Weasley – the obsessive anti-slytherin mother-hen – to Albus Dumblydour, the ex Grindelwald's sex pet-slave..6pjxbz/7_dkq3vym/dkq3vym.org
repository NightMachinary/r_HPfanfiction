The problem is Anime. This is a trope commonly found in shit-tier anime that many people watch for wish-fulfillment which was in turn based off of a light novel that the writer wrote as wish-fulfillment. The only problem is, those shit-tier animes build their own world, in which the Power scale can be reasonably tipped, etc... for the main character to be both weak and powerful. In the Potterverse, Harry who has some kinda hidden OP Magus Golden God Power will have a hard time seeing a challenge in any enemy that doesn't equal him in terms of power. So, short of Yahweh himself, you gotta make Voldemort equally as powerful. But the authors don't like seeing Harry lose at all, so he is probably going to win any battles with minimal tactical use of Magic and minimal intelligence. Despite us all hearing, it banged into the back of our heads that HE IS Intelligent and OP Prodigy at Magic. We rarely see any fields of Magic in use other than Curses and Hexes and whatever Eldrich Abomination Field of Magic 'Dick Increasing Spells' and 'Avada Kedavra surviving shields" fall under.

I would be able to handle it all, but Harry doesn't even go into depths why someone is the 'love of his life' normally only being the girl that shows emotion and Harry saying something idiotic or useless.
