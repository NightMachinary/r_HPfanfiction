Harry with a lightsaber (figratively or literally) is still outclassed by Voldemort. You'd still have to glue an idiot ball to Voldemort, as happened in canon, for Harry to win. You could boost Harry massively, and all you'd need to do to compensate is to make Voldemort act a bit less stupidly, and things would be even. People don't really seem to realise just how contrived the original plot was.
