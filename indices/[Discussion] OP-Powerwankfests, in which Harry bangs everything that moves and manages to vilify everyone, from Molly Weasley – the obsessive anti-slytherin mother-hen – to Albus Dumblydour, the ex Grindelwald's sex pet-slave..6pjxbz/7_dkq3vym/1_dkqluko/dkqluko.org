I don't think the problem is power levels and magic cores, per se. Rather, as you mentioned, it's that authors seem incapable or unwilling (or both) to balance things out so as to still create realistic conflict and tension. Or to put it in simple terms, if you give Harry a lightsaber, you must give Voldemort the Death Star. If Harry has a magical core of 9000, Voldemort better be at least two orders of magnitude above (in the beginning).

For example, in spite of all of its other flaws (e.g. the author peddling his transhumanist philosophy at every turn), Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality did this very well: it made Harry a genius, but Dumbledore and Quirrelmort were no less intelligent, in fact outwitting him on several occasions.

Completely agreed on the problem of god-like Harry's relationships---it is never quite explained exactly what this newly-minted demigod sees in those mere mortal 2-D cutouts of girl characters. Then again, I think writing romance is much more difficult than basic action and adventure, so to expect them to get this part right is really to expect running before walking has been mastered.
