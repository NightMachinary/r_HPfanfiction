They can honestly be fun, in the right mindset. You know its trash, I know its trash, everyone knows its trash. But so is Transformers and people still watched the shit outta that. Sometimes you just want trash.

- Harry Potter isn't an Anime or Manga. No Magical Cores or other such powerlevel nonsense.

- General writing advice: Plot out your story before you begin writing it. Its should be finished in your head before you can finish it as a document.

- Be wary of fanon, but not afraid to use it should you feel like it fills a legitimate hole in canon.

- If choosing fanon or canon doesn't make a great significant difference, use canon in order to save yourself the time and lines to explain the fanon.

- Also: Canon needs no long (,or any) explanation. We all read the books.
