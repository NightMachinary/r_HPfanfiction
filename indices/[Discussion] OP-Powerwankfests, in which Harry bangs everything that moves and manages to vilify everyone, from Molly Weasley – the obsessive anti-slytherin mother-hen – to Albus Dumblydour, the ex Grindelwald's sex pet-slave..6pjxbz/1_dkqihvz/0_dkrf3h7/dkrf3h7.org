I failed to plot the story before writing with a story I started. After 40k words, I found the plot was too complex and not going anywhere. I discontinued it for that reason.

A seconday advice, make a summary of the plot and look for anything that can be cut away without removing anything significant. A second tip, repeat yourself but don't repeat yourself in the same way. Refer back to previous events and foreshadow future events.
