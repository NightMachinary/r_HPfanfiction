I'll agree that there is a lot of confusion about magical law enforcement. We know about 3 groups (that might actually be two groups?):

1. Magical Law Enforcement Squad - Fudge mentions that “no one but Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad” (paraphrased) could have brought in Sirius Black in /Prisoner of Azkaban./

2. Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - Arthur mentions them as being the group responsible for dealing with the culprit in the regurgitating toilets in Bethnal Green issue in /Order of the Phoenix./

3. The Auror Office - Mentioned first in /Goblet of Fire/ in relation to Moody, they specialize in apprehending dark wizards and witches, as well as bodyguard duty for high profile magical and muggle officials.

Honestly, it feels like JKR wanted a title more special than Hit Wizards (maybe because of the negative connotation of “hit men”?) for Moody and wound up, as per usual, creating a jumbled mess.
