We hear of three branches of law enforcement empowered to make arrests: Aurors, Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, and Hit Wizards. Possibly a fourth with Dementors, who are specifically prison guards but also used for apprehending escaped convicts.

Aurors we see the most of- they seem to be a combination of VP bodyguards (Harry, the Muggle Minister, the Minister for Magic), spies (Dawlish is sent to tail Dumbledore, Kingsley works undercover), and counterterrorism. In real world terms, they're like a hybrid of the Secret Service, FBI (especially the counterterrorism divisions) and SWATT. Or maybe the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted police), who act as a Federal police force, security for the PM, and as cops for rural areas and such without their own police force. Given the elite training they reportedly undergo, however, and the small size of magical society, there are probably not a lot of them- the dozen or so referenced in canon might be the entire British force for that time period.

Magical Law Enforcement Patrol are, as per Arthur Weasley, used to arrest more minor offenders, petty criminals. They'd likely be analogous to beat cops, more numerous than the Aurors, but not as well trained, and not up to telling with the most dangerous violent offenders.

The Hit Wizards are mentioned only once to my recollection, in the context of Sirius's capture. My headcanon for them is that they were something that was created specifically for the war with Voldemort, and disbanded upon its conclusion- a unit that wasn't as small or selective as the Aurors, but more empowered to use lethal force to take down Death Eaters, as per the name. A force trained specifically for combat, perhaps, to augment the Aurors' numbers, but without the additional law enforcement, undercover, and investigative training of Aurors. But that's just my guess.
