"Guys, we have a bit of a problem."

"What is it? Did someone use Weasley fireworks in public again?"

"No, they've not been a problem since they added a muggle repelling charm into the explosions. But do you know of this new drug the muggles are using, miraculin?"

"I heard it uses mRNA Crisper or something like that, complicated muggle gene stuff, and cures cancer? Pretty big breakthrough, it was in all the muggle news."

"Yeah, I just ran some tests... The gene stuff in it doesn't actually do anything. There's two potions in it, one that dissolves all of the CRISPR stuff as soon as it detects that it entered a human body and another one that cures cancer."

"So someone's selling potions to muggles? Why didn't we notice this sooner?"

"Whoever did it disguised it really well. If any muggle runs tests on it all they see is a mess of genetic modifiers that somehow works."

"So what do we do, arrest them, obliviate everyone involved and revert what they did?"

"That might not be that practical. As you said, it was in all the news. The entire world knows of it. There have been millions of cases of successful treatment already. We can't really undo that."
