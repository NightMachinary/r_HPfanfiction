I actually had an idea for a story somewhat like this (maybe a crossover with one of Rowlings' non-Potter crime dramas). An Auror saves a Muggle from something (not imminent death, they're allowed to intervene then, but something chronic like drug addiction that is likely to eventually kill them), and Harry as head Auror is forced to discipline them for it, leading to a moral crisis for Harry when the Auror calls him out and resigns in protest. Basically a "what have I become" moment for Harry where he realizes he's grown into a Ministry suit not much different from the guys who followed Fudge and Umbridge's orders.

Also you could write a great courtroom drama in the Wizengamot around this, and I don't think it would be clear cut. IIRC witches and wizards are allowed to break the Statute to save lives (or was that the Reasonable Restriction On Underage Wizardry- well, they're closely-related laws). So the question becomes "What is "saving lives""? You're allowed to break it to stop a Muggle from being soul sucked by a dementor or eaten by a dragon. Are you allowed to break it to prevent a "natural causes" death? What about curing a chronic condition that won't kill them today, but probably will kill them in a month? Or a year? Where is the line?

For extra drama, Harry (as head Auror) is prosecuting the case, and Hermione is the representative for the defense.
