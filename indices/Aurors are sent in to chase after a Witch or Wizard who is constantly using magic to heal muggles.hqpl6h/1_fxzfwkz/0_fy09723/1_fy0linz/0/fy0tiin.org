That would make for a fantastic story, honestly. Turn the Death Eaters and Voldemort into something most people would find positive. Instead of a battle of good versus evil the series becomes a fight over the issue of how to use the gift of magic and what wizards may or may not be obligated to do with their powers.

I'm picturing the purebloods as a group of philanthropic/well-meaning individuals who want the magical community to intervene more in the mundane half of the world. Stopping famines, curing cancer, and solving issues like resource scarcity instead of hiding away in their own little paradise while the muggles suffer. Oh man, a plot like that would need an entire re-imagining of the basic plot and characters, in all honesty. Harry probably wouldn't be an orphan, Tom Riddle / Voldemort probably wouldn't be hated or feared, and the house dynamics at Hogwarts would be radically shifted.
