Yeah, you'd have to change the entire story past, oh, most of book one. There's no way you could make some of the acts we see canon Voldie commit sympathetic.

But as an interesting alt universe story, it could be interesting. As long as it doesn't just turn Dumbledore into the bad guy.

Maybe, to make this Voldemort still have a bit of his arrogant canon self, and make the Ministry/Dumbledore side not completely the bad guys, this Voldemort actually wants to abolish death, make everyone immortal, which would have really serious reprecussions (overpopulation, evil people living forever as well as the good ones, etc). So there is still a genuine reason to oppose him, even though his motives are a lot more sympathetic.
