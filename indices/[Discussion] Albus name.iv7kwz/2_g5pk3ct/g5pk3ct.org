You could try Aeolus instead of Zephyr, but I don't really feel like Ginny would give her kid a complex or very old fashioned name. She seemed to really dislike the name Ginerva.

Alternatives that fit with your theme are:

Neil, Rai, Raiden, Tal, Gale, and Altair

As a completely unrelated option I'd like to suggest Colin.
