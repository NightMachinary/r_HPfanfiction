#+begin_quote
  Seven years after the fall of Voldemort Harry doesn't know what to do with his life. His love life, and everything else, is an absolute mess. Everyone around him seems to be moving ahead with their lives but he isn't moving. Eventually he finds someone to remind him of things he has forgotten and things he treasures. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
