My first exposure to this type was Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer and I loved it because it is a more reasonable start to an independent!Harry universe. Then there is also Dragon Chronicles 2: Harry Potter, Dragon Whisperer (you'll need to read the setup known as DC1 to understand the backstory as to how he got there). Both of these are my favorites, with DC2 being in progress with fairly regular updates.
