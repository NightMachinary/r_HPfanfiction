linkffn(Blood Bound: A Vampire Story by dementor149; Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) are both completed, but neither is really new either. In fact, they're both quite old.

Blood Bound I would say is the better of the two despite its age, but the prose tends to run a little dry for my taste, and the tone is quite depressing throughout. YMMV.

Curse of V'Ardian is a bit difficult to read right at the start but straightens out after a few chapters and is somewhat easier to read. It does have a few unfortunate tropes I won't mention but it's old enough they were frankly new when it was written so it can't really be discounted because of them.

Anyways, cheers.
