Except there are spells that allow a person to alter their physical appearance. Self-Transfiguration for one, would allow you to rearrange your facial features into whatever you wanted (and in fact I feel like one could argue that that's essentially what a Metamorphmagus does, just on an instinctual level); and you could use the Colour Changing Charm to dye your hair, and possibly even alter your eye colour.
