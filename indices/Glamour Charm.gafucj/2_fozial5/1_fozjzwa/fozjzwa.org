I would say that they cover different niches, though. Polyjuice physically turns you into a different person/form - a glamour, in the fanon sense, is just a magical illusion.

Techniques and spells that could detect or ignore magical illusions would not work against Polyjuice, for instance. Glamours would also not change your voice, or other attributes (eg - weight/actual size). There's a lot of other ways in which polyjuice would have an edge over glamours, should they exist.
