And they're so, so, so bad. Robst is not someone who understands how a story flows, or understands how characters work. Like WTF is with his hate boner for Dumbledore? Don't get me wrong, i'm not a big fan of Dumbledore, I think he made stupid choices, and was maybe a little too manipulative, but he was human. He was in general the oldest human in the room, and a war hero who had dealt with previous dark lords. I'd believe I know best in his shoes too. While Harry got royally screwed by Dumbledore's decisions, his decisions did in the end save both Harry's life, and the lives of the british wizarding population.

Dumbledore was not someone who believed Harry should suffer, and he would not pay Ron to be his friend. Basically if you like good Harry Potter stories, don't read robst. If you'd enjoy stories where the character is one dimensional, never wrong, and some badass magical prodigy, read robst.
