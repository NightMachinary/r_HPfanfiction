Yes! Ok, that's what I was trying to say - like I said, I can see him torturing people about big failures - letting Crouch get away? betraying me to the point where only Pettigrew can be bothered to resurrect me? smashing the prophecy from the DOM? Big failures. Telling me that the deli was out of roast beef? Not so much. It's one thing to use heavyhanded crucios to show a descent (further) into madness, but as just part of a normal villain's day - it's weird. Like you say, it's a caricature, not a realistic view of a leader.
