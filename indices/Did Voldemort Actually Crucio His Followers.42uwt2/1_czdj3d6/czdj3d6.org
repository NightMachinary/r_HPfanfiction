When I read canon, i always had the view that voldemort crucioed occasionally, not incessantly. It is his punishment of choice, yes. But he doesn't just do it for kicks and giggles when he is bored, or for minor disappointments.

Pettigrew let crouch escape: that could ruin his resurrection plans, big failure

Graveyard scene: followers denied him, make an example of them so they won't ever do that again

Crucios seen through Harry's connection: the connection is triggered from voldemorts extreme anger for the most part. So obviously those times will be big mistakes by his followers.

Crucios are used to make a point and keep in line, or else people would stop following him willingly. Fics that feature constant Crucios by voldemort bother me, since it doesn't seem realistic. Its a caricature of a dark Lord, not how a brilliant and charismatic evil leader would act
