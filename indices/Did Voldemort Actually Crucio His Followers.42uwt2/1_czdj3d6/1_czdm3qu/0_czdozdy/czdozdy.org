I think it's structured after the nazi elite, many of them were very servile (at least in his presence) towards the FÃ¼hrer.

In my opinion it also fits stupid aristocrats who would like to live in the past, and a world were personal power (with a wand) means much, much more than in the real world.

And I personally think the Death Eaters are in their core followers, not leaders.
