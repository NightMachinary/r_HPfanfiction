Yep, Pettigrew and Avery in GoF, and in DH he commands Draco to Crucio Rowle. In OotP he talks with a trembling Rookwood, and the way Rookwood acts suggests he was either tortured, or expects to be tortured. There might have been more instances that I don't remember, but Voldemort definitely likes to punish his followers for their failure.
