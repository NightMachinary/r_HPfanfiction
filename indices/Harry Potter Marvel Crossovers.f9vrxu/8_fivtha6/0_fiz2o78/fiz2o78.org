I was pretty partial to Finding Home and Steve and the Barkeep. Wasn't a fan of 'Post Apocalyptic Potter' just because... well mostly because Harry was too /nice/. I can't really see him being a random SHIELD agent for years until the Avengers storyline picks up - tbh I kind of expected him to tell them to all bugger off until shit starting hitting the fan lol.

But then again, I couldn't really get into A Third Path to the Future, so.

Say A Prayer and its sequels is a great romp if you can get past the heavy handed crack/bashing of the first installment, but it doesn't really have much to do with the MCU. I really liked it, but it's absolutely not to everyone's taste.
