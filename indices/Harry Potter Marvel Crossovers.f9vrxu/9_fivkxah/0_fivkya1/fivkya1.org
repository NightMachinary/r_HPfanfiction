  Harry doesn't know what's going on, or why he's suddenly having such strange dreams after he turned ten. Maybe he's a freak, after all. Or maybe the world in his dreams is real, and these are memories of a past life. (He'll put off admitting they're real for as long as he can. He no longer wants them to be true.)

  Harry remembers the past...for the most part, but he's still in denial. Into this add the sudden introduction of the Wizarding World, his mother's big secret.... He'll have to build friendships and alliances just to survive the year, because Voldemort isn't dead, and still seeks to regain power. But, hey, at least Harry knows how to fight!(This story follows the plot of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, kind of. Some things go very differently indeed. For instance, this part introduces Thor, in person!)

  It's been over a millennium since Salazar Slytherin left Hogwarts, some sort of legendary monster hidden within the fabled Chamber of Secrets. So, why has the monster awoken now? It has to be because Harry's in attendance here, and he can speak to snakes, right? And a basilisk can't be that hard to defeat, for beings from myths themselves.But that's forgetting that there exist some liars good enough that not even Harry can tell, and then there are pathological ones. Harry's noticing some trends in the sorts of people he keeps encountering. Life likes to keep laughing at him by throwing him in the way of psychopaths and liars, Harry has decided.(This story follows the events of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets fairly well.)

#+begin_quote
  Twelve years ago, James Potter and Lily Evans were forced to go into hiding, and choose a secret keeper for their safe house. They could have chosen Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, or Peter Pettigrew. They did not choose well, and now that history is being dragged into the light for the first time in twelve years, when Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban.Dumbledore has yet to reveal the prophecy that destroyed Harry's family, but he promised that he would, didn't he?Thor has yet to reveal his existence to Harry, thinking that Harry's happier not knowing.Remus Lupin prefers to try to forget that he was ever happy.Well, gentlemen, here it comes:Knowledge is a burden, Dumbledore, but also a gift that can set its recipient free.If you don't tell Harry the truth, Thor, how will he ever trust you?And you can't help Harry without acknowledging the truth of the past, Remus.A choice lies before you:Harry or the world?trust or kindness?hope or despair?The path to each is not always clear, but a choice lies before you. You can only have one. Which one will you take? Choose well.

  Hogwarts will never be a safe place for Harry, but always before it seemed safer than Privet Drive. Now, however, someone (a Death Eater) somehow has entered him into the fabled Triwizard Tournament. To make things worse, their newest ally refuses to share any knowledge as to how this happened (or maybe he doesn't know). Time travel complicates everything, and Harry had enough wild cards in his life before time-traveling sorcerers were thrown into the mix.But hey, he can do what's coming to be what he's best at: plan, wing it, and build alliances so that when the real threat rears its head, they're ready. He just has to last out this war without dying permanently. That should be easy enough, right? All he has to do is survive a Tournament discontinued due to its high death rate amongst "older" wizards, build a network of alliances, and, with his family's help, try to reweave fate to save as many people as possible from the immediate threat.Looks like he won't be making much progress in the quest to find a way to defeat Thanos this year--but hey! At least he gets to bond with his godfather, and uncover even more secrets from the Marauders' past.
