  Harry doesn't know what's going on, or why he's suddenly having such strange dreams after he turned ten. Maybe he's a freak, after all. Or maybe the world in his dreams is real, and these are memories of a past life. (He'll put off admitting they're real for as long as he can. He no longer wants them to be true.)
