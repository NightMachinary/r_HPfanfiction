Usually you'll see Triumph Of These Tired Eyes recommended alongside Child of the Storm, but apparently not today! Of the two, this is the one I prefer by quite a wide margin - it's not nearly as plodding as 'Storm'.

A couple more that haven't been recc'd:

- Great Expectations (part of a series)

- To Ride Upon Svadilfari (abandoned/incomplete but long af. I thought it was okay? I guess?)

- Redemption Songs (on my to-read list)

- Understanding Beyond Words (on my to-read list)
