  A man falls from the sky, and SHIELD is more than happy to help... even if Fury is tempted to shoot him before he manages to make his life more complicated than it already is. Now SHIELD's not quite sure what to do with him; especially when most of their experts claim he should be dead.But then another another turns up... and another, and SHIELD is half wishing they could rescind their offer of 'sanctuary'.Magic users might just be more trouble than they're worth.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  Loki escapes from Asgard during his punishment and finds himself back in New York City where people still remember his face. Well except for one man, who doesn't know of him or the Avengers and has a strange habit of trying to save people who are beyond redemption. Like Loki, Harry has known pain and suffering and was Mother once. Loki now has someone who wants to save him. PostAA

  For two wizards thrown out of their own world and into another Earth populated by superheroes and gods, it looks to be a treacherous ride as they attempt to return home again. But when has the impossible ever stopped Hermione Granger and Harry Potter?
