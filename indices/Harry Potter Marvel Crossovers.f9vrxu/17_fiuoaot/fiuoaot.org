The Stark Truth over on AO3 is pretty good. Kinda dark. Mischief's heir is a fun series also on AO3, not a ton of Marvel crossover until later but loads of Loki. Super fun. And finally Raising a Wizard series on AO3 is another fun one, where Black Widow was actually Lily Potter's kidnapped younger sister, so she raised Harry. It isn't a finished series but it has 3 years of Hogwarts finished already, I think.

By the way, these are all stories where Harry meets the Avengers when young. So, expect altered timelines.
