Warning: stark truth is kinda shit (not surprising from ao3). It's about Harry being raped by his uncle and sold to other men by his uncle. The rape scenes are disturbingly and unnecessarily long.

The rest of the fic is pure angst and what over at ffn.net would be desribed as hurt/comfort. Basically all of the avengers' reactions (horror, anger, a desire for vengeance, Dumbledore knowing about it all, for the greater good blablabla ... very clich√©)

Oh and Harry cuts himself.

I guess this fic is a realistic and horriric representation of real life child rape survival..?

Just a warning for others to know before they get into it. It's not really about the marvel world crossed over into the HP world.

It's also slash main pairings.
