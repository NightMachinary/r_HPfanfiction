Um, canon?

All jokes aside, he was god-like, if irrational and insane in canon. Only Dumbledore could really stand up to him in a straight fight. In the Battle of Hogwarts, he's fighting McGonagall, Shacklebolt, and Slughorn three on one with ease. All three of them are accomplished wizards and witches, and easily in the upper echelon in terms of duelling skill.

He really only died from Dumbledore and Harry taking advantage of his paranoia, irrationality, and power-trips.
