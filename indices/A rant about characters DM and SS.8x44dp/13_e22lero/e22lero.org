We barely see anything of Snape or Draco Malfoy during the story. Their lives are unexplored territory, and they both have interesting enough lives that good fiction can be drawn up from it.

I take "offense" at one point you make:

He was a phenomenal spy. And he put himself in mortal danger for Harry multiple times. He is not a "good" person, but he is not evil, I'd say he's miserable, probably far more suited to being a prodigious hermit who concocts potions and crafts spells than being a school teacher.
