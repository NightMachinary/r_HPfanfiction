"Phenomenal spy"? As in, he remained undetected? (though even that, again, is questionable).

He never really gained much useful information, as far as I remember from the books, at least. He was just... there. Don't get me wrong, he DID help Harry many times, but it was not because of acquired knowledge from his spying. More often than not, it was because he was ordered by Dumbledore or Dumbledore's Portrait.

If anything, it's a question if Voldemort was not the one spying Dumbledore through Snape.
