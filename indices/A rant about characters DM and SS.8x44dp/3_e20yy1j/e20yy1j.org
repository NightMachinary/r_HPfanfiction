In the books, we see things from Harry and Co.'s perspective, and they're children through most of it. If you count the epilogue, Harry considers Snape to be one of the bravest men he ever knew and Draco, though not friends with the Trio, is still formally cordial with them. Snape did what he could out of his love for Lily, as shown by his patronus. Draco, beyond being a giant arse, only tried to do real damage when his family was threatened, and he cried about it in Myrtle's bathroom.

Given that the Wizarding World is highly insular and we are shown it through the wide eyes of a child / teenager being introduced to it in a (mostly) school setting, we can't assume to know the motivations of the characters we don't see explaining themselves. JKR's post-series notes notwithstanding, we have a playground.

As we never see things from their perspectives, it opens the door for authors to come up with backstory and personal lives for them. Many bullies have shitty home lives, so what if Draco has been raised to hate Muggles and Muggleborns by his parents and their friends inside of a completely isolated community and it only continues to be reinforced by Lucius shaming him for Harry out flying him and Hermione out scoring him in grades? He might recognize that there's something potentially wrong with the Muggles Suck theory at this point, but having his nose rubbed into his supposed failures may account for his heightened hostilities. We don't know his thoughts, but we know that based on the Trio's observations he makes himself sick and cries in his attempts to kill Dumbledore for fear of his fucked up family.

Similarly, we know Voldemort is a Crucio happy nutter. Authors like to have Snape get his fair share of torture as it is plausible and have no one to look out for him personally. Having to maintain his cover is another big reason why he's such a cruel man, though he does save them on multiple occasions including placing himself between them and Lupin after he has changed form, which is one of his greater fears.

So you take two characters whose motivations are mostly unknowns but are developed enough to have their behaviours strongly defined and - voila - Byronic heroes! Much more interesting to write about than other underdeveloped characters. I suppose a crackfic about trying to date Seamus and having something explode on every date might be fun, but people like angst, and those two carry the brunt of the angst unless you are drawn to a whiny Harry.
