He did attempt to save Harry from a cursed broom by Quirrell, why wouldn't he try to save him from being bitten/killed by a werewolf? He did make a promise to protect him, I don't think he would break it because of a werewolf.

Granted that was later, but he also seemed to take his promise to Dumbledore to try to protect the students seriously. He arranged Ginny and friends to have detention in forest instead of something worse by the Carrows. He does seem to hate most students, but I don't think he would just run off without even attempting to save them.
