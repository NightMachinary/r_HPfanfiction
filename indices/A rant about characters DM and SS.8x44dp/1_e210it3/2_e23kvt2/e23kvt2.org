I feel ya. Intuitively, I find there is always more depth to a character who is a villian than someone who remains good. Part of it is I think plot and character development are in some ways easier when you start out evil. I gravitate to these fics because I find a redemption arc more relatable than someone who is "good" throughout. It's tragic and I love it. Snape knows he is a POS, but cannot be better and cannot do better. Draco is a child who has been ruined by shitty parents, but still feels fear, and you feel bad.

The way DM or SS is portrayed in most of these fics are OOC. If we are talking about strictly book portrayals, I don't see many redeeming qualities. However, it's easy to tweak aspects of these characters in fics so that they are "nicer" or "more good" e.g. by elaborating on backstories or POVs.

OP is asks about infatuation and popularity. I think those are two separate questions. It's hard to redeem a bad character (esp one we already know), so amateur writing often comes across as romanticizing.
