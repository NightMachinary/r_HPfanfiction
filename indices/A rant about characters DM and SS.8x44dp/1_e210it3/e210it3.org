Can I put a question to this sub? Whatever happened to liking villains for being villains? These days, if you say you like an evil character, there's a decent chance someone's gonna demand you justify every single bad thing they've ever done. I like both Draco and Severus because they're both complete bastards, but also have at least a few layers to their character. Does it have to be any more complicated than that?
