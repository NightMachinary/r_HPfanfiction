This is true, as Snape as Alan Rickman portrays him is very attractive to a lot of females, but in the book he is described as being short and very very ugly. But not all of us who have Snape as a favorite character think he's an awesome angsty hero that should be worshipped, there are those of us who consider him a selfish, petty, mean, cold, bastard bully. Don't characterise all Snape fans by those who only wish to see what they want and create an OC from Snape. My little feelings :( We're not all idiots!
