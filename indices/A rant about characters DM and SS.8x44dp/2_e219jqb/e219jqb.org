If you look at Snape's school years and upbringing, he begins life as an underdog. That's a likable trait in most characters, it's even something he shares with Harry. He was raised by a muggle father who was cruel and abusive, this put him in a position where he was powerless to protect himself or his mother. He also heavily resembled his cruel father who made his life hell, which means he likely resented his own appearance. He also grew up very poor. So he had very little resources, little to no affection, and was horribly lonely. All implications are that his muggle father hated and fear magic and likely discouraged it.

I'm sure you see where I'm going with this, but he shares many of these things in common with Tom Riddle. Dumbledore tells Harry that Tom got followers because he was good at giving them the things they wanted, Dementors want victims, people like Snape want power and respect. I imagine that in Snape's young life a man he shared so much in common with that promised him those things was very enticing. The fact that Tom hated muggles or non-pureblood witches and wizards was probably of little import to Snape, he didn't have much concern for them himself, given all he'd experienced to that point. There's no evidence he enjoyed murder or torture or even committed it, aside from Dumbledore's death. Why would Voldemort even bother to ask that of him? He had tons of followers who followed him specifically to gain access to victims, followers like Bellatrix and Greyback.

As soon as Snape realized how empty the promises he'd been made were, and how he stood to lose the only human being that had ever cared for him without obligation, he was done. Not just done, he devoted his entire life to the cause of ending Tom Riddle. He wasn't a nice human being, but he wasn't a bad one. He was young and misguided and seduced by the offer of things he never thought he could obtain alone. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie The Departed (spoilers ahead) but Snape is not dissimilar to Leo DiCaprio's character in that movie, Billy Corrigan. Throughout the film you watch him try so hard to do the right thing and you watch it cost him everything and destroy his entire life. You watch Corrigan, like Snape, live on the outside of everything he ever wanted, just out of his reach. Just like in The Departed, people feel sympathy for these characters. Snape's story is a Greek tragedy, which, despite the echo chamber of this thread, is a character and a story people have enjoyed for thousands of years.

Draco is like Harry, he's a child who was never given a choice in his own future. Yes, Draco is a bully, but lots of kids are mean to each other in school and grow up and out of that behavior, whether Draco does is open to interpretation I suppose. The epilogue and The Cursed Child would seem to indicate he does. His only “evil” actions are actions made by a desperate child who is frightened and alone and has /way/ too much on his shoulders. People enjoy redemption, and Draco has that potential. He not only has the potential, he commits a few very small, redeeming actions. Despite his upbringing, he feels empathy and he may not see the error of his bigoted views, but he does see how horrible the world would be under Voldemort.

TLDR: People are complex. They aren't any one thing. Draco and Snape are complex, that's relatable and people can sympathize with them and root for them to be better. Also, fan fiction exists so that people with attachments to different characters and ideas can explore them through reading or writing past the established story. Maybe if you're not into a specific character or story, don't read that one.
