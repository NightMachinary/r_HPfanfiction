Ok fair enough when I hear mind rape I think of Legilimens but Imperius totally qualifies too, just not my first thought. If I recall correctly Draco used Imperio once on Madam Rosemerta as for the Cruciatus he attempted to use it on Harry but Harry nearly killed him before he could. Are there others I am missing? I realize this isn't the point but what is you opinion on Harry? He used Imperio twice, successfully used the Cruciatus once and has 2 more unsuccessful attempts to his name.
