Okay it's been a few years since I read the books but when did Draco mind-rape or torture anyone? Also I wasn't joking when my first reason for liking Draco was Tom Felton.

Edit: I totally agree about Snape's ending. I hate that it is cannon now that he was only doing it for Lily, not that he realized the error of his ways, just that he was still "in love" ugh. As I said it was between books that I made these opinions, so this was unknown at the time and honestly I simply choose to ignore it.
