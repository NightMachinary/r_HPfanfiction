Snape "did the right thing" because he owed Dumbledore and "loved" Lily, nothing more. Draco is nothing like Zuko. Zuko had interesting backstory for why he did what he did. But he never went so far as to mind-rape, torture (etc.) others. Draco was almost literally just an S.S. Jr Nazi. Of course, I can understand thinking this early on but once the end of GoF came I was certain Draco wasn't going to change. He just wouldn't commit murder. But torture and taking away free will? He did it.
