I like Snape for the same reasons I like House. They are miserable bastards who take out their problems on everyone around them, no matter how undeserving the person is, but when needed they right thing they do. They are good people who are also massive jackasses. Draco is played by Tom Felton, lol. I personally always hoped for a redemption arc for Draco, his character is, in my opinion, fairly similar to Zuko's and my hope for the last book was that he would see the light and join Harry. All of these opinions were formed during my early teen years, in the madness of waiting for the next book and have just stuck around.
