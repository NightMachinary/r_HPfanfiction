I wasn't straight up comparing them (and neither was the person who mentioned House). I just said this "made me think of" Dr Cox.

Obviously the terrorism stuff doesn't apply. Next to that however one of the big complaints about Snape is that he bullies his students. Dr Cox is a major bully who, in real life, should be reported to HR. His behaviour goes far beyond "being a bit mean" and in a scenario where this behaviour wasn't being dealt with, people would absolutely quit that company due to him making the workplace completely unbearable.
