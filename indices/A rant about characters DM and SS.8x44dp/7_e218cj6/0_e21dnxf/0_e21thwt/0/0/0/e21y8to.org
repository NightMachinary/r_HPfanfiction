1) Yes, I'm aware of this. After all it is a comedy and characters will therefore have highly exaggerated traits in order to make it funny. I already wrote this in another post here, but Harry Potter was written as a children's book. There are so many issues for which the finger can be pointed at the genre. Whether it's no one caring about Harry being neglected / abused by his relatives, or the Ministry's lack of accountability, or Dumbledore leaving the Philosopher's Stone behind absolutely pathetic defenses, or the /plethora/ of incompetent teachers (and this group even includes nice people like Hagrid) - this kind of exaggeration and incompetence is a common thing in children's books in order to let the children have all of their adventures. Had it been a book for adults, characters like Snape would've needed a hell of a lot more depth and back story in order to not be judged as a really poorly written character. I agree that Scrubs shouldn't be taken too seriously because it's a comedy; the same can be said for HP due to it being children's literature.

2) I understand the tough love aspect, I honestly do but there are plenty of things Cox does that do not fall under this category. Let's just take the nicknames and refusal to call people by their real names. That is entirely unprofessional and unacceptable and does not in any way contribute to him helping his students succeed.
