  Next to that however one of the big complaints about Snape is that he bullies his students. Dr Cox is a major bully who, in real life, should be reported to HR. His behaviour goes far beyond "being a bit mean" and in a scenario where this behaviour wasn't being dealt with, people would absolutely quit that company due to him making the workplace completely unbearable.

Two points:

1) Most of Cox's outbursts are done for comedic effect - since Scrubs is in fact a comedy and not to be taken seriously

2) Cox wants his students to succeed and I wouldn't describe him as a bully. He's a "tough love" kind of guy and I've encountered people with this style of teaching - not once did I feel bullied. Snape on the other hand has no interest in actually teaching anyone, he clearly loathes everything about his job.
