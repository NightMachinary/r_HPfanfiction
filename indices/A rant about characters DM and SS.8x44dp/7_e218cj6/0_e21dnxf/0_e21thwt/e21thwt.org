That comparison is even worse! Scale of being good people:

#+begin_example
  Dr. Cox >>>>>>>>> Dr. House >>>>>>>>>>>>> [...] >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Snape >>> Voldemort
#+end_example

The only thing bad about Perry Cox is that he's sometimes a bit mean! Snape joined a terrorist organization, that promotes subjugation and murder, while Cox and House are *Doctors* who try to save people's lives!
