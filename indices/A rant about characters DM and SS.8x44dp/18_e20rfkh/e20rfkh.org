Because those people usually find the actors hot. Personally, I don't see it, but that's probably to an old German parody which introduced Malfoy with using "lube as a haircare product. Do you know the expression crawl into someone's ass (suck up)? He takes that literally!"

My biggest gripe with hyping those two up is the fact that they both are toothless. Malfoy couldn't kill another man face to face, even if he took pleasure from watching others suffer (Buckbeak trial) and called for racial purges. He would do for killing off some background characters, but due to the powers of plot armour (you wouldn't want some weak dude to defeat the MC, right?) and the fact that Malfoy couldn't cast the spell, he doesn't make a very dangerous antagonist. Hell, he is like Joffrey /Baratheon/ but with far less bite from his parents. Very few redeeming qualities, but Malfoy doesn't make a good villain either.

As for Snape, there is no way he'd kill Harry under Dumbledore's nose. He is one misstep away from an intimate date with a dementor, so there's very little he can get away with unless Dumbledore approves. And by the time Voldemort takes over, Harry is outside his reach. Since Snape doesn't strike me as the type for suicide assassinations (otherwise he'd have killed Voldemort's body long ago), he is an annoyance for Harry, but not a real threat. And that's not even taking Lily's eyes into consideration.
