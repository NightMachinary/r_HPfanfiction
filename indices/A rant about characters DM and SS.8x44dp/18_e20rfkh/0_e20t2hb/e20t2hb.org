I never could shake the feeling that Snape was always most focused on Snape. Canon strongly implies that his no. 1 goal is and always has been the defeat of Voldemort, but his behaviour makes more sense to me when assuming that he played both sides, under the proviso that he preferred the outcome of Voldemort losing. Just a slightly different order of priorities.

In any case, he doesn't have much choice to do anything except being a spy after the events of Halloween 1981: He's a marked Death Eater and can't fully commit to Dumbledore (Voldemort would kill him) and fully committing to Voldemort would be stupid and not help to see him dead eventually. It strikes me as odd when this is framed as a grand heroic gesture of Snape.

Sorry that was a bit ofa ramble.
