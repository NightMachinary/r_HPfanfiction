That's a terrible way to analyse that situation. Snape is going exactly along with D's plan by giving Harry the information at this point. If he wanted Harry to make an informed decision about what he should do, Snape could have communicated these facts earlier and not at zero hour. Snape perfectly understands that Harry is with his back against the wall during the Hogwarts battle.

If they had told Harry earlier he might have decided not to martyr himself, so Snape clearly accepts the "pig to slaughter" part of the plan (though he scoffs at it)
