i do think he wants voldemort defeated. i was disagreeing with the framing that 'canon implies it's his no.1 goal'. also

  But he still follows through with Dumbledore's plan and gives Harry the memories.

people make a huge leap wrt snape giving harry his memories -> snape sending harry to die. snape gave him memories where snape himself opposes the plan and those are his only thoughts on it. the memories were so harry would know /dumbledore's/ plan, and that he was a horcrux. the choice was left up to him, and snape expressed he /didn't/ like dumbledore's plan
