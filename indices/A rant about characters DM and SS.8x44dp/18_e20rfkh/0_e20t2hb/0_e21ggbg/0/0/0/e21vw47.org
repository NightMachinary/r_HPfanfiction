I think people also forget that while Snape said, "You're raising him like a pig for slaughter." With disgust, Dumbledore accused him of caring for the boy, and Snape said, "For him? Never." And then showed his patronus, for lily. His disgust at the plan was not for Harry, he made it perfectly clear he did not give one damn what happened to harry at all, for harry's sake. But for Lily. So he really couldn't have cared less about harry himself, only for Lily. So no, I don't think Snape was all that upset that Harry had to die. Merely that for the last 16 years Dumbledore had manipulated him into doing his bidding by binding him to a dead woman who disliked him, risking his life saving Harry who he hated immensely multiple times and risking his life spying, only to find out none of it mattered because the boy had to die anyway and that Lily's son would have had to die the entire time.

He is pissed because of Lily, and how his sacrifices, suffering and promises, all in the vain of keeping Lily's son safe, were for nothing as he had to die anyway. Had harry not been lily's son, he wouldn't have cared at all, and would have not shown such disgust, so no, it had nothing to do with Harry at all.

As for his number 1 goal, I think at that point it was having Voldemort dead. As he no longer had Lily, because had his loyalty been only to her he would have given Harry choices, or wouldn't have showed him at all, or told him at any point in the seventh book like when he was in the Forest of Dean. He had multiple chances to 'save harry'. So no I don't think his loyalty to lily went that far to go beyond Dumbledore's plan to save her son. But I also think Lily herself believed in defeating voldemort at ALL costs. As you recall Harry walked with Lily, james, sirius and Lupin to meet up with Voldemort to die. None of them protested or told him not to do so to run, not even Lily herself. She knew her son had to die, and said nothing to stop him or discourage him, in fact they all did the very opposite of it. Lily's cause was the defeat of Voldemort, and so I think for Snape the choice was clear in the matter.
