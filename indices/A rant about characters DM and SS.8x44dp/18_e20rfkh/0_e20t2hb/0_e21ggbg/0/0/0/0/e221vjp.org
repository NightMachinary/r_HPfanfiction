  Had harry not been lily's son, he wouldn't have cared at all, and would have not shown such disgust, so no, it had nothing to do with Harry at all.

...but harry is lily's son. it's an implicit part of his existence. if harry weren't lily's son, he wouldn't be harry. his disgust at the plan /was/ for harry, because 'lily's son' is an inherent part of who harry is. he was also appalled at the perceived callousness of dumbledore's plan in general

like i said, i don't disagree that he wants voldemort dead. my disagreement was with the framing. snape's #1 goal, that's implied in canon, is atoning for being complicit in lily's death/endangerment. that includes protecting harry, and also the triumph of lily's cause. he then finds out that he can't have both things at once, so he's stuck

or, put it this way: if harry decided he didn't want to sacrifice himself, snape wouldn't have forced him, and would have just continued on saving people/fighting voldemort until he (snape) was killed or something else happened
