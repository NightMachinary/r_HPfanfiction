I can see your point. It's a tricky situation that could be interpreted in many different ways.

Ha! How could you force someone to kill themselves? Harry had to do so willingly for it to work, not led by Snape at wand point or anything, or use a potion. Voldemort could have threatened him with the destruction of the world but that wouldn't have been free will either since it was blackmail, harry would have wanted to go on his own. Hm interesting bit there.

Although I do think Snape would have encouraged harry to make the choice to do so, probably insulting him while doing so I can just hear it now (You're just like your father willing to sacrifice everyone to your arrogance and superiority...), but in the end I don't think there was much he could have done, or wanted to do either.
