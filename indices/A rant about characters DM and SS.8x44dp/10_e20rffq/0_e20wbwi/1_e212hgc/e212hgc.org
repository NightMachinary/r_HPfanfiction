He believed the rhetoric, completely and absolutely, I won't argue that. However, I do think at some point (When Lucius failed and was in Azkaban) he woke up. Not in a "now i agree with the other side and I was wrong about believing in this" but in a "this is a megolomaniac psychopath who will destroy everything, what am I doing here' way. Everything after that seemed to be primarily driven by fear. He's still a cowardly, racist, pathetic being, but he had little desire to watch his world burn to the ground and be ruled by a cruel, 'immortal' madman.

He doesn't seem beyond redemption, and we don't know how far his faith shaken only that it was.
