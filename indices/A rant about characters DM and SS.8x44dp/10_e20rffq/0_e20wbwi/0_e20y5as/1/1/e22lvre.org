That he was acting under duress wouldn't hold in English courts (maybe in the Wizengamot?). There is a high barrier for that. The threat must be immediate such that he cannot do anything else like go to the authorities (or Dumbledore), a "reasonable person of ordinary courage" must act the same and if he joins a gang which is known to do criminal acts and threaten people he knowingly put himself into a position in which he was likely to be subjected to threats.

He's only a teenager, not an adult, though. And has grown up in a toxic environment. That are the mitigating circumstances.
