I think most of what he did was motivated by fear and a desire for survival. He didn't want to kill Dumbledore and imperius Katie and Rosmerta but he was afraid and so he did. He's still a bigoted bully, but he's not a murderer, his actions were that of a desperate man so it's easy for some to look past all of his less redeemable qualities.
