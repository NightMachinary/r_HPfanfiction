SS- Alan Rickman

DM- He's a good looking (in the movies, possibly books), rich, supposed bad boy who in the end did things he didn't want to do. Hello, redemption arc and female/male romantic savior.

Movies and sex appeal, remarkably shallow but that's what it comes down to.

Thinking about it, I've never seen the appeal of either. As far as Snape is concerned, he's a jerk. He'd been dealt a horrible hand in life, but that doesn't discount the fact he's a jerk. A jerk who bullies children. In terms of his feelings for Lily, I don't think they were ever healthy. It seems he relied on her for his happiness, which isn't healthy, and later or in addition to that was obsessed with her. It wasn't sweet, it was twisted. There are many things about Snape that make him an interesting, complex character to explore, it's unfortunate most don't choose to look at that.
