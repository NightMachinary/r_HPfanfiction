I'm not really influenced by HBC, but I buy the thesis of “Delenda Est” that Bellatrix could have turned out well if it were not for Voldemort's extreme corruption. In that case, a time traveling Harry saving Bellatrix very much appeals to me.

Similarly, Hermione time travel to save Snape is also acceptable to me.
