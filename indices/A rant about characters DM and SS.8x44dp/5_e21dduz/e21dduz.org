The series was originally written as a children's book, let's not forget that. All of the adults are completely useless, and the government and other authority figures seem to ignore completely ridiculous stuff like incompetent and/or abusive teachers (Binns, Trelawney, Lockhart, "Moody", Umbridge, etc., and yes also Snape) - this kind of stuff is part of the genre and a lot of it is done for comic relief.

Had HP been a book series for adults, a lot of this would have had to be dealt with much, much more seriously and there would have had to be more depth and background information for many of the characters. The great part about fanfiction is that we can imagine what this would have looked like. I don't read a lot of Draco-based fanfic any more, but I am a huge Snape fan even though he's a right old douchebag in canon and should not be allowed to teach children. I find fic's which explore Snape's backstory really interesting, despite it essentially being an AU. Plus, I love a good redemption arc!

Additionally plenty of Draco/Snape haters paint fic's based on them as always being overly romanticised which is simply not true. I'm currently reading an SSHG story where quite frankly Snape is such an arse, even I'm finding it impossible to believe Hermione would fall for him! Overly-romanticised Draco's and Snape's are just as common as all kinds of other tropes and there's nothing inherently wrong with them. It's not my cup of tea either and I prefer them to be more or less in-character (just with more depth to their backstory) but hey, no one's forcing me to read that stuff and I really don't see the point in complaining about it.

*tl;dr:* I love Snape fanfiction and it's honestly kinda annoying how so many people feel justified to bash people who like Draco/Snape. There's nothing wrong with enjoying those two in all their AU-y goodness.
