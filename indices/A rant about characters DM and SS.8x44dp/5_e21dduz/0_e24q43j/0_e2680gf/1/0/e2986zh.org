I'm still super conflicted about The Return... There are loads of interesting things in the story from a psychological perspective, for example I really liked how Snape held on to his house and that moment Hermione sees it and realises how he's kept all of that secret from her. I definitely agree Snape is incredibly damaged (Lily too), but their lack of remorse bothers me. The interaction between Lily, Harry and Ginny also seems short-changed. The author writes really well and I suspect all of this was intentional, I would've just liked more of a resolution on a lot of these stories because as it is most of the characters' actions are incomprehensible to me.
