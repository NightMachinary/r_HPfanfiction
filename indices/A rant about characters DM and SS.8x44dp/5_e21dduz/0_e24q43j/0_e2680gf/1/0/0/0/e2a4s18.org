I read it after it was finished, all in one go and I basically just felt a bit numb at the end. Didn't write any reviews cause all I would've said was "I hate you for writing this, what have you done to my favourite characters" lmao Definitely nowhere near enough grovelling, I would've just liked for Hermione to tell him to fuck off and then proceed to live her life happily doing her own thing.

Might reread at some point and keep a look out for your comments.
