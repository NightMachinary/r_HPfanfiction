I should probably read it again, just to let the rage-monster spread its wings. I followed the fic while it was being written and fell into a sort of Return-shaped black hole, where it was pretty much the only thing I could think of. Chapter 13 made me so angry I could hardly think, it was a little ridiculous. I feel like Hermione got short-changed in the groveling department, and I'd have liked to see more genuine remorse from Snape.

I had some wonderful conversations in the comments section of that fic though.
