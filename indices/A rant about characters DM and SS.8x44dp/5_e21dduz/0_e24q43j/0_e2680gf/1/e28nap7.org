Omg I've read Intended Vessels and whooo boy Snape is the King of the Dicks in that one!

As for The Return, I got really invested in that fic and wrote some things to work through my feelings there. In the end, though, I think Snape wasn't actually bad in that fic, so much as severely damaged. He needed therapy in addition to a solid kick in the arse.
