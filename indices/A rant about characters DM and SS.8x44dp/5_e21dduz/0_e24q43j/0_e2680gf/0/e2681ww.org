  [newly edited as of Feb '18] Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.By killing Draco, she saves Dumbledore and keeps Voldemort at bay for a little while. But evil never sleeps for long. When a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. She's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  Lily Evans Potter sacrificed herself for her son, and her love saved him and then the world. Except, she never died. With romanticism and cynicism, Albus Dumbledore plotted to keep James and Lily alive. Harry didn't need that sacrifice to live; conventional defense against the dark arts would do. He just needs to believe in that sacrifice. Dumbledore is confident in his ability to persuade.Severus Snape lived his life with one glimmer to cleave to: in the summer of 1975 he loved Lily Evans, and she loved him back. It is what helps him sleep during the worst nights. It is what motivates him to refuse to die for the cause.It is not until his early forties that finally another glimmer arrives and changes his life into one he truly wants for the first time since he was fifteen. But that spark of Lily that kept him alive throughout the years will not be extinguished easily, especially because Lily never died.
