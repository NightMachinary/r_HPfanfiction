It's linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) I've not finished it yet but God Snape is an arse there.

Making me think back to linkao3(The Return by CeleryThesis) I loved the premise of the story but fucking hell I hated Snape so much in this. Hermione honestly should've cut his balls off and fed them to him and it still wouldn't have been a sufficient punishment.
