I think they're both interesting characters and I'm a big fan of unpleasant and ugly characters who are strict and brilliant too so I adore Snape. His character kept me sane when I was going through a bad time, so I'm protective of his sorry asshole face.

Most people love Draco because they make him into a pretty boy bishonen. I prefer the rich entitled jerk when I write him. He can be villainous (but usually ineffective) or he can be somewhat redeemed but I imagine he still stays super whiny.

You don't have to like them, though. And you can have multiple favorites! It's totally fine!
