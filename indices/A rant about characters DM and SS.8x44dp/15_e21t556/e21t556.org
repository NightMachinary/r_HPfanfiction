Malfoy's redemption was literally just Narcissa. She saved Harry, and had she not done so, Voldemort would have won. After Voldemort was dead, being of his ideology was probably too dangerous (probation, maybe?) so he moved on and became a sort of good father.

Snape... well, people try to see the good in him that isn't really there due to his Book 7 arc. He was the greatest fear for someone whose parents were tortured into insanity, he's not a good person by any way shape or form. Great character, but that's because he's an utter contemptible dick, not some secret tragic superhero magic man that was a good guy the entire time. If Lily had lived, or if Voldemort had targeted the Longbottoms instead, Snape would have remained a Card Carrying Death Eater without any qualms
