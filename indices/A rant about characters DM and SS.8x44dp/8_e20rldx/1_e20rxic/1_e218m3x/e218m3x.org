You are way more likely to start a "real-life political argument" by making it look like you're offended at Nazis being used as a negative comparison when they're relevant than the dude you responded to is by bringing them up in the first place.

Because either you don't think being a Nazi is an objectively bad thing, considering the subject matter is directly related to them, or you just look like you think that for whatever reason.
