Maybe, however, there are two things:

1) This is about the books/fanfictions, so real-life politics are off-topic still, kind off.

2)This subreddit rules do not allow to debate politics properly, as one side is obviously favoured (no "hate-speech", etc.)

Because of these reasons, it's better to not even engage in such debates.
