I don't get the point of this comment of yours. First, you claimed nazis exist nowadays (which they don't), also implying, that they are so bad, even considering siding with them is wrong:

#+begin_quote
  (as if it's a legitimate position)
#+end_quote

And now you are saying this? You are seemingly contradicting yourself, comrade Crow.

And the links you provided do not even show actual nazis. The first 3 links are of the very trolls I mentioned before. And NDP is National Democratic Party. It is completely another thing. Unless of course, you see any political party with the word "national" and scream "NAZI!".
