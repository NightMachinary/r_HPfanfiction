The mods here are generally pretty laid-back and won't intervene unless you start promoting political extremism of any kind or shape. I mean, the other day there was a fairly long and political discussion about bashing Islam in fanfiction and in there I made a long argument in favor of the "freedom of bashing" and another about the one and a half millennia Europe had fought Islam, and I was neither banned nor downvoted into oblivion.
