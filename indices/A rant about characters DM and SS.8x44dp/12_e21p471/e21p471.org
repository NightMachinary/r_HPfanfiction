Well Snape's love for lily it was probably the only way he knew love. Who really showed him love, his parents who were too busy arguing? Or anyone at school who bullied him? He probably had a bad role model for what 'love' is. And while we know what love is, or at least is supposed to look like, he might not have had the same good building blocks. It's just like a little girl who grows up in a home where dad beats her or mom, and often times (Not all the time) they go looking for boyfriends/husbands/etc that are just like their father and beats them you know? So while he may not have 'loved' lily in the same way that we see love to him it was how he knew how to. Unfortunately it was twisted his concept of it at least, andwhile it wasn't a warped 'i'll beat the shit out of you cause i lov you' i did think it did do him a great deal of harm as he was bound to a dead woman though Dumbledore's manipulation of the situation. So eh.

Back to the original point though, I think people are fascinated by them because of the "bad-ass' factor they have which isn't really that much. I mean draco wasn't a bad ass at all. And Snape was more cunning and clever in certain specific aspects etc. Also a lot of times you find they are written poorly, and OOC one way or another. I think it's all about fulfilling some bad-boy fantasy. However, I do write a ton of Snape fics (Almost all of them have him in them). I like to think I keep him as in character as possible. I do this because Snape happens to be my favorite character. And no it's not because of Lily. Snape has been my favorite character since the very first Potions class in Sorcerers/philosophers stone. Ironically I remember saying 'there's something about him, he has a back story i know it'. But often it was because I could understand Snape, especially after the fifth book. I could relate to him. I was abused growing up and had no friends cause I was bullied too. I grew into the same resentful, bitter, mean, hateful adult. And I spewed venom as well. I'm not saying I was exactly like Snape, I had more than two good points to me, I was loyal to those I trusted (Which were very few) and I'd go to the ends of the earth for them etc. But I could understand Snape so much it hurt. While no one else could understand why I hated life so much and people. And the world. Someone in the world did, cause someone wrote a male version of me. You know.

I'm aware Snape was an immature petty selfish, mean spiteful bully. I fully acknowledge how awful he was to certain people, esp harry, and in general. I'm not defending him on those points, or saying it was okay or justified or excusable. Just that sometimes my heart aches because that was me.
