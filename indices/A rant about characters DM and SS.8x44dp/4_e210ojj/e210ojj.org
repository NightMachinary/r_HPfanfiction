You don't have to like it. And anyway, most people like these characters in fanfiction, not the books- there's a huge difference!

The fiction/fantasy/smut people read is usually NOT the same as what they want in real life. I mean, sometimes it's more enjoyable to read a redemption arc than a harry potter power trip. And just because you may enjoy reading fanfic about a villain doesn't mean that you're conflating it with the same character in the book. They aren't part of the same universe.

The way people shame others on here for wanting to read about the characters they like or pairings they like is ridiculous. People have different tastes. Get used to it.
