You shouldn't assume that people like these characters just because of their actors and their movie portrayal. I find Snape interesting in both the movies and the books and I am sure I am not the only one. I even find the movie version of him a little too soft and different from book version at times. Like the fact that Snape is supposed to in his early 30s in the first book, I would have never guessed that based on Alan Rickmans age.

He is this complete bastard who has lots of issues and problems, but that's what makes him so interesting to me. He is not always moral. He is not a good person who often does the right things for all the wrong reasons. He brings conflict and spices up almost every scene his is in. Also has a great set up for a potential redemption plot line, especially with his later comment of how he is unable to save everyone. It shows that he may have changed his mind about the death eaters at least on some level. I like fics that explore these different possibilies and ways for characters to reflect on themselves and change due to various circumstance they are in even when they may not be good people to begin with.

Plus I absolutely love the cutting dry humour, creative insults, the sarcasm and just the presence that his character has. The way he says his first year potions speech for example, the way he completely owned Lockhart in the dual. While the gryffindor way is to jump into situations without thinking, Snape tends to embrace slytherin qualities of cleverness, planning, manipulation and just waiting until the time is right to make a move.

Not to mention his backstory and the parallels to Harry and Voldemort. All three are half bloods with crappy childhoods, but are so different.

Can't say I care too much about Draco, but he also has a good potential set up for redemption in the books. There is a whole book of him basically having to face that being a death eater is not as good as he thought it would be. And being all angsty about the fact that he now either has to kill Dumbledore or have Voldemort kill his family. He is also a good candidate for the ever popular "Enemies to friends/lovers" trope so it's not hard to see why he is popular regardless of how well Tom Felton played him.
