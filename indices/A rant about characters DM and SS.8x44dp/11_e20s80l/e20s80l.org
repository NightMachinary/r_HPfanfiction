I think Draco has some potential as a post-OotP divergence story. The guy is clearly scared out of his mind and I think there's the possibility of him and his mother seeking protection and defecting. How would he adjust to having to try to be civil with blood traitors?

Post hbp Draco is completely despicable and really hard to redeem without white washing murder attempts and bigotry.
