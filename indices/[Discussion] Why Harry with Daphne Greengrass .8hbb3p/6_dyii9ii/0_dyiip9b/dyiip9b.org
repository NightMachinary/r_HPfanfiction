Zabini and Bones are neither death eathers, nor they are associated with the Light Lord Dumbledore . They are pureblodds that believe in the wizarding traditions even if it is only marginally hinted in canon. It is a war of beliefs after all , LIght= to integrate mudbloods the wizarding world must be the most similar to muggle. Dark= Mudbloods are the cause of the disparition of the old ways because of the Light wish to integrate them. Neutrals= The wizarding world must not change but the mudbloods must learn the traditions and old ways if they want to be integrated. Harry Potter was never to choose, Dumbledore by isolating him with the Weasleys and Granger and seeding him to the Dursleys assured of that.
