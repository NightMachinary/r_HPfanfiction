We know absolutely nothing about Lily's character, and how much Ginny looks like her. Rowling stated that one of the reasons Ginny and Harry got closer was their shared experience of having Voldemort in their heads. Also, as referenced in HBP, he's rather attracted to her personality, liking that she's bold, and fiery. He also feels comfortable enough to confide in her, especially regarding things that he doesn't confide in Ron and Hermione. In OotP, it's Ginny that Harry talks to about his desire to speak with serious.

Now, regarding this nonsense about Harry and Malfoy, that's a shallow and biased interpretation of the text. Not for one second in the books has Harry done anything other than despise Malfoy. His first impression of Malfoy compared him to Dudley. Not to mention, in HBP, Malfoy had been directly responsible for hurting 2 friends(Ron and Katie Bell).

So why was Harry still "obsessed" over Malfoy? Here's why. During both OotP and HBP, a common theme is Harry's frustration at his inability to join the order, and actively work against Voldemort. Malfoy, however, is a target in his reach, and someone he suspects is working for Voldemort, and focuses his efforts on stopping Malfoy, mostly because that's all he can do now.
