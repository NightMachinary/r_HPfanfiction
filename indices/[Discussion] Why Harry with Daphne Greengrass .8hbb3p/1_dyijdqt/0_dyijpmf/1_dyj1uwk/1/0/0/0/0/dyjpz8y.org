- Contrary we have a very large description of her physical appearance and personality : Lily was a beautiful woman. She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and bright green almond-shaped eyes. (HPDH) Lily was known for being a vivacious, talented, and popular student. (HPHBP) Lily was also a woman of sound moral principles, and would stand by them no matter what it cost her: though her actions were ineffective. On at least one occasion she called out James Potter and Sirius Black for their bullying of her friend, Severus Snape. When she realised --- through an insult that Snape gave her in a moment of angry humiliation --- Snape's devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause (of which she was a target of at the time) as well as his increasingly deep fascination with the Dark Arts, caused her to refuse his apology for the insult, and ended her friendship with him permanently. Lily and her daughter-in-law Ginny also are very very similar to each other. They both have red hair, they both married a Potter: Lily married James; Ginny married Harry, they both were popular in school, both weren't afraid to stand up for their friends: Lily when the Marauders harassed Severus Snape, and Ginny when people ridiculed Luna Lovegood by calling her Loony Lovegood.

- Notwithstanding his obsession towards stopping Draco and protecting Dumbledore has blinded him so much that he has ignored the withering curse that he has seen when they side along apparated and that Dumbledore was already dying.
