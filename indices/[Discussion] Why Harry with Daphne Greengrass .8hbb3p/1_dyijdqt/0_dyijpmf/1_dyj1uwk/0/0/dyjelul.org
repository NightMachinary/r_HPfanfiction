While true, there's also the fact that Susan's parents are canonically alive until the sixth book. While the fanon view her as being a ward of Amelia. My headcanon workaround though is that the Mr. and Mrs. Bones mentioned in the sixth book was her uncle and his wife.

Also, we only fucking know that A) Amelia was a good duelist, enough so that Voldemort deemed it important enough that he himself should fight her(Or is that fanon, I forget sometimes), and B) That she's head of the DMLE. Nothing else is known about the Bones or Susan.

Lets be honest, most fanfiction authors can screw up characters that we have available to us with a full personality and development path. Which is why quite often the OC-yet canon named characters end up rather flat and stale.
