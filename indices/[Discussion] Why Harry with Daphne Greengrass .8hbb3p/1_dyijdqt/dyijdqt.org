A lot of stories feature kids in politics, and basically all of those are silly (or worse) because it is done poorly. Old Pure-blood families end up being politically savvy (often with Occlumency because that's /totally/ a skill kids can pick up), so Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor has to get with one to learn to politic. Greengrass is just a blank canon character from a pure-blood family so it's an easy choice if you want to write this kind of story.
