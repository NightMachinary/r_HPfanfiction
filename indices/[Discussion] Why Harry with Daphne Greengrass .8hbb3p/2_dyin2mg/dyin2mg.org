If nothing else, it's a really pretty name.

But other than that:

- Unless it was written before book 6, Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy are all guys, and slash pairings (particularly Malfoy) are not all that appealing to everyone.
- Susan Bones fics deal more naturally with Ministry work (since, after all, Amelia Bones) rather than Wizengamot work, I feel. Though as I recall there's a few that do the whole Lord thing as well.
- Susan Bones is also canonically a redhead (though I can't remember if that was from the books or just because of the actress who played her in the movies), and not everyone's into that. I know some people get really weirded out about Ginny being a redhead.
- Personality-wise, the name Susan Bones as a redhead evokes a very different feeling to Daphne Greengrass. It's stereotypical, obviously, but you think of redheads as having "fiery tempers" and things like that, regardless of whether or not they do. A lot of HP/DG fics have things like backhanded compliments, maintaining poise in the face of political adversity, etc., etc. It feels out of place for a redhead named Susan Bones to do that.
- If you do Harry/Daphne, you can keep canon characters at least somewhat close to normal. Harry with Malfoy would require him to act /very/ different from in the books, for example. Daphne is a blank slate.
- Susan is a Hufflepuff, and Daphne is a Slytherin.

But really, those pairings you mention do sometimes have the whole Lordship/inheritance thing. Not always, though, because they have other parts to them they can rely on instead.
