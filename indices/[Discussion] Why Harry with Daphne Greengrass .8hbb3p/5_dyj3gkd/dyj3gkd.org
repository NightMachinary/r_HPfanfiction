Daphne Greengrass has an unknown personality and family, basically unknown everything so authors can use that to make her be "perfect" for Harry. Zabini is a guy, And the "Lord" fics don't include slash that often. There are plenty of fics with Susan Bones/Harry as the ship, which often ends to her being a ginny clone since she's a redhead.
