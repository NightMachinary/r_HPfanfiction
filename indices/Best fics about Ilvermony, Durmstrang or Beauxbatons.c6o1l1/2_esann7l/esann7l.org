Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

A fic I'm currently writing about Durmstrang starring mainly Nordic characters, although many from the canon (Grindelwald, Krum, Newt, Draco) appears.

”The tale about a young half-blood who's about to attend his last year at the Durmstrang Institute, where he gets caught in a rebellion by the institute's half-breeds lead by his former best friend, who seeks to end the pureblood student hierarchy once and for all. What follows is an intense year of drama, violence, tension, wild partying, nihilism and the quest of finding oneself.”
