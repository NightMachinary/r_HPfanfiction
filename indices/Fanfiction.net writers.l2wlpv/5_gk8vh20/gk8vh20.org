I don't think it would change much. It's really one of the very bad side of this platform, and why I use AO3 instead. Not only are the comments difficult to read through, but everyone is constantly telling the author to do this or that, and this ship, and that trope. It's all so very entitled and rude and pushy. And it's only when people actually appreciate the story. Otherwise, you go through the comments to get a feel for the story and you find « flames » that are so outlandish. It's very disheartening even for a reader, I can't imagine for authors.

But otherwise, yes. And it works for every platform: if a writer starts to feel bothered by rude or spam comments, they should totally filter them.
