This may be weird - but my guest comments are 99% okay. In fact, I have some guest commenters that I wish I could reply to because they're so nice.

I will say - yes, bad commenters exist and are more likely to be 'guests' because there is anonymity is being a guest which can lead to people feeling free to leave mean comments. But, even then, the majority of guests are appropriate reviewers. However, for those folks who need to vent about mean comments - and by all means, vent away, I am here to support you - they are probably venting about 'guests' making them appear to be more prevalent than they are.

Of course, this is all anecdotal...
