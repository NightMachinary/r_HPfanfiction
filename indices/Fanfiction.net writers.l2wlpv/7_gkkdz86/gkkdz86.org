  I also, though I don't use it, heard AO3 has a better community /though I don't know if that is true/.

In my time posting fics to AO3 I have had one mildly disgruntled comment in 67 chapters and a oneshot, and absolutely no abuse.

I've been put off posting to fanfic.net because so many writers report receiving abuse there. I might get new readers but I am unlikely to get better feedback than I already had, and I am much more likely to get abuse and spam, while serving up who-knows-what adverts to my readers.
