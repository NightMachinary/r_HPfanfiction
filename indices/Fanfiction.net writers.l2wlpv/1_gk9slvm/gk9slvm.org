One of the many and sundry 'improvements' offloaded on us by [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] is the inability to automatically block guest comments. In order to block them, you have to intercept them within 24 hours and manually block each of them individually. Honestly who has the time.

I just mock the ignorant gutless blowhards in writer's groups. It's therapeutic for everyone.
