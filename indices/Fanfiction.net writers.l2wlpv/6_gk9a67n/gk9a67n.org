Idk, I've never had too many problems with guest reviews. Mostly, I've only gotten compliments from them. While occasionally there has been something mildly negative or even insulting, it's been few and far between. As long as I have the option to delete them if they're like spam or whatever, I'm happy to keep myself open to them.
