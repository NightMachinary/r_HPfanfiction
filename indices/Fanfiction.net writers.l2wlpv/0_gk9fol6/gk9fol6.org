Totally agree with you... There's nothing worse than reading a really good story only for the author to quit because of guest reviews... On another note I have noticed ao3 is a much better community amongst authors I've seen in multiple fandoms authors helping each other out, collaborating and giving gifts (stories) to each other and I don't think I've seen many complain about toxic reviews (or they just ignore them)....
