If someone wants to leave a review on something I write, that's their prerogative. I'm not going to take away their ability to do so because some people are mean.

Personally, I do find it a bit cowardly that they aren't willing to attribute their name to it, but, well, I'm not one to cower from my own opinion.

That being said I've received plenty of positive guest reviews too. And plenty of poor signed reviews. But honestly, the guest reviews are the most fun. Most of them don't even make sense! It's great. But even looking through them it's about a twenty to one positive to negative ratio.

And honestly, the dirty little truth of any art is that there are always going to be people that don't enjoy it. If an author or artist does not develop thick skin they won't last. Not every bad review is a personal insult, and most people that leave them didn't even bother to read anyway.
