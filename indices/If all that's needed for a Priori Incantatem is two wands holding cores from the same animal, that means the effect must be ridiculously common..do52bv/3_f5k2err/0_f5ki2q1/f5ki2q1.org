Given how defined the first few digits of serial numbers for most products are, probably pretty common. They usually follow a pattern, identifying brand, factory, model, etc. It's the last 4 that are actually #1, #2, #3, etc.

​

I'd expect a better analogy would be sequential serial numbers.

My head canon is that Brother Wands would probably be not just same core, but adjacent wood from the same billet, same batch of glue, with those components also similarly blended, completed by the same maker, sequentially, etc.
