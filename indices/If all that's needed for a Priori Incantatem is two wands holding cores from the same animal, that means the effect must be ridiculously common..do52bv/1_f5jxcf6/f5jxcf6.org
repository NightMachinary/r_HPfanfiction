A mitigating factor of /Priori Incantatem/ is it appears that the actual spell effects need to hit each other in order to trigger the effect. So you not only need to have two wizards dueling each other. They need to have wands of the same core type, from the same animal. They need to be using a targeted spell effect at the exact same time and they must be skilled enough to both bullseye.

If it was a common effect you'd expect Voldemort to know what was happening, and he appeared to be as confused as Harry in the graveyard.

That said the spell, rather than the effect, doesn't appear to be all that rare. If I'm not mistaken it was Amos Diggory that used the spell on Harry's wand at the World Cup. Amos, if I remember right, worked with creature regulations and most creatures don't use wands so it wouldn't be something he would be expected to use all the time, unlike Aurors.
