One possible explanation is that the behavior is different if neither of the wands has preformed the killing curse. Like maybe without that you do get some effect but not the exact same one?

Either because it isn't noticable (you get different light show when the spells clash but nothing to stop the duel) or it is noticable but different enough Voldemort didn't recognize it. (Maybe the effect causes the ten previously used spells to shoot out in random directions but no light cage or wand connection)

Since the killing curse is (supposedly) rarely used, it would make sense this combination is not well known.

Edit: It has been a while since I read the scene, I don't recall if Voldemort's surprise was at the wand connection or the phantoms. It could be he recognized the connection (and thus ordered his death eaters to not interfere) but didn't expect the killing curse ghosts.
