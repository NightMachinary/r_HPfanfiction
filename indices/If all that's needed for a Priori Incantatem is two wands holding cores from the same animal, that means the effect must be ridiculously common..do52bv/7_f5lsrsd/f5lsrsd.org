I've always assumed that any kind of professional dueling etc. would have a wand weighing like in the Triwizard Tournament to make sure that no wand-cores reacted like that. Since out of war-time the chances of you duelling your wand's twin would be limited to school and professional duels (for the average person) it would be rare to actually meet.
