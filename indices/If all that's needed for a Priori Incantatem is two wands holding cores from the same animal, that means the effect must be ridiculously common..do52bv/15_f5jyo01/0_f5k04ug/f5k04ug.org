What is this connected to?

Fawkes is one phoenix, but he only gave two feathers in recent memory.

Therefore, for the other phoenix feather wands (ollivander would not say "we use phoenix feathers" if he only had one such wand in his entire shop), other phoenixes are needed. they are rare creatures, rarer than dragons and unicorns, meaning any wands made of their feathers would have a much greater chance of being brother ones.

Think of it like this:

Let's say there are three phoenixes, seven dragons and thirteen unicorns, alongside twelve witches and eleven wizards. nontheless, ollivander makes twenty-three wands with an equal ratio of all three cores - meaning that all the phoenix cores, dragon cores and unicorn cores came from those twenty-three animals. one unicorn may have not given any hair, and one may have given two, but the phoenixes would either all have to give multiple feathers or one of them many, many more, meaning there's a much greater chance of phoenix wands being brothers than the other types.
