  Therefore, for the other phoenix feather wands (ollivander would not say "we use phoenix feathers" if he only had one such wand in his entire shop), other phoenixes are needed. they are rare creatures, rarer than dragons and unicorns, meaning any wands made of their feathers would have a much greater chance of being brother ones.

Well, to be fair, we don't /exactly/ know the makeup of his shop's inventory - the majority of the wand cores that we're told in canon are dragon or unicorn based. A check online indicates 10 dragon heartstrings, 9 unicorn hairs, and 4 Phoenix feather ones - 2 of those being Harry and Voldemort, and the other 2 from extended sources (whereas all 19 dragon/unicorn ones seem to be from the main series).

From that at least, I would imagine that Phoenix feathers, though used, are rather rare in wands - so feasibly, Ollivander /could/ have 1-2 wands from a half dozen different Phoenixes. Or at least there's the /potential/ for that to be the case ;)
