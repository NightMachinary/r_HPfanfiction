Nah, just wondering. Really, I think the question of how common Priori Incantatem can be answered by how many cores does a typical animal get harvested for (which, of course, is a detail neglected by canon).

I personally think that Ollivander has procurement contracts with a bunch of different suppliers and only makes a few wands out of each animal to better diversify his wand inventory, with the rest of the heart strings, feathers, hairs, etc taken from an animal are sold to potions manufacturers.
