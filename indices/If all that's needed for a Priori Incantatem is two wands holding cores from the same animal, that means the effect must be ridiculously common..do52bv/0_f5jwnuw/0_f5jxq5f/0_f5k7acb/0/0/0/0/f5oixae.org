Sure, once they're **made**. But cores are also used for Potions ingredients in which case, we can only assume the ingredients will spoil or, at least have a different effect after they've been purchased. We don't technically know the shelf life for these things so it's fun to HC that, just like food, magical cores and ingredients will spoil and or, have negative effects when used after a certain amount of time...(Though, due to the school list, we can assume most ingredients last a whole school year. At least dealing with Potions.)
