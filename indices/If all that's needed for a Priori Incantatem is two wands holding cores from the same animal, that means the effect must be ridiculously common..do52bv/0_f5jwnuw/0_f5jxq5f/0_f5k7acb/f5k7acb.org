I agree. But I also think that when using/searching for wand cores, in order for a "brother/sister" wand to be created, they have to be extracted/retrieved at the same time. From what I understand - or at least HC - is that when making a wand, you only retrieve what is needed for that wand.

Basically, no wholesale orders of cores are available.
