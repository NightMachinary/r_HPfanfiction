You're assuming that Phoenix feather wands are common. There are exactly 3 Phoenix feather wands mentioned in the books: Harry's wand, Voldemort's wand, and a maple wand that Harry tries in Ollivanders in the first book. Compare this to the 15 Dragon Heartstring and the 13 Unicorn Hair wands.

For all we know, Phoenix feather wands are just as rare as Phoenixes, which would make it rare to even encounter another Phoenix wand, let alone one from the same Phoenix.
