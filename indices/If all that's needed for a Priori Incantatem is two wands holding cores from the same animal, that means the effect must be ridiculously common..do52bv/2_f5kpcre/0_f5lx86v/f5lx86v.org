You are forgetting that Dumbledore knew bout the brother wands and had every incentive to look into what that might mean in the grand scheme of things. He could have come across the mention of a strange phenomenon that is so obscure, it happened only a handful of times in history. Or not. But either way, I reckon what happened at the graveyard is anything but rare.
