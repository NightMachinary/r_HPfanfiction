It's time for MATH!

Okay, so, estimates of wizarding population vary wildly and I'm not getting into that. The number I'm going to be using is 20,000 wizards in Magical Britatin (1000 hogwarts students representing 1/20 of the gen pop). This means that, on average, Olivander is selling (and thus presumably making) at least 143 wands a year. If he makes something more like one wand a day and keeps normal work days then he'd be making more, about 250, but that would be a big surplus, so call it an even 200 (this makes sense since he has to collect supplies too, as well as man the counter for a few weeks each year).

I'm not sure how many heart strings a dragon has, but it's probably at least 10. Unicorn's have lots of tail hair and Phoenixes have lots of feathers (although, thinking about it for a second, holy shit how many phoenixes are their in the UK that something like 1/3 of all the wands there, 66 per year, can be made with them? Fawkes only donated 2!) so this matters less. If we assume Ollivander uses all three wand core types equally then about 66 wands of each core type are produced. Call it ten wands with the same dragon core, and god only knows how many for the others. I would guess Ollivander takes something like an equal amount of tail hairs and feathers usually, so wands are being made in sets of ~10 wands with the same animal for a core each year.

BUT

Ollivander doesn't sell them all at the same time! It makes sense that he crafts them all more or less together, he doesn't just leave the dragon heartstrings sitting for years before using them, but then that wand might sit for years in his shop until someone matches it! By a similar measure however, tail hair and phoenix feathers don't kill their hosts to produce. Horses live ~30 years, unicorns are presumably similarish, which means Ollivander could potentially have as many as 300 wands made with the same unicorn's tail hairs. This seems a little unlikely imo, because wands seem to be very bespoke, Ollivander seems like the kind of guy that tries to collect from a very wide number of animals to get a wide variety of wands and ensure a good fit. Not just unicorn and beech wood, but a specific unicorn and a specific beech tree.

In summary: it might actually be pretty common in the worst case scenario; but it is also possible the person using the same wand core as you died a century ago, or that you were simply never in a pitched death battle with them.
