There's a fanon interpretation where the effect doesn't occur with Unicorn tail hair/dragon heartstrings because those cores could require being woven together from the raw materials from multiple animals. I'm also a fan of the fanon interpretation where brother wand cores require not just coming from the same magical beast, but at the same time/aren't guaranteed in the harvesting process.

But I think the points about the general lack of circumstances where you'd be hitting someone else's spell with your own, and it being common enough to be recognized, are fair points. Ollivander supposedly only uses three types of cores.
