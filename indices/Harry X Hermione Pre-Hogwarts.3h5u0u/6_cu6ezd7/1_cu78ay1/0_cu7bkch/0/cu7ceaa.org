If I had read it originally thinking it was a crack!fic, I think I would have liked it. As a matter of fact I read quite a bit of it...because I wanted to find out what happened...but it just...ugh. For every bad thing that happens there is an insane amount of good to balance it. Babies ever after makes me puke in my mouth, and the whole pack premise was a put-off. The family itself is TOO perfect, despite occasional obligatory flaw. The prophesies are just awful and cringe inducing. And don't get me started on the dreamscapes and founders...
