Well, the Triwizard is a big plot point in the story

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elder-Sect]])

has Harry returning to Hogwarts for the Triwizard in Chapter 6. Having the Uber Powers of the Witches and Warlocks of the Bewitched TV series, he really doesn't want to play, and Cedric, remembering Harry from his first year, starts telling Fleur and Krum that they've lost.

has Harry, raised by Tony Stark, having warned Dumbledore that a seer had told him that he would be entered into the Triwizard, and of course, he was. Cedric starts telling stories to the other champions about Harry's adventures around chapter 22, killing the troll, being abducted by aliens, and other bits of fun. Harry tells Rita all about the lawyers that work for his father and godfather, the kind of lawyers who sue reporters into poverty and ensure they can never work in the English speaking world for the rest of their lives. The Dragons show up for the first task because it was funny, the 2nd and 3rd tasks have no resemblance to canon (the third is the most fun in my opinion.)

has Harry, cheat and bribe his way through the Triwizard, the champions soon figure out that the whole thing is dangerous bullshit, and that they can only trust each other, so they hang out and talk.

I've got others, but those are my favorites from my own works.
