While some people may not enjoy it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold]] is one good options. However, the time travel in the story is limited to about 3-5 chapters in the middle of the story. If you give me some more time, I could probably find others.
