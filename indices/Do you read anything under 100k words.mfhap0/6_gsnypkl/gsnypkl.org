I do. In fact these days I don't read anything that's +200k just because I don't want to invest too much in a story only to realize half-way that I hate it. Also I think you don't need +100 chapters and +5000 words per chapter to tell a good story... sure there might be some authors that have these kind of stories because there is a lot happening but I feel like most authors just try to get the word count up there and become really boring in the process.
