I used to think like this, I used to love finding a new 600k word long fic to dive into, but over the years that has gradually changed.

Really, length is a really poor indicator of quality. Philosopher's Stone was 76k words. The Hobbit is 95k words. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is 38k words. Nineteen Eighty-Four is 89k words.

People often mention how 'epic' fanfics are often supremely bloated, with too little substance to keep them from collapsing into an unstructured mess, but what I don't think people mention so much is that unfinished 'shorter' fics have the same problem. They just cut off earlier. That, I think, is why some shorter fics can leave you with the feeling of being unsatisfying.

However, a completed fic in the 20-100k range is a rare gem. I've really come to appreciate self-contained stories that try to avoid getting bogged down in drudgery.
