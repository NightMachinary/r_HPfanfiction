I primarily read longer fic, but there have been plenty of shorter fics I've enjoyed over the years. My sweet spot is between 40k-200k, though I really love series that are broke into those amounts because it gives a chance for longer arcs intermingled with shorter arcs, which is what I aim for when I write.
