- your story's all wrong - linkao3(1243798)

  - It's Cho Chang/Hermione

- Insecurities - linkao3(22145584)

  - It's Pansy Parkinson/Hermione

  - It's Luna Lovegood/Hermione.

- Ivy - linkao3(3240926)

  - It's Ginny Weasley/Hermione
  - (I know it's another Weasley, but it's a bit rarer?)

- Francais - linkao3(17699189)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- He'll never like you like me - linkao3(17764199)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- Witnessed Here in Time and Blood - linkffn(10090975)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation

  - It's Neville Longbottom/Hermione - linkffn(5537755)
  - There's a bit of Draco/Hermione, Draco Neville and Draco/Hermione/Neville in it, but the main pairing is Neville/Hermione
  - It's technically incomplete, but it reads like a first novel of an entire series. Just no sequel.

There are many other great fics with rarepairs, but I'll send you these to start. I really hope you enjoy them.
