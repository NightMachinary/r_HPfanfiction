The closest fic that I have read to your prompt is linkffn(Courage and Cunning). Salazar became immortal and polyjuices himself as baby Harry to destroy Voldemort, but then accidentally gets amnesia. Just a warning though, it has been on hiatus for several years, and the author hasn't updated since 2016.
