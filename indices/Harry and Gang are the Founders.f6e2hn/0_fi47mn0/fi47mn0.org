I haven't seen any fics like that before but I have some questions about which characters would be who? My first instinct is

-Harry (or Draco)/Salazar

-Hermione/Rowena

-Ron/Godric (though, Neville could fit this role as well)

But I can't think of who would fit into the Helga character. I just can't see Ginny in that role, Luna oddly enough fits closer in my head than her.
