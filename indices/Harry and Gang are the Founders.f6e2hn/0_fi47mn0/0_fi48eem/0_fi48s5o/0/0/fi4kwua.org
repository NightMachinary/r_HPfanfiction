I'll probably use Neville though, since he seems to fit that role more. I'm not a fan of gender-bending though >.<

Or luna.... Argh, I'll think about that, for now I'm on a hunt for such a story. Or a similar one

Though I already got a reason in my mind for why Neville will turn into a girl if I go that way
