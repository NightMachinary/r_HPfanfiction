linkffn(10756667) has Harry be a reincarnated Salazar Slytherin. For that matter, linkffn(10709411) by the same author is somewhat more similar to your request, though Harry is the only time-traveling founder. linkffn(8550820) has the entire gang travel to the founder's era due to the Department of Mysteries fiasco, though they themselves are not the founders.
