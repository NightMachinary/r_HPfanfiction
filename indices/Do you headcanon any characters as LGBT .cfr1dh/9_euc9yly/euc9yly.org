Given how sore a topic that was thirty/twenty years ago, it wouldn't be /that/ surprising to find some closeted/subconsciously non-straight people in Hogwarts, but for the same reason I don't exactly expect people to announce their preferences publicly either.

As for the question OP asked, since Dumbledore's preference is now technically canon I no longer have to. :p
