I always had it in my head that Lavender and Parvati would've gotten together if the former hadn't died, but that's me channeling the fandom in a sense.

Aside from that, Harry reads as bisexual or just ambiguously into cute people, but I think that comes down to how Rowling writes the appearances of men, and isn't exactly Harry's perspective necessarily. Doesn't stop me from thinking that way, though.

Ginny feels bisexual too, if more female-leaning albeit ending up with Harry in the end.

Tonks could've been a fascinating look into how being able to be any gender could right fuck with someone's sense of self and gender if she wasn't, y'know, killed too. Maybe non-binary or at least non-conforming in any event.

Katie, Angelina and Alicia are absolutely 100% ot3 and none of you can tell me otherwise.

Oliver and Marcus hate-flirting is also great.
