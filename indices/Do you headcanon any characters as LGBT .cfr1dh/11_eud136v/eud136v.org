The HP series is not the best when it comes to LGBT representation, but... the characters I do get LGBT vibes from are almost alway male. Peobably because JKR is a straight woman, and also because the HP series just has more central male figures.

Definitely getting bisexual vibes for Harry. As we've discussed elsewhere in this thread, he's more likely to notice how handsome the GUYS are than he is to notice how pretty the GIRLS are. He goes on about the handsomeness of Cedric and Bill, and he can't see the young Tom Riddle without noticing how very good-looking he is..So I definitely headcanon Harry as bisexual, just very much in denial about it.

I can sort of get some bi vibes from Ron too, but not as strongly. Ron is a lot more clearly into girls than Harry is, but there is that "celebrity crush" on Krum... Ron strikes me more as bicurious though.

Charlie is asexual. This is probably the one I'm most convinced about. Not only is he like the only Weasley never to get married or show any interest in romance at all, but he plain does not seem interested.

Same with Tom Riddle, really. Cursed Child aside, I plain can't see him bothering with sex or romance. (Bellatrix CLEARLY has the hots for him, but he mainly cares about her loyalty... it's obvious he doesn't care at all about her.)

Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy? Totally into each other. I mean, I'm not a shipper at all and even I was shocked that they didn't kiss even ONCE during the play. The only girl Scorpius pursues is the girl who blatatly HATES him... maybe it's just to get rid of the creepy nature of his pestering of Rose, but I kind of saw Scorpius as a deeply closeted homosexual who pursued Rose precisely because he knew he would never have a chance with her.

I don't really get all that many LGBTQ vibes from the female characters. I'm a queer woman myself, so I'd definitely appreciate some queer-coded ladies here, but... really, almost all the female characters read as either VERY heterosexual, or completely without any hints about their sexualities.

For example, Professor Sprout. If you told me it was canon that she was in a lesbian relationship with Madam Hooch, I'd have no problems believing that... but if you told me it was canon that she was married to a man and had three children, I'd believe that too.

So when I headcanon any girls as LGBTQ, it's not really based on anything I read in canon. It's more like "Yeah, it COULD be like this."

Like, I headcanon Luna as being pansexual; she's not bothered at all what sex or gender other people are and mostly just goes with the flow... but there's no canon hints here, it's just something I personally feel fits the character.
