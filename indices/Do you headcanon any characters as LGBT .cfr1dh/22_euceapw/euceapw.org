Dean is the only guy among the male characters close to Harry that I can see as being gay, and that's because he's basically a blank slate. Even Dumbledore doesn't fit as gay for me, regardless of JKRs tweets. I can accept Remus if you streach it, but certainly not with bloody Sirius! It's just very hard when you have known certain characters for decades to suddenly imagine them completely different.

Among the girls it's easy to see many bisexuals, but that's probably because I have never had any issues with picturing two girls together, it has always seem just normal to me, expected even.

I don't believe magicals can have transgender issues though, as too many fanfics have used all kinds of full gender switching magics to make me accept anything else. For that reason alone I find fics that include it completely unbelievable, even worst that the usual super angsty Lord Harry King of Europe Potter-Evans-Slytherin-Merlin.
