  Well, it's almost canonical already, but obviously, Grindelwald should be gay for his relationship with Dumbledore to work best, even if it's up to interpretation whether there were any actual feelings on Grindelwald's side.

I'm of a similar mind, but I see Grindelwald as being egocentric and narcissistic, where he only stayed with Dumbledore for as long as he did because he saw Albus as being almost worthy of his radiant magnificence.
