Well, it's almost canonical already, but obviously, Grindelwald should be gay for his relationship with Dumbledore to work best, even if it's up to interpretation whether there were any actual /feelings/ on Grindelwald's side.

I don't feel strongly about it, but I like the idea that Ron is bi without realizing it in his teenage years, an idea suggested by others in relation to his apparent "celebrity crush" on Viktor Krum. While we're talking bi, I wrote Pansy Parkinson as such in /Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, purely for the look on Draco's face when she dumps him for a Hufflepuff girl --- so there's that.

In an effort to cull the creepy undertones some people try to read into him, I like to think of Lockhart as ace. All his getting-girls-to-swoon is pure ego-boosting, as hollow as anything he ever does. And maybe, if you want to get psychological, "overcompensating" for the feelings of inadequacy asexual people are known to have.
