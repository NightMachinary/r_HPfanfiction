  He is susceptible to Veela charms... but it's noticable that Harry is the only one who suspects that Fleur is part Veela since he identifies the same vibes from her. Almost like he's not that used to seeing girls that way.

FYI, it was Ron who identified Fleur as half-Veela.

As for the rest - I've seen such arguments before, but they always seem to me to confuse the narrative voice of the series. Namely, it forgets that the narrative voice of the HP stories is not Harry.

The story centres around Harry, and (with a few exceptions) we are only let in on things that Harry knows, but the "voice" of the narrator is not Harry's internal monologue. We know this because the narrative always specifically distinguishes Harry's thoughts from the general narrative, either by use of the "Harry thought" tag, or through shifting into first-person italics.

The narrative is so heavily seasoned with Harry's feelings and thoughts that it can be easy to forget this, but it's most easily seen in descriptive passages, where the narrative voice is quite distinct from Harry's own, often using vocabulary that you would never hear Harry saying.

E.g.

PS:

  ‘Yeah, that's a goblin,' said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps towards him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.

  Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn't say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.

  Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.

  Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.

  “Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.

  There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.

  Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore's words; Harry had sent back his ‘yes' with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.

  And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
#+end_quote

Words like swarthy, fervent, gaunt, diatribe, tumultuous, austere, missive, unerring, splayed... these are not words which belong in Harry's mouth or head.

As a result, I don't really think that there's anything to be concluded about Harry from the descriptive passages of the HP books, except in those sections where the narrative distinguishes the description as something that Harry has specifically noted, like the PS quote above.
