Hmm... I agree that the narrative voice definitely does not belong to Harry, but the fact remains that the narrative is written in Harry's perspective. When we are treated to descriptions about something or someone, it's because /Harry/ has noticed them and /Harry/ is looking at them. While the voice does not belong to Harry, the perspective does, so I think there is something to be said about the argument for Harry being bi. The words may not be his, but the very existence of the description does indicate that he is noticing their appearances. And apparently, more likely to linger on the appearances of men - though I admit I never noticed such a tendency when I read the books. Then again, when I read the books, I hadn't really been exposed to the idea of sexualities other than heterosexuality.

That all being said, I doubt JK Rowling ever intended for Harry to be anything other than heterosexual.
