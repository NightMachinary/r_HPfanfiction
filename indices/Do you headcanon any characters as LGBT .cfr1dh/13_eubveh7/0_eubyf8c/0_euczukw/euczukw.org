Yes! I've noticed that too! Harry is a LOT more likely to internally go on about how good-looking BOYS are. With GIRLS he's a lot more likely to find something odd or ugly about their appearances... the one girl he consistently thinks is pretty is Cho, otherwise his description of girls tends to be neutral or critical.

Even Ginny is usually described in neutral terms; it's pretty easy to infer from the text (and other characters' reactions to her) that she MUST be pretty nice-looking, Harry never really focuses much on her appearance at all. He's attracted to her, yes, but it seems to be more about her personality.

But if a BOY is handsome, Harry NOTICES. More than once he notices just how handsome Bill and Cedric are... but also with the young Tom Riddle he DEFINITELY notices how good-looking he is. Same with when he sees pictures of Sirius as a young boy; Harry is very quick to notice that Sirius is very easy on the eyes.

He is susceptible to Veela charms... but it's noticable that Harry is the only one who suspects that Fleur is part Veela since he identifies the same vibes from her. Almost like he's not that used to seeing girls that way.

It's probably a biproduct of being written by a heterosexual woman, but still... once you notice it, it's really hard to accept Harry as completely straight. I can definitely see him as being attracted to guys and just HUGELY in denial about it. He does like girls too... I mean, he pined over Cho enough and he got REALLY into Ginny, but he spends much more time thinking about the handsome guys. So yeah, my headcanon is that Harry's bisexual.
