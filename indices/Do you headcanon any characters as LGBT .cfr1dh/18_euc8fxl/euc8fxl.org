Lots of people on this sub, apparently: No because unless it specifically SAYS they're LGBT they can't be, even if it also doesn't say they're straight. LGBT people in MY Harry Potter, ew!

E: I'm starting to feel like someone has a vendetta against me now guys. I'm flattered but also frustrated that the downvotes come streaming in every single time I, a longterm LGBT fan mention my own personal LGBT headcanons or even the fact that a certain proportion of our readers have an issue with people having those. You're proving my point. Who are you to control what other people think? Isn't the whole point of fanfic us enjoying playing in a sandbox to expand the world and explore unexplored territory?
