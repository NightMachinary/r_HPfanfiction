You know what,whatever. Who's making personal attacks now? This sub can be full of some lovely people and sometimes we have great open-minded discussions but ither times it's got people bullishly throwing their weight around because they don't like someone else's imagination. My post observes a recurrent trend. Frankly, you guys are the majority and will always be able to out-upvote us if you take it upon yourselves to do so. But don't kid yourself and try and make out that coincidentally all LGBT folk are just attention seeking and complaining about things that aren't real, fighting shadows.
