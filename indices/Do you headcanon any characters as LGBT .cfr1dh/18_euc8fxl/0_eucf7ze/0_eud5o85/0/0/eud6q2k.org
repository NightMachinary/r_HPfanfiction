I'm just intrigued at how a thread ostensibly for people to share their personal opinions can possibly attract the indication of disagreement.

I'm not sure this discussion with you is going anywhere though I feel that last comment borders on rudeness. If you'd like to portray me as someone I'm not in order to feel validated, that's on you, but I've been a member of this sub for a long time, I make good posts that people like, and I'm not going anywhere.
