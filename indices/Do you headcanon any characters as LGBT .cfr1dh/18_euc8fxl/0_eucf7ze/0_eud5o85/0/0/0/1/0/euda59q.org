No, it's clear that you were discussing your opinions. But consider the following two discussions:

Conversation A

#+begin_quote
  "My favourite colour is blue," Tom said.

  "I prefer green," Richard said.
#+end_quote

Conversation B

#+begin_quote
  "My favourite colour is blue, because it reminds me of the sea," Tom said, "my fondest memories are of the sea, and that's why I like blue so much."

  "I prefer green," Richard said. "I'm a big fan of nature... forests, parks, fields, all that stuff. For me, green is just so peaceful."
#+end_quote

Even when discussing opinions rather than facts, people are generally interested in your /reasons/, not your opinions themselves. To be frank, a conversation where people just state their opinions is pretty much entirely pointless. Unreasoned opinions don't really have any value. Unless a person /justifies/ their opinion, there's no content there to engage with.
