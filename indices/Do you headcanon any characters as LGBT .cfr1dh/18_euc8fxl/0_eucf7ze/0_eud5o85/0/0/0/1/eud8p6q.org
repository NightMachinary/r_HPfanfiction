It may just be dialect from where I'm from that is causing confusion. I understood the statements I made to (to me, very obviously) be opinions rather than facts.

If the question is phrased 'do *you* headcanon characters to be LGBT?' and I answer 'X character, definitely' my intention - and the logical read of that answer to me - is that I am saying 'I *definitely* headcanon X character as...' rather than 'Definitely, *the text says that* X character is...'
