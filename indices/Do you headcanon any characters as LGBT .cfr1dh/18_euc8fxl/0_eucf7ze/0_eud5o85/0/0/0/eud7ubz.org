  I'm just intrigued at how a thread ostensibly for people to share their personal opinions can possibly attract the indication of disagreement.

Well, it's generally common for people to give reasons for their opinions in a discussion. Otherwise it's not really a discussion, just a group of individuals each declaring their own views without any real interaction occurring. The discussion arises out of people talking about the relative merits of the reasons given for their differing viewpoints.

This is doubly so when it comes to "headcanon", which ostensibly refers to "the canon in your head" i.e. canon, plus your personal additions to it.

Assuming that we are all rational people who seek only to adopt logically consistent viewpoints, our headcanon will be consistent with the established canon and perhaps even supported by elements which are implicit within that established canon.

While there may well be people downvoting you out of sheer dislike for the topic of the thread, I don't think that's the case here. The second most upvoted comment in the thread is one stating Harry to be bi /and giving a reason for that opinion/ - the emphasis the GoF narrative places on Cedric Diggory's appearance.

I suspect the reason you are being downvoted is that you are stating your opinions as facts which cannot be disputed (and that to dispute them is somehow wrong), rather than a position adopted following some form of reasoning.
