The issue here is that you are using your post to throw shit around. You should have phrased that without that disguised attack or your victimisation, that's just phishing for trouble.

That's also one of the issues I'm seeing here very often, people opening threads about how they are /clearly/ being persecuted, or how everyone is homophobic.. then I check their profiles and see nothing but sly provocations on every comment, and going full drama queen the moment someone gets tired of the same shit on every post.

TLDR: Learn to write a comment without implying that everyone here is after you, enough is enough.

P.S I will personally downvote you, because your post is a clear bait for derailing.
