I think of Tonks as polysexual in part for her being a shapeshifter. I also see Remus as a rather confused more-gay-than-bi-sexual, for whom Tonks was an ideal match. Their whole dynamic was inverted from usual; he was the caregiver, the teacher, the worrier, and Tonks was the aggressor, the protector and the breadwinner.

Also I see Ginny as being bisexual but preferring boys. Her fixation on the Holyhead Harpies and general sportiness is contrasted with her dating several boys over the span of the story, and part of me thinks Harry appreciated her ability to see both sides of the attraction game.

I have no problem believing that Scorpius and Albus would end up in bed together.

I have an unsubstantiated headcanon that Alicia Spinnet was gay and loved Angelina, despite it being a one-way attraction.
