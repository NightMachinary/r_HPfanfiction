The lifelong single man in his 30s who has coded HIV and who hates himself, yet cares about children and is paternal in his own way? Who has one close friendship with a man who he embraces when he sees him back? Later they buy Harry a join birthday gift.

And the short haired punky girl who seems to be the only woman in an all boys club, with an androgynous name who hates being feminized by her mother, and who is clumsy and unladylike?

Throughout fiction over the last at least 50 years when you couldn't openly write about gay characters often writers would use traits like the above, either lowkey associated with gay stereotypes or very suggestive of the opposite gender stereotypes. JK was a university educated, literary woman, and she by the time she got to these books had a strong team of editors around her. Those archetypes were suggestive and not uncommon. She herself admits she used an interest in knitting to indicate Dumbledore's sexuality. There's plenty textual evidence that those may at least have been indications before she ultimately decided to take the characters in a different direction.
