I've been in this fandom a long time and for a long time those things were tacitly assumed by fans with any awareness of queer culture. Tbh I really don't know why people have a such a bone to pick now that even sourced textual examples phrased politely get downvoted.

There are plenty articles and archived discussions out there from the earlier days of fandom to look up if you seriously have an interest. If not, then,well, no biggie. I'm going to close here in any case because this style of discussion where instradof each of us having an interpretation based on the text, one of us must be Right and one of us Wrong, isn't working for me.
