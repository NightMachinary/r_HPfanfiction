Remus doesn't trust himself in a relationship because he's a werewolf, Rowling described Sirius and Remus's reunion as "embracing like brothers".

He's paternal towards and cares about the son of his best friend like a normal person who doesnt dislike children tends to do.

They buy a joint birthday gift because Remus doesnt have a lot of money, and Sirius can't be seen in public.

Tonks hates her first name for a very good reason, anybody under the age of 40 will see her first name, and immediately single out "Nympho". If she went by that, she'd have spent her 7 years at Hogwarts being constantly laughed at or with her head in a toilet. I'd hate that name too if I were her.

Just because some people did it, doesnt mean Rowling did. Besides, do you really think she'd have kept her mouth shut if Remus was gay?
