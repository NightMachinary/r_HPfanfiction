I downvote not for your headcanon but for the argument that Tonks/Lupin were queercoded and JKR backtracked. I strongly disagree with that argument and don't thus don't like to see the accusation hurled at JKR.

I love to read Wolfstar but always nope out of a fic that begins with that particular rant.
