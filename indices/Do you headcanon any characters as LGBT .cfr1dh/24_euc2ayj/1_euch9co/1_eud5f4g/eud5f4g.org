Rita is described as having 'mannish' hands and other body characteristics on more than one occasion, so arguably the read is there. Witch Please podcast discusses this at length and there's also a discussion of it [[http://www.cosforums.com/cosarchive/archive/index.php/t-23138.html][from 2004 here]] - based solely on the text and JKR's descriptions, which are well-known to lay hints.

On that point, I'm slightly intrigued with the way this thread has turned. In my mimd we have been discussing how certain things /could/ be, supported by our own personal reading of the text. Is it the case that others on the thread are perceiving us to be discussing how things /are/ or /must/ be? I'm struggling to understand otherwise why so many of the politely and textually sourced comments on here are attracting downvotes.
