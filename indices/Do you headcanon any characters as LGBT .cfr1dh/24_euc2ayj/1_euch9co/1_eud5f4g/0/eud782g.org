Actually like I quoted she's described as heavy and thick, that's a polite way of calling someone fat if there ever was one. Nonetheless when taking Harry's point of view into account we must seriously considering the fact that we do have an unreliable narrator, that's on top of a writer that doesn't know how to write a male perspective. (Much less a teenager!)

I agree that /some/ people use downvote to disagree, but in general is when you say something utterly stupid or insulting. I have seen one comment of yours that basically says being over 30 and having HIV means you're gay. How did you expect no one to downvote that?

Also don't put words or actions on JKRs hands that have no proof or basis. We can rant at her all we want, but it does have consequences. People will defend even her more stupid tweets, I know it because I've learned that lesson long ago in CC debates.
