It didn't say that, it explained that those were indicators used at the time to indicate homosexuality when it couldn't be outright stated - which JK may potentially have neen bound by too, as the UK had a law against promoting homosexuality to children that wasn't repealed until 2003.

My understanding was that I was not making accusations, I was stating the possibility. Possibly the phrasing led to people taking an interpretation I didn't intend. For the record of course I don't think we have any way of seeing into JK's head! we can only guess and make theories. My own there were largely just based on the history of coded and veiled representation when it couldn't be said outright.
