Figg? Seriously? lol

I disagree on Sirius vehemently, he is straight as an arrow, but just fucking broken. Lupin is a peaceful individual that dislikes conflict because of a self imposed moral code, but I don't see him as anything but straight, though I can accept it because of the entire Wolf play. Harry is straight, he would in fact never accept a touch from a man as I see it. Tonks as bi is normal, in the books she was basically a punk girl that liked adventure, and taking everything about her into account then it's obvious she would have plenty of female friends, but only guys for romance.

Lockhart is... probably bi curious, but it's far easier to imagine him raping and memory charming girls than boys, unless they are worth collecting. And yes, I see him as a pedophile and a rapist, that's for sure. Fucking fanon has filled my head with this for me to imagine anything else.

I don't get where you came up with Bullstrode as I remember literally nothing of her beyond just being.. big boned, and Rita seems..

  Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jewelled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.

well, I'm just gonna call unreliable narrator on that one. She's probably fat.
