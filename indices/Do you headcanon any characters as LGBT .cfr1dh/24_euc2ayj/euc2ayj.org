Harry, Lupin, Sirius, Tonks and Professor Sprout at the very least. Possibly Mrs Figg, possibly Charlie Weasley. Dumbledore I guess although I often headcanoned him as asexual, even before I knew the word.

Mostly bisexual, Sprout as a lesbian because I always got the vibe from how she was described - brisk and earthy are pretty long held indicators in classic lit when coding as gay women.

For that matter Lupin and Tonks are both pretty heavily queercoded in canon up to book 6 or so which is why it was pretty crappy of JKR to backtrack on it. She had to have known what she was doing after the first book she did it in.

Besides that I like to headcanon characters as bisexual when I get the vibe or there's no hard textual evidence otherwise, and that covers the rest of my headcanoned characters. Tbh there could be plenty more too like Lockhart, Millicent Bulstrode etc. There's arguably textual suggestive evidence of Rita Skeeter being a trans woman. But those were never ones I picked up on my initial readings. Having said that I don't discount them when I see them in fic and could happily read fics where any number of characters were LGBT in a magic world where such things might not even be noteworthy.

E: downvotes for my own headcanon, really? Why ask the question if you don't want answers? Seriously I feel like this is disrespectful. Aren't we better at engaging than this?
