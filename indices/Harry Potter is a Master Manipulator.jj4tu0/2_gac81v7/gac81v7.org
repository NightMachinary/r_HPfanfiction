Harry! snarled in anger his plan to turn ronald weasley into his general had failed. He should have been more careful about ron's insecurities. he should have known entering the triwizard tournament would set them off.

Harry chuckled and smiled to himself. all was not yet lost he would just have to guide ron back to the right path. he will buy ronald a nice broom and a ton of muggle books on chess and act like he is apologetic for not helping ron enter the tournament.
