Holy shit. I'm impressed and scared lol. How is he keeping Hermione in line? Is she actually as crazy as Bellatrix but way smarter? Is Harry seducing her to keep her in line? Was SPEW a front for recruitment for his House Elf Army? I actually like the idea that Dobby is as twisted as Harry. He got beat too many times in the head and is fanatically loyal to Harry. His death was upsetting because he was the General of the House Elf Army and was killed by Bellatrix which is why Harry arranged for her to be killed rather than converted.
