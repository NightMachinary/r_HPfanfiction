Allow me to explain in detail, after meeting the Wealslys Harry antagonizes Malfoy because the Malfoys are viewed as a dark family. This also has the benefit of strengthening his camaraderie with Ron. The troll incident was instigated so Harry could gain a more suitable right hand. The fiasco with Quirrell was so that Harry could secretly gain the sorcerer's stone for him self, he left broken shards of red glass on the ground and stunned himself. Harry defeats Voldemort for the second time and kills off his competetors for immortality. In second year Harry is influencing Tom(Ginny) to do the attacks, he releases the fact that he is a parselmouth so that others think that he is the one attacking the students, this will make a greater impact when he 'captures the culprit'. He has Colin Creevey petrified because the foolish mudblood caught Harry while he was instructing Tom(read Ginny). Harry destroys Colin's camera and obliviates him of the incident. Harry then kills the basilisk with a fake sword made to look like Gryffindor's. In his third year Harry modifies Lumos in order to create a fake Patronus, it was the only magic beyond his wretched soul. Harry frees the 'innocent' Sirius so that Dumbledore, and by extension the Order, would believe that he is on the side of justice. In reality Sirius and Peter worked together to kill the Potters, theynthought that the family's fortune would be left to them, when Harry survived, Peter blamed everything on Sirius and faked his death. Fourth year was just for publicity, even aspirating dark lords need a little fame. In his fifth year Harry places Umbridge in the school so that his potential future enemies would not be properly trained. The DA was meant to be a secret militia but Harry grew bored with the idea and began teaching them fake spells, with the aid of the ROR he made the students believe that they were actually learning. It was that year he learned of Sirius' betrayal, along with having him killed Harry revealed the continued existence of his competitor. In Harry's sixth year Dumbledore(the old fool) finally outlived his usefullness, Harry planted his plan with Snape, and had the Headnaster killed. The Horcruxes were never a problem, Harry destroyed each of them in his fifth year when he stumbled upon the diadem in the ROR. The entire Horcrux hunt in his seventh year was simply a cover for Harry's secret search of the Lively Hallows, artifacts created by Life as a counter balance to the Deathly Hallows created by death. Ron leaving him was not a part of the plan, Harry always knew the boy was disloyal. Once Ron arrived back home he found a stash of candies left to him by Harry, shortly after eating one of the Loyalty potion laced confectionaries Ron returned to his rightful Lord and Master, Harry. Days later Dobby discovered Harry's secret army of house elves! Needles to say, Dobby was killed by Harry's enchanted knife. Once Harry collected all three Lively Hallows, he made his way to Hogwarts where Harry killed his rival and obtained a position of unbeatable political power, onwards Harry influeces Hermione i to becoming minister and slowly shape the British Wizarding world into his own image.

But wait, there's more!

Harry also collected the Deathly Hallows before the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry is the Master of Life and Death! While Hermoine reshapes Magical Britain, Harry and his sidekick Ron travel the the ICW where Harry reveals his mantles of power, after a breif duel to the death with the Sumpreme Mugwump and a few (read several) changes to the Global magical accords, Harry becomes the ruler of all magical societies in the world.

Just in case no one noticed I borrowed a few ideas from the creative redditors that posted before me.
