I'm not really sure how to post the links on here, but I have a couple favorites by the same authors. The one that got me back into fanfiction was Eagle's Nest by HeartOfAspen, which is still incomplete but over 60 chapters, as well as star crossed which is complete and fairly long. I assume you've read isolation by bexchan, but they have another one called hunted, if you haven't checked that out. Colubrina has some good ones including the green girl, the muddy princess and rebuilding (the chapters are somewhat short but there's 300). Presque toujours pur by shayalonnie is also a really good one. I have plenty of others, but hopefully that's enough to get you started!
