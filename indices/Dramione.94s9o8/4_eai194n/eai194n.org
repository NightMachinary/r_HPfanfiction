The best Dramione I have read was Draconian by heppbrunets on wattpad. sadly it's been taken down because of plagiarism. The next favorite of mine is Once upon a thyme by zensho. It's about time travel, both Hermione and Draco are sent back in time and their roles are reversed. Hermione is lady of the Manor and Draco is a peasant boy. They try to work out a way back to their own time along with their differences. I am also writing my own DM/HG fanfiction on wattpad- Labyrinth. It's on going fic. It's about how Draco saves Hermione from Malfoy manor and the journey ahead. You can give it a go if you like.
