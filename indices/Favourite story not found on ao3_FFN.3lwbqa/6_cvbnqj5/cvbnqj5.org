I was a Buffy fanfiction reader to begin with (well, Ranma 1/2 before that, but that's unrelated to this) and I had read the HP books, but didn't really bother with fanfiction, so I have to link the fics that got me into HPFF back in the first place: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6136/Tassos+The+Flat+Next+Door.htm][Tassos' The Flat Next Door]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8175/AnimeRonin+Reincarnation+Can+Suck.htm][AnimeRonin's Reincarnation Can Suck]].

The former has withheld the test of time and change in tastes better than the latter, but both are still on the level I'd consider readable even now, it's just the former would probably be one I'd favorite (or Recommend given the way TtH works) and the latter may not make the cut according to my current standards.
