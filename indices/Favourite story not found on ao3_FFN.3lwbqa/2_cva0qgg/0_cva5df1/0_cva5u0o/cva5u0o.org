Ah, I realize the set up is a bit confusing - those stories listed first, in the series description are actually side stories from other authors.

The first story of the series is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=26436]] . It's set in the canon HP world, after the war, but with lots of crossover elements as lots of heroes have to work together to battle a threat to them all.

The next story, Cross Purposes ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=27744]] ) is a collection of follow-up stories and arcs, some set in the HP world, some not (but some of those featuring an alternate Hermione). Not too many Harry Potter stories there though.

The third story, ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=28614]] ), is set in the Alex Mack verse, but features the adult versions of the trio from "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived" ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]] ) in a number of chapters.
