I've read several but am completely blanking on the titles.

However not to be totally useless, Potions & Snitches has a Self-Harm warning tag for their stories. Potion and Snitches is a Snape & Harry Gen archive (no HP/SS slash) that features stories where Snape is Harry's mentor, guardian or parent, to name a few. You could browse through the stories there to see if anything sounds interesting.
