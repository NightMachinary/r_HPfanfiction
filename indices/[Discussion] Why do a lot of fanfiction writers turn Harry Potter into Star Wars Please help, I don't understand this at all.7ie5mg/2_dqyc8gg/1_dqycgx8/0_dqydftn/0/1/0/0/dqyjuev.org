Well, not really. However, it set most of the tropes modern "high fantasy" (the ones that take place in fictional, medieval-like settings a la /Dungeons and Dragons/, unlike /Harry Potter/). For instance, orcs were pretty much created wholecloth by Tolkien, and antagonist Sauron was the the first of many evil, very powerful villains calling themselves the Dark Lord, cheating death, and having their true name rarely spoken out of fear.
