Yeah, Tolkien elves are basically the fair folk, as are Hobbits.

On an unrelated note, I recently had the idea that the One Ring gives its wearer abilities based on the natural abilities of the wearer, as a for of amplifying it. That's why Bilbo and Frodo turn invisible when they wear it, as Hobbits are known to be able to 'go unnoticed by larger folk'.
