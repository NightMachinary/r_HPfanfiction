  I recently had the idea that the One Ring gives its wearer abilities based on the natural abilities of the wearer, as a for of amplifying it. That's why Bilbo and Frodo turn invisible when they wear it, as Hobbits are known to be able to 'go unnoticed by larger folk'.

Tolkien's universe is pretty well documented, though. This isn't the reason. The hobbits were not "turned invisible," really. They were shifted into the Unseen Realm, the "wraith-world." Extended use of the rings eventually leaves one entirely in that realm. The invisibility has no dependence on their race, as hobbits. It was entirely because of their mortality. A man would be turned invisible in just the same way, but an elf would not.
