Everyone seems to forget that Slughorn is an example of a Slytherin who isn't an evil git, and uses his Slytherin qualities for positive things (mutually beneficial connections).

While it's true that we didn't get to see a "good Slytherin" among Harry's age group, it's not exactly unrealistic that those specific generations would be carried away by pureblood ideology and peer pressure. There's a decent amount of "house unity" messages in the books themselves.
