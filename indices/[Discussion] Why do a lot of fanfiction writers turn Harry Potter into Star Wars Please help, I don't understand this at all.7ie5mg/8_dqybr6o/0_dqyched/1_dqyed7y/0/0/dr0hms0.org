“Most of those stories” is what they wrote. There are always exceptions, but the majority of the top-upvote stories as counted on ff dot net is upvoted not for artistic merit but rather because it provides simple pleasure for simple folk. A lot of fics in the top however many for upvotes are genuine crap.
