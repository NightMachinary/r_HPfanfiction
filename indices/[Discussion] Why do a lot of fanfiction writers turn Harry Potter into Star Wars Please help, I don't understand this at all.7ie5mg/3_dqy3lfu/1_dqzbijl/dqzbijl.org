I've never understood the harem thing really, especially when it has a romance element too.

The romance element seems like heavy-handedly papering over the cracks that the story essentially becomes one of collecting female 'characters' like dolls with different colored wigs to put into the hero's item bag as he progresses and gains achivements etc.

It's kinda a little sad to see when you get the sense the author thinks that that's what healthy relationships /are/.
