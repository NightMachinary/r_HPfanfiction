But it should have some amount of "realism". Your girlfriend's mother will not join you if she is happily married unless her husband is involved as well (and they both have that particular fantasy but we are talking about smut here so that is a given). But if her husband cheated on her and left, leaving the GF's mom an emotional wreck you can probably convince her to join you in a night/lifetime of debauchery. Keep it easy, make it somewhat "believable". I am not expecting a bad spinoff of Bismarck's realpolitik, I am expecting the reason why people have sex and "being horny and having the opportunity" is perfectly alright.

Let's go back to my favourite example, "the free use experience". The whole Harry being able to change into a girl thing is a good starting point. Want his sister to be part of the fun? Why not? Want Harry to explore how it feels to have sex as both a girl and a boy while portraying a slow shift from "sole attraction to girls" towards bisexuality? If you pull that one off you are writing some good stuff. Having characters develop over the course of the story? That's good.

But why would you throw in some absolutely retarded legalisation that says "either get raped and pretend to enjoy it or say goodbye to your future prospects" into the mix and spend most of your work dealing with that? Would it be that difficult to centre the story about a voluntary sex club where you fuck everything that moves? You could even keep the original motivation why Harry's sister joined for fuck's sake.
