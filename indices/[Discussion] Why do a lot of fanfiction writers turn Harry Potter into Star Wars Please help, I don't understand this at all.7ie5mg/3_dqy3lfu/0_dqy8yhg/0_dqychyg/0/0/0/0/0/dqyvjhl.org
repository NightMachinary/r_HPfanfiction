I thought it was obvious that magical Britain was in a civil war. But there are universal laws how a war should be fought (Geneva convention) and the Death Eaters are breaking those. Like Malfoy not wearing his regalia while attacking Katie, attacking Katie (a civilian) in the first place or the murder of Professor Burbage. You could claim that this is part of their war against muggleborns but that would be saying the Holocaust was ok because the Third Reich was waging war against the Jews.

The flair is a provocative statement towards the Death Eaters/Harry and Death Eaters/Hermione shippers, who usually go for the "Draco in leather pants" or "Voldemort did nothing wrong" tropes and are honestly writing stories about the actors and not the characters.

My other idea was "Death Eaters = Magical Waffen-SS".
