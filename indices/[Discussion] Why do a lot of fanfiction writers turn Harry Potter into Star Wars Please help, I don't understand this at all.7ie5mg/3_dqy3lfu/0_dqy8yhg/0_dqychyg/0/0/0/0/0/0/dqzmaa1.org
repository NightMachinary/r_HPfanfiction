Yes. That's part of what I'm talking about. A formal definition of a "civil war" would be this, from the International Committee of the Red Cross:

#+begin_quote
  1) That the Party in revolt against the de jure Government possesses an organized military force, an authority responsible for its acts, acting within a determinate territory and having the means of respecting and ensuring respect for the Convention.

  (2) That the legal Government is obliged to have recourse to the regular military forces against insurgents organized as military and in possession of a part of the national territory.

  (3) (a) That the de jure Government has recognized the insurgents as belligerents; or (b) That it has claimed for itself the rights of a belligerent; or (c) That it has accorded the insurgents recognition as belligerents for the purposes only of the present Convention; or (d) That the dispute has been admitted to the agenda of the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations as being a threat to international peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression.

  (4) (a) That the insurgents have an organization purporting to have the characteristics of a State. (b) That the insurgent civil authority exercises de facto authority over the population within a determinate portion of the national territory. (c) That the armed forces act under the direction of an organized authority and are prepared to observe the ordinary laws of war. (d) That the insurgent civil authority agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Convention.

From the Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war][page on civil wars]].

By that definition, I would not call the conflict that is Death Eaters vs Ministry of Mgic a "civil war."

Further, even the intro to the Wikipedia article states that civil wars are fought with regular armed forces, of which we see none in the Harry Potter series. Aurors are magical law enforcement, which implies that the Ministry of Magic does not treat the conflict as a war, more like how a government would fight organized crime.

I'm reading a few papers on the US response to 9/11 that deal with the classification of terrorism as acts of war vs domestic crime, I'll just edit this with the links when I finish.
