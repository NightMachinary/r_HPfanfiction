I never understood that. You want a harem? Then write one. Write solid smut without the pretense of plot. No one watches porn for the plot and no one reads a collection of explicit sex scenes for the character building.

"The free use experience" has this issue. The smut is some of the best around, especially the "new experiences" due to metamorphic gender change. But most of the story is some bullshit politics centered around a rape law (free use). Want people to shag around? Explain it with magical society. No need for a law that legalises rape because it is "networking".

Edit: Apparantly I derailed the top comment into a discussion about smut. Not sorry about that.
