Dark vs Light is a slight reframing of Good vs Evil, which is a standard conflict in stories for about as long as we've had stories. Stories about people following their respective leaders into battle are about as old as having leaders and battles.

The trope that doing evil makes you enjoy being evil is also pretty old -- older than the Star Wars series, I'll wager, and it appears in far more than Star Wars.
