It's no longer magical if it's easy.

  Magic can have mystery and still be explained look at Tolkien or even Martin they have set rules to there magic.

Give me some quotes where magic is clearly, scientifically explained in those stories.

    "The Dark Arts," said Snape, "are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible."

The last sentence describes magic consistently tagged as Dark, such as Fiendfyre and Horcruxes in separate instances; and, Sectumsempra in this passage:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. . . . He's alive."
#+end_quote

Voldemort also gave a great statement on how important intent is for magic within the Wizarding World.

#+begin_quote
  "There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."
#+end_quote

As in, some magic may not be good or evil. Power is neutral. But, if magic is used for cruelty and pain, it can be considered Dark. This is what makes the Unforgivable Curses unforgivable. To use them, one must have the intent to control, hurt or kill others.

  "You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain -- to enjoy it -- righteous anger won't hurt me for long -- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson ---"
