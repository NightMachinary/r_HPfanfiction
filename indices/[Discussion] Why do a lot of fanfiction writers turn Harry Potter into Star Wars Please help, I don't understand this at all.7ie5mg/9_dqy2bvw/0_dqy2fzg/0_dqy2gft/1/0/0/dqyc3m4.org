I think you are upset with the way the books were created using third person limited perspective focused on Harry. You need to remember that Harry's personality didn't lend much toward explaining the deep mechanics of how the magic fundamentally worked. Perhaps if the story were focused on Hermione's point of view then JKR would have explained things like this to the reader. Instead the reader got little snippets here and there to show Hermione's personality of being a bookworm and to show that Harry and Ron didn't actually utilize all the opportunities they had in school to learn about magics grand scope.

Personally I was frustred with how blas√© Harry was about learning and becoming a better wizard. I would think that considering his constant battles with dark wizards and looming deadly threats he might seek out learning everything he could, but we need to remember how his character started off knowing nothing and not really understanding what was happening to him - he was just an oblivious child for over half of the series after all. Or perhaps it just shows him trying to grasp on to any semblance of a "normal" childhood considering his total lack there of. I guess who can really blame him not feeling excited about learning considering he is a somewhat damaged child who wasn't able to grow up in any sort of healthy environment and with such little healthy relationships or role models.

Thinking back during your education do you remember the lectures on how mathematics worked or how chemical reactions worked in science class? I know I don't, but I know what I need to know for the application of some information to get through my day. I wasn't ambitious for the same of knowledge - it was for the sake of application. I didn't really care about learning stuff I didn't immediately see as helpful, so I assume Harry felt the same way which would explain him really only excelling in Defense class.

I think JKR never INTENDED to show the reader how magic works beyond wand motions, incantations, and intent. In depth explanations for the readers sake interrupt the flow of the story. It would also take away the mystery and wonder of a new magical world for the reader to explore alongside Harry throughout the series. In reality JKR explained more about magic then most fantasy series I know about. I think it's a bit disengenuous to say JKR wasted the opportunity. It wouldn't make sense to have pages upon pages of technical explaination about how magic works throughout the series when the character has little interest in that as well as the target audience being children who have little interest in reading something that feels like an excerpt from one of their school books.

Personally my favorite topics of fanfiction focused on the magic being worked --- the unraveling of how it can be manipulated, created, and changed, as well as characters learning or creating new or interesting ways to use spells.
