Magic can have mystery and still be explained look at Tolkien or even Martin they have set rules to there magic. My issue with rowling is the fact that she has this magic school and does not use it nor does she even attempt to explain how certain spells work or how dark magic is different from the norm. I do not care about where magic comes from you can keep your mystery but at the same time explain SOME of your system so you cant just pull ass pull after ass pull and expect your readers to be ok with it.
