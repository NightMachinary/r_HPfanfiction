Whoever is voting here needs to take a step back until the fanboy tweaking wears off.

There is a very significant difference between a magical system which goes completely unexplained, and one which is mysterious. The former is just a deus ex machina generator, the latter can create interest plot points all its own. In fact, when handled properly, a magical system with known elements makes the more unusual magic (sacrificial magic) more interesting precisely because it doesn't all entirely occur because "a wizard did it."
