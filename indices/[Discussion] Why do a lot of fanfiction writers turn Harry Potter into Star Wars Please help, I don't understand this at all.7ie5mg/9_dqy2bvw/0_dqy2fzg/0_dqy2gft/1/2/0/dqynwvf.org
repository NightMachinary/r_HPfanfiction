We do learn what magic /can't/ do: It can't create true life, it can't truly bring back the dead, and messing with your soul is a very bad idea. Really, one interpretation I have is that Potterverse magic is really only limited by consequences. You might be able to bring back the dead, but the consequences are likely so terrible that no one in their right or even wrong mind would try.
