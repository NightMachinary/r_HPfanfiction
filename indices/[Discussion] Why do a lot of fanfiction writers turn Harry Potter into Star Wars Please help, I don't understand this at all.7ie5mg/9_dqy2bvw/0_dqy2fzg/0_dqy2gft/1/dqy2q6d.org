Some would argue that it sets her apart from many fantasy authors. If a magic system is so mechanical that it can be described entirely through a few paragraphs of jargon-riddled exposition, is it really "magical"?

There's a reason why magic is often associated with terms like "occult", "esoteric", "mystery", "arcane", etc. The effects of a spell or ritual or eldritch abomination are far more interesting when the causes behind them are only partially understood.
