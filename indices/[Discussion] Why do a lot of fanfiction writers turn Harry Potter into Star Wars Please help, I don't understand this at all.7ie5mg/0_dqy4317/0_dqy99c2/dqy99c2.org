Except that the epilogue screws even that puddle over. No one is bothered by Ron's magical assault on his driving instructor, Draco is not in Azkaban and Snape is a hero. Their few good deeds, made due to personal interest and not morality, do not undo their countless bad ones. What exactly did Draco do to earn his freedom? Maybe he amounted to some improved prison conditions, but not a pardon for several lifetime imprisonments.
