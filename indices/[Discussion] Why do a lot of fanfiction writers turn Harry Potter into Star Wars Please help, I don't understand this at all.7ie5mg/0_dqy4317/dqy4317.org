For example: The big bad of the series has a disfigured face because he's so damn evil. The big bad of Star Wars has a disfigured face because his own evil power was reflected back on him.

Everyone picks a light and dark side because that's the way the story went. There were exactly two sides: Good Perfect Heroes and Evil Corrupted Dipshits. Every character was placed firmly in one of these two sides within the first few minutes. The /one/ exception to this rule is so notable that he's regularly described as the most complex character in the series.

The morality in Harry Potter is about as deep as a puddle on a summer's day, which is also precisely the problem with the Jedi and Sith in Star Wars. You're either outright evil (and by extension, stupid and ugly) or you're a moral paragon who farts sunshine and rainbows. It really wasn't as deep as you make it out to be. Hell, even Rowling admitted she fucked up by having /an entire house dedicated solely to being evil/ and tried to rectify it in later writings and statements.

It's literally described as being "black and white." By its very nature, there are not many ways for it to manifest.
