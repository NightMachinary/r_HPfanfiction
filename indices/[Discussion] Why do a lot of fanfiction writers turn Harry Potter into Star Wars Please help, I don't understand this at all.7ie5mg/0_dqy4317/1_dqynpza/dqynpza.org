no, there weren't? did we read the same series? the one with statements like 'the world isn't divided into good people and death eaters'? the series elaborates on the flaws of /many/ of its heroes. sirius is immature, and was often cruel, even to his friends. so was james. remus was selfish, insecure and a coward. dumbledore was a baby fascist, and a shitty administrator/spymaster as an adult.
