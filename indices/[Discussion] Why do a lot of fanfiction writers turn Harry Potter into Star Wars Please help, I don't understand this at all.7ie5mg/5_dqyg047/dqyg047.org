Okay, it seems like there is a lot of anger in this thread so I'll try to provide a counter point. Star Wars does not have a monopoly on the Dark vs Light dichotomy. It is a literary tool that has been used by many people in many different pieces of fiction, from books to movies to video games. It's not weak writing on its own unless it is done weakly. Which I'm sure some of the fan fictions y'all have been exposed to have been.

Much of what you are concerned about is done through extrapolating on what is in canon as well as reflecting it for literary symmetry.

We know that Dark Arts are a thing. We know that many people consider them something to be defended against and avoided, but we also see people like Snape drawn to them. This can be extrapolated when someone is trying to fill out their story by continuing the train of thought. What makes Dark Magic Dark? What is its definition, is Dark the absence of Light? Does that mean that there are Light Arts too? JK Rowling never mentioned them but that's the whole point of fanfiction, to add and expand.

Voldemort is the Dark Lord. In canon Harry and Dumbledore share the role of the reflection of the Dark. In fanfiction that can easily be done by making either of them “The Leader of the Light” in name as well as in action.

Dark or evil being addicting or corrupting is also not a Star Wars thing. It's human nature to view giving into darker paths as addicting and corrupting. Hell, that's the whole point of Dr Jekylll and Mr Hyde. It's a human thing not a writing thing.

I also feel that Dark families vs Light families isn't actually something from Star Wars at all. It's usually used in political fics which people can be pretty opinionated on. I can't remember any of that in Star Wars at all. In fact the main family of Star Wars is almost evenly split between light and dark. I'm not exactly sure what your problem with this is other than the words light and dark.

I can understand why it can bother you, and I won't deny that some authors may draw from things that they like about Star Wars, but not every use of Dark or Light is an attempt to turn Harry Potter into Star Wars.
