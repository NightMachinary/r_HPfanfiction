Now that is definitely bad writing that's upsetting you and is completely understandable. Light and Dark as political factions and families can work well of written well. Example from canon: The Blacks as a family are described heavily as “Dark”. But in the two characters we are given more details on we see actual characterization. Sirius rebelled against his families wishes while Regulus bowed to them. Sirius went to Gryffindor and joined the Order while Regulus went to Slytherin and joined the Death Eaters (back to the dualism of light and dark) but they have light and dark in both of them. Regulus treated Kreacher better than anyone else, while Sirius was a small minded bully for most of his schooling and almost got Snape killed.

That is how things should be handled in fanfiction too. You can have Dark and Light families and political factions with all sorts of financial, political, and familiar pressures for characters to toe the line and stay with how they were raised, but it should be part of what makes the character who they are, not what defines them. I think when it comes to bad writing there is the simple fact that many fanfiction writers are just hobbiests that are stumbling through with something they enjoy without the technical skills that can make good writing. I'm sure they haven't taken the time to think about the characters they introduce and what motivates their actions. That is what leaves you with generic two dimensional Dark cardboard cutouts.
