Okay, thank you. Also yes what irritates me about the Dark and Light family thing is that it is so SIMPLE. It is simple to the point of being frustrating. How can you reduce human beings with thoughts and dreams and motives and everything into "Oh your whole family is Dark and you are Dark and Dark is Evil so you will all ever only be and think EVIL forever!!!!" and the same thing for the Light family stuff. "Oh they are such a Light family they are so good and righteous and every one of them is amazing and Light because Light and there is no question or doubt or independent thought or anything because Light!"

/That is what irritates me about these stories I read!/ So much! They are just reducing humans with everything inside them into just plain "You are Dark or Light forever and that is it. That is all there is to you, that is all you will ever be. You have no motives, you have no dreams, you have nothing. You are a Dark family or you are a Light family so obviously you will always be Light and Dark because that is it." And they write those characters that way for the whole story and they are not even characters, they are like statues or something to be pushed around for all they have any /complexity to them./

It is so /simple and reducing and/ it is so frustratingly irritating to read because it is! It is like taking a sphere and squishing it down into a tiny flat blank plain dot!
