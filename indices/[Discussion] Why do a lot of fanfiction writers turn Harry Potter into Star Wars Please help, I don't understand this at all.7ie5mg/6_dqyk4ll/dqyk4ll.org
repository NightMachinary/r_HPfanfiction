Well, in general, to many readers it isn't clear that "Dark Lord" in a Potterverse setting is just a title Voldemort made for himself that nobody before him had. And to be fair, the most powerful bits of Dark Magic /do/ corrupt their user in canon (that's why Voldemort looks the way he does), although there's no "addiction" shown.

From then on, you have milder similarities (the good-guys society called the Order of [Something], to which the old eccentric but very powerful mentor belongs) that are really just tropes but play into the similarities. The fact that the original /Star Wars/ trilogy and the first three /Harry Potter/ movies share the same composer may have factored in. Voldemort himself dresses in a black hooded robe and has glowing eyes, so comparisons to Emperor Palpatine are hardly surprising.

The movies even muddied it up further by having Hagrid say Voldemort "turned people over to the Dark Side" in the first movie. It was just a turn of phrase, but instantly familiar to /Star Wars/ fans.

The result was fans getting a conception of the Potteverse's Dark Arts as pretty much the Dark Side of the Force. The whole "Light Lord" thing is the Order of the Phoenix being played up to eleven in an attempt to "even things out" and not make the villains too powerful.
