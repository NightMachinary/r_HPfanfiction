Just from fact that the HP universe contains the Dark Arts, it doesn't at all follow that not using the Dark Arts makes you a Light wizard, or that using other kinds of magic constitutes an opposing category of Light Arts. Somewhat analogously, not being a murderer doesn't make you a pacifist.

The whole Light-Dark idea is disliked for good reason, it's terribly clich√© and stupid. It's clear from the Harry Potter novels that the term "Dark Arts" describes magic which damages the soul, leaves irreparable damage to yourself and others and is specifically intended to harm, torture and kill. All of these things make it a pretty bad idea to use Dark Magic, not some kind of philosophical outlook on morality which disagrees with Light Magic. There are plenty of people with cruel intentions in HP who are not "Dark".
