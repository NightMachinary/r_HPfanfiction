...because the books too talk about "Dark Arts" and "Dark Lord" so it's easy to say that those who don't belong to the "Light Side"? Certainly, the characters are flawed and have their complexities in HP but on the other hand, everyone in Slytherin is evil, everyone who uses Dark Arts is viewed with suspicion etc.

I'm not surprised that people take that and run with it, and take it to it's 'logical extreme' /shrug/
