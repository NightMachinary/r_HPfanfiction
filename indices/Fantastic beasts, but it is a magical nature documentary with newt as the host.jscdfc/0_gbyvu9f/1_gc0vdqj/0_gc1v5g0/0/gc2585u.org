Excellent point.

Or what about Newt heard about how there was a basilisk in hogwarts? He digs through some magical animal research. (Also he definitely cried hard when he knows she died). When he realizes how little and rare basilisk are, he wants to breed them! To save them, because they are so beautiful. And their scales are glittering in the light.

But the group of anti snake people (especially anti big snakes!) don't like this at all. So we have newt trying to catch toads and put them on eggs. Obviously that already is a Difficult job cause those toads ALWAYS jump away. And then you have the anti snake people who try to use legal things to obstruct him. Or use flies to lure the toads away. Or Rita skeeter who tells the world that this man has gone dark!!

Etc etc

Ok maybe I'm in a bit of a cracky mood.
