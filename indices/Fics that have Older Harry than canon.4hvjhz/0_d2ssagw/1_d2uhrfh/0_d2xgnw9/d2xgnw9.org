I believe he's said he doesn't plan on doing so since he wrote himself into something of a corner with the ending of the MoM battle.

From his bio: "The One He Feared. Probably my best story from the standpoints of technical writing, characterisation, humour, and action. Unfortunately, it has a fatal flaw: I was too clever for my own good when I came up with the plan, and now realise that putting your climax at the end of the first third of the story isn't a great idea. I'm honestly not sure if there's anything I can do to fix the story, but I am at least happy that the story as it currently exists tells a semi-contained arc with its own climax."
