I imagined them as people who recognized each others abilities and therefore power and influence in their communities and decided on a work-relationship. Universities started becoming a thing and monestaries were already busy propagating knowledge in a somewhat unified manner and I would think that the smartest minds of magical Britannia would have liked something similar, as well as - dare I say it - a safe space.

I thought their friendships developed while they worked together. Slytherin and Gryffindor became buddies because I /also/ imagine that wizardry and witchcraft were two separate magical cultures back then (hence the name of the school), and they just had more to say to each other in the beginning. After that I imagine Gryffindor slowly gravitating to the women as companions, as it became more and more clear that Slytherin represented a philosophy he could not support in the slightest.
