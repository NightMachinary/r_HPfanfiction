I can't remember the name but in a story he hired professionals to deal with Voldemort and Horcruxes. It was after his name came out of goblet. Voldemort was dealed with before he was revived. Afterwards, he was probably exiled/self-exiled from Britain for some reasons. Malfoy Sr probably helped him to deal some business stuff. So many years later when he returned to Britain for a week, he stayed with them.
