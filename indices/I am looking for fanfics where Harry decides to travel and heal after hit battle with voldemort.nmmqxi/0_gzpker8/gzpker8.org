For what it's worth, you should probably change the flair from *Recommendation* to *Request*. Recommendation is for topics when you want to recommend a fanfic you've read.

Anyway, onto the fanfic recs...

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]]/ is the only one I've read that really fits this criteria(I tend to read a lot of fics taking place at Hogwarts)
