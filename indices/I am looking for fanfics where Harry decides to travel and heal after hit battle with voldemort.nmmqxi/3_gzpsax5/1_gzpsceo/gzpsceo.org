  He's never been as clumsy with anything as he is with his affection for Deku. It's one of the only things that has ever truly left him speechless. When it gets really bad, Katsuki finds himself in bed, replaying their fights like a movie on the ceiling. He sees Deku's mangled body in his nightmares, jolts awake with saltwater vision and a lead tongue. He can never sleep after. On those nights, he spends hours upon hours fighting in the trenches of his self-induced mental warfare---what could I have done differently, how could I have protected him better, how do I pretend that I'd be able to live in a life that's not in Deku's shape.
