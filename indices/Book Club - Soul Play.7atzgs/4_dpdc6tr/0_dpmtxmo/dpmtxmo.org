I only read part of this fic a while ago, but is this the fic where he thinks at some point about making his own horcrux? I never did see him as the type of person to care about immorality or one that was super power hungry at the point of his life after he killed Dumbledore. I just have viewed him as not caring too much whether he lives or dies other than fulfilling his obligations to see Dumbledore's plan through.

Why spend so much effort helping the light side, attempting to protect students and what not when he could just not. His promise to Lily to protect Harry is kind of moot since he is actively helping Dumbledore's plan which as far as he knows will result in Harry dying. Or maybe he just wants revenge on Voldemort so I guess that makes sense.

The fic reads like it was written before the Deathly Hallows so thats likely why, I just thought some of the characterization was kind of off. Other parts are great though.
