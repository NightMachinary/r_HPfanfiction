I'm sorry but I couldn't get into this story at all.

The first paragraph sums it up, really: a mass of adjectives and adverbs that means it takes 37 words to say "Snape appeared in London. It was raining".

I'm reminded of the episode of M/A/S/H where Radar subscribes to a writing course and comes out with phrases such as *'The friendly old sun showed his friendly hot face over the mountains of purple majesty as though he was salutating, "Good morning to all."'/ in an attempt to sound clever.

The story is 361,400 words long. It could be 1/3 that length and still not leave out any plot.
