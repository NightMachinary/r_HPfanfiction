I read at a rate a little over 100 pages an hour with no major slow down while reading on a phone and supposedly a page has about 400 words on average(I'm not sure on the validity of this) and I read for an average of just over 3 hours a day ,3:07 a day for the last month some of that is rereads but that ends up as about 40 million words in the last year. I would estimate that a quarter of that is me rereading so 30 million words of new content. I'm not sure if I should be proud or depressed by this number honestly...

Edit: just to add I don't read exclusively HP FanFiction but I'm not sure on exactly how much is hp stuff since what I'm reading Varys month to month.
