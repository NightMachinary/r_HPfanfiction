Hmm. Including short A/N's, my all time favorite stories, which I reread at least once a year, total to ~1 million words. One of these stories has been one of my favorites for, oh, 6 years now? Meaning I've roughly reread it five times (although it's definitely been more than that), meaning that that's another ~1 million words I've read. As for the others, the trilogy has been a favorite of mine for 3 years (~1.5 million words), one story has been a favorite for roughly 2 (~.5 million words), and the other has been a favorite for a similar amount of time (~.4 million words). So that's roughly 4.4 million words I've read from these stories /alone/. I have something like 400 favorites on FFN, with HP fics ranging from 500,000 words to 285 making up the vast majority of these. So I'd wager that I've probably read 2-4x more than that 4.4 million average at least.

(Also, yes, I realize I have no life. â€˜Tis what happens when you're a introvert with chronic health issues lol)
