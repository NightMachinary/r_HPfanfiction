The 500 stories on my FanFiction.Net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eroryokane][profile page]], according to a small program I just wrote that looks at the “Words: <number>” text pattern, contain a total of 5,073,438 words. (This is across fandoms.)

However, I actually Favorited 552 stories; FFN displays only a maximum of 500 on a profile page. And the stories left out include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]'s Harry Potter fanfic series Sacrifices Arc, which by itself is 3 million words long.

When I filter my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Rory-s-semifavorites/97051/][Rory's semifavorites]] collection to stories of at least 100,000 words, there are 103 results. So that's at least another 10 million words in that collection. Probably more like 20 million.

Then on top of that, there are the 153 bookmarked stories on my [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/roryokane][Archive of Our Own profile]]. Plus fanfiction on other sites that I read and liked. Plus I'd say at least one thousand stories that I read some of but didn't bookmark or favorite, because they were bad.

In total, I'll estimate I've read *50 million words* of cross-fandom fanfiction in my life so far.

However, keep in mind that *the point of reading fiction* is to entertain yourself, and secondarily to learn how people think and the world works. The time you spend reading words of fanfiction is only worthwhile if those goals are being accomplished. Your goal should not be to read a lot, but to read /good/ writing. As long as you're finding /good/ writing to read, the total number of words you've read are irrelevant.

Too often I find myself continuing to read a bad story out of morbid curiosity. If you're like this too, practice putting the story down and accepting that you will never know how that author finished their story... because it doesn't matter. No one will praise you just for reading a long story. It was only worth it if you enjoyed it or learned something useful from it.
