The Sirius thing, like you said. Everyone portrais him as a womanizer (unless he's dating Remus), and that always slightly bugged me because there's nothing that tells us that, and yet it seems to be everyone's idea of him.

I think wards are a thing, just not to the extensive detail and boring description some people like to use them as. The lord thing is equally exagerated, but that doesn't usually bother me.

Luna actually grew up to become a magizoologist and prove the existence of many of her animals. I mean, that doesn't invalidate your personality disorder theory, but it does go to show that her father was, in fact, right.

For things that bother me, personally, I need ot be that little bitch again and mention Charlus and Dorea, a concept I never liked even before it became canon that it was false.
