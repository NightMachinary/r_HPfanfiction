  Lordships... it seems that only the Black family practiced that 'Lord somethin somethin'.

And I'm fairly willing to bet that, if the world was more fleshed out, you'd see more of this. I imagine this "lord" refers to the lord of the manor, which doesn't refer specifically to a building but to land. It's an older form of property rights, essentially. The lord of a manor owns land, and under him are tenants or serfs, who are /kind of/ like renters today. Tenants had obligations they had to fulfill to the lord, be it labor, goods, or money (or some combination thereof), under penalty of law. Ultimately, the land and all means of production on the land belonged to the lord of the manor.

I'm /way/ oversimplifying here, but that's the gist of it. Manorialism was around for a very long time and went through some major changes to stay relevant in society, so it'd only make sense for the magical world to take advantage of it, especially when they weren't in full hiding.

Whether or not it's still /relevant/ in the modern magical world is another story, but when you see a fic talk about lords or vassals or whatever, it's probably not as crazy as you think. Lordship (of a manor) was a real thing which existed for a very long time. In a society still as backwards as Magical Britain's, why wouldn't it take them even longer than muggles to lose feudalism?
