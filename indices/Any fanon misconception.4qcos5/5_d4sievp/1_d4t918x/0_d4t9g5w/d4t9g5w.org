Eh, that doesn't really ring true for me. I know some people don't consider it canon, but Lupin's story on Pottermore mentions that Lupin bitterly said to Tonks "he [Sirius] always got the girls." Personally I read the fact that he wasn't paying attention to the girl in OotP as a sign that he was so used to girls being all over him that he could pick and choose.
