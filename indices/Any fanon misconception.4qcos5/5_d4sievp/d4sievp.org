On the sirius note, I think it's worth remembering that he had posters of bikini clad girls in his room. While it's made clear that it's partly teenage rebellion against his parents, it does suggest that he is very much into women and possibly not too concerned with chaste, monogamous relationships. If I recall correctly, in the OotP memory he was also looking over at the girls by the lake (or was that James? I thought he was busy playing with the snitch). The fact that he ignored one particular girl in an exam may be that she's an ex, that he didn't like her, that he didn't even notice and so on. I agree that sometimes manslut!Sirius goes way too far though.
