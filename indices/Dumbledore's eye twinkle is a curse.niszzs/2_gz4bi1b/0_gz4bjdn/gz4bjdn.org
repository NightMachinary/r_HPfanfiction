  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic. Wherein Sirius questions the facts he thought he knew and Regulus fails to hate.
