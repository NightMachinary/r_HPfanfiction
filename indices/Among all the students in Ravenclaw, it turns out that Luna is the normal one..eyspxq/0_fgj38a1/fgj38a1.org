Ravenclaw house had an infestation. Nargles. They bred through the cracks and u drr students beds. But no one could see them except for one house member. While everyone else fell victim to the magical effects of the creatures, one remained impervious to their effects. Luna Lovegood.

In fact, their is a small population of nargles in Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. But Ravenclaw was the capitol of the Nargels in Hogwarts. Why could no one else see them? Because the creatures come out at night on the first night that new students settle in their dorms and work their magic. To remain unseen and to go about their business. Why was Luna not infected? Because she was not in her dorm her first night in Hogwarts, she was locked out and lost. She wandered the halls without sleep when she found the creatures coming from the kitchens with bread in tow. She saw the tiny creatures with wings and they were furious. Since she had seen them before they could work their magic, she would always be able to see them.
