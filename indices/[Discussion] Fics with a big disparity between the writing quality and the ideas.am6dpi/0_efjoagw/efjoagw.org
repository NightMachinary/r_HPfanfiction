For your first question, I can't think of anything specifically because there are too many to name. One of my pet peeves is nobody has figured out how to use commas to break up natural speech patterns. "It's a very dangerous mirror Harry" WHAT'S A "MIRROR HARRY"??

For your second question, I would have to say the "boy with a scar" AU series by dirgewithoutmusic. Poetically written, succinct, grammatically correct interesting story seeds that turn into dull canon rehashes every time.
