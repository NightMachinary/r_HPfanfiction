I guess I'm asking about the ones at the very top of that heap of bad writing. Ones that have, truly remarkably clever/interesting ideas. Not just your run of the mill "oh that's a clever what-if, too bad it's written as shite" but a story that has /multiple/ instances where you go "Oh. Oh wow. Now /that's/ clever. Too bad it's written as shite."
