Was just about to recommend those fics as falling into category two, but then I scrolled down and saw your post. The Neville BWL is a stretch from the start, copying Lily's sacrifice "just because", even though it would never have happened without Snape's intervention. The canon rehash makes all the fics blend together and even the better ones (Harry and Dudley raised by divorced Petunia) become less memorable in retrospect when you can barely any remember details because they're all exactly by-the-book. I remember one, or several, where Sirius died in the Veil and it made me mad, because there wasn't any set-up with Dumbledore's year-long ghosting or the magic communication mirror.

linkffn(8615605) is another example of excellent writing that is let down by a rehash. Over 200k words of by-the-book setup, and doesn't start to diverge until the Yule Ball of year 4.
