For the first, linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone) has amazing ideas about a magical society and an AU take on magic that is brilliant, but puts people off because of its weird names.

For the second, though I really like it and it does a lot well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) had a few too many tropes that make it, while still an amazing fic and worth reading, still particularly lacking in areas.
