Harry Crow had an interesting premise (Harry raised by goblins) but implemented it rather poorly. Not in terms of terrible grammar and spelling (despite his other writing faults Robst is usually pretty good about those), but in terms of there being no plot tension at all. Antagonists are cartoonishly evil with no redeeming features. Protagonists never face any serious difficulties and are shown to embody all that is wonderful and good and pure, etc.
