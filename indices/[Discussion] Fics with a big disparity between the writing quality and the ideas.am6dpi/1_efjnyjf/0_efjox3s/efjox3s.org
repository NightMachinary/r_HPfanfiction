I tell this to everyone who complains about how /Harry Crow/ snatched a good idea and made a terrible novel out of it, but: have you read /Harry Amidst the Vaults of Stone/? It has the disadvantage of being abandoned, of course, but it also has the advantage of actually being a good story. It also may or may not be where robst got the idea from, as it predates /Harry Crow/.
