(Why bother? CC stands on its own...er.../merits/.)

There's a brief scene in The Peace Not Promised where both Snape and Dumbledore scoff at the idea of Tom having a child, but it doesn't feature beyond that.

Delphini turns up as a baby around the end of linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions), with things set to go rather differently (eg Professor Snape survived the Battle of Hogwarts and is going to raise her).
