The last list I made was an ordinary fanfic search. While certainly (mostly) comprehensive, it wasn't a definitive list.

You can guess what happened to that post's karma.

Concerning your actual comment, I agree. Most Harry/Bella stories I've read involve a massive change of heart on somebody's part. While they certainly appeal to /my/ tastes, which are quite wide ranging, they do not in anyway reflect on the tastes of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] as a whole. We're quite the diverse community, and there are only so many writers out there that write Harry/Bella, so you oftentimes don't get much choice on what tropes are present.
