Out of the three the way people write Snape annoy me the most. He's either an unredeemable puppy kicking kitten skinning psychopath or a misrepresented super sexy hero. It's fucking disgusting either way. Personally I lean more towards the puppy kicking interpretation because the guy is an obsessive nazi and seems like the kind of guy you'd see on the news after he stalked and killed his ex.

Ron doesn't bother me that much for some reason. Mostly because I don't read many stories where Ron plays a major part in the plot and the Ron-centric fics I've read were actually pretty good.

Dumbledore I don't really care too much about since watching the author try to fit him into the plot is funnier than watching the excuses Marvel comes up with in the movies for why x character can't just do y thing and destroy the plot.
