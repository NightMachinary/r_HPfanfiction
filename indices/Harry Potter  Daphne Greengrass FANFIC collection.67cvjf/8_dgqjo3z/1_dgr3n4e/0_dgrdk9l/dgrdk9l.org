No idea what he thinks but I hate the way that she's written in 90% of fanfics. Author's don't bother giving her any flaws or they make her a goody two shoes who freaks out and/or narcs every time the mc does something out of line. Then there's the whole annoying book ex machina thing where Granger's studying thing gives her a spell for everyfuckingthing. There's also the incontrovertible fact that Harmony authors are scum and usually can't write a good plot to save their lives.
