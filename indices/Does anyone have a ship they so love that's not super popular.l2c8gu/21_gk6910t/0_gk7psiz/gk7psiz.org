Fem!Blaise was a looot more popular when it was like the first 3 or so movies and we were on Book 4 or so, might be worth it for you to check out some older fics. I'm pretty sure Rowling doesn't even gender Blaise until at least Book 5, and I remember a lot of the Dracofics I read when I was much younger featured a blonde, fem!Blaise in a similar role to Daphne Greengrass today.
