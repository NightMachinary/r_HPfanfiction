“Petunia's Letter by mzzbee” linkao3(11676102) ... you wouldn't believe it, but it is Petunia Dursley/Arthur Weasley and it is pretty good (for more mature people, not because of too much sex or violence, but because it is about adultery and one has to deal with people who do wrong things and deal with it).
