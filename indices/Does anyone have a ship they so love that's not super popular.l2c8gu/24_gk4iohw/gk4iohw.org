Harry X Gideon Prewett is a particular one that I just adore. It's in the Second String, I'll link it down below.

Harry is really determined and strong and sly the whole time and then Gideon walks in and he just turns into this grinning idiot and it's so completely adorable. I love them. Gideon is a big ol quiet dote. And Harry is a moron. And they're adorable.

It's not a romance story it's an adventure story that just happens to have this pairing but absolutely everything about this story makes it worth reading ðŸ˜Š linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)
