Hermione/Tonks.

It would be a good case of opposite character traits attracting each other without being fundamentally different. It would also draw out a lot of moments where Hermione would be breaking rules, which are generally some of her best moments (like everything she did surrounding Umbridge and the DA).

Likewise, I would love to read a Hermione/Luna fic where they both influence each other for the better, but sadly that does not happen often (usually Hermione is completely wrong while Luna is close to a Mary Sue, usually ending in them finding one of Luna's creatures).

And I second Harry/Padma, although with the caveat that it should not be a "foreign magical culture and society are superior to everything", which is quite common in a lot of fics dealing with things abroad (although usually with native American or aboriginal magic).
