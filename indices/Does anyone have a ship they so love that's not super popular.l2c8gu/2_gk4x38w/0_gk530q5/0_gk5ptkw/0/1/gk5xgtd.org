  But he definitely knew how badly he'd fucked up, how bad he'd left the omega wounded. He'd never forgive himself for hurting such a sweet soul and his mind became flooded with the thought of how he only deserved the best things in life but he was too angry to imagine someone else making him happy.What he didn't know however, was on that cold night, a new tiny life began its journey inside of the omega that was no longer his. Four years later. OrJimin and Jungkook go through a nasty break up and manage to cross paths again after four years. But Jungkook is unaware Jimin had his baby. A chance encounter in a stripclub allway changes their lives all over again. This story is super angsty and fluffy and smutty, Idk how to summarize I'm terrible at it:)
