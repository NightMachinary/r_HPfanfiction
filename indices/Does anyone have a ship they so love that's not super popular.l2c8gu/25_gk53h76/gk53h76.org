Harry/Pansy is a fun post-Hogwarts ship I enjoy when it's well written.

Hermione/Adian Lynch (National Irish team seeker during the 94 world Cup); Artemis_Girl wrote a one-shot with them and as far as I know, it's the only one...

edit: typo. I swear to merlin I wrote it correctly and double-checked before posting and then my phone changes things the second I hit "post"
