I used to ship Hermione and Percy when I was in primary school and read the books for the first time. Cuz they are both sorta workaholics. And if I remember correctly the book mentioned a few times that they got along well. Better than other brothers. Until the fifth book came out... the ship sunk. Completely.

But then the seventh book came out and I felt there's still a slim chance to float it :P
