Oliver Wood x Marcus Flint and Oliver Wood x Percy Weasley are two that I've gotten into lately. The first is good for competative-tension-becomes-romantic-tension without as many moral hangups as the more popular enemies-to-lovers tropes in this fandom. As for the second, both are seen as obsessive and overly intense by their peers, and I feel like they could appreciate each other in a way that no one else can.
