I mean, I get redemption arcs - but they usually need the villain to be redeemable/ redeemed anti-hero acting edgy in the first place. Snape and Draco feature in so many fics for a reason.

But we are talking about death eaters and Voldemort now. Literally all of them are 50+ year old terrorists (Snape is probably the youngest of the lot). They are ugly, unsympathetic and murderous maniacs.

90% of the Hermione x Deatheater/ Voldemort pairing fanfics are marriage law fics where Hermione is forced to marry these bastards, gets raped and Stockholm Syndromes' herself into falling in love with them.
