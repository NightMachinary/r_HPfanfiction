IDK but I am under the impression that Hermione/ Death Eater fanfics are all smutfests where marriage law happens, Hermione is forced to marry these bastards, gets raped and Stockholm Syndromes' herself into falling in love with them.

That sounds pretty miserable to read, so I generally skip them on sight.
