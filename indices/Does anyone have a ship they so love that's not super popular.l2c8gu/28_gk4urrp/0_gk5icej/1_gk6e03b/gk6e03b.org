For me, I think there's several things to it

1 -- for a rare exception (such as Hermione or Neville for example), the more JKR writes about a character, the less I seem to like them. So the most of ‘good guys' fall in one of two categories for me -- boring or unlikable. DEs/Slytherins, on the other hand, were mostly names with just a shadow of personality. Why not focus on ‘good guys' that were just names too? Well, that's just my taste in characters in general, I guess. I don't really like ‘funny', ‘heroic' and ‘honest' types that would ask a jinn for world peace; I've always preferred ‘ambitious', ‘sly', ‘intelligent' and even ‘morally ambiguous' types that look out for themselves first. In HP fanfiction these usually fall into Slytherins/DEs category.

2 -- canon pairings were one of the largest disappointments for me and the very reason I even went looking for HP fanfiction at all, so I tend to read fics that focus on relationship (romantic or otherwise). I did read many canon compliant (minus canon pairings ofc) fics in the beginning. But... relationship between two ‘good' characters... there's no conflict in them, no obstacles to overcome, no growth for either character to be achieved. And if there is, it's something so horribly mundane and domesticated, they're just boring and frustrating to read. Plus if I wanted such ‘realistic' plot I would rather go and read some classics or even original modern books that focuses on describing how miserable and depressing our ‘real' day-to-day life is. At least they're better written.
