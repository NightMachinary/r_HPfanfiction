One of my favorites is the Peverell Legacy. It's more or less done, the author is doing a few epilogues with future stuff, but still. Basic premise is Harry ends up in the past after a time turner explodes. Right before he's about to marry Padma. Cue him adopting Harry and her showing up in a huff in her wedding dress 'cause she found out and didn't bother to change before going back, as she wasn't going to let him be trapped in the past alone.

This one is a harem, but Padma's got a pretty nice part in it. Premise is Harry has no date for the Yule Ball, some people decide to "help him" and suddenly he has way too many.

(And yeah, I read that one. Bit more smut than I like, but it's nice anyway. :)
