Depends on what you mean by rare.

I'm fond of Harry in a romance with Padma, which is relatively rare outside of one shots.

I'm also fond of Harry with Angelina, which is quite rare in my experience, mostly just some harem fics that never completed.

Harry with Millicent has some potential too. You have the Slytherin angle and the contrasts and the fact Millicent has to deal with being large.
