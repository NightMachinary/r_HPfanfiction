  Harry having more than one relationship (not as in a harem but one after the other) is also a good idea not used enough. It allows character growth and it's rare that the first relationship is the last.

The thing is, in order to pull that off you need to write convincing relationships and then have them fall apart convincingly, followed by the same all over again. It is doable, but really, really hard to write multiple relationships which get the reader invested into them.

You can't asspull them (eg the alternative ending to Letters), you shouldn't resort to cheating because that feels like cheap drama even if it happens IRL (usually, there are red flags the reader would notice, even if IRL they are hard to tell). Character Deaths are also to be avoided because writing a good "grieving" arc is very difficult and probably enough for a fic on its own. At the same time, you can't make the failing relationships too convincing, because otherwise everyone and their mother will be up in arms that you broke them up.
