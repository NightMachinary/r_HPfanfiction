I would say finish reading it.

I liked it because contrary to a lot of fics, Harry doesn't become stronger without consequences and he isn't perfect. From his point of view he's more or less justified but you can also see what the other would think and when he goes a bit too far. But everything he does has a price, sometimes quite heavy.

Like his last interaction with Dumbledore. Dumbledore wasn't perfect and totally innocent but he wasn't an evil overlord either. In the end both made mistakes they would regret and the paranoia and lack of communication and trust was their undoing.

I liked less the twist with Hermione that I thought came a bit out of nowhere (no sign of it before) but it could have happened like this and it's not too far-fetched. Bittersweet ending and a bit confusing to me but overall a good fic.

Harry having more than one relationship (not as in a harem but one after the other) is also a good idea not used enough. It allows character growth and it's rare that the first relationship is the last. It was also well done in "The Life He Leads" which was unfortunately abandoned (even if the author explained what he had in mind for the end).
