I actually finished it. I enjoyed it for what it was. There are some parts that happen that require you to remember from 20-30+ chapters ago to fully understand. The end chapter especially. I wouldn't really read it again. Since a second reading would probably ruin how I feel about the story since I've read better written ones.
