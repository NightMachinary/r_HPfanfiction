  It has some fanon cliche's
#+end_quote

Let's not split words here, it has /literally every/ fandom cliche. Part of it's charm is that it revels in how many cliches it pushes together. It cringy at time, self-aware cringy at times, and at others seems like it's going off the rails only to pull it together at the last moment.

But what it has going for it most of all is that it's complete, has a story-line that's close cousins to being logical, and has consistent characterization.
