Repost from another thread: you might like linkffn(11994595). It's post-Hogwarts, Harry has a family with Ginny, Dudley Dursley has grown up and has his own family and is a decent sort despite Vernon's poor parenting. One of Dudley's kids turns out to be magical, Dudley reluctantly contacts Harry for advice, and the families end up meeting up and getting along. A nice story without much angst.
