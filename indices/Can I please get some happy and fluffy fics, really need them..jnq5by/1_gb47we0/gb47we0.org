linkffn(harry is a dragon, and that's okay)

In which Harry is for some reason a dragon. Being that Harry is near invulnerable, can fly, and breathes fire, Voldemorts machinations are effortlessly thwarted and the actual story is a slice of life about going to a magical boarding school.

linkffn(What's her name in hufflepuff)

This story has some serious bits but is mostly light hearted. Focuses on the trials of growing up or pretending to at least, of going to Hogwarts and of learning magic.
