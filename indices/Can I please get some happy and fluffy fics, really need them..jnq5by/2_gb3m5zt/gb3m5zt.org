- “Wondrous Apparition Provided by Magician by Abracabadger” linkao3(20364421) and its sequel “Harry Potter and the Malleus Mallardeficarum” linkao3(20403121), the sequel is still crazy but it has substance, the first is just one very glorious crack.

- “Just a Random Tuesday... by Twisted Biscuit” linkffn(3124159) ... oldie but goodie

- “Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum by Mister Cynical” linkffn(12302907) ... I am really suspicious of anything labelled Humour, because mostly it is just an euphemism for lemon and/or something disgusting, but this is really extraordinary: long story with a plot, and yet so crazy I was laughing loudly.
