I'm not the biggest fan of such twists but maybe that would be interesting. Remus would be devastated and would most probably leave. Snape would obviously stay. The question is if Umbridge would figure out his secret and what would Dumbledore do if she did. Voldemort might not be so fond of a werewolf Snape.
