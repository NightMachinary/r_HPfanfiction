Hmm...well, the Lightning Speaker series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1927254/AntaresTheEighthPleiade][AntaresTheEighthPleiade]], as I recall, features Harry and others forming a secret group to train and oppose an epically-evil Dumbledore.

And S'TarKan's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] features a time-travelling Harry helping to train his friends up, and he ends up sharing a big secret with them, so that might count too.

Unfortunately, neither fic/series is finished, or updated for a while.

Funny thing, I'm wondering now; what if you had a fic where /everyone/ was hiding their true power? Everyone has a special power like Parselmagic or Metamorphmagi or a Magical Animagus form or can see the future or is just really good at some area of magic or another, but they're hiding it to not stand out or because they're afraid of being kidnapped by Unspeakables or so on and so forth.
