I'm so happy you loved it too! I'm always so impressed when I see such phenomenal worldbuilding in a fan made work. And instead of declining in quality, in my opinion, the recent chapters have got me even more on the edge of my seat.

Likewise, let me know if there's anything you'd recommend to me! I'm open for anything, but my favorite is TR/HP

Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head except for one of MayMarlow's other fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]]

And also

Dark_Cyan_Star's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5745418/chapters/13239679][His Slytherin Descendants]] is a favorite of mine, but I definitely hold MayMarlow in a separate league. I'm such a huge fan.
