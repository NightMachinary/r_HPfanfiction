Oh my god. THIS. I started reading the fic yesterday, after seeing this and it's so amazing. I'm not sure words can describe it, but I love this fic so so much! Thank you for your suggestion; if you have any more recs then I'd love to know--- I'm open to most pairings and partial to most slash except draco/harry and ron/harry.
