Hmm, the Pawn doesn't have any romantic relationships. It focuses on young Severus and Albus Dumbledore in the midst of the first war.

Puzzle weird in a good way. I've always hated self-destructive behaviour, self-harming, self-denial etc. Like, you can't get me to hate you if you curse at me all day and bother me, I'll just ignore you but if you're someone I care about and you're behaving in a self-destructive way then I'll hate you more than anything I've ever hated and that fic is that. I love it and hate it so much that it's weird. That's the only thing I'm gonna say about that fic.

Honour Among the Death Eaters is it's own thing, about the relationship between young Severus with his friends from Death Eaters, Dumbledore and Lily.

In Long Road home, it's a slow process of understanding, emphaty, re-discovering each other and coming to terms with each others choices whether they were a mistake or not.

And about the incredulity part, I am not saying all people are like that or Lily was like that either since Lily is more of a plot device then a rounded up character in the story but people are able to forgive, move past and ignore a lot from people they care about. For example, I wouldn't love my brother or my father or my mother or any of my oldest friends any less if were racist, hell I wouldn't care if they were Hitler himself. I might be disappointed, I might be angry or dissappointed but my relationship with them is based on how much they care for me and how much I care for them. So yea, people can forgive a lot when it's the people who love them that needs the forgiving. Hence the reason Lily was fine with having a relationship with someone who she hated for 6 straight years because ultimately, it doesn't matter if he was a relentless school yard bully who traumatize more than few people, in the end all that mattered was the fact that he kept the bullying out of her field of vision last year and gave her his undivided attention and care.
