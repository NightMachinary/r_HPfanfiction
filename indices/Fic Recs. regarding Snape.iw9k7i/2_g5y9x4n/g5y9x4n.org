First of all, thank you for including some fics! I was really searching something to read, and maybe I've missed one or two.

And I bring to your attention my favorite series of Snape's fan fictions: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/981534]]

They are admittedly a bit weird, but I love them. It's a "Snape survives" series.

Since I'm from smartphone I have a bit of an hard time putting links and searching stories, but I was also reading a very good Snape/Lily in the past months. I'll see if I can find it later!

Get well soon and take care!
