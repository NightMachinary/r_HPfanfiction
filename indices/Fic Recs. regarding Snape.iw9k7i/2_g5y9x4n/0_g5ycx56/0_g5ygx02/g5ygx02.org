Thanks for the recs! I really appriciate it and will check them out immd. Wil give the New Skin a try to even if it's first person. It's just that to me, first person seems like it should only used with stream of consciousness style of Joyce or Woolf.

Anyway, Thank again for the recs and for your well wish! Take care!
