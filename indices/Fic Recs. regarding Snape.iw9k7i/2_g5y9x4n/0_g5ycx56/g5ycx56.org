I noticed now that New Skin is actually written in first person. I didn't remember. Well, apart for a couple dream sequences in the first story the style isn't "heavy", I'm not a big fan of first person myself and it didn't bother me. Maybe there's hope. Still... I'm sorry!

And I found the Snily. It isn't complete but I trust the author, and you have 141 lengthy chapter to read as you wait for the new ones. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14046060]]
