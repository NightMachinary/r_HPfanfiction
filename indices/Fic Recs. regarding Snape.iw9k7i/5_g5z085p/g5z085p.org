Linkao3(A Dealer not a Death Eater by Jaxon)

This is an awesome fic with an exciting plot. It really gets into the nitty-gritty nuance of cultural oppression (re: the First Wizarding War), love and the dynamics in abusive families (re: Snape's past), and has lots of other social themes.

The Marauders exist, but aren't a huge focus (though the though Lily-James dynamic is really interesting in this AU). Also: the story is quite dark, but /very/ complex, morally.

If you're more in the mood for an adventure with a more positive spin (ie, featuring more of the resilience and comraderie we knew and loved in canon), then I recommend the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1315952][Different Path]]" series by Dtill35 and Moonybird on AO3. (The summary does not even remotely do this work justice.)

It's a really fun genfic with lots of unique storyline and some of my favorite OC's ever. It also features one of my favorite tropes: Snape is a Marauder.

The Marauders are a huge part of this, but they all have really significant character growth--so if you're interested in seeing Sirius come to terms with his family situation and make peace with Regulus, this fic has that. It also has an arc for Remus standing his ground, and another for his "furry problem". James' growth is based around maturity and the responsibility of leadership. And Peter's is beyond a sentence or two of explanation; it's terrific.

The author's (Moonybird) first language is not English, but Dtill35 does a good job editing. And the few awkward words that make it through are well worth the fantastic story.

Edit: editor is Dtill359; I forgot a # .
