Blood Magic by GatewayGirl

It is a Severitus story, ie Snape is Harry's biological dad. It is a sixth year AU and the story focuses on their growing and complicated relationship after they found out.

I find it really well-written with Harry acknowledging that people aren't perfect and that nothing is black and white, that you can do the right thing for the wrong reasons and vice versa. Essentially Harry growing up and getting a more nuanced view of James and Severus.

The story was written before HBP came out so the backstory to Snape is different, he is a pureblood with non-European ancestry. And bisexual and attracted to Lupin, so lots of emotional stuff to unpack.

Another story that I like is the Darkness and Light triology by R.J. Anderson starting with "The Potions Master's Apprentice". Also written before HBP came out and giving Snape a slightly different backstory, but really good. IMO it has stood the test of time. Snape with a female OC who is not a Mary Sue.
