And yet Greece and Anatolia are both home to Indo-Europeans - the older languages of Anatolia might be extinct in favour of Turkic ones, but historically? They're related. (Hittite is the one I can remember off the top of my head as it's the 'famous' one, but Anatolian was its own sub-family just like Germanic and Indo-Iranian).

Which is why it's so silly to use a language group, /especially/ that particular one, to classify people. Remember: Sanskrit and Latin are cousins, and PIE ancestors are scattered throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa too.
