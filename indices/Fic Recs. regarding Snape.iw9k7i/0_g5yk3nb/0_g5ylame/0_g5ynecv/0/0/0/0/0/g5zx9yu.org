  Kartvelian speakers also have a few thousand years of inter-marriage with IE ethnic groups, by the way.

Oh ofcourse, I'm not forgetting that but we are bit more of a ''mutt'' than Western Uralics as interbreeding of Kartvelian Speakers includes Turkics and Middle Eastern peoples to little degree as well.

  You forgot Greece again.

Oh yea I forgot didn't I. I've lived in Turkey's Georgian border town until university so my brain never classified them as Europeans and still don't for the most part. I've always considered Greece and Anatolia to be their own little thing in on self rather than being part of Europe and Middle East respectively.
