Okay, so. I have a couple problems with your statements: changing Snape's race was, from what I've read in the summary, a stylistic choice in order to use it as a plot point. It does not mean that the author didn't think that dark hair, dark eyes and fair skin could not be European. (It is, and you can find that on the British Isles. [[https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS-VuGxDmpiGuxOemwqVykTUKmDgnMFmnzPYA&usqp=CAU][This dude]] is Welsh, and ticks all those boxes for example.) I, personally, have dark hair, hazel eyes and olive skin, and I am of 100% "standard" European extraction (and most of it is IRISH).

Next: Ethnic Europeans are not a subcategory of Indo-Europeans as IE is a /language group/. There is no known relation between Kartvelian (which includes Georgian) and Indo-European, just like Uralic languages are also separate (Finnish, Hungarian, etc). IE includes the language groups you mentioned (Italic, Germanic, Slavic), but also Greek, Armenian, Persian, Punjabi, Hindustani, Albanian, and a whole host of others.

*We do not know where the Proto-Indo-Europeans came from, /and/ we do not know what they looked like.*

Finally... The way you're using the term ethnic European is /nonsense./ The people from the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean are all equally "ethnic" Europeans as a random dude from Norway.
