Oh I'm sure she's a good writer since all of her stories have very above avarage comments and kudos. It can be easily seen that what she writes is enjoyable for great number of people. But the plot points are just not for me tbh and I've no interest in reading a male/male homosexual relationship, no offence to anyone but that whole concept is not something I can stomach. Just my sexual preference.

And the concept of a spell being able to identify ancestry is alright and fine but that spell should not be able to be performed by an although clever and resourceful, still a very much of a child. Since I'm guessing that spell identifies the ancestry through checking genetic make up, I'd guess/expect that it needs to be done in a very sophisticated labrotary and the results needs to be compared to other regional genetic samples. And to perform magic to precise enough to discern genetical degree one has to be very very experienced and talented.

And dark hair having something to do with non-European ancestry is just screaming not knowing anything about ethnic Europeans. Sub category of Indo European people, although fair (fairer compared to other regional ethnicities atleast) skin seems to be a unifying factor Europeans whether it be Germanic, Slavic and Latins etc have all varying degrees of fair hair/eyes and brown/black hair/eyes. I myself come from a non-Indo European people as I am Georgian myself but nearly my whole family have mix of people with from blondes with brown/hazel eyes to black hair and blue eyes. I kinda blame US racial understanding for not understanding the fact that race is more than just a hair or eye colour. Things like skull structure, bone structure, melanin, blood types etc all play part in that area. I could understand if the story was in for example a Nordic country where Populations have 80%+ and sometimes 90%+ fair eyes etc but it passes in England where even before the huge migration of non-European peoples traits such as brown eyes and black hair were not that uncommon.

Anyway, talking about genetical differences or similaritie of varying European peoples is not a place of Hpfanfiction subreddit I guess so I'll shut up. I guess I've too much time on my hand sitting at home doing nothing. :D Yea, I'm kind of a perfectionist and a very hang up on the details on stuff like this so that's why I said I'll pass on this story.
