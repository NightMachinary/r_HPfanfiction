I think you are doing the fic a disservice to dismiss it. There are few authors in the HP fandom who are as good as Gateway Girl and she shines when she writes an ambiguous Snape.

The racebend is not intentional, at the time the story was written so little was known about Snape that it was a believeable explanation for his dark hair. It provides something for Harry and Snape to bond over and it comes up a few times. For example Draco Malfoy uses a spell to test for non-European ancestry on Harry and that raises all sorts of uncomfortable questions.

Changing Harry's biodad - I am not going to argue about that, bc that is sort-of the whole plot-point. But many of my fav stories are Severitus/Sevitus and I cannot fathom dismissing them just bc of that. I find the conflict that this provides for Severus just so interesting.
