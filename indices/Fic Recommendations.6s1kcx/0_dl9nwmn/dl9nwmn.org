Well, since you said you read a lot on Fanfiction.net, and you want some smuttier stuff, it'd be best to look on Archive of Our Own, most likely.

Here's a [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreator%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=1&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=Sirius+Black%2FHermione+Granger%2FRemus+Lupin&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=&commit=Search][link.]] I did a basic search of complete "Harry Potter" fanfic, with your R/H/S pairing.

You could order it by word count and see what's there of the 30 stories I got with those parameters. But it's a very particular threesome, so I imagine the pool is very small. But you can always adjust the pairing on this search and explore AO3.
