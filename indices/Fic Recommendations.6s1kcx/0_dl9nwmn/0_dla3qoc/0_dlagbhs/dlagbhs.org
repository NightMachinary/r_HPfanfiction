Well, here is their [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][guideline page]].

But basically they allow M-rated stories, not MA stories. M-rated are stories that mature but okay for someone 16 and older to read. So basically this results in non-descriptive or gloss-over smut on fanfiction.net.

MA stories are things you can find more on AO3, which are stories that are explicit and intended for an over 18 audience.

However, very occasionally you'll find a fanfiction.net that is more MA than M. Mainly because the author has managed to dodge a warning and takedown. In fact, several stories get moved by authors to AO3, because of warning/takedowns.
