Black Luminary? It's worth the read if you have time. It's more character focused than plot focused, one of those works of huge scope where it's more about journey than destination. For me, it was enjoyable but doesn't make me ravenous for more.

Its biggest flaw is that it's still in progress. Right now the story has made a lot more promises than it has fulfilled. At 300k words presently, that hints at an absolutely enormous work once it's finished.
