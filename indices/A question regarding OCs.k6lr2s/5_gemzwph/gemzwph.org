Generally, an OC works best when they do something an existing character couldn't or wouldn't fit - and where they might bring something interesting to the plot/situation. IE, there needs to be a reason for an OC to be there for people to like/accept them. Pseudo-OCs - taking an existing background character and essentially making them into your OC - tends to be a lot more accepted.

The skepticism comes from OCs often being OP, Self-inserts, or not particularly interesting to read about - or just being a version of a canon character that didn't need to be replaced (eg, slotting an OC in to play Harry's best friend instead of Ron just feels like bashing).

So in your case, I'd ask what the benefit of the OC being Ginny's twin brings you - is there a dynamic that you think that would add that would be interesting to explore? What is the benefit of having this OC be the seer rather than Ginny, or another existing character? What kind of impact will this OC be having on the plot - will we be following them around, will they be joining with Harry/Hermione/Ron, will they just be in the background? What kind of personality will they have?

For OCs that I enjoy, it's difficult to say. Like I mentioned, there's a ton of pseudo-OCs - Daphne Greengrass would be a prime example - and those often are enjoyable - but do they count? Otherwise, OCs that are in areas not covered by canon have typically been better in stories that I've seen (though that by no means prevents them from being good) - eg, focusing on a different magical school/country, or time period, or age.
