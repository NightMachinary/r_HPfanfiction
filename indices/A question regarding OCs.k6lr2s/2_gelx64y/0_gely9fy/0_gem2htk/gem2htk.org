I mean, I like some Weasley girl fics, don't get me wrong, but only the ones where she loves Harry, because HarryxGinny never resonated with me much.

It could go either way; readers could be annoyed by a new addition to the magical world that isn't in Rowling's books, OR, readers could be interested in a new family and background of a brand-new character!

Either way, I'm excited to read your story!
