I love OCs! However, here's what you asked for...

I dislike OCs who are...

1. Superhuman powerful
2. Voldemort's target
3. Hermione's sister, because let's face it. Ron and Harry would never ignore Hermione's sister. They're too nice for that!
4. Oh, woe is me! type characters. Honestly, I would say to them..."Like, have you /seen/ Harry? The guy has to defeat a Dark Lord! While his parental world is crumbling around him!

I love OCs who are

1. Kind
2. Healers
3. They have their flaws
4. Not from a family mentioned in HP, or from a well-known family from HP. That ruins the OC thing for me.
5. I prefer OCs who are Pureblood or Half-Blood becase Muggleborns seem very curious, and to have 5 chapters dedicated to how surprised and suspicious they are of the magical world is too much.
