Thank you for your insight on this topic, this helps a lot.

  If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people).

This I like in particular. I can already promise that she's going to be very different from Ginny because that was super important to me. Where Ginny is spunky and fiery and sporty, she's going to be pretty much the exact opposite. There'll be reasons for that, obviously. Thanks again!
