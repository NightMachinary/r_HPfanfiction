The idea I have won't work without her, obviously 💁‍♀️ but I get where you are coming from. I wouldn't want an extra just to have her romance this and that character. She has her own story, she has her own purpose and it has little to do with the Golden Trio as such. Granted, because she would be a Weasley -- and Ginny's twin -- she'd have interactions with them but I would insert neither her nor Ginny into the Golden Trio.
