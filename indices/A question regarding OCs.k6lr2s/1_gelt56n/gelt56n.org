It is as with anything else: you must have true plot-given reasons for having OC. There is nothing wrong with Maria in “Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89” linkffn(9566537) (actually, she is not OC, but only almost). She has her own story (actually, in this case, she is the main heroine of the story) and it wouldn't work without her.

Disastrous OCs are those girls clinging to The Golden Trio (or “what would happen if Harry had a sister?” stories), who don't have their proper story, and only reason for their existence is that the author wants to project herself into them.

What would happen to your story, if that character vanished? Nothing? Then save the world of her presence. (BTW, this happened to JKR with Ginny to some extent: what would happen to DH, if Ginny vanished just after Harry broke up with her? Absolutely nothing).
