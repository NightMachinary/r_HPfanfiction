And there's the first issue, lol. I mean, this OC will have a divination skill, though it does come at a price. But that'd be it. Not super smart, not super skilled, not anything beyond that one skill. And even that won't be like something OP, because it would take away the whole tension if she'd just be like "this and this and that will happen at this and that time." I mean, I get where you are coming from. Personally, I want OCs as MCs to be special in /some/ way. I'd find it boring otherwise. However, if it becomes too much Anime then I nope out super fast.
