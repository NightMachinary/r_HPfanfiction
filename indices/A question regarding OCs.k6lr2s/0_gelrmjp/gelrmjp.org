I probably won't be much help since I really dislike fics with OC as the main character, but what I dislike about those fics is that the OC is always special in some way. They either are super-(powerful, smart, funny, skilled, talented) or have some unusual skills (parseltongue, legilimency, prophetic dreams, wandless magic, whatever).

The best OC (in my opinion) is someone who blends in. They should have an interesting personality, backstory or family situation that would make me want to read a story with them as the main character, instead of a long list of skills and talents that just makes them so unique they seem more like a cartoon character than a real person.
