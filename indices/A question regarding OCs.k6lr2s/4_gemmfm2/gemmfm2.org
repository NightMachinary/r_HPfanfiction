Linkffn(Green Eyed Monster) has a seer oc as a slytherin twin. Nice characterization. You will want to be less canon compliant. A Seer who is unable to make tangible changes to canon events leads to a fundamentally uninteresting story.

It would actually be nice to see a different sort of seer like in the Alex Verus series. Someone capable of short term precognition in fights and dialogue.

Linkffn(Felix Fortuna) is a good example of a interesting story even with extremely overpowered precognition for the MC.
