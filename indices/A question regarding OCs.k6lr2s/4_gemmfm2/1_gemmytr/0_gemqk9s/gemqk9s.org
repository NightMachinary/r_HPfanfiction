It would also be nice to follow the subtle effects an additional girl would have on the surrounding characters. Ron gets even less attention from his parents than in canon. The family gets poorer. The dynamics with elder pair of twins will be fascinating. Ginny's character will be subtly different. And Luna's interactions with your OC Seer should bring them closer with the OC possibly foreseeing her Mother's death and being unable to avert it.
