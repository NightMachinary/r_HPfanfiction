I think one of the important issues, in addition to the usual power stuff, is one of agency and dramatic moments.

Is the OC stealing a protagonist's agency and defining moments? Hell, it doesn't even have to be an OC, it just happens more often there. I remember one fanfic I was reading, it was an attempt to 'redeem' a really questionable non-OC character, so they put him more in the forefront. Until the character started stealing the spotlight at points when it's supposed to be the protagonist's shining moments.

As an over the top example: A new OC joining the "Golden Trio" to make a "Golden Quartet" is fine, if handled properly and they mesh. One who drives away the Dementor Horde in book three instead of Harry? Not fine, it's stealing Harry's agency. One who defeats the basilisk while Harry is unconscious? Not fine. And so on. Don't have the OC steal the protagonist's thunder.

It's fine to change things up, and have the OC do some stuff, but one must be careful.
