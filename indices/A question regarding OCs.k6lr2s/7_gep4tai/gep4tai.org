Why not just make Ginny a seer?

As evidenced by the Daphne Greengrass fandom, there are so many unutilized characters you may as well grab one of them and plaster your OC over them and get a better response. Demelza Robbins can be a seer. Jimmy Peakes can be a seer.

Lavender Brown turning out to be a real seer sounds pretty great, actually.

I personally don't mind OCs at all.
