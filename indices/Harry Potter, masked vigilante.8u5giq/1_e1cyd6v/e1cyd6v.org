Lightning-man, a crack fic about Harry fighting crime. Hermione is the Librarian, with Susan Bones as her sidekick "Stacks", Daphne Greengrass is a serpent themed villain I think called Viperess, Ron is NotRon the Weasleboy, Malfoy is the Ferret ect.

Don't know where you could find it anymore though (maybe try the yahoo groups for hp fanfiction?)
