Meh. This isn't a great fic by any stretch.

Mostly, its just Harry going back in time after being killed in the forest, to the DoM in OotP. Spoiler: he gets thrown through the veil, but doesn't die because of the blood connection with Voldemort, then comes back and decides to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters as a masked Vigilante.

Honestly, Ectomancer was sort of going that way too before it ended prematurely. That was heartbreaking.
