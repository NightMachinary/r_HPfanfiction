There's one (unfinished) where he has a trunk full of magical creatures because in the future the magic died and he time travelled with the surviving ones in stasis to try to go back far enough to save them. It's a bit angsty because not all of them made it.

He also goes to all the muggle orphanages and collects the "special" children to bring to his own orphanage, including a boy named Tom.

Sadly the author abandoned fanfic writing altogether because of too many attacks on his grammar/punctuation. It was a really good story despite these flaws.
