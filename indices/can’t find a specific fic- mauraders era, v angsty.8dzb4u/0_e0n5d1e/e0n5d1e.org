I stumbled on this while I was for what I think is the same fic - I think it's The Life and Times if you're still looking for it! It's very similar to what you described, but Lily dates Sam Dearborn, who is related to Caradoc in the story, an OC dyes her hair blonde, Marlene chops her (blonde) hair short, Frank cheats on Alice, it's all very angsty...
