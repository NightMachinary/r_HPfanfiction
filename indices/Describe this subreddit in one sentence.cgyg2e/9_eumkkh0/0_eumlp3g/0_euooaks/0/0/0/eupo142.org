Somebody do give me some details on Astoria cause i had thought of writing one.

Only thing I know about her is that she's a brunette and has chocolate brown eyes and has a bubbly and cheerful personality.

Maybe She's a year younger than Harry and is fairly neutral.

How did she end up with Draco The Prick, That I do not know.

Somebody give me pointers plz.

And if anyone wanna cowrite or beta, dm me.

Honestly Daphne's more fun to write due to her Ice Queen persona but that's just my opinion.
