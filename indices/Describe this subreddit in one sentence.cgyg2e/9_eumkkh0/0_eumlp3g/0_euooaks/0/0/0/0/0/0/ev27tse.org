Hmm, how did they build such a complex character out of nothing from canon? I am very curious to see the fic that started this all. (Mainly because they didn't do this to any other character)

I personally feel Susan Bones has a huge scope for character development. My fav Fanon Pairing is Luna/Harry though.

I don't mean to be rude asking all these questions, It's difficult to get my thoughts across comments, and people think I'm passive agressive, which surprised me because I have questions which is why I joined this subreddit in first place :) Thanks for answering!
