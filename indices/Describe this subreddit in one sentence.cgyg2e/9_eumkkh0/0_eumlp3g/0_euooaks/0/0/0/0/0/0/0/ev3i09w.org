Nah man, it's alright to ask about it. The point is both Daphne and Susan are blank slates and are completely up to us to mould their persona. Daphne is only shown in one scene and Susan doesn't get too much screen time. Hell the one time I remembered Susan was when Amelia Bones was murdered. We do got a basic framework for Luna through the books and movies for being dreamy.

Years and Years of fanfics helped in Character Development of Daphne. It could be that a guy just thought of pairing Harry with an OC (considering thousands and thousands of Ginny and Hermione Pairing) and checked JKR's website and found Daphne Greengrass, connecting her to Astoria and thought that , 'Hey lets make Draco and Harry Brother-In-Laws by pairing Harry with Daphne. That could be the origin of HP/DG pairing, at least what I think. But, JUST A OPINION OF MINE. Some made her personality Cold, Distant and Aloof, building a Ice Queen Persona for her. Its up to you how to make her personality. You can make her cheerful and bubbly or use the basic Ice Queen Persona. It's your choice.

Harry/Luna is also a good pairing, I have read some of those but authors tend to make oneshots only for them. I never got a full novel length fanfic for them. If you got some, do tell me about it.

Normally these pairing are made to be hated by other students of Hogwarts except a select few. Like students may hate Daphne for being a Slytherin, Susan for being a Hufflepuff, making a mindset of a weak person or Luna for being insane according to them

Authors tend to write their fics so that Ron and Hermione hate Daphne for being a Slytherin and Smarter than Hermione (Hermione has somewhat of a competitive nature as shown in Half Blood Prince), Susan for being supposedly weak and not right for Harry and Luna for being plain Insane. Hermione might not be like that in some fics and Ron may accept them or not but thats how authors tend to write fics.

Personally I believe that these pairings have a lot of potential and do tell me why a woman is screaming in a muggle station about where is Platform 9¾. Didn't Molly, Authur, Charlie, Bill, Percy, Gred and Forge attended Hogwarts before? Surely they must have conveniently forgot about it in order to help Harry find the Platform, sound fishy to me.

I like to read Dumbledore Ron and occasionally Hermione bashing fics cause they feel like my type. But your opinion matters, not mine.

Anyways, excuse me for my ranting and hope you got your answer my friend !!¡!!
