That's the exact point! Daphne's a blank slate and years of writing Daphne fanfics by other authors gave us the basic framework of an Ice Queen of Slytherin Persona. Its how we manipulate the story in order to make her open up to Harry and Harry to her is how the story's subplot revolves.

The basic idea of her character is that :--

A. She's A blue eyed blonde girl with a hot figure. ( Not exactly Susan Bones but not flat chested either )

B. Her Personality is cold towards everyone except her parents, sister and her best friends Tracy and Blaise. (Some fanfics do make her character about hating her parents and sister but thats up to you to write it)

C. Her family, The Greengrass, is a neutral family. ( Again, some make them dark,light or neutral but thats up to you )

D. She does not follow Draco's gang of ruffians.

E. She's a straight O student and the Topper of her class. ( Intelligent but not a Hermione-bookworm either )

F. She loves Ice Cream and Chocolates. (Ice Queen loves Ice Cream, welp!!!)

I take character inspiration for her from Virginia Gardner

( More Terese than Virginia but, Your choice. )

But still, Its fun for me to read an HP/DG story where the Ice Queen fall for Harry and stands by his side through thick and thin. Normally in fanfics i read till now, they are either introduced through Marriage Contract or in Triwizard when nobody believed Harry but Daphne does. You can do the same or make them meet at the train or put both Harry and Daphne in Slytherin house. Its up to you on how to set them up.

Excuse me if I did got carried away but it's was fun to write about Daphne.

I hope you got your answer my friend. PEACE!!ยก!!
