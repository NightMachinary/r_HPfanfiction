The general expansion of rules. Specifically, that all of the new rules are targeted at limiting discussion.

Most concerning is the sneaky expansion of rule 8. Rule 8 itself was implemented as a consequence of Reddit-wide policy. But recently, the mods appear to have added an additional section of text to it:

#+begin_quote
  Gratuitous or positive depictions of non-consensual sexual content are also subject to removal.
#+end_quote

You will notice that when Rule 8 was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7x1cdx/compliance_with_reddit_rule_change_regarding/][implemented]], no mention was made of this.

This is disturbing for two reasons:

1. In the past, all additions to the rules have been discussed among the community, not added unilaterally by the mods, without notice to the community of the change.

2. In the past, the subreddit has maintained a strict policy of "no kink shaming". Non-consent/rape fantasies are extremely common, [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605][especially]] [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20620397?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents][among]] [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/all-about-sex/201001/womens-rape-fantasies-how-common-what-do-they-mean][women]].

The second one is particularly troubling because the moderation team have a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5v5f2v/new_rule_proposals/][history]] of wanting to impose their own personal morality on the subreddit in terms of wanting to ban certain kinds of fics. In the past, the community has consistently pushed back against this, and the mod team has respected that push-back. But now it seems that new rules intended to limit the types of discussion which can occur are being implemented covertly, without notice and without consultation.
