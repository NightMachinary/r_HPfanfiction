  I just can't sympthise with the MC in a slash fanfiction, that's why I don't read them. I'm not homophobic.

  But I also read three different het romance from female perspective in one month.

I don't think "I can't sympathise with the MC in a slash fanfiction" is an accurate description of the situation.

For the type of reader who projects onto the protagonist rather than merely sympathises with them, not reading slash is just an example of a more general reading perspective. That perspective is the lack of interest in fics where the protagonist is attracted to individuals the reader does not find attractive.

Because it's not just Harry/male that this type of reader dislikes. It's also Harry/Umbridge, Harry/Millicent, etc. Basically Harry paired with anyone, regardless of gender, who the reader would not want to have a relationship with themselves. Seen through this lens, the lack of interest in slash is nothing more or less than the fact that the reader is straight.

This cuts both ways - it is why so many straight female readers like slash (and only read slash) - because they are attracted to men, they want to read a story where the MC is attracted to the characters they find attractive.

So it's not the fact that the MC is gay per se which breaks the reader's identification with the MC. It's the fact that the MC is seeking out relationships that the reader would not want for themselves, gay or otherwise. It's the same reaction as when the MC does something stupid - the reader is annoyed, because they feel that they would never have done that thing.

For this type of reader, the reading experience is like a video game: Harry is the reader's avatar in the world - an extension of the reader themselves, not an independent character. That works so long as the avatar does things the reader likes. But the moment Harry starts doing things the reader wouldn't want to do (or does not aspire to do), it's like playing a video game with broken controls. Frustrating.

As for female protagonists - I suspect that for many (straight male) readers, the reading perspective is different from the outset when reading a female character. Whereas with Harry you are living vicariously through him, such that his sexual experiences are your own, I suspect that with female characters the reader's point of view is more that of imagining themselves with the MC. Which is why (straight male) readers of female protagonists will generally only be interested in female protagonists who they find attractive. The test is the same "Would I want to be with this person?", it's just the target is different.
