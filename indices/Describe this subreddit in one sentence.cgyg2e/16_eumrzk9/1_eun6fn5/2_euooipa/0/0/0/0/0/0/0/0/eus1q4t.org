Thank you! At end of the day I don't care that this subreddit has homophobic redditors with preconceived notions about M/M relationships.

Fanfiction.net and AO3 favorites and kudos speak at end of the day, and I'm glad to say many of the top fics (In ao3's case almost all) , are Slash relationships. So this subreddit's users don't represent the fanfiction readers out there.
