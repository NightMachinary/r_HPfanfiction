I was curious, so I looked it up on AO3. As of right now, there are [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works][2,499,461 works categorized as M/M on AO3]], of which [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=BDSM&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=M*s*M][118,304 are also tagged BDSM]]. 118304 รท 2499461=0.04733180473, so slightly less than 5% of slash works on AO3 are BDSM. Granted, this search won't catch all of them due to people undertagging their fics, but it's certainly not enough of a problem to turn 4.7% into 90%.

If we narrow it down to the Harry Potter fandom specifically, there are currently [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=M*s*M][103,734 Harry Potter works categorized as M/M]], of which [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=BDSM&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=M*s*M][5,027 are also tagged BDSM]]. 5027 รท 103734 = 0.04846048547, so the Harry Potter fandom has about 0.1% more slash BDSM fics than the archive as a whole. The percentage tagged Dom/sub specifically is about [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&include_work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Dom%2Fsub&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=M*s*M][2.1%]].
