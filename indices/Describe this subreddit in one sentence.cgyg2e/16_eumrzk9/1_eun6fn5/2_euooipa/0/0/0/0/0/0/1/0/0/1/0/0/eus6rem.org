My fannish history sounds pretty similar to yours, except Remus/Sirius instead of Snape/Harry. We weren't hit as hard by Strikethrough as your camp, but I think most of us went "fuck this shit" in solidarity and fled to other platforms in the exodus. I miss crack_broom and crack_van so much, though. And all the newsletters!

I was hoping after Tumblrpocalypse that we might get more people moving back to Dreamwidth, but it seems like most people headed to Twitter, which I like even less than I liked Tumblr, so fml, lol. Meanwhile I guess I'll be hanging out on reddit being stubbornly pro-slash and hoping The Next Big Thing comes along sooner rather than later.
