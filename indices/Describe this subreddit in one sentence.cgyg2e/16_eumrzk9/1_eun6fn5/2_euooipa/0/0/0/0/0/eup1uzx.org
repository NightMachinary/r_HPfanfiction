Well, I don't agree. I've been writing slash in HP and reading it in numerous fandoms for almost 15 years. Like most of us here, I've read at least a few thousand fics by now. I promise you, there are all kinds of dynamics. And yes, of course there's a ton of badfic - bad for more reasons than I care to count. But saying it's all D/s and that's why it's 'garbage'? Nope.

It's fine with me if you don't read slash. I can't imagine it would bring the writers joy to have you lecture them on why their content is bullshit.
