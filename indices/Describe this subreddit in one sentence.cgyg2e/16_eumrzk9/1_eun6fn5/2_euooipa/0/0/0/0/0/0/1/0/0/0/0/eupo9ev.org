Oh, I perfectly understand why Snape/Harry squicks people. But I like age-gap or cross-gen pairings in certain combinations (Snape/Dumbledore is another favorite) if there's tension or unresolved issues or power imbalances or thematic parallels or what-have-you. I also like unconventionally attractive or even ugly characters together (for example, Snape/Filch, mostly because of one stellar writer).

I'm sure I have more brilliant fannish revelations I could unload on you, but fortunately you'll be spared because I just realized it's already 2:30 am on a workday. But thanks for sticking with the conversation.
