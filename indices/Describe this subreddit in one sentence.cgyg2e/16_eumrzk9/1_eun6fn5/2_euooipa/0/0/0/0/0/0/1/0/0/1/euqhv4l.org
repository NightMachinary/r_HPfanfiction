  I'm also baffled by the general rage toward badfic. Either I'm supernaturally skilled at identifying and skipping things I don't enjoy, which means they never get a chance to leave an impression, or most people on this sub torture themselves by wading into poorly written shite.

I sometimes feel the same, but I do get the impression that a lot of people here read mainly on FFN, so maybe that has something to do with the rage towards badfic? AO3 certainly has plenty of badfic, but the waitlist for an invite seems to scare off a lot of the writers who just barf out words on a page and post them immediately with no edits to start getting comments, so in my experience the writing quality on AO3 is higher on average than FFN. AO3 also has a higher average age for the userbase, which also tends to lead to more skilled authors, and a much better tagging system that makes it easier to filter fics you're not interested in from your search results without ever seeing them, let alone having to scroll past them every time you run a search.
