Severus/Harry squicks me out mainly because of one the MASSIVE age gap and two i honesly can't see harry as gay.

Like, Outside of Cedric or maybe Ron I don't see Harry liking dudes at all, mainly because most of the men in his life (Vernon, Dudley, Snape, Fudge, Malfoy, Tom) were all awful to him. but i digress.
