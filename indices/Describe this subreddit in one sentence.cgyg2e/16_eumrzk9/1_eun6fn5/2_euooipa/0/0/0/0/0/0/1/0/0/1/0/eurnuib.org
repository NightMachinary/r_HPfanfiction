You're probably right. I started out on LiveJournal, where it could be harder to find fics if you weren't part of the community, but there were a lot more rec lists and reccing comms (oh, how I miss crack_broom and crack_van) and dedicated archives to help guide readers. After the LJ exodus, I started using AO3, partly because Snape/Harry was one of the ships targeted by the religious organization that threatened LJ with lawsuits and created the whole Strikethrough situation. I came late to ff.net and even now only read there if I trust the reccer's taste.

AO3 may not have the sheer quantity of badfic ff.net does, but give it time. It's getting there. I don't use the tag system much myself; my tastes are pretty specific, and authorial style and characterization are the true enticements for me. Kinks and tropes, not so much. I can usually tell within a few sentences whether to hit the back-button or keep reading.

I also suspect a lot of this sub's members avoid AO3 because of the visibility of slash, which they automatically categorize as badfic. So in their eyes, ff.net is superior because it has far more het and gen. Of course, it also means they've got to navigate the search system without a map. And a lot of people just plain forget that fanfiction is amateur by definition, and as fandom becomes more mainstream, the upswing in baby's first fics increases sharply. Students on their lunch breaks posting silly in-joke fics and fantasies for each other is just part of online life now.
