I'm trying to find it, but one of my all time favorites was a Harry/Cedric but i read it ages ago. I also read a really great Remus/Sirius fic that made me smile as well.

Keep in mind, I don't like reading sex scenes in anything really, I'm a straight dude and while I am biased towards het and tend to read het or femslash more often, as long as the slash doesn't have creepy shit (Severus/Harry) or graphic sex i'll normally give it a chance.
