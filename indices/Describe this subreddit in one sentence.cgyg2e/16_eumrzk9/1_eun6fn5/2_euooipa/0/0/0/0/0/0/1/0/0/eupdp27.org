See, it makes complete sense to me that straight dudes don't read gay sex scenes. (For that matter, no one /needs/ to read smut of any kind. It should be an opt-in experience.) It's the broad-brush hostility toward slash that brings me out of the woodwork.

I actually do like smut, and I'll read all kinds of things, although I'm /extremely/ picky about the het sex I like. Most of the people in my fandom circles take smut in stride, and some are quite kinky, so very little fazes me.

I'm also baffled by the general rage toward badfic. Either I'm supernaturally skilled at identifying and skipping things I don't enjoy, which means they never get a chance to leave an impression, or most people on this sub torture themselves by wading into poorly written shite.

Full disclosure, by the way: you're talking to a creepy Snape/Harry shipper who prefers fic about messed-up relationships. Welcome to my dungeon.
