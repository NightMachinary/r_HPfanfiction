Well, it /is/ a canon in its own right, though not one as well-built as the literary one to be sure. As long as a writer explicitly say they are a fan of the /movies/ and are writing fanfiction of the movie universe, it /is/ a canon.

But either way, the point is more that in this case, it's a very iconic and in-character thing for Bellatrix to do. Even under the premise that the movies aren't canon, that makes them "officially sanctioned fanfiction", and there's nothing wrong with borrowing ideas from that "other fanfiction", much as stories routinely borrow from one another (wards, etc.).
