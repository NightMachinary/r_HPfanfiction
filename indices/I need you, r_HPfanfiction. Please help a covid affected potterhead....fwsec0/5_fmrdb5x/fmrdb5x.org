If you liked Isolation and haven't read Hunted by the same author already, drop everything you're doing and go read that. A hidden gem that I am disappointed not to see on this thread is The Unwinding of Percy Weasley, which I feel is a delicious slice of low stakes fluff that still manages to tickle the need for substance. The main female character is perhaps slightly too perfect, but the characterization of Percy and Arthur is superb. If you REALLY have an overabundance of time, I recommend checking out ByeByeBirdie's Balcony series, which is honest to God probably the longest work of fiction I've ever finished, with the exception of The Wheel of Time. ByeByeBirdie has a weakness for dramatic monologues, but over such a long story you will build up a tolerance surprisingly quickly. Given it's length and melodrama, some have compared the series to a soap opera, which I feel is inaccurate if only because you actually grow to care about the characters. Mad respect to ByeByeBirdie for her dedication to completing fics- her first was published in 2002, and she just finished another a few months ago. Order of Mercy is a fantastic canon compliant Deathly Hallows fic that focuses on Percy/Fleur/Bill, my only gripe with it is that the author makes Fleur just a wee tad too domestic for my taste- I could be mistaken, as it has been a long while since I read the fic.
