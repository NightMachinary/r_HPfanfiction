Very glad you liked it! I like broadening my horizons too, but I'm similarly wary of new experiences. The prose was just so solid in this one that I got hooked.

These days I do like finding authors and sticking with them moreso than doing the old filter search - if coco's writing appealed to you, I'd also encourage checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5909028/SallyJAvery][SallyJAvery]] - her writing is very poetic and evocative.

Thanks for your hard work!
