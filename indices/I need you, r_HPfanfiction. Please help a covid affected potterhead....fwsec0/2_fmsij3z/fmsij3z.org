I just finished catching up with the Innocent series by MarauderLover7. I am sorry that it's not post-Hogwarts, and pairings are not decided yet, since the latest fic of the series, Intensity, is only halfway through the fourth year.

But, the series starts with Sirius escaping from Azkaban to adopt Harry, and it goes...well, it goes a lot of places from there actually. This has easily become my favourite Sirius-adopts-Harry, as well as Harry-gets-realistically-stronger fics (or rather, series of fics, ever). There is a lot of heartfelt family bonding, between Sirius and Harry, between Sirius and Remus, between Harry and Remus, and a host of other people frankly. Plus, this fic series has the best good Draco I have ever seen.

Here is the first one in the series: linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]] ). I hope you will give this one a try.

Thank you for your service.
