They may be capable of mimicking speech, if the fear they're representing demands it. For example, a lot of people here have mentioned Hermione's Boggart in the third year exam. That Boggart turns into Professor McGonagall. However, Hermione isn't afraid of McGonagall as such. What she fears is *being told she isn't good enough* - the fear specifically works because of what McBoggart is saying. No speech means no fear.

So, what does your character REALLY fear? His parents?

Or something his parents might say?
