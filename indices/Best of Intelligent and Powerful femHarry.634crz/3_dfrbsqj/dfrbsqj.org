linkffn(A butterfly effect by SlyGoddess) Still has my favorite Sirius chasing Peter scene I've ever seen. Politics exist but aren't a strong point of the story, but intelligent and powerful fit pretty well.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home) Just backing up midasgoldentouch here. Fantastic story.

linkffn(Princess of the blacks by SilentlyWatches) Fairly political at times, underhanded wee bit OP protagonist (although Voldemort seems similarly powered up). Johnsmitish warnings definitely apply.

I could have sworn [[/u/taure]] had a fic with a female protagonist who was learning etiquette from Dumbledore and practiced somnamancy. It might be on DLP or something... Or maybe I finally went insane.
