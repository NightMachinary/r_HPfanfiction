linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). I mean, the character is a female Harry, who is intelligent, powerful, and ruthlessly pragmatic. On the flip side, it is far more about the exploration of absurdism than anything else. Don't let that deter you though, because it is the fic everyone should read.
