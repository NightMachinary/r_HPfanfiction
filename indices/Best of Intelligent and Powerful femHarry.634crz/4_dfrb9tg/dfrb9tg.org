Princess of the Blacks did it incredibly well, with a bit of romance added in. Powerful fem!Harry, who solved problems not through power but through cunning, and whose family was heavily involved in the political world. I love it.

Just keep in mind, part of the story is that Jen, or fem!Harry, was raised in a bad environment that invovled child prostitution. I'd say don't let that skew your view of the story, since it doesn't come up that often, but since the entire first chapter is literally set in a brothel, just keep it in mind.
