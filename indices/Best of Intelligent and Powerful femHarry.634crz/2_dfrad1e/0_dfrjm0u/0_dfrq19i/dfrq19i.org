I wouldn't really classify it as "powerful Harry" though. Sure, Harry(Mel) is working on it but generally she's average. It's very much realistic in that sense, just because Mel decides she needs to be better doesn't mean that she's gonna be a godlike witch through half a year of training.

She's progressing fast but she's just very far behind and I don't expect her to ever be strong enough to beat Voldemort.

So while the fic technically fits OP's requirement, the focus of it is not on Mel being super powerful. It's more about her noticing how fucked up her life is, how much of that is actually partly her fault and what she can do to fix it.
