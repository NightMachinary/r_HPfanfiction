Well

- the science is either wrong or explained in such a way as to be useless for anything except showing how smart the author is

- the author's arrogance bleeds into the character so much that people have started calling him Hariezer

- the author has no sense of comedy or pacing, and the story suffers greatly under family guy style jokes

- the magic system is shit

- characters are not characters; a teacher, scholar and academic is struck speechless by an eleven year old who hasn't cracked open his schoolbooks. It's the definition of the dunning-kruger effect.

- statements and actions don't matter; one character makes a rape threat, this is never brought up again

But I think the worst thing is that MoR does not contain actual rationality, or science. It contains a religious notion of their likeness - a worship of what they represent.

A truly rationally thinking person would not enter a world where the rules are different and attempt to work with the wrong set out of spite, for instance.

They would not lecture others on how smart they are, because that's completely useless in achieving anything.

They would not attempt to force magic into a system that it is clearly not meant to be contained within by fudging the variables like some game theory sensationalist - they would, you know, apply the scientific method; evidence, data, theories. Not rants about how the evidence contradicts what you thought you knew before. Because that makes you the exact opposite of a rational person - namely, a fool.
