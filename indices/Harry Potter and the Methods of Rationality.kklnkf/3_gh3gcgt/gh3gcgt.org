Discussion. Meta is talking specifically about the sub itself (eg. Why does HPFanfiction do this thing that I don't like/understand?). Discussion is talking about fanfic stuff.

And to answer your main question - personally, I just find the Harry in it to be a smug, intolerable twat. He seems like the kind of person who'd smarm a "Well, actually, I think you'll find that I'm technically right, which you'd know if you'd read all the books I have." in the conversation that you got trapped in because everyone else at the party was more successful in avoiding him. Whether it's intentional or not, he's just such a turn-off that I can't like the fic.

I like likeable characters, even if they're monsters, and I actually do enjoy characters that discuss the functional, philosophical, and moral implications and characteristics of things (even if I disagree, it's still interesting to read). But if a character irritates me, I'm not going to want to spend time with them (ie. reading the story) in the same way I probably wouldn't want to spend time with a real person that irritated me.

I have no particular opinion on anything else about the story - the science, the plot, the premise, the other characters, the setting, etc - because I never got to read it. Harry is just so fundamentally dislikeable for me that I couldn't read more than a couple of chapters in.
