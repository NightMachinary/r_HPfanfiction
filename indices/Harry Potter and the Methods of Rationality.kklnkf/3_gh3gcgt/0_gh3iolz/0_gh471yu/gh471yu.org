The author makes a living by writing about how intellectually superior he is and essays on how it would be better to torture someone to death than for people to have dust in their eyes. He's that obsessed with Utilitarianism, if he's the one making the decisions about what's better with his massive brain.

He's the King of the Neckbeards.
