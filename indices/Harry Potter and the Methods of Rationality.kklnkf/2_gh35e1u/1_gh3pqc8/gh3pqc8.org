  the characters and therefore writer
#+end_quote

That doesn't necessarily follow, you know. The writer is not the characters. If you examine the story closely, you'll find that it recognises that Harry is making mistakes, and those mistakes come back to haunt him.

My understanding is that Harry was supposed to simulate the author /as he was at a much younger age/, so in some ways the author does sympathise with him, and in other ways the author would be exasperated by him.
