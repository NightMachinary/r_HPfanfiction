I would like to point out that a character being annoying does not necessarily mean that the author is annoying. I for example, frequently write characters that are depressed and self-deprecating, just to lift them out. Now, I'd admit that I'm not sure it's realistic or not, but that's not the point. The point is that the personality of the character does not equal the character of the author.
