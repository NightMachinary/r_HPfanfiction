We did indeed discuss this a few days ago. This is what I said then:

I tried the first few chapters, but had to give up. I'd heard a lot of good things about it, but it just wasn't for me.

I thought that the "Harry" in the fic was a very blatant self-insert, and the whole thing seemed like an exercise in pointing out all of the logic fails of canon, attacking suspension of disbelief, and generally mocking people who actually enjoy the story.

I get the feeling that I was supposed to read through it and be amazed and impressed at how smart the author is, but I just...wasn't.

Harry was completely unlikeable, which makes me assume that the author is too. Acting that superior/smug/I'm-smarter-than-you-and-don't-forget-it in the real world will most likely result in people either ignoring you, or if you become too insufferable, punching you in the face.
