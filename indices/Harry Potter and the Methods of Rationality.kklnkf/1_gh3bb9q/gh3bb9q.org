I mean, I definately gave up reading before any plot happened. I think I got to like the 4/5th chapter before getting bored?

Maybe it's because I have a science degree and my career is in science? I started reading it going "hey this might be funny" since it combined two of my things, Potter and Physics. But it ended up just being really boring?

Partly because some of the justifications are... Not necessarily wrong but certainly flawed... Which makes it difficult for me to read. I just got mad at it. (and thats a personal problem from my history in Astrophysics, I get mad at basically every sci-fi movie now it's very annoying). Hearing people/books trying to explain metaphysical concepts to the general public will always be fustrating to a physicist because they're always wrong. Simply because it's impossible to be right as a layman doesn't have the knowledge to understand the truth. No fault to either party.

But also because it turns out I hate when you try to apply normal people logic to fantasy worlds. I read Fantasy to escape the logic I usually live in. So it didn't appeal to me.

I don't hate MoR. It's just not my thing but a lot of things aren't my thing. I get why people like it though it's funny in an obscure way.
