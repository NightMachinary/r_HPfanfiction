I like your comment much better than others, just purely because I feel your comment has a lot more substance to it, though I guess this isn't any fault of theirs. Yeah, I can see how that would turn you off, but I'm not a scientist, so I can't actually relate to you. I guess it's just unfortunate.

Thank you for writing this humongous comment, and I appreciate it.
