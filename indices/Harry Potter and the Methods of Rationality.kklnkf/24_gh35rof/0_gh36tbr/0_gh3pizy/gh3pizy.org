I think there's a kernel of truth in that. One of the key ideas of the philosophy community that MoR belongs to is that you start to learn about rational thinking, which allows you to recognise and discuss a laundry list of mistakes you've been making - and yet you keep making them, and keep making them, and maybe you manage to fix one or two here and there, but having the language to describe your mistakes isn't an overnight fix. So yes, there's a lot of talk about doing better, with a much smaller proportion of actual behavioral change.
