Most haters are annoyed by Harry being an arrogant sort of person and the inclusion of science and rationality in a fantasy world. I personally like HPMOR very much, and I think many of the haters stopped reading it before the virtues of the story become apparent. For example, it is a story of character development, and you can't make Harry improve as a person if he is not obnoxious at the beginning. Maybe one other reason to dislike it is the quite intellectual parts. The average teenage reader who is mainly interested in romance gets annoyed when Harry and Dumbledore have a long and thorough discussion about philosophical things like whether immortality is a good or a bad thing.
