Considering the fic's a decade old at this point, and that it's a few years since my last re-read, I still have fond memories of it if I also consider that it was one of the first fics I ever read.

Since then, I've read a whole lot more, firmly determined my likes and dislikes, gained some irrational limitations like "won't read if not complete and 100k+ words etc..", and even entered the wold of crossovers. HP cross of course. <- mind blown with the possibilities. And finally frustrated that "the cross i want" doesnt exist or isn't good, or some other arbitrary, self-imposed, subjective restriction.

That said, if i'm jonesing, i peek at reddit for any recommandations, irrespective of my stated restrictions. <- so less of a total snob and more of privileged teen brat throwing a tantrum.

So take it with a grain of salt when I say: I enjoyed parts of it, i disliked parts of it, but never did i stop reading it. I'm a little better than ambivalent about the work as a whole. I've read other works that were much more painful to their completion and felt aweful afterwards. And some works were completely amazing and then ruin it with a twist ending.

I don't recall the name, but there's one where hedwig is a horcrux, and like everyone dies at the end. <- or maybe i'm remembering it wrong, and everone BUT Harry survives.

HPMoR is not that story. I rate HPMoR average in my book. Even with the Hermione thing. <- If i was going to stop, it would have been right there.

The whole author talking (teaching/preaching) to the reader thing is a bit unusual, i grant, but it gave the story for some much needed context. I interpreted it as an experiment of sorts, where the protagonist is an amplified version of the author. Canon-bashing is canon-bashing. Enough fics do it that i just don't care. And the whole end game was highly contrived. BUT i understood it to be intentionally highly contrived so as to arrive at that specific scenario. <- which is contrary to the author's premise of "what would happen if the characters were more logical".

Now I take off my analysis hat, and put on my tin foil one.

I suspect that the author initially tried to follow his own rules for writing the story. About 1/2 to 3/4 of the way in he realized that if the characters were truly logical, none of the exciting stuff would conceivably (by our human, non-fantasy standards) happen. So he had no choice but to start coercing the story so he could have the "only one way out" scenario at the end.

Removes tin foil.

That said, this is the same debate that MHA and naruto fans have. It can get pretty toxic. Clearly HPMoR has something for everyone, otherwise it wouldn't have the following that it does.

Objective criticism, backed by examples of your expectations are an author's best friend and helps ever so slightly improve the number and quality of fics that will be available in future. I see it as an investment in MY personal future so that I may have more and better fics to consume.

I don't feel I have the creative potential to pen a fic, so never have. I am thankful for Less Wrong and all of the other authors I have consumed over the years, irrespective of my personal opinions of each individual work. I will never recommend someone to NOT read a particular fic, I will happily discuss any fic, but I will never discuss a fic I have not read to its completion. (Count on one hand)

HTH and YMMV
