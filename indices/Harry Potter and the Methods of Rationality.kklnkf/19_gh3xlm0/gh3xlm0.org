It's not for everyone. It's got its strong points - but Hpmor Harry is fairly unlikeable, and what the plot develops into is a pretty far cry from the initial premise imo (that is, I saw it as 'scientific Harry exploring the magical world')

The author making harry a self insert also adds in a bunch of weird aspects - with his odd version of 'rationality', his being scared about AI (in a weird thought experiment that got him terrified), etc.

It's competently written and complete, and certainly has a lot of fans - I recommend everyone try it, to see if they enjoy it, but not to keep at it if (like me) they find it not to their taste
