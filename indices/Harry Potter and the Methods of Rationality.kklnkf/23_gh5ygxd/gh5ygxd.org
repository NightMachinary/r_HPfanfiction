I also feel like it's taken very seriously by canon purists. Especially glaring while stuff like A Black Comedy or Firebird gets a pass for being much more imo canon in name only.

In my view it's a fascinating story that takes some characters up to 11, has some OOC moments, and has some characters the author obviously doesn't like. And that...could apply equally to a *lot* of fanfics.

I've privately also wondered before if it's also less popular with some because it features to an extent a super!Harry but who is too young for pairings/sex/comedy that those characters usually get embroiled in.

Ultimately I have no issue with it as a fic. It sets out with an initial premise - Harry is very smart - and proceeds from that point in a logically consistent way. Not all fics even manage that!
