I suspect that part of the issue is also the fact that the author had an agenda in writing it - he wanted to produce a tutorial on rational thinking - and being a Harry Potter story was a vehicle for that goal, rather than an end in itself. That could contribute to the "this isn't a proper HP story" vibe that some people get, even though objectively it isn't even all that divergent compared to some stories.
