It sounds like we aren't actually disagreeing here that the only impact of Hermione's death is for Harry to feel bad about it. In the grand scheme of the fic, Hermione's skills, abilities, decisions, or even availability as a resource had practically no impact. It wasn't an actual /setback/. Heck, it got him out of a debt.

In fact, does Harry ever actually reflect on the fact that Hermione's death is a consequence of his own foolish behaviour or draw any conclusions about how he could act or treat other people? All I remember is that he laments that he wasn't clever enough in the moment and rants at McGonagall about how /she/ is oh-so-authoritarian and---as is traditional for a Gary Stu fic---she meekly acquiesces and promises to change.

Murder of Harry's parents' has a far greater impact than the loss of an inconsequential character towards whom the protagonist has some friendly affection, and you know it.
