Now, I'm not a science-savvy person, but is it possible that the research that you refer to was more widely accepted when the fic was written? It is a very old one after all.

Other than that, the story employs a very clich√© trope where if used muggle-discovered Laws of Physics on magic, a humongous breakthrough can be conceived. It's very common, though I'm not sure if it was so when the fic was written, so there's that.
