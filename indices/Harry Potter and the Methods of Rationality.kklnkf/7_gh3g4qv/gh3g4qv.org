So I generally enjoyed my time reading HPMOR, but it is a really flawed work. I'm not going to add spoiler tags, so be warned.

The basic premise I was sold on was that it would be a realistic take on Harry Potter where the MC would use science to investigate the world.

Instead, we get an arrogant twat who simply refuses to accept that magic and therefore the metaphysical invalidates a lot of what he should think he knows. For instance, he goes on a long rant about how the animagus transformation should be impossible due to the conservation of mass. Despite knowing jack shit about magic.

Pretty much the "science" in the story can be broken into three categories:

1. Harry spouting off some research as gospel truth. Which ironically there's now doubts about the physiological research due to the replication crisis and where the author didn't spend time checking whether what's put in the story matches the science.
2. Harry thinking hard about something magical using only his mundane knowledge and somehow making a massive discovery of magic.
3. One or two semi experiments where the scientific method is vaguely followed.

Most this doesn't make it far into the story anyway and we're left with the rest of the story, which has a number of massive flaws.

In particular,

1. None of the adults punish Harry severely for his lack of respect.
2. Harry never really faces any personal consequences for his dumb mistakes and hubris until the very end where he's literally forced at gunpoint to take an unbreakable vow to actually think things through.
3. The story spends way too much time trying to keep up the fact that Harry doesn't realize Quirrel is Voldemort.

What we're left with is an arrogant character that doesn't really exemplify how one should grow and learn using rationality, but rather an OP power wank where "rationality" and a superficial understanding of science gives you lots of power beyond other mages.

That said there are a lot of interesting ideas in the story, but there's a lot wrong too.
