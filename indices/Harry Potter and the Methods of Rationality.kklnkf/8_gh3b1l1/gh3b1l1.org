I think a lot of readers here like to imagine themselves as the protagonist of any story they read, and the hpmor Harry is too annoying for them to want to be. I saw someone complain about the part that mentions that this Harry never played D&D because he didn't have any friends, but he did memorize the rulebooks. I thought that was a hilarious description of a character who was clearly intentionally written to be unlikable, but apparently for a lot of readers an unlikable main character is a deal-breaker. I enjoy the contrast between this Harry's extreme arrogance and foolishness.

In the Facebook hpfanfiction groups, it's hated because there's no romance or sex. People in those groups tend to have one-track minds.
