I like HPMoR because of its humor. The whole thing with ComedTea, and the situation between Harry and Draco (he thinks dumbledore thinks I'm converting you, subtlety of a rampaging nundu, a normal child if his doting father was Darth Vader) come to mind. I just gloss over the philosophising and stuff like some people gloss over bashing.
