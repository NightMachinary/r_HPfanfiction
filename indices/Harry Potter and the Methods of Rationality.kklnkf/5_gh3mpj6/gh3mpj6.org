I tried to enjoy it and gave up a little way in, while Harry tried to prove some point that broke magic's laws - and confused the reader - and for what reason?

As a story, I don't think it works. The writing isn't high quality, the plot is poorly paced (it's extremely bloated) and the characterisations are flat/weak - it didn't make me feel much of anything. The characters - Harry especially - spend so much time trying to be right that they appear to have the emotional depth of a teaspoon.

To me, it was on far with those action fics that just seem to loop and loop similar-but-different examples just to flaunt the fact they have.

That said, some people like those sorts of things. They don't want emotions clogging a story.
