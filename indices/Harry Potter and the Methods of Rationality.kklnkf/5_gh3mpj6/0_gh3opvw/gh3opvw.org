As far as I can tell, it's meant to make you think, more than make you feel. There are a lot of discussions that I found interesting, about the nature of good and evil, what it means to be a hero, being able to set aside ego to achieve your goals, and a variety of other topics. But I didn't connect to the characters as much as some other stories. For me, it was worth reading.
