It was the first HP fanfic I read, so I personally liked it.

That being said later half of the story had a lot of philosophical talk, that seems totally out of place, considering our protag is an 11 year old boy. People can understand harry being smart but in this he's like this generation Socrates.

The fic also had /interesting/ characterization for characters like Draco and Snape, this is sub has an aversion to that. Plus there's the weird non-relationship between Harry/Hermione. I can see 11-12 year olds having crushes and imagining their life together, but the relationship seemed almost like one between young adults.
