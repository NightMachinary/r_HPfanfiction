I wrote something as a sort of response to the whole idea of MoR: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27034639/chapters/66000553]]

Essentially, if you took the actions of the characters of MoR and had characters like, say, Rick and Morty be the ones doing them... well, if at the actions of a supposed "rational" character could be plausibly done by Rick or Morty then how rational is that character, really?

And that really doesn't matter for a fun fanfiction, but if a fanfiction claims that it can teach you how to be rational, then the rationality of the characters themselves does matter.
