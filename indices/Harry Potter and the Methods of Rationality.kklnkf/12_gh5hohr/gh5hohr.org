I think that people hate it because they find it insulting. It shows a world which pretends to be the Potter world, but is completely different. It has characters who we are told have flaws, and told that they realize their flaws, and then... nothing. It's an exercise in I'm better than Rowling written by someone so fundamentally stupid that the very concept of rationality being included in their title offends on a personal level. Characters are what I read fan fiction for, so when I see something like this, I want to read it, but MOR doesn't care about characters, all it cares about is trying to show they can make a better world than Rowling by creating a self contradictory system of rules that make its MC look stupid. Recommendation for something similar, Rorschach's Blot wrote two versions of a story called Better Living Through Chemistry. It's in his Odd Ideas fanfic
