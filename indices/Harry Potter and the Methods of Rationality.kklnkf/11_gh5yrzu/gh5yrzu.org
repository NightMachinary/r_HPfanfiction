For me, HPMOR devolves from a Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay humour fic with that kind of energy... but based on the reasoning that Harry is a Rationalist and That's Okay... into a more Lord Potter Black Peverell, Ruler of the Known Universe style fic. It's also got this very strange "immortality is desirable" thing set in a nominally Harry Potter world which, famously, has the opposite message.

That being said, I really like the chapters about the replacement quidditch thing and I wish someone knew what they are because I honestly wouldn't mind re-reading them... but only them.
