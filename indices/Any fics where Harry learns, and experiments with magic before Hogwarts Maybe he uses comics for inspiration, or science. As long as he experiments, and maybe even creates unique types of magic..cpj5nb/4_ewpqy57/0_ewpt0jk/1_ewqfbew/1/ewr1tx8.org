Not really. It's more a case of Dumbledore ignoring. Harry doesn't really care about any of the things he's supposed to, and so doesn't devote any real focus to Dumbledore's plots. Arguably it implicitly bashes Dumbledore as he bumbles along believing that Harry is a good little pawn and everything is well while actually Harry's a drug dealing, thieving little shit with a weird form of magic nobody else uses. But it's never the focus.

Essentially, Harry's a jaded, cynical, prematurely aged asshole who is constantly playing a chaotic neutral or chaotic good character, and part of that involves unnecessary swearing and the like. It sounds cringier from that description and quote than it really is.
