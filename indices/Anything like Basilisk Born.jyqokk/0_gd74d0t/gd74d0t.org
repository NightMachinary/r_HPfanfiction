The only other two ancient Harry fics I know are Voldemort's Last Spell and The Wizard from Earth. A Long Journey Home really is the best example of Ancient-Harry-Wandering-Through-History there is, I'm afraid. (I've also linked it - I know you've read it already, but I figured other people reading this post might not've).

The latter is purely around the south-eastern Mediterranean and features mostly Egyptian stuff. Interesting fic though.

The former starts off interesting and then rapidly devolves in the last few chapters into a standard Avengers cross-over with no warning whatsoever. Not my thing at all, but maybe you'll enjoy it.
