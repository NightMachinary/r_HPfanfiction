God, I've got to get off Reddit. I'm so tired, right now. Procrastination!

Not really? I'm pretty widespread in my tropes - although the only thing I can ever read is drarry, anything else I can't stand.\\
I prefer not to read sex, but contradictory I find it difficult to read T-rated fics since I, prejudicially I admit, believe that the writing is going to be less mature.\\
As for tropes, anything angst - except mpreg or MCD - is pretty much my jam. Marriage contracts and magic/world-building...politics, too.\\
There's a lot of stuff I enjoy.
