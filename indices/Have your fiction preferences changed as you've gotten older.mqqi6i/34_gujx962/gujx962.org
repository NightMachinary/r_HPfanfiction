When I was younger I loved hero stories, good overcomes evil, good guy falls in love. Now... Jesus Christ, I am a gluten for dark and fucked up stories. The kind of things that when I finish a chapter I needa go take a shower. And my god the smut, I can't look at normal fics the same anymore. If I was to be judged at the gates of heaven with my fic history my ass would be punted sooo hard the devil himself would be holding up score cards.
