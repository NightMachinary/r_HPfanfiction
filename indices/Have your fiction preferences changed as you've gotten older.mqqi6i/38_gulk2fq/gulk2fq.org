I think my tolerance for poor writing has decreased - but otherwise, the major thing I've noticed is that I'm more sensitive/alert to certain jokes/throwaway comments/problematic inclusions, which I'm going to blame to being on the internet over the past few years :P

But in terms of what sort of fics that catch my eye, that's been relatively unchanged. I suppose I'm more open towards the less action-y ones than I was a long while back, but... On the whole? If it's well written, I've always been likely to enjoy it!
