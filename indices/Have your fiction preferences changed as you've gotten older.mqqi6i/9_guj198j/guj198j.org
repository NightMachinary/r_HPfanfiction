For me, I've found that I've kind of become a writing quality snob to some extent. I paused my fanfiction reading for a good 4-5 years post university and exclusively read published books again, and usually the ones that got Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy Awards or nominations, at the very least.

So when I came back to fanfiction years later, I suddenly didn't have the patience for very badly written prose. Like I will happily gloss over the occasional spelling or grammar error (up to 1-2 per chapter), but really *bad* writing is something I simply can't read anymore.

Also because I've read so many fics in the indy!Harry and OP!Harry subgenres as a teenager, they've become unbearable to me.

I don't mind fanfiction that is geared towards a specific ship, but, from what I've read or been recommended in the ship side of HP fanfiction stories, the romance is usually god awfully written or maybe I just don't have the patience for it *shrug*

I also read a LOT more humour fanfiction these days, but that maybe because of the general doom and gloom of the past year and the half and the state of the world in general.
