Let's first of all agree that our standards are higher. I think that'll hold relatively well across the board.

I found that as I got older and revisited HPFF since leaving 10 years ago, several changes occurred:

1) My sense of humour got drier; situational comedy was not as amusing, nor was twin speak and pranking

2) I got out of my teens and stopped thinking "oh my god it's a SEX SCENE" whether for comedy, drama or smut purposes

3) I had more appreciation for longer, well-written mysteries

4) I empathised lots more with post-DH/Epilogue Trio-deals-with-raising-kids type stories, and the conflicts found in those stories

And not least

5) I had less patience for AU fics. Because canon is hard enough to deal with as is.

P.s. /My Immortal/ is still the funniest shit I ever read though
