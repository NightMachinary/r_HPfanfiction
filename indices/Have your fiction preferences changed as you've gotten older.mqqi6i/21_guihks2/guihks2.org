Absolutely, I started reading fanfic, at about age 12-13? My first fic was a Drarry, that iirc had forced exhibitionism in front of Slughorn, I later read a Snarry that gripped me hard, and Snarry is ONE of my otp's, I also have a few ot3's with mainly Harry as a base, and later I got into NCIS, and the slash-tastic Tibbs pairing, so Tony and Harry are basically my basic slashy foundation, ofc, I also like/love some Harry/girl fics or even girl!Harry fics. I have a very diverse fic collection.
