I've gotten to be this way, too. I can no longer read stories where romance and/or the characters' romantic relationships are the central plot. I also find them boring now, to the point where I start scan reading through stories that focus too heavily on sex/romance/dating until - if ever - the story gets back to the action. I have dropped so many fics because of this and started to read a lot more gen stories.
