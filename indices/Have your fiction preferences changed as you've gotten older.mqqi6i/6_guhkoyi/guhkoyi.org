I used to read a fair amount of shipping fic, but now I really prefer gen and avoid smut if at all possible. If it's a plot centric fic with sex scenes, I skip the sex scenes. I'm not a prude, I just find sex boring and I want them to get back to the plot. I am also now really into female Harry, where I used to avoid it. I even started writing my own female Harry series and that never would have happened ten years ago. I'm also now more into Slytherins and Snape.

Some things that have stayed the same: I love time travel, hurt/comfort, plot focused, characters with a mission/plan/con. I generally prefer the magic to stay similar to canon, but having some additions or explanations isn't a bad thing.
