I don't mind those myself, if they're not entirely the focus. Not sure if that made sense - but romance playing a big role is fine by me, smut is a bit iffier (it's not easy to write well and integrate into a good plot), but if either becomes the whole focus of the thing I'm going to lose interest. Eg, I was reading an interesting Draco timetravel one a month or so back, that was pretty well done - and then it (in an entirely understandable/foreseeable way from the plot/characterization) became heavily/almost entirely about Draco and Harry being horny for each other. Which makes sense for 5th year - but, um, it made the chapters drag on for me when they seemed to all be about that.
