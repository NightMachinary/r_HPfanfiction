Definitely higher standards for quality of writing, but as I get older (started reading at 9 and am almost 20), I'm unable to read most Hogwarts era fics, and prefer adult Drarry and Wolfstar. If a fic doesn't appropriately address Draco's prejudice, I'm usually not able to read, and as a result find myself reading a lot of "down-and-out Draco" fics just because I want him to get what he deserves before getting to the romance. I'm much more willing now to try different pairings than I used to be as well!!
