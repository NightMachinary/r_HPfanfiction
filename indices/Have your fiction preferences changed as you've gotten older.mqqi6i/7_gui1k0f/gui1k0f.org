I am an old-timer...I have changed my reading habits quite a bit, but I'd say my preferences have expanded more than shifted.

I've become more open-minded as I've aged and that's including what I read. There's some stuff I'm still not interested in, but there are almost always exceptions. The first fanfic writer I ever read is still publishing, too, so there's that.

Just happy to see an ever-growing variety of fics and authors in the community.
