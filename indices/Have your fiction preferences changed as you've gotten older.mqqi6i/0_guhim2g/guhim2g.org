It changed a bit. I used to really love angst and dark fics. I used to be able to read 100k words of misery for misery's sake. Now, I can't stand them anymore. I need to be assured of a happy ending before I start an angst fic, and the angst has to be purposeful otherwise I'll drop the fic.

Other than that, I now lean more towards romance and character studies. I like fics that really dive deep into the head of a character and how they play off each other.

Because of this, I don't read Harmione fics as much as I used to. I am very attached to their characters and dynamics in the books, but with both Harry and Hermione being popular self-insert characters, it's so rare to find stories that remain faithful to the canon characterization and dynamics.
