Personally, I've found as I've gotten older and just experienced more...life, I don't need to be reminded of how dark and depressing everything is and can be: I've seen and experienced enough that I don't need my fiction to also be miserable. Even pre-covid I started gravitating towards escapism in my media, and just don't want to use my free time to be experience more angst - plenty enough of that to go around.
