What you say makes sense intuitively but I don't fully trust my instincts. I believe that stories are how we humans gird ourselves to face the traumas of life. When we were younger perhaps we were more willing to face these stories because we were bolder, more willing to compete, to maybe suffer loss, in pursuit of our goals. I'm wondering if, as we've aged, we've found our place, fought our wars so to speak, and thus become too comfortable and unwilling to face the unpleasantnesses that we used to. And I'm wondering if that reflects a loss of competitive spirit.

I'm thinking about myself mostly of course. But also wondering if I'm alone in thinking in these terms.
