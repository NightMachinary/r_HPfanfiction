I wouldn't call it a lessening of character, at least not personally - I just didn't have the same frame of reference then, and filled in emotional and experiential gaps with the media I consumed. Now I have lived experiences to inform how certain types of trauma feel (like death, illness, and pain), and don't feel compelled to willingly revisit those feelings or pick at emotional scabs in my leisure time, if that makes sense. Your mileage may vary - I can only speak for myself!
