I started reading fanfiction in October on watt pad reading snamione - this is my past and it should be a crime that I even went there

Yh now I have pure hatred for wattpad and that ship and use AO3 and FanFiction.net for all my fics and no longer have Snape/ characters anymore unless story line is good but I went on a real rollercoaster and now am happy reading almost anything especially muggle au's or other characters raising Harry :)
