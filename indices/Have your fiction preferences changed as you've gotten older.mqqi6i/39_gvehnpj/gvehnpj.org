I used to love reading fics with 200k words and up and actually reading them all. Absorbing the stuff the author wrote for the worldbuilding, the type of governance and the like, the way how a school system works, spells, all the detailed stuff.

Now I prefer reading fics with less 100k words and even I still skim paragraphs most of the time just so I could get on with the main plot.

I also used to love reading long and detailed battle scenes. Now I just skip it to the part where one gets injured or dies and the other remains standing and alive.
