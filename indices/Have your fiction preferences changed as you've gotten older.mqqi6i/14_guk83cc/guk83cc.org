I used to go in for fluffy Hogwarts romances, with no preferred pairing (some pairings I tried were Sirius/OC, Rose/Scorpius, James/Lily - essentially all OCs, haha). Now I go in for more adult romances, with Hermione/ non OC characters. Not necessarily more explicit, just more mature. My guess is that whatever is more relatable works better as a kind of escapism... When I was in high school, fluff is what entertained me, and now that I'm almost 30, I prefer to read about adults.
