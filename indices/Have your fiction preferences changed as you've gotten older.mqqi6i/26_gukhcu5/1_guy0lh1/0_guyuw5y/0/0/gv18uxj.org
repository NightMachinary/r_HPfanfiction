I don't believe my opinion is right. It */is/* right. The vast majority of the fandom for the series think Harry should have married Hermione. If this was a democracy the Harmonians would have it, and I'm not even one of them. The reason they 'have' it is because they recognize that love is built up over time, and not something crammed down your throat in the span of a few months. As such, the closest thing to real love that exists in canon is Harry/Hermione, with Harry/Luna as a distant second. Ginny isn't even really in the running.

You call it an 'opinion' because */you personally don't like it./* Feel free to prove it wrong. I've told no lie. Ginny all but disappeared for four years, she only became relevant near the very end of the series. The lion's share of her character development happened /off-screen,/ where Harry certainly couldn't have seen it. Where's the character development? Where's the slow and gradual buildup over time? It's nowhere. You can cite nothing.

Save your dissertation, I've see somebody go on for 100k words on why Snape and Hermione should be having sex in a closet. Any idiot can talk about anything for hours if they have half the wit to string sentences together.

Harry and Ginny didn't have real love, and neither did Ron and Hermione. Real love is built up over time. Rowling pushed them together because she had an agenda, and she's even admitted it. Rowling has admitted across several interviews that she pushed Ron and Hermione together because she viewed Hermione as herself and thought of Ron as a sort of proxy for her own real-life husband. She also admitted that Harry and Ginny got together solely as a consequence of that. Which is another way of saying Ginny was just the spare loose end that could be tied to Harry for convenience.

  "[[http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/02/showbiz/rowling-hermione-ron-revelation/index.html][I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment]]. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."

Furthermore, the actors who played the parts in the movies all agree. Watson felt that Hermione's relationship with Ron was "dangerous and unstable," and that it wouldn't last. Rupert Grint agreed, saying that he's "pretty sure Ron would have divorced her already and moved on."

You can't talk about Harry and Ginny without talking about Ron and Hermione, because the only reason Harry/Ginny existed in canon was because she was the convenient loose end that was lying around after Rowling de-facto decided Ron and Hermione absolutely had to end up with each other.

Rowling has admitted in other interviews that if she could redo the series, Harry would end up with Hermione. Ginny would just be a friend, no different from Neville or Luna.

So spare me the essays on how you and a few other people are absolutely convinced they're soul mates. I wanted Harry to end up with Luna, but I got over it. You need to get over it, too.
