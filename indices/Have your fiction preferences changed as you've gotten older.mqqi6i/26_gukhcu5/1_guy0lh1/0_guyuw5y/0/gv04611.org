Again read this [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/features/essays/issue2/whyharrypickedginny/]]

You're so aggressive in believing your opinion is right when not everyone thinks that way. But if you read that then it's clear that Ginny does have a personality and it's clear why Harry likes her.

And Ginny never dated other people to make Harry jealous, she dated other people because Harry wasn't interested in her and she wanted to get over him? And then in sixth year he did start to like her but it's not like she could read his mind and know that so she kept dating her boyfriend?
