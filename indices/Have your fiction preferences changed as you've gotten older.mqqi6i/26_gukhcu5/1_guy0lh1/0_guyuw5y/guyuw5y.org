No, I'm not doing a disservice to Ginny. I'm being brutally honest about the reality of the situation, which is that she's an ascended fangirl. The person who did her a disservice was Rowling. She was introduced in book 2, and nothing interesting was done with her, ever. She got zero development. Then near the very end, suddenly Rowling starts aggressively pushing her to the forefront of the story, making her character seem off-putting with how forward it was and how unnatural her being thrust into the limelight felt. Harry has no reason to even like Ginny, let alone "love" her. The monster-in-the-chest scene is widely panned as being utterly ridiculous, and */rightly so./*

Ginny went from being a childish fangirl, to behaving like a jealous ex even though they had never been together in the first place (dragging other boys into closets and dating to try and make Harry jealous), to suddenly monster-in-chest and now they're a couple.

That's not love. That's not even sexual arousal. It's a joke. It's no wonder literally thousands of fans put a pin on that exact moment to say "and that's where she obviously love potioned him." Because that's /exactly/ what it looks like.

I know what good Ginny looks like. I've read good Ginny. I've */written/* good Ginny. Good Ginny does not exist in canon, and if you think she does, you've obviously not reread the books recently. Severitus is a great idea that makes Snape a much more interesting and compelling character, and I enjoy reading those stories, but it's not fucking canon. It's an OC wearing Snape's face. Snape isn't Severitus and never was, or could have been. He proved that solely through his behavior towards Neville. He was a shallow and unrepentant bastard that abused children to gratify his own ego, and Rowling inexplicably expected us to forgive after forcing him to make doe eyes at us. Good Ginny is not any fundamentally different from Severitus. Lots of writers can do Ginny justice, but Rowling is not one of them, and she's the only one that counts.

I'm not doing a disservice to anybody. I'm being honest. Your bone to pick is with Rowling, not me. Actual love and romance is built up over time with mutual bonds and trust, it's not a monster in your chest telling you to start frenching a girl you've never cared about until now. That's why so many people argue that Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna makes more sense. It's because it /does/.

If Rowling really wanted Ginny to be with Harry that badly, then she wasted 90% of the series. Look at all this space for build up where fuck-all was done. Luna got more emotional rapport with Harry in a few chapters of book 5 than Ginny got with him in six books.
