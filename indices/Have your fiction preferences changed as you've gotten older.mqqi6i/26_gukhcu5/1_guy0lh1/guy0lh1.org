You do a disservice to Ginny. I agree people don't always write her well but she has a personality she doesn't just exist as a fan girl...

Also we basically know nothing about Bill we hardly get to know him. We know he's handsome and a curse breaker and popular. Why wouldn't someone like Fleur who is also really attractive, also a powerful knowledgeable wizard, also really popular not get with Bill? Again with what we know about Bill's personality there's nothing there that wouldn't work with Fleur. We just don't really know Bill or Charlie. As for why they got married so fast it's uh because there's a war, Bill is in the order and could die at any time so when they fall in love they want to get married ASAP. This is actually quite common IRL when there's a war going on people get married a lot quicker than they otherwise would.

Also I think Remus is only like a bit over 10 years older than Tonks. It's not that unheard of for this to happen. Remus is depressed but that doesn't mean he isn't loveable? Remus is also extremely smart, kind, and has a sense of humor. And again it's war time everyone is rushing to get married.
