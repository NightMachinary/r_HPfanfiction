Indy!Harry got old real fucking quick. I'm honestly not convinced I ever really liked it, it's just that there was a broad stretch of time where the only fics of any quality and length being written were independent Harry sticking it to the man. I feel as though I didn't really mind it at first, but over time I've grown to hate it. I greatly prefer stories where the various "good guys" work together and sometimes at cross-purposes to try and solve greater mysteries or big problems, but those are rare. Good luck trying to find a story where Dumbledore means well, Harry doesn't act like an indy cunt, the bad guys are intelligent, and nobody gets bashed or flanderized.

I am the Fanfiction Lorax, I speak for the OCs; use moldyshorts, old goat, pup, or flaming chicken again, and I'll break both your knees.

I also didn't really care about pairings at all, but now the only stuff that seems even remotely realistic is Harry and Hermione, or in some instances Gabrielle, Katie Bell, Angelia, Tonks, and the few other women he had regular contact with and something resembling an actual friendship. Unless you're running an AU where Harry meets different on the train and has totally different friends or something, it just doesn't feel very convincing anymore. I didn't use to mind Harry Ginny, but I've read so much of it now that I've started to feel like it doesn't work because Ginny is basically an OC. Rowling gave her zero personality besides being an ascended fangirl, so while there are good Ginny fics out there, they're also not really Ginny, any more than a Severitus fic has any-fucking-thing to do with canon Severus Snape. It's a different character entirely, and I feel like you can only go so far with that before it's time to just throw in the towel and give it a rest.

I can't really stand anything that makes use of book 7's sequence of events anymore. Even slightly. Remus hooking up with Tonks has only gotten weirder and more inexplicable as time has gone on. I can't really imagine Ron with anyone besides someone like Lavender. Pairing Bill and Fleur up along with Tonks and Remus feels extremely random, and gives a sort of impression that Rowling was just pulling names out of a hat or something. "I need a marriage for the plot because I need a crashed marriage dramatic battle, but I haven't developed anybody enough to sell that yet, time to write the names of all the tertiary characters down and do some blind draws." Never mind the weirdness of Tonks marrying a man over twice her age whose canon personality is bland and depressing: if Fleur could get over all the problems she seems to have dealing with people and fall in love with Bill after having barely known him for a year, then by all rights Harry should be going on dates with some girl from Smeltings or something. Which honestly would be a pretty funny AU to explore: Harry/OC, Harry has and struggles to maintain a relationship with some totally normal girl that is his sole childhood friend: he tries to keep the worlds separate but can't, and she inevitably gets dragged into it.

As an extension of that, I can't really stomach those kinds of AUs that tell a new story or a new sequence of events, but then just default to the way Rowling did it for everything that is actually important. Sirius gets exonerated and Harry learns how to turn into a magical panther or something while carrying dual enchanted glocks with him, but the graveyard scene still goes exactly the same way it always does and nothing actually new or interesting happens: MASSIVE AU, but Harry/Ginny Ron/Hermione Remus/Tonks Arthur/Molly DH Compliant Albus and Scorpius get on the train in the end. What was even the point, then?

I used to read everything and not really care. But some things become much more obnoxious over time. AUs that don't really diverge on anything important. Defaulting to Rowling's own pairings which don't make any sense at all because you want romance involved but aren't creative enough to deviate in any real way. Stuff that turns Dumbledore into a dark lord or Molly Weasley into a potions rapist. Funnily enough, you never seen Snape using Amorentia on anybody to push students together or ship pairings for his own amusement: another funny or dark idea that you won't ever see. Molly being evil and manipulative was edgy and novel at some point, but that boat sailed years ago.

Seriously though, if you care about romance at all, at least don't copy canon, because it doesn't make sense. Logically Tonks would hook up with someone like Bill, and even though I'm not a Harmonian, that was obviously the correct canon pairing, it makes the most sense and it certainly feels the most thematically correct and "vanilla." Rowling has literally admitted that Hermione was her self-insert and that she modeled Ron after her own husband and the relationship she has with him. She's also admitted that she regrets not pairing Harry and Hermione, but that she can't really change it now. So let's all just admit that she has a dysfunctional marriage that she couldn't help but project onto the books and move on.

I think most of all, though, I really just want complete stories with happy endings. It's surprising how rare those seem to be. Harry was a huge downer in canon even though he lead one of the most heroic and chad lives it's possible to live: a happy ending or a more happy and confidant Harry are the things that interest me these days.

And he should really use the sword of Gryffindor more. I know how I was when I was fourteen, I would have walked around with it everywhere if I could have gotten away with it. Seriously.
