Bloody hell, I can understand you have trouble understanding what I'm saying, but you shouldn't have trouble understanding what you're saying.

I replied to your talking about something being "logical". I quoted that, so it should have been clear. I also stated "to each his own" right after that, so it should have been clear I have nothing against your preference.

Then you wrote *"To just want similar people to be paired" isn't "reductive," it's real.* So yes, you are talking about it being real, even if you're right that I brought that up first.

And no, I have not implied that the relationship is good because it's realistic. That's just your hate. Real funny you should mention me feeding you words and then arguing about it. I'd say it's an excellent example of accusing me of something you're actually doing, but then there's an even better one. You, complaining about paragraphs. Wow. I have to applaud your bravado for that.

Anyway, I think we at least agree that there's no sense in continuing this. I'm really just writing this in the small hope you'll think about what nonsense you're spouting. Cheers.
