And I'll try and ignore how you've lost the plot of the entire thread, which was a question asking have your fiction preferences changed as you've gotten older, and if so, how?

I've been at a loss on what to say about your complaints on my preferences from the beginning. You're just whining. Yes, I prefer to not see characters engage in obviously self-destructive and doomed behavior, because I've seen quite enough of it. Which is what quite a few of the pairings in Harry Potter are: Hermione and Ron are doomed for divorce in any sane universe that isn't authorial wish fulfillment, and Remus and Tonks would have been doomed to a loud and violent separation if they had both lived.

And yes, their relationship IS inexplicable, which is what */my words/* were, emphasis because you seem to be feeding me your words and then arguing about it. It is inexplicable because they were surrounded by meddlers and well-wishers who should have stopped them from making the obvious mistake they did when they conceived Teddy. With how much Molly Weasley tried to run Sirius' own house and affairs for him, and with how much she complained and ran the ear off of everybody about what was proper and correct behavior for young adults and adults, I find it completely unbelievable that Remus wouldn't catch a tea kettle to the face for having a roll with Tonks, a woman half his age, when Molly nearly has an aneurism every time Tonks, Ginny, or Hermione walk around in "improper" clothes. It is completely unbelievable and very inexplicable, that nobody in the Order cared, that Molly Weasley didn't care, and that neither of Tonk's parents cared. For that matter, it's inexplicable that /Remus/ didn't care, or at least didn't care enough to turn her down flat and push her away. It goes against everything that was established about his character. I am talking, and have always been talking, about characters behaving in-character or out-of-character. */You're/* the one who brought up what was "normal," what was "real." Not me. That's */your/* talking point, not mine.

If you don't want to talk about "realism," then don't bring it up, or waste my time by forgetting that you're the one who brought it up in the first place. You're the one who brought up what was "real," what was "normal." You're the one who called my opinions "reductive" and "boring" and then started going on about normalcy and realism.

From the very beginning, you don't even have a point. You don't know what you're arguing for. You whine about my preferences and opinions and call them banal and boring, you claim that I'm reducing characters because you misunderstand what a "summary" is (that post is quite long and talks about many things, not just one thing, sorry I didn't write a doctoral thesis on the one specific thing you decided to nitpick about). You start us on this track of realism and then abort and suddenly want to know why we're talking about realism, like I care about it at all, like we aren't talking about a relationship between a shape shifter and a werewolf, like you aren't the one who brought this up in the first place. And you're still ignoring the original point, which I've never stopped talking about, because apparently you don't care or just don't want to see it. That point being, yes, I have a preference, it's for people to have happy relationships with people who are good for them, and for people to behave in-character.

You've done nothing but obliquely imply that Remus and Tonks is a "good" relationship because it is "realistic" without ever expounding any further than that. Nothing could possibly be further from anything I said: I called it weird and inexplicable, which it is. It is a choice that doesn't make sense, it doesn't match facts and characterizations that were previously established, people around them did not react in a manner befitting what we know of them either, and no explanation for any of that was ever given. Fleur and Bill was also drawn out of a hat, but at least Fleur got a character arc out of it.

Their relationship is an out-of-character event. Remus was the responsible one and never would have allowed it to happen, he was so straight laced he wouldn't even share any information with Harry on what the Order was or what Voldemort was doing, which Sirius vocally disapproved of. Molly didn't give a shit, which I find improbable in the extreme. Tonk's parents are ghosts that don't exist and didn't care, even though they were so intimately involved in the Order that Harry was taken TO Ted Tonks when he was injured during the beginning escape sequence in book 7, with both Ted and Andromeda being trusted and involved enough to be caretakers for Order safehouses. Tonks doesn't have any kind of understanding or pull with Remus to get him to open up, especially not after Sirius died. If Remus couldn't give Harry the time of day because he was too busy rolling around in his own sadness and sense of extreme responsibility, there's no reason for anybody to believe Tonks could succeed well enough to be impregnated.

Rowling pulled their names out of a hat to create that relationship. I don't give a rat's ass how realistic you think that is in hindsight. I'm not talking about whatever you refer to when you call something "realistic." When I use that word, in the context of a work of fiction, I'm referring to the fiction making sense within it's own established setting, which is realism as defined by the standards of literary criticism. When you use the word, you're talking about real life. Using your definition, fiction is not realistic, and never has been. It is incredibly structured and engineered, it is full of utterly improbable coincidences, it follows its own previously established rules, it proceeds in a sequential order of events that by definition must make sense, and it nearly always features some sort of aesop or political message. Nothing could be further from the true kind of realism you seem to be obsessing over than a work of fiction. There is nothing spontaneous about a detective novel or The Lord of The Rings. If anything, the detective novel, which is what Rowling obviously based the structure of the series on, is the most aggressively curated and least spontaneous of all storytelling formats.

At this point, I don't really expect you to see or address the original point. Obviously you've completely missed it, and there really isn't any further point talking to you about something you aren't paying attention to and have no interest in. I reread my entire original post twice just to double check, and I only ever used the word "realistic" once, in reference to Harry having relationships with girls he spends large amounts of time with at school, like Hermione or the Gryffindor Chasers. No, I'm not arguing for "real" and never was. I don't care about realism. Thanks for finally catching up, I'm glad we needed twenty paragraphs to establish that you're arguing about a complete non sequitur.

If I wanted to watch adult children wallow in the consequences of ruining their lives, I could just go for a walk. Most people read fiction and fantasy for the escapism. Shocking, I know.
