I'll try to ignore how you reduced all the characters to one or two basic traits, all while talking about appearing opposite on the surface, because I'm at a loss as to what to even say to that.

But “real“? You're not even arguing for real, you're arguing for what you think is best. What the hell is realistic about that? Are all the people around you in the best possible relationships with the best possible person for them?
