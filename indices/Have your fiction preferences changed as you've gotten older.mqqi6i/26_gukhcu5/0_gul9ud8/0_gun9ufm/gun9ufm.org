  What logic is that?
#+end_quote

Because they're the same age, because they have similar interests, because they would actually have a future together. Because Tonks Bill would still exist in thirty years, while Tonks Remus absolutely would not.

"To just want similar people to be paired" isn't "reductive," it's real. It's more realistic than Rowling's drawn-from-a-hat pairings. Opposites don't attract, people who complete each other attract. They may appear opposite on the surface, but in reality they are not. It is their similarities that give them a foundation to build love on, love is built, it's not something you fall into. That's lust.

Remus and Tonks didn't have a relationship, they fucked and then he died and left her pregnant. Then she died too, and Harry was left holding a baby. Nothing about Remus helped or completed Tonks, and nothing about Tonks was good for Remus either. Remus didn't understand any of the struggles and issues she had with her life as a metamorph, and her abilities as a metamorph wouldn't have helped her understand or emphasize with a guilt-ridden man whose friends are all dead and who believes he is a monster undeserving of love. The two of them together is red flags all over the place. Their experiences did not equip either of them to build any kind of foundation between them that love could have grown on. The two of them could not help each other, or heal each other, even in a one-sided way of one helping the other. Them having sex was the high point of their relationship, that's as far as it could ever go. Remus and Tonks is just the story of a young woman fucking a much older man because it seems exciting, and then getting pregnant without planning to. It happens all the time. Guess how many of those relationships end happily ever after? If the war hadn't killed them, they would have eventually broken apart, and Teddy's existence would have merely accelerated that. Babies don't stabilize bad relationships, they hasten their end.

The irony is, you're right. Tonks being a stupid cunt who had a one-night stand with someone exciting that's twice their age and then forgot to put a condom on or use contraceptive IS realistic. That happens all the time in real life, and it ALWAYS ends badly. The bad joke is that you're using the fact that it's realistic to suggest that it is a viable relationship, and not a doomed fling with a baby nobody wanted thrown into the middle of the whirlwind for extra drama.

Remus Tonks wouldn't have lasted five years after the war ended, if both of them had survived. That's also real. That's realistic. Their mutual deaths saved their relationship. It was preserved forever mid-whirlwind. The self-destructive explosion at the end never got to happen.
