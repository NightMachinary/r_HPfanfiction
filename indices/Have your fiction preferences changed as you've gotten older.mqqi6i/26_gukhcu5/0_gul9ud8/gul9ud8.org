  Logically Tonks would hook up with someone like Bill

What logic is that?

Not to rain on your parade, to each his own, but one of the main reasons I like this universe so much is the nuanced characters, who feel like real people.\\
It's normal for someone to like someone because he's kind, even if he's also depressing and bland. It's even /usual/ for someone subdued from hardships to gravitate towards someone full of life, even if maybe a calm support would do them better. People who have trouble dealing with other people quite likely /will/ latch onto the first person they meet they don't have that problem with. And so on.

To just want similar people to be paired seems sadly reductive to me.
