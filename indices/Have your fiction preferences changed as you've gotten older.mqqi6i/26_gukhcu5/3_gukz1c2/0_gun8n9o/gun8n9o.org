Objectively wrong.

"[[http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/02/showbiz/rowling-hermione-ron-revelation/index.html][I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment]]. That's how it was conceived, really," the Harry Potter author said in the interview with Hermione Granger actress Emma Watson for /Wonderland/ in 2014. "For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron." What's more, Rowling went on to actually admit that Harry and Hermione should have been endgame.

Additionally, all THREE of the actors who played the parts in the movies felt that Ron and Hermione's relationship was doomed, and that Harry/Hermione made more sense after everything was taken into account. Watson doesn't think Ron could have ever truly made Hermione happy. Grint says that the marriage would have imploded and that Ron would have divorced Hermione by now.

I'm not a Harmonian. I don't really care. If I could have gotten any pairing I personally wanted, it would have been Harry Luna, because I feel like it would have been therapeutic for Harry and that they were the best match for the other, emotionally and in attitude. They would have healed each other. But Rowling HAS admitted that she regrets not pairing Harry and Hermione, she HAS admitted that their relationship was projection and wish fulfillment on her part, and she HAS admitted that Hermione makes far more sense with Harry. She has gone so far as to imply that if she could do the series over, she would pair them together. Though that was merely an implication, not a confirmation.

Harry Hermione makes the most sense as the core relationship of the entire series, and both the author and all the actors in the movies have admitted it. I don't understand you people who still cling to denial.
