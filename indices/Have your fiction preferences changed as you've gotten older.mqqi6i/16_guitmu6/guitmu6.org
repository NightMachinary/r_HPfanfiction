Apart from the obvious higher standard in writing style (because now I actually know how to find the good stuff), I find myself gravitating towards older characters. I've been reading a lot of post-Hogwarts stuff in the last few years, because I've kind of moved on from the original series but am still in love with the world. There are only so many canon retellings you can read, so I prefer stuff that broadens the wizarding world. My favourites now are fics with adult Harry&friends or people we meet as adults (Remus, McGonagall, Sprout). Pairings don't matter as much to me anymore. I used to read slash almost exclusively because fanfiction was my main way of finding some sort of representation, but now I will read straight pairings too if I like the premise of the story.
