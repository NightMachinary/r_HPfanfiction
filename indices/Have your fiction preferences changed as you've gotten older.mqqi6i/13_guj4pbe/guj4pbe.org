Realism is a huge factor to me now. Like, although I love Harry/Multi fics, I can't stand it when they all just get along swimmingly or Harry is somehow okay with marrying so many girls at such a young age. I also can't stand 16/17 year olds talking perfectly, without stuttering. I get that it's kind of weird, but I have a stutter/various other speech problems myself, so I really enjoy it when I can read a character freaking out without making them seem like they're straight out of a Jane Austen book or something like that.
