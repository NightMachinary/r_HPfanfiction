I started to avoid romance more and more, because I simply find the romances in majority of fanfics way too unrealistic (Example: falling in love waay too fast, just being eternally happy with no arguments or difficulties) or borderline toxic (the age old 'GIRL FINDS A BAD BOY AND TRIES TO MAKE HIM SEE THE LIGHT (dramione is especially guilty of this). )

It is exceptionally rare I see any good romance in fanfiction, and when smut also begins to enter the fanfic, I am out and will not look back.
