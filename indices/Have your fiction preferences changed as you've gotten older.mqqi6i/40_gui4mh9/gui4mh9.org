I started with Dramione, then moved over to Drarry. For a long time I stuck with that but started liking more neutral/slightly dark Harry. At the same time I hated, literally despited, the idea of Harry&Tom/Voldemort ship (same for any ship with Snape but that one still prevails).

After that I grew up from Wattpad mania and moved over to FanFiction.Net and AO3. Now, I'm unable to read fanfictions where main ship isn't Harry&Tom/Voldemort. Either I read something with that ship or a story that doesn't have a ship for Harry at all. Also, I only read things with Harry as the main character and still like the idea of neutral/dark (also evil if it's nicely written) Harry.

It's the one true ship for me and that will probably never change again xD
