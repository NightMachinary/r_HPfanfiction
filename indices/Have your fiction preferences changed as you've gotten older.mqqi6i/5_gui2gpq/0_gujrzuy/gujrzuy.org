Oh my gosh! Same!!! I started like this until I found communities on fanfiction.net, then found my favorite one.

Looking back, I understand why I liked those fanfics though, they had exactly what I had wanted, and even if they weren't the best- I had fun.

I'll still read then if they're the only ones I can find, but I'm definitely more pickier than I used to be on the grammar.
