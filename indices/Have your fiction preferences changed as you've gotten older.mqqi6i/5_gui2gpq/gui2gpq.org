Oh yeah, I used to look up what i wanted on google (Ex: "Harry does X fanfiction") so I would read some pretty crappy quality fanfiction but I loved it. I don't remember how I found this sub, but once i did I found some actual good quality stuff, and going back to read some of the first suff I ever read for nostalgia... it's not great. But yeah, I can't read a fic unless its actually good quality now compared to when I started.
