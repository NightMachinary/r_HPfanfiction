Yep.

I have little patience for the good girl/angsty brooding bad boy trope. ESP when it involves her trying to “fix him”.

I really like fics that have the characters post-school. And more new adult themes. I'll still read younger but I really prefer the new adult stuff.

I never read non magic AUs but now I'm into them for the marauders era.

I have high standards on smut. No tolerance for sex god BDSM master 16 yr old boy.

I'm much more aware of toxic and unhealthy romance themes. I can't explain but it's harder for me to get into things where (if it's a straight couple) the girl and guy don't seem on equal footing. Like both of them are toxic? Ok...but the guy toxic and the girl just bends over backwards doing emotional labor? No. Also the “I hate everyone but u” trope on guys....and the thing where the guy is very very overprotective of the girl like she's made of glass. Just no. I mean I like a dark morally grey fic sure but I feel like these kinds of themes are overly romanticized within the story.
