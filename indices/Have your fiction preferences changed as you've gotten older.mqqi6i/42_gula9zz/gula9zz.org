It's kind of funny how there are two main camps here - the ones who used to read stupid things and now realise and can't stomach it anymore, instead looking for quality, and the ones who used to read quality stuff and now can't be bothered to add to the pressure of real life, instead seeking out the stupid and the simple.

I'm in the second camp. (Though there /is/ still some level of simple which won't do.)
