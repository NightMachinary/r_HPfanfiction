I have got suuuuuppppper into Wolfstar since I first got in to fanfiction. I stumbled upon The Shoebox Project back when it was still being updated on livejournal and it made them my OTP. Now I read marauders era Sirius/Remus almost exclusively though I have recently started branching out to non-Magic AU's of the same pairing. I never thought I'd like them, but then I gave Text Talk and chance and it was cute as hell so I read Sweater Weather (twice in a row...) and now I really like them ðŸ˜‚
