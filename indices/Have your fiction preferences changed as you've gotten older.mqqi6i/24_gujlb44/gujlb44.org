I used to really like reading about OP characters. It's a bit embarrassing. I just can't read junk like that anymore. Now my favorite trope is time-travel, which is an expansion off the OP thing. A character who time-travels has a fair amount of power with their knowledge, but it's not over the top, since it's not anything tangible, and the future is constantly changing. I mostly enjoy the character interactions, and having other characters slowly realize something is off. It sort of reminds me of angst, which I also used to read, but not very often. Makes your heart race a bit, and you anticipate the next twist. I also CANNOT STAND it when a character does something that would never work in real life. I'm not talking about magic and plot armor, and all that. Say a character does something that would never be well received in real life, and the other characters just brush it off. I can't really describe what exactly, but I know it when I seeing, and it drives me mad.
