No I totally get where ur coming from. I used to love reading fics where the main character goes against the grain. I was young and edgy and watching young characters kick the shit out of the canon and world and logic their way through everything was awesome. The problem is I read in worlds like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Naruto, my hero, etc. those fics all follow kids. And those kids will start back talking older, experienced, leaders like their an idiot and just be right 90% of the time. looking at some of the shit I used to read now I cringe. I still like a character going against the grain, but now it's a requirement of mine that it be as thought out and dare I say it realistic as possible.
