I wonder if that's why people started to write fics where the characters are excessively formal and speaking as if they were "adults". And by "adult" I don't mean just being formal, but using jargon on complicated subjects that even adults don't usually talk about.

But I don't remember the dialogues themselves well, so I was wondering what dialogue do you think is most forced? And I don't watch much anime / game / film, but there are a lot of cases where a child just doesn't sound like a child.
