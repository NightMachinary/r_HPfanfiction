I've definitely gotten more picky when it comes to grammar, though it may have to do with me writing my own fic.

Smut for the sake of smut is a huge no. It detracts from the story. It adds nothing.

Wholesale bashing is something I don't have any patience for, anymore. And if the author is going to bash, let's say Ron, I would prefer if they took his flaws, and cranked the up a bit. Don't make him evil. And the potion mistress Molly trope I hate.
