My views on FF changed with my views on canon HP. It's kind of a chicken or the egg thing. But as I grew older, I was more critical of the adults, more analytical about the plot and details, and more knowledgeable about what it's actually like being in near-death experiences. Naturally, my views on canon shifted and I can barely tolerate reading FF that is too canon compliant. Most of the stuff I read now is either AU or is about characters that don't really appear much in canon (e.g. Tonks family, other side characters). Incidentally, most fanfictions are also quite critical towards various canon details, so I'm really not sure whether my opinions shifted so drastically because of the fics I read or if the fics I read shifted so drastically because my opinions shifted.
