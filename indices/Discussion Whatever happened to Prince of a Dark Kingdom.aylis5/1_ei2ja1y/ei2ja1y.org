:END:

I have speculated previously on what the ending probably would have come to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9evnw3/how_would_prince_of_the_dark_kingdom_have_ended/][here]]. These are just personal conclusions, but in my defense PotDK had a narrative style of consistently setting up the ending for each "year" rather obviously at the beginning, and we already saw most of the hints of how the story would have concluded.

An alternative possibility is that the author, in fact, never had a serious ending planned out - rather they may have just been adding more and more until the AU got to large for them to try and tie together (somewhat like how I suspect ASoIaF will go in the end).
