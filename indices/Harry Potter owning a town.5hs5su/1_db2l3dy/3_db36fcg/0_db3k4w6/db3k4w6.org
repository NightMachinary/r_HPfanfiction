There will be references that assume you know what they are talking about but there are a fair number of context xlues that can be used to fill yourself in.

Overall I would say it is helpful to have the knowledge of the series, but not required. And the amount of knowledge you need is relatively small. Reading a summary of Got would give you enough.
