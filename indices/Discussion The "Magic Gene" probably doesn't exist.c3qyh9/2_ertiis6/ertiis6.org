  As far as I know, in all cases where at least one parent is magical, the offspring is also magical or a squib.

The definition of a squib is someone who has at least one magical parent but is not magical themselves, so yes, your point is factually correct.

#+begin_quote
  Since squibs still have limited magic

No, they do not. According to Harry Potter Wiki "A Squib is a human who is born with at least one magical parent, but does not inherit any magic from said parent." This could mean that magic is a recessive trait and requires homogeneity to fully develop. This is backed by other information from Harry Potter Wiki "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-born][Muggle-born]] witches and wizards are descended from Squibs who married Muggles: the magical ability *unexpectedly resurfaces after many generations.*" Recessive traits have a habit of doing that.

If a pureblood child inherited one corrupted copy of the gene and one healthy copy, they would still develop magic because there is no muggle gene to get in the way. If both copies are corrupted, then the pureblood child has no working copy of the magic gene and does not develop magic. There is no muggle gene to trigger the muggle repelling wards.
