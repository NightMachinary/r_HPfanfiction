  but for all the average person knows it could easily be something like the Leaky Cauldron which apparently can only be seen by people who know about it.

Well, obviously not, or none of the kids on the Express would have seen them. And I don't know about you, but in these kids' place I'd definitely have owled my parents about this first thing. Plus, i the kids had just felt a gloomy aura without seeing anyone, I feel like the Ministry would have had the perfect excuse to just deny everything /en masse/, anyway. So no, the Wizengamot knows full well that Dementors are visible even to wizards who have no earthly clue they exist.
