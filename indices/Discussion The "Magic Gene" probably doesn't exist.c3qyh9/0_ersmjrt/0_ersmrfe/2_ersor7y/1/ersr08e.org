It's not clear whether Mrs figg could /actually/ see them or not. I could easily see her choosing to lie or being convinced to lie by Dumbledore to protect Harry. After all, the others were surprised that she could see them. I'm not saying common knowledge can't be wrong, especially about uncommon interactions like squibs witnessing dementors, but it's not as clear cut as it might seem.
