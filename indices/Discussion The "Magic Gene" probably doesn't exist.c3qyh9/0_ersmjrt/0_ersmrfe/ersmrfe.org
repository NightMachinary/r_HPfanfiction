Aye, don't let fanon fool you. Squibs aren't magical at all. We don't even know for sure that Muggle-Repelling Charms don't affect them; could just be that Filch was "keyed in" somehow when he was hired. I know some fics posit talismans which can be given to Muggles to allow them to visit Diagon Alley, explaining how the Granger parents could go there; why couldn't Filch be given something like that?
