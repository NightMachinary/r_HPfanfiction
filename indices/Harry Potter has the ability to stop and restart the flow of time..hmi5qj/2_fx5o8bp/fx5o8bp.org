I once read a crossover that had Harry as Jotaro Kujo post Part 3 and therefore after Star Platinum started stopping time. Aside from an introduction chapter however, there wasn't any content. Though there was a noted resistance on the part of Stands to most spells with SP blocking numerous curses ranging from Blasting to the Cruciatus and shrugging off stunners Hagrid style.
