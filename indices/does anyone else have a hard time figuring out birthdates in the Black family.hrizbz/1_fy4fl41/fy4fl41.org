  From the dates given, it would seem that Pollux fathered Walburga when he was a mere thirteen years old. The original hand-drawn family tree by Rowling and the painted “tapestry” on the wall of the set created from that drawing both show the dates as given here (verified in a visit to the set by SVA), so we may assume that Pollux got started a bit young.

All Black family was then already so inbred that I guess most of the members were a bit /meshugge/.
