I take that family tree with a pinch of salt, especially the dates, since JKR is notoriously terrible at maths.

I usually age Walburga up 5 years and Cygnus down 5 years, to make Walburga born in 1930 (sitting her closer to Orion, born 1929, perhaps in the same year at school?) and Cygnus born in 1933. This sits the three siblings (Walburga, Alphard and Cygnus) closer in age, and means that Cygnus was around 18 when Bellatrix was born, and Walburga around 29 when Sirius was born.

This also better fits my headcanon that Walburga's family were proposing to marry her off to other notable pureblood families - her branch was 'just' a tertiary branch of the Blacks at that time, with her grandfather Cygnus the youngest child and third son of Phineas Nigellus. I hc that Walburga was the one to initiate the relationship with her cousin Orion, heir to the family, because she couldn't bear the thought of losing her name and not being a Black any more - /and/ that she had eyes on Grimmauld Place and sitting herself within the line of succession. So it makes sense, to me, that she was a bit older!
