Yeah. Well... if I judge them with the modern-day sensibility with my own culture, I agree with you. But this is an entirely different culture, different time, maybe even different species. I just turn off my brain on something like this in fiction. If he did, that's okay. If he didn't, that's alright too. It is not like the character (minor character, even) is the self-insert of the author that shared her view, right?

JKR world is enjoyable to me, and I don't want to involve politics in my fiction reading.
