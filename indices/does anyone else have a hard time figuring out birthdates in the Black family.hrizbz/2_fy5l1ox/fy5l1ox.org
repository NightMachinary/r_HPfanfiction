Whoever put that "Black Family Tree" together lacks even basic math skills: Bellatrix's father, Cygnus III, also was only 13 years older than her.

Therefore, I think authors can COMPLETELY disregard it when writing their stories. They can of course use some names. But they should only pay attention to these canon facts:

- Sirius was born around 1959/1960
- Nymphodora Tonks was around 1973, and graduated from Hogwarts just before Harry arrived.
- Tonks's birth year means Andromeda Black should be born before 1955.

I would make Bellatrix the middle sister, simply because Andromeda comes before Bellatrix alphabetically. It also makes sense that her elder sister running off with a 'mudblood' radicalized her and made her more determined to uphold 'family honor'.

As a result, Andromeda was born in 1954, Bellatrix 1956, and Narcissa in 1959. Lily and Marauders would have some overlaps with all three Black sisters. I think this would make fics from that era more interesting.
