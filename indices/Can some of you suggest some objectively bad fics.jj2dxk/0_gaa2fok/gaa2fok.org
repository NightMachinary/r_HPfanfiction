In FanFiction.net you can search stories. If their summary is something like "Sry for bad grammar this is my first fic just read the story plz review" you can be sure reading it will not be a pleasant experience. However, they are not bad in an interesting way.

Some of the interestingly bad stories are deceptive. You really need to analyse them to realise what is wrong. Many people, especially young people who are interested in romance between two specific characters, fall in love with bad stories that feature such a romance. That way a bad story can become very popular indeed, and more critical readers get annoyed by it. It feels wrong that really flawed stories get more credit than the rare quality stories.

Here are two examples of deceptively bad stories:

*Harry Crow*. The main character is a Mary Sue type who triumphs every challenge he faces, is loved by everyone but his enemies, and is depicted as a hero regardless of what he does. The moral system of the story is that the main character is always in the right and thus can do whatever he wants. His enemies are totally inept, but somehow he doesn't get bored winning. There is drama for the sake of drama, because if the "hero" doesn't get to beat someone up every second chapters, the writer apparently thought it would get boring. (I only read twenty chapters or so before getting too disgusted, I can't know if it continues like this, but I strongly suspect it does.) I suggest you avoid this like the COVID.

*A Cadmean Victory*. This is another really popular story for no good reason. It has unpleasant characters, pointless filler parts, one-dimensional romance, plot that is shoehorned to follow the Station of the Canon, and world building that contradicts the Harry Potter universe. I actually wrote a review of it last months, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ikpo3l/critique_of_a_cadmean_victory/][here is a link to the review]].
