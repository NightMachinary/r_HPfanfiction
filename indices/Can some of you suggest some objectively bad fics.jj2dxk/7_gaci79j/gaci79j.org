I can't remember what the writer's name is but there is this one who always has ensembles of male characters who do some sort of training and have lots of gay sex (like I love slash but this is just, not written very well imo) and it's mostly just really horrible lectures on magical theory; like the worst smug mansplaining â€˜I know more than you' kind of thing for chapter upon chapter. he also has Regulus Black and his son smugly saying that them having sex is totally fine and normal lmao, and lesbians can't do this special magical bond thing because they apparently don't have dicks.

I'm also traumatised from some really fucked up scenes involving statutory rape and assault, but that was at least written as a bad thing and the dude was on trial

I have no idea why I read so much of their shit. the premise is often interesting but the writing is so indulgent in male slash and long winded explanations that the fics are ruined

they're not the worst I've ever seen, but I keep coming across their stuff, so it's the first that came to mind.

super prolific though. Like they're doing what they want and obviously enjoying it so power to them tbh
