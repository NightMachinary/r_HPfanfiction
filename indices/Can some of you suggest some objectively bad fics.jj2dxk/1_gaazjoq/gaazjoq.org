It seems a little mean-spirited to recommend specific stories that aren't parodies or trolls, but I agree with Gavin_Magnus that non-summary summaries tend to accompany not-so-good stories (e.g., "I'm bad at summaries", "This is my first story be gentle", "no proofreader sry for bad grammar", and similar). You could also look up sporks, which is a mocking review of a story that often goes line-by-line criticizing the plot, characterization, etc.

I personally think Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a pretty awful fic, and I'm comfortable saying that given that the author is an awful person in real life, but I don't know if it's objectively bad. It certainly had a large fanbase. My Immortal is a parody of bad fic rather than a genuine effort, but it's a classic if you've somehow never read it. Oh, man, and Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles; it's another parody but it's such a delightful mess.
