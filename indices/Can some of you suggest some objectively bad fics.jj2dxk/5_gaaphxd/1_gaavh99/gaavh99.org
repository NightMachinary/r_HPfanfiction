I strongly disagree. Its plot, writing, structure, characterisation, world building, foreshadowing, practically every aspect, is of high quality. Many people dislike it because they don't like the theme or the personality of the main character, but that's a /subjective/ view. This topic is about /objectively/ bad stories, and that means focusing on things that are of interest in a literary scientific way.
