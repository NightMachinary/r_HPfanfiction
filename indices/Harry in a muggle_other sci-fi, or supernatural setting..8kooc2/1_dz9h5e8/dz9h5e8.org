The Star Empire ([[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8637910/1]]) is something I rarely see linked. It is quite the creation, where Harry was in a stasis for over a thousand years and wakes up in a world where magic no longer exists. It is abandoned and has a few flaws but overall its honestly an incredible read. Highly recommend
