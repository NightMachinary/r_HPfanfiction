The fanfic I'm currently co-writing is whump/hurtcomfort, has Harry suffering unaddressed PTSD, and heavily features Snape (it's eventual mentor!Snape). However, it does not include alive Sirius, and though there are currently no ships, it will not feature any canon relationships down the line either. Romance will be only a sideplot though-- Our genre is more Gen Angst/Tragedy than anything else.
