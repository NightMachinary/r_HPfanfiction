  A legacy is what a man leaves behind to the world, the culmination of past deeds laid down at his feet for those who come after. War is what inheritance has been passed, and to an old ship left behind in war, forgotten and half-dead they will not go gently into the dark.And when sleepers awaken, they'll discover just what inheritance they left behind.Told in a series of drabbles.

  Neville Longbottom is supposed to become a great wizard, or so his grandmother always says. As it turns out, doing so is more difficult than any of them thought when one has to deal with a broken family, scary teachers, pesky Slytherins, dangerous monsters, and *gasps* yucky girls.OR; A retelling of the Philosopher's Stone, but from the sidelines, mainly from Neville's perspective, but other characters will become important too.

  New Year's Day dawns too bright and far too early. Eliot groans and rolls away, trying to escape the sunlight falling across his face through the wide-open curtains, but his pillows and quilt seem to have slipped to the floor at some point in the night, and there is no refuge to be found. Cursing, Eliot sits up, and comes to the swift conclusion that he hates everything. His head is pounding, his mouth tastes like something died in it, and...

  He has no recollection of how he got to bed last night. Jesus.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.
