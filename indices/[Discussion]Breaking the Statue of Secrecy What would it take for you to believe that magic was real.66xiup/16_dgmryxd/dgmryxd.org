Ive always wondered this. With the technology in today's world, combined with the possibilities to fool the eye, either via "muggle magic" or simple tech tricks, it seems like it would take a LOT to break the statute of secrecy and would probably require a large scale event reported by multiple media sources across a country and seen by hundreds if not thousands of people. Even then, it might not be enough. A good example would be the mass UFO sightings that pop up occasionally around the globe, often with recordings, where you just cant know for sure one way or the other.

To personally believe it I would likely have to experience it first hand and over a period of time before I truly believed, or at least have such a large percentage of the world see proof of it, that there is no denying its fact.

Then again, look at what happens with God or Gods. Millions believe with no real "proof" other than their "belief". Ive never seen a god or gods. We have no scientific proof of a god or gods. And yet, most religious people choose to believe he, she, it, or they exist.
