Nothing, I think would be the correct answer.

We already know of a force that can invisibly act on objects to move them around or levitate them. It is called magnetism. It would appear as 'magic' to those who don't understand it, but once you begin studying it and understanding its limitations the magic goes away.

If I was to come in contact with storybook-esque magic, my immediate reaction would be to study it. (Honestly, a reaction that doesn't happen enough in magic-type books). What are it's limitations? Does the mental state of the practitioner matter? Does Exhaustion effect it? How does it actually interact with objects. Is there some kind of detectable field around them? Lets quantify its strength. Ok, lets have you cast the same light spell 100 times, does it change? How about if we move you around? Let me get an instrument that measures the strength of the light...

It wouldn't take much to convince me there is some unknown power in the world that some people can control with will alone. A fully reproducible, describable experiment. I'd likely even be ok relying on the community at large to verify the experiment rather than require I see it first-hand.

The problem with the notion of magic without rules is that the world doesn't work without rules. If there really is such a thing, how can you call it anything beyond chaos. And if there was really will-controlled magic of that nature, with no limitations, how has the world not been destroyed by some nihilistic wizard who happened along? And if you are willing to tear down enough of the rules of the universe, eventually I'm going to start thinking we are all a figment of some omnipotent imagination. Maybe one who thinks she is a high school student but doesn't really know her powers...

And of course, Magic with rules is just science. Atomic bombs, magnets, gravity... once you understand them, we don't call them magic.
