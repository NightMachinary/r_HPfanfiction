Spoken like a creationist. Contrary to popular belief, the fundamental nature of the universe cannot be determined by personal opinion.

One should distrust all anecdotal evidence, no matter the source. There's nothing special about my own experiences relative to other people. Any experience in isolation is an unreliable source of knowledge.

Humanity has developed institutions of knowledge for good reason. The large scale collection and testing of experience has proven far more reliable in discovering genuine knowledge than trusting one's own intuition and senses.
