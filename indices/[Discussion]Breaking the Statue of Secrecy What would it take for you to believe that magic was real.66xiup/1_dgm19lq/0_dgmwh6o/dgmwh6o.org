This probably wouldn't be enough for me. I would sooner believe I had gone insane and needed to visit the doctor than magic was real.

I would need first hand evidence AND wide-spread societal acknowledgement including acceptance by respected public figures. Both are necessary. Experience alone and I would doubt myself, societal acceptance alone and I would assume it was some kind of elaborate prank or mass stupidity.
