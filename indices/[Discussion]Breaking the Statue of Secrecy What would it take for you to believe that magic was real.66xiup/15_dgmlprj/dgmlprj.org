I'd have to see a magic demonstration with my own eyes I'm a paranoid and cautious person by nature for me to believe it's not butter I need to see the car facts. No illusions just flat out raw magic until then seeing a video would interest me at most while hearing people claim they saw it would be taken with a grain of salt not yet ready to believe but not outright rejecting it. If enough people start making claims I'd then start to do my own research since at that point something would be clearly going on.
