I remember watching a documentary about James Randi and how he, plus a few others, managed to trick actual scientists into believing in magic for an pretty impressively long time. Like, during almost a year of studies while being filmed and picked apart by the best of the best. And they did it with slight-of-the-hand-tricks. I agree with you, I think it would take scientists agreeing that its real and not a joke plus some personal interaction to make me believe. Like, a wizard or witch would have to show me proof via portkey travel or something.

That being said, if it was someone I knew personally, like I friend or a family member, I don't think it would take too much. A few spells here and there and and introduction to the world with a few newspapers or something. Nobody I know personally would be smart enough to pull off an elaborate prank to make it seem like the wizarding world is real.
