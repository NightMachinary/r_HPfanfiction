When I see evidence of it somewhere while I also see concerted efforts by established authorities genuinely doing everything they can to cover it up.

It's not so much the what as the how that would clinch it. Like if videos were being spread on the chan boards with the chans being taken offline without explanation not hours later, but with so many people having downloaded it that the spread can't be stopped and reaches critical mass at some point and everything goes to shit after that. That would be the most realistic scenario that I would believe that comes to mind.
