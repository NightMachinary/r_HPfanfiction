I work in the VFX industry. So basically, given that I know how well you can fake shit, if it wouldn't be first-hand experience, I wouldn't believe it without at least 10 different angles from 10 different smartphones, from 10 unconnected people.

Or if it just keeps being reported on. If I hear of paranormal activities by weird people in robes for weeks on end, I'd eventually give it some credibility.
