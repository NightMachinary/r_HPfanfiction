What I basically don't like with the lordship fics is basically that the nobles forgives Harry actions before he is aware of his status. I would like more fanfics where Harry lack of knowledge and actions have consequences with his standing like House Potter losing alliances, losing power or even losing its seat upon the Wizengamot. Simply House Potter being driven to the ground because of its heir being basically a disaster because of being raised by the muggles.

Why it is only Dumbledore that enjoy the power to manipulate a vulnerable House Potter ?
