Well more that he wants to make a name for himself based on what he can do, not something that happened because of his mother, which to me is in the same vein as not pulling the "I am Lord of House Black-Potter-Stark and therefore..."

Most of what I've been reading lately is mainly canon compliant until the events of the story, so not expecting too much variation on characters. That sounds like an interesting one, though I'd say it ruins Voldemort's character more than Harry's haha
