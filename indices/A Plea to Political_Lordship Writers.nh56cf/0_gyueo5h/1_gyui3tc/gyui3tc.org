Well, he actually doesn't. He's kinda ... indifferent. Perhaps a bit resigned. But not resenting. In any case, he doesn't make a big deal out of it, which is fairly typical, I guess. Harry's laconical reactions to presumably extraordinary events are one of his core traits. Of course, this also does mean he's not seeking to exploit it. That much is pretty obvious -- and it's also one reason why he never was Slytherin material.

But the more relevant question is; in a world with AUs that literally have Harry as Voldemort's son and commiting genocide, /this/ is what destroys his character? :P
