No, I'm ok with that, though a bit tired of seeing it. The mandatory chapter where he goes to Gringotts is about as stale as the mandatory clothes shopping one for me now, haha.

But stuff like using that name to get Malfoy and his cronies to leave him alone, which is frankly just more boring compared to his normal sass. That and getting professors in trouble, usually Snape as well as Dumbledore. I guess most of this is just a side effect of character bashing since those are some of the more common ones.

I really like the idea of your main post though. Have people stab him in the back or use him in this situation. Sucks, but it's more believable to me than him becoming a mega Chad who knows everything about it just from banging Daphne.
