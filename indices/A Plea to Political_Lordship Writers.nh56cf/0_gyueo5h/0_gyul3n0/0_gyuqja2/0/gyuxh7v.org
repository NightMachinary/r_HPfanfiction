Do you consider personal gain to be steps taken towards "freedom''?

Genuine curiosity- I agree that Harry wouldn't abuse a position for greed but I could see him using it to secure something better for himself. I think that's human nature to a degree. Like a "if you become Lord Potter, it'll suck but you don't have to live with the Dursleys". I think Harry jumps all over that
