TBF, Harry would have a lot more pride in the Potter or Black name than in the BWL moniker. Though he does never really seek out info on his parents and family that we see, so who knows?

I do think participating as Lord Potter is much more in line with canon!Harry's character than participating as a celeb BWL whose endorsing things on that.
