Ron Weasley wasn't sure what he should make out of Harry Potter. He met the other boy at the train and it was very nice to spend time with him. For the first time in Rons short live somebody actually listened to him when he told storys about his favorite quidditch team or his favorite chocolate frog cards. During the whole train ride Harry sat there, smiled and listened. What was a little bit irritating was that Harry called him Arti the whole time. But being the sixth son Ron started to react to every name that's called in his direction so he doesn't complain. (Not much, at least. Sometimes it's disappointing when your mother needs two or three tries to get your name right).

Anyway, Harry was a nice bloke. He even bought sweets on the train. He did sound a little bit like Grandpa Septimus when he said: "Don't eat them all at once." But they had fun eating them. That was until Malfoy turned up. Malfoy was a git... but Harrys reaction to the other boy was weird too. After Malfoy made fun of Ron and his family Potter said: "I am really disappointed in you two. You are great-cousins - family really - you shouldn't fight."

And while Harry was right - Rons Grandmother was a Black as much as was Malfoys Mother - they didn't talk about that. Nobody did - not their fathers or their grandparents. There was a mutual agreement about that (after all: you can't choose your family). At least Malfoy fled the compartment after that.

It only got weirder after that. There was this boy - Neville Longbottom - Harry called him Frankie - who searched for his toad. When he opened the door, Harry fired a spell, called him a f*cking Dark Lord who doesn't learn and said that this time they would take him to Nurmengard when Askaban couldn't hold him. It was scary - really - Neville even start crying when Harry pressed his wand against his throat. Luckily a prefect came and stunned Harry in the back. After they arrived Hogsmeade a teacher already waited for them. He woke up Harry and had the most peculiar reaction yet.

"Oh, I must be dead", Harry said to the teacher. "I am sorry Riddle killed you. I named my son after you. Ginny said I am crazy because you were a total git - but I think you deserve a Potter named after you. When I said that Ginny suddenly was okay with it. At least I think so. She stopped laughing after half an hour. But she really has no room to judge. She called an owl Pig."

Ron was sure he never saw a grown up man more horrified than that teacher after this words. The teacher then stunned Harry again and levitated him to the castle. While Ron was on the boat with Neville - who assured them he wasn't a Dark Lord, really - Ron thought that maybe taking a killing curse at age one makes you a little bit crazy.
