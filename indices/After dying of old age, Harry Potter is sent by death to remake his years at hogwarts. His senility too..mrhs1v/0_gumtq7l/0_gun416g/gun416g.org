Part 2:

Hermione Granger was furious. It just wasn't fair. Harry Potter was a nuisance, really. First there was the incident on the train with Neville. The poor boy still didn't dare sleeping in his dormitory because Potter attacked him half the time when he saw him. Then there was the fact that Potter would miss half of their lessons if Ron Weasley didn't keep dragging him with him.

An even worse habit, however, was that he addressed some teachers by their first names. How many points they had already lost because of his lack of punctuality and his disrespect! Hermione couldn't win as many points as Harry lost them. It was like he didn't care about school at all.

The worst of all, however, was that despite his ignorance he managed every spell first and got every potion straight away as if he'd been doing it all his life. He didn't even bother!

But this time she would show him. Professor Flitwick had said that that day they would finally make objects fly. She'd spent every free minute in the library - even skipped lunch and broke the school rules that you weren't allowed to do magic outside of class so she could do the spell perfectly. This time she would be better than him.

So Hermione was sitting in the classroom with a wide grin when Flitwick started handing them the feathers. They were divided into groups of two and Hermione sat right next to Potter. Everyone should see that hard work beats lazy talent.

While they waited for Flitwick to let them begin, she heard Potter mutter, "I forgot something ... but what? There was something, I am sure...“

Hermione ignored him. When Flitwick said they should start, she cleared her throat and said, "I'll start."

Potter didn't even seem to notice her. He looked as if she had pulled him out of a deep thought. „What are we doing?" He asked. Hermione felt like she was bursting with anger.

She hissed: “The levitation spell! We are currently learning the spell for levitation!"

"Oh, that“, said Potter. And without actually swishing and flicking or saying the spell at all, he tapped the quill ... and the damn thing flew. Flitwick turned to them and said: „Oh well done. See here everyone. Mister Potter has done it. Splendid. Well done, my boy! Talented like your mother! Five Point to Gryffindor.“

Hermione felt tears well up in her eyes. Furious she pointed her wand at the feather and shouted: "WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!" Suddenly there was a loud bang and the feather in front of her exploded. All the students turned to her and started laughing. Hermione couldn't take it any longer and ran away. She hated Potter, she hated him with all her heart.

She didn't know how long she had been crying in the girls' bathroom when she suddenly got a terrible stench in her nose. She looked outside to see where the stench was coming from and screamed. In front of her stood a huge mountain troll with legs as thick as tree trunks and a club bigger than her body. She wanted to run away, but her legs didn't obey. Suddenly the girl's bathroom door flew open and Potter rushed in.

"I remembered!" He shouted, then pointed his wand at the troll and screamed: "Sectum Sempra!"

The spell hit the troll right on the neck. For a moment it was as if time stood still ... then the head slipped off his shoulders and hit the floor next to her with a loud splash. Hermione looked from the troll's lifeless eyes to the broadly grinning Potter ... and passed out.
