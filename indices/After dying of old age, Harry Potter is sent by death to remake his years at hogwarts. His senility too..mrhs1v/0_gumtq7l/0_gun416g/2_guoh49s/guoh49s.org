Part 3:

“Come here, Potter!” Professor Quirrell did not stutter at all. If anything, his voice sounded stronger and more sinister than Snape.

“No,” Harry said.

Quirrell muttered. “Master...”

“Let me face him.” Trembling, Quirrell turned around and removed his turban until it was the disembodied face of Voldemort facing the boy. “Harry Potter! You will come here!”

“No,” Harry said. “And since when did you have a nose?”

“What? Come here, or I shall curse you.”

“No.”

“But...why not?”

“I don't wanna.”

“But I have a wand.”

“I don't care.”

Voldemort began muttered to Quirrell. “More of my curse must of hit him than I remembered. Imperio the boy!”

Quirrell spun about and cursed Harry with the most insidious of the Unforgivables. “Come here!”

Harry blinked and obediently walked to the mirror. “Tell us, boy! What do you see?”

Harry had a goofy grin. “The day Ginny told me I was going to be a daddy.”

“What?” “What!?”

As the two stared dumbfounded at the mirror, Harry snapped up his hand into Professor Quirrell's crotch and shouted, “Explodies Testes!”

The resulting screams woke the entire castle.

Two hours later:

“Harry, my boy, I'm so proud of you,” Dumbledore said they spoke in his office. “But where did you learn that...effective spell?”

“My daughter brought home a lot of boys. It was a good way to deal with the ones that weren't right,” Harry said. “So, why didn't I ever know you were putting Flomax in your lemon drops?”

DUmbledore twinkled his eyes. “You'll understand when you get older.”

“IN other words, Pomfrey doesn't have a spell for bad prostates.”

DUmbledore sighed. “Alas, no.”

AN---Not sure it's funny. It's been years since I've written any HP. But it was a fun prompt.
