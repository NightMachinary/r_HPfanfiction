No no, same friends - but treats them exactly like he would if they were as he last knew them:

- Shouts everything at Ron because he became deaf later in life.
- Tries to emphathise with Hermione about outliving their spouse.
- Makes inside jokes with Ron about not playing around with brains.
- Treats Cedric, Snape and Dumbledore like ghosts.
- Complains to Draco about the trouble their sons got into together.
