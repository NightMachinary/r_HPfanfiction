I also disagree with this.

  He paled as he read it. "H-how..." he stuttered.

There's no need to add stuttered here. We know he's stuttering. The dialogue itself shows that.

Similarly, adding an exclamation mark for Madam Maxime's dialogue removes the need to say announce.

If your dialogue conveys the type of speaking, and it usually should most of the time, you don't need to use those other tags. Resorting to other words in these instances is just lazy writing. It's telling instead of showing.

Obviously there are many cases where you can't get certain things across in dialogue and need to use a different tag, but these two examples are not those cases.
