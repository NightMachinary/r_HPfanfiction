"Said" is perfectly fine in /conversation/, but the instances of "said" I changed were part of other actions. At least, I was assuming that Dumbledore was stuttering, and Maxime was announcing what the paper said to the Great Hall.

I actually don't avoid, "said" all that much, but this only had two instances of the word, so there wasn't a sample size sufficient to demonstrate that I don't. If there's a more appropriate word to describe /how/ they're speaking, I'll certainly use it, however.

For example the line "How are you today, Harry?"

I probably wouldn't use "said", I'd probably use "asked"

But with the line "I'm just fine."

I might either use "answered" or "said"
