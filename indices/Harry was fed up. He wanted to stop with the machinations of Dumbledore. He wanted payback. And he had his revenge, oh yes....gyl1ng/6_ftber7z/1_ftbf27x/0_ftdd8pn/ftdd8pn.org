You barely made any mistakes! The commentor has, mostly, changed your perfect English to suit their preferences. I can only see a few actual errors like lightened and lit. (Sorry I'm on mobile otherwise I'd go through it all properly).

Why I'm writing though is because one of the suggestions would make your writing incorrect. You had the phrase 'had learned' in reference to Harry researching the cup and this was 100% correct. You were told it should just be 'learned', which is wrong. Had learned is right because it happened before another past event. That past event is what's happening with the cup, since writing employs the past tense.

I know the instinct is to trust the corrections of native speakers but your level of English is good enough that if someone gives you this many corrections, it's probably personal preferences as well as actual grammar. A few changes also made your original writing less descriptive. You've got great English!
