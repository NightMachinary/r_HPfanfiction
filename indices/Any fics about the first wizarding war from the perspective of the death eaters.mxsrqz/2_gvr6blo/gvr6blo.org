Well linkffn(7937889) explores that phase of Snape's life. However, as in the original books, the Death Eaters mostly use stealth tactics rather than flashy attacks. Snape invents a bunch of spells and potions that makes them really silent so it's not that interesting of an action. Just a lot of assassinations.
