Damn there's one in the Albus Potter series (linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation)) that recurs throughout the story. Albus, a non-Ravenclaw, can't figure it out and none of his claw friends will tell him. I think the riddle pops up in book 1 or 2 and by the end of book 5 (where I stopped for a reading break and never continued) it still hadn't been solved. I wonder if anyone better than I at remembering will know it!
