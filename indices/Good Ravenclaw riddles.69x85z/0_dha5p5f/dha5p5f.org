I would love to see a mathnerd!Rowena, and have the door force them to find roots of very difficult set-ups. Given her time period, from my knowledge of math history, she could issue diophantine equations, or if she wanted to be very mean to upper-year students, I recall an infamous challenge problem from very roughly that era, which was a 45th degree equation only solvable because you could do some very clever substitutions and then apply trigonometric identities.

This is assuming that the door is working off some master list that Rowena compiled. If it can be added to by later Heads of House... mwahahahah
