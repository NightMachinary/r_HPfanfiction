It's part of a trend that a lot of people think is the norm which technically it is but shouldn't. Most of them are just a plain crackish Ron that is just there to oppose Harry. Sometimes doesn't even do much for the plot except be annoying. Because people coming into the fandom are hit with these fics, some opinions change and are influenced by the influx of all these Ron bashings. It's not like all of them are bad but sometimes I just wish some of their Ron's would die off already because he didn't do anything for the story and was just so distracting with it's general annoying personalities.
