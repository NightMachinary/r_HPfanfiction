It's hard to ignore one of the main characters of the story, but I totally agree that the bashing is excessive and makes no sense. Especially when they write the main antagonist (malfoy) as someone with depth and being the "sort of good guy" ðŸ™„ I trully believe that people who bash Ron have only watched the movies, because in there Ron has much less depth and is just a jealous goofball
