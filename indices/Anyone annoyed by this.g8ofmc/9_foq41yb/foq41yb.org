This is the one subculture in HP fanfiction that drives me up the wall!

I am not immediately drawn away from bashing because on occasion it can be executed with excellent world building which rationalizes their reactions brilliantly. Fanfiction authors seem to forget that the audience doesn't have to like a character for them to be compelling.

Having said that, the bashing of Ron is often so unnecessary especially when he canonically played such a pivotal role in Harry's development. Luckily, I find this genre decently easy to filter out as it is usually accompanied with other terrible troupes.
