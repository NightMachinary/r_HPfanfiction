  It's lazy, it's bad it's not fun to read

  You don't *need* to bash Ron to have them be incompatible and drift apart romantically

Thank you! I don't understand this trend of bashing one character in a relationship just because you want their love interest to end up with someone else. I read that Bill is often written into an abusive boyfriend/husband to have Fleur end up with Harry. And of course the same with Ron. I just--why can't it just be an amicable split? Or, you know, just rewrite canon so they were never in a relationship in the first place. But I guess that's just too much work for these writers.

I--okay. I'm speechless. Honestly, at least be consistent in the bashing lmao
