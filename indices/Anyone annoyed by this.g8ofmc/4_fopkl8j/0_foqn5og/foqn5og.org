It's easy - it's because it's the easy/lazy option.

Since Hermione canonically ends up with Ron (which I dislike myself, but it does happen) - authors feel the need to not remove that entirely. So they throw in that relationship, but still want it to end in Harmony - and the easiest way for that is to bash Ron heavily, so that relationship instantly ends.

It's lazy, it's bad, it's not fun to read. Harmony makes a lot of sense as a pairing, if you're into that - but the way to achieve it in a satisfying way isn't to bash Ron. You don't /need/ to include the Ron/Hermione relationship if you don't want it to end that way. You don't /need/ to bash Ron to have them be incompatible and drift apart romantically.

The most glaring version of this I saw was a fic where Ron was bashed just in the middle - where he turned into the biggest asshole in the world for a few chapters so that Hermione would break up with him, and then in the last chapter basically returned to normal. ><
