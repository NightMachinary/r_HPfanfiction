Same! I'm really tired of Harmony fics that bash him seemingly just for the sake of it. Like why can't he support them or at least just he a neutral background character? I don't see Harry being bashed in Ronmione fics.

This oneshot has Hermione defending Ron to her parents who prefer Harry and I really liked it :)
