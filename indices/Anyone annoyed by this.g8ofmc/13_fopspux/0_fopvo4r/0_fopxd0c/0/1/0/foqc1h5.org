A, man, if that's what you got from reading the books, I'd re-start with book 1 and stop at 3. You obviously don't have the reading comprehension to go after that. It's okay.

Also if you call Ron lazy, then Harry should be worse in your eyes, since he actually puts less effort into things. But since you've obviously not paid attention to the actual text, and probably think the movies were good adaptations well... You'll grow up. Eventually.
