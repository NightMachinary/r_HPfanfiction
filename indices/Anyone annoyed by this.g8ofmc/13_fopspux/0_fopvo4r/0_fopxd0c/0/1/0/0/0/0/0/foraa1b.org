Why is he the bad influence and not Harry? There's absolutely nothing to indicate Harry would be any different without Ron.

Also Hermione studied more than anyone else and Harry still beat her in Defence. He was never going to overpower Voldemort.

I think you saying it's a common point in stories shows you're not actually talking about canon here. People using it to create an OC called Harry that studies loads doesn't change canon Harry.
