As for being a bad influence, he encouraged harry to be lazy and slack off like he did. Ignoring the part where he had the most powerful psychopath since grindewald after him and should be training to fight him, or at least survive him.

To be fair, a similar, though somewhat weaker argument can be made against hermione. That her constant nagging put him off from actually applying himself.

It's a fairly common point made in stories that either have harry making a clean break from the both of them or for ones where he doesn't befriend them to begin with.

As for warping my view, it might be possible, but again I really didn't care for book 7. Even more so than HBP, which I read at least 4 or 5 times. Probably read the first five books at least a dozen times each over the years. Definitely more than that for PoA and GoF.
