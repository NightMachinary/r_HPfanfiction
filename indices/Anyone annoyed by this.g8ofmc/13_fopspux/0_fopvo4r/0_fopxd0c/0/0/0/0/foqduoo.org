  MarySue!Hermione permeated into the fandom and now it's stuck there like mold on the walls.

"Hermione isn't a Mary-Sue! She has /flaws/, like being a /really smart/ Muggle-born! Mary-Sues don't have flaws but Hermione does so she's /not/ a Mary-Sue! Here's a bunch of Harmony fics to prove it! What do you mean Harmony's not canon? You're just an idiot who clings to canon, and this is /fanfiction/....WAIT A SECOND! You can't recc Hermione-bashing fics! That goes against canon! Ron-bashing is completely fine because he /hurt/ Princess Hermione^{TM} Hermione has never hurt anyone --the bird attack doesn't count because she's a teenage girl, neither does the jinxed parchment, and who cares about a broomstick or a book-- without a /really good reason/, so you can't hold that against her! Everyone keeps attacking our princess, make them stop! WAHHH" -- Annoying Hermione stans
