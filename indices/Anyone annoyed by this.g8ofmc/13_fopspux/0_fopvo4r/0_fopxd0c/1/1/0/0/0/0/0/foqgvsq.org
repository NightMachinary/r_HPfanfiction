That is the beauty of fanfiction. We can take the best from Harry and the worst from his 2 friends and that can IMO lead to an absolutely great story. Bashing is in my opinion not the most elegant way of removing people you don't need out of a fic, but it doesn't ruin a story and shouldn't be seen as negatively as it currently is.
