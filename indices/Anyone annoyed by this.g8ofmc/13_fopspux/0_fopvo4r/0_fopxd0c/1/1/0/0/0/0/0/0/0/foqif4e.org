Wouldn't say that. Harry being friends with different people and more motivated in school is something that can easily come about as a butterfly in an AU fic. And if you think like that every fic that makes Harry evil or gay changes a much more integral part of him. In the end the only trait that Harry always has are his Green Orbs, and that's perfectly fine. We're writing fanfiction after all, stories too similar to canon are boring af anyway.
