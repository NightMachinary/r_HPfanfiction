I don't mind Ron bashing when there's a legitimate reason given for why he's a dick, like it's an AU where the Weasleys are traditionalist purebloods like the Malfoys, or AU Harry is grey/dark and they just don't get on. But when it's a fic where they're all in Gryffindor and everyone behaves basically the same as in canon except Ron it comes off as a bit hamfisted.
