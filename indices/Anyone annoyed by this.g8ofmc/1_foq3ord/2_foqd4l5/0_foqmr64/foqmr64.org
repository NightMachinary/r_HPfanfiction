It's pretty easy to ask for a judging/bashing fic on Hermione on here - it'd be harder to ask for a Ron-bashing one (or at least, it's harder to find a recommendation thread asking specifically for that). There are plenty of posts that bash on Hermione too, particularly in her relationship with Ron - though, of course, as a reaction/pushback to other fanfic communities outside of this one's portrayal.

Ron-bashing fics are easiest to find in the wild, of course. But his canonical actions stick in people's mind most clearly because they're the least logically justifiable (they're very /emotionally/ justifiable, of course). For instance, the split in 4th year is very memorable for how much it affected Harry, and for Ron being just /wrong/ there - by comparison, most of Hermione's conflicts with Harry in the earlier books are more logical/justified in nature, and affects him less (because Ron is a more important friend to Harry in canon, IMO).

The focus a lot of fanfics have on making Harry more competent also run counter to the canon influence Ron has on him - which is an emotional anchor/normal life (they both do this, but in terms of the trio, Hermione is more the one pulling towards studying/practicing at all times, and Ron is more towards skivving off and having some fun). And so, instead of doing the same thing to Ron and Harry (the proper approach), some take the easy approach of just dismissing Ron and blaming him for Harry not taking things seriously in canon.

It's terrible, obviously, and makes it very difficult to read fics that involve it - but I can see where it comes from in canon and why it's more prevalent than Harry/Hermione dislike (in the general fandom - not on this subreddit of course)
