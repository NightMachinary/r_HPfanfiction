  I'm surprised people are still Ron bashing and I really don't understand why!

I guess it's a combination of:

he did do things canonically that you can genuinely judge him over, and which people get hung up over.

the movies differed from the books in a way that made ron worse, such giving his smart lines to hermione and giving hagrid's anti-slytherin bias to him.

this flanderised, negative version of ron is seen/used so much in fics that it has essentially replaced canon-ron in a lot of peoples minds, so ron is, if not bashed, written as a worse person than he actually was in canon, simply because that's what people think he is.
