I made an argument somewhere else that a lot of authors tend to bash him as an easy way to get rid of the character - sometimes bashing is just bashing, but occasionally?

Say they wanted to write a story starting about third year or fourth year, but wanted to change the story to not have him in it - bashing his character is a very easy way to end the friendship of the previous years without taking away or rewriting everything that had happened up to that point.

Read a story yesterday, Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift, which is a Harmony 6th year fic that portrays probably the most realistic way everyone might have reacted. Everything isn't immediately great between the trio, but neither is 6 years of friendship just ignored and thrown away.
