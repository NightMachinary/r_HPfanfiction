That might be part of another issue though - I don't really read Ron/Hermione fics (not against the pairing in stories, just not interested in stories about the pairing) but I don't recall ever reading a story where Harry was in love with Hermione, the trio knew, and she chose him anyway - which is the likeliest place for Harry bashing to be.

Mind you, some of the Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell stories make him so damn edgy and arrogant you could read them as character bashing parodies.
