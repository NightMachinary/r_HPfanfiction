I'll just note that Rowling had made a list of everybody in Harry's year and it's been put up on the internet at some point or another. And that's likely where Tracy Davis came from. The same with Blaze Zabini, who also got a mention in the books. Probably still a handful or so characters on that list that's not been used yet.
