She's one of the few really attractively casted Slytherin girls but she has no lines or any involvement in the books. That allows her to be a relateable blank slate where fanfiction authors who want to write a relateable Slytherin girl can do whatever they want with her. Similar to fics that make Draco less dickheadish than shown in canon. He's good looking enough that people like to write him more relatable unlike crab or Goyle or marcus flint. Similar with Zabini.

Rowling and the movie producers were basically extremely biased against Slytherin house. Most of the people from there were cast as ugly, dumb, and mean. That really didn't line up to how Slytherin basically had a monopoly on the house cup and would've won in year 1 if it wasn't for dumbledore giving out 150 whopping points after they already won.
