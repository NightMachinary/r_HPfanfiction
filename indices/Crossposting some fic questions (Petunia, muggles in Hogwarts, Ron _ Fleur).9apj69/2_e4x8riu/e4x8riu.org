Not sure about the first one, because there probably are a few, but I've never bothered with those. To me, Petunia (like Snape) is an absolutely despicable bitch, and it's only because canon HP is a eunuch that he still tolerates their shit all the way up to book 7. Anyone else would have killed all three of them long ago, and turned psycho or some such.

Why would non-magical stuff be taught in a school for magic? You don't see the arts being taught in a school for engineering, or the reverse.

As for the third, well, there are some smut oneshots and regular oneshots. Reason why nobody bothered with that pairing is probably because it really is too much to imagine, lel.
