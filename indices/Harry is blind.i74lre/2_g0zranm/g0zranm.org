Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone is a good blind!Harry fic. Luna doesn't play a major part, but she is in there. Pros: it's well written, has a good plot and updates semi-regularly. Cons: a lot of OCs (I don't mind that, but I know some people don't like it) and it is really long (464,000 words and nowhere near the end), in the sense that it can be a bit slow moving in places.
