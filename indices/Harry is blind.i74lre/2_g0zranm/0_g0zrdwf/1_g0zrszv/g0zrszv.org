No, don't worry. I hate that pairing too. No pairings (yet). Basically, Harry is blinded in his fight with the Basilisk and he goes to a centre to learn to adapt to his new disability. No bashing, but definitely a realistic look at some characters' flaws (Ron, Hermione and Neville's reactions are interesting) and not sappy at all.
