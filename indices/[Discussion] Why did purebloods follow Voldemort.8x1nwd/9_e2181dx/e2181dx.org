A lot of people have discussed the crumbling of the pureblood ideology in the mid-20th century as a motivation for the Death Eaters, which is a valid point, but I say you don't even have to go that far.

During the period when the KKK was at its peak in the American South, blacks were 10% of the U.S. population (similar to the implied population of muggle-borns), and segregation was the law of the land. Whites had nearly all the power, and yet people still joined the Klan.

Many if not most genocides were perpetrated by a majority against a minority. They would almost have to be, to be successful.

People don't need to be under threat to join a hate group. They just need a charismatic leader to manufacture a /perceived/ threat, or to whip up historical prejudice, or any number of other things, and Voldemort was that leader to the old pureblood guard.
