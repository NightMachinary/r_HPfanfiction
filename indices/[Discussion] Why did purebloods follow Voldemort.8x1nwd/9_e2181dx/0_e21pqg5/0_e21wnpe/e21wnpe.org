  In Harry's year we know just about two of them: Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley.

That's an argument from ignorance. We don't know the blood status of most people in Harry's year.

  What are those threats? Almost everyone here mentions the only muggleborn Minister and that's all. Is such single case enough to start a civil war?

I don't this is fleshed out in any way and we can only speculate, but there could be many small things that Purebloods felt like encroaching on their territory. "Now Muggleborn are even allowed to have their own vault in Gringotts?! Wha'ts next? Will they take all of our jobs and ursurp the government?!". Paranoia like this is not uncommon, one just has to look at many of the unjustified fears of people in regards to immigration.
