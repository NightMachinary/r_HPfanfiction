We only know two /for sure/ (which is already 5%). JKR's Original 40 list named 5 muggle-borns out of the 22 names on the left half of the notes we saw. Even though 3 of those have been retconned, it definitely shows her early intent to make muggle-borns more common than that.

The difference between the groups doesn't need to be physical either. It can be cultural. Muggle-borns will be pretty obvious at school from the way they talk, even if they fully adopt wizard manners of dress and other trappings, and this is a small community where everyone knows each other, so the people who cared would remember that.

And why do there need to be plausible threats for a hate group or genocide to happen? The "stealing magic" line the Death Eaters come out with in /Deathly Hallows/ has no justification at all and is the very definition of "manufacturing a perceived threat." Ditto for the Nazi-knockoff propaganda pamphlets.

Finally, besides the election of Nobby Leach, we know there were also squib rights marches around the same time, which together imply a larger cultural shift that would including a higher standing for muggle-borns. Most of what we can say about this is speculation, but a political threat is one of the most likely ways to provoke a violent reaction. It's plausible that increased rates of intermarriage were another part of that shift, for example, something the Death Eaters specifically regard as a threat.
