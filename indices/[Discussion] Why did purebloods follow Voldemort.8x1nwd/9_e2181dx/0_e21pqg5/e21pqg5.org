Muggleborns are a lot less than 10% of the Magical World population. In Harry's year we know just about two of them: Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley.

Also unlike Blacks muggleborns don't have any distinguished features like skin color and there's also no history of their enslavement (KKK roots are from it).

  They just need a charismatic leader to manufacture a perceived threat, or to whip up historical prejudice, or any number of other things, and Voldemort was that leader to the old pureblood guard.

What are those threats? Almost everyone here mentions the only muggleborn Minister and that's all. Is such single case enough to start a civil war?
