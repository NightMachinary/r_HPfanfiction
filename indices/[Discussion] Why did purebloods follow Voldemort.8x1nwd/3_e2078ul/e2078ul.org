People followed Voldemort because of who he was: powerful, magically competent and very, very charismatic. Remember, he wasn't Snake-face all his life; in the beginning, he was rather attractive and even dashing. He was a leader, simply put. He had the smarts and the looks and -- most of all -- the will.

Everything else -- the bigotry and promises that he sold to purebloods -- were just tools that he used. It was his character that drew them in.
