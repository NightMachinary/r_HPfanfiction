That's a pretty loaded question. It wasn't that they were stupid...it's just...why do people follow others in the first place? Often, it's because they find something very appealing in the leader's persona: a trait, a character aspect; it can be seductive, and not in a sexual way.

Voldemort would have gathered people to him like flies to honey. He would have gained their trust and respect. Gradually, he would have tied them closer to him, a process that I imagine took years and eventually culminating in the dark mark. Then, the children of those people -- like Lucius and, later, Draco -- would have already been born into a culture of subservience, fear and awe of their leader; their choices whether to follow him or now would have been severely limited at birth.
