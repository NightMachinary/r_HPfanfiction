I actually wrote a text about this for use in review some time ago.

The rise of beliefs in blood superiority in canon has its reasons. The division between wizarding world and the muggle one existed before ISOS as proven by things like Wizard's Council rules on playing Quidditch afar from Muggles (Quidditch Through Ages), The Tales of Beedle the Bard being written in runes in XV century (DH), the various cases of Muggles not knowing that people living near them are Wizards (ex. Pottermore: Potter Family, Pottermore: Hogwart's Ghosts). In Early Modern Europe, came the waves of witch hunts, which created hostility to Muggles. The Wizard and the Hopping Pot had new, anti-muggle version created (The Tales of Beedle the Bard). In the end "the widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for muggle ends", "escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic", "increasing numbers of witch-burnings", "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches" and "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (W.O.M.B.A.T.) led to creation of International Statutes of Secrecy in which British side played significant role (W.O.M.B.A.T.).

"The International Statute of Secrecy became effective in 1692, when the magical community went into voluntary hiding following persecution by Muggles. This was a traumatic time for witches and wizards, and marriages with Muggles dropped to their lowest level ever known, mainly because of fears that intermarriage would lead inevitably to discovery, and, consequently, to a serious infraction of wizarding law.

Under such conditions of uncertainty, fear and resentment, the pure-blood doctrine began to gain followers. As a general rule, those who adopted it were also those who had most strenuously opposed the International Statute of Secrecy, advocating instead outright war on the Muggles. Increasing numbers of wizards now preached that marriage with a Muggle did not merely risk a possible breach of the new Statute, but that it was shameful, unnatural and would lead to 'contamination' of magical blood.

As Muggle/wizard marriage had been common for centuries, those now self-describing as pure-bloods were unlikely to have any higher proportion of wizarding ancestors than those who did not. To call oneself a pure-blood was more accurately a declaration of political or social intent ('I will not marry a Muggle and I consider Muggle/wizard marriage reprehensible') than a statement of biological fact.

Several works of dubious scholarship, published around the early eighteenth century and drawing partly on the writings of Salazar Slytherin himself, make reference to supposed indicators of pure-blood status, aside from the family tree. (...)

Successive studies produced by the Department of Mysteries have proven that these supposed hallmarks of pure-blood status have no basis in fact. Nevertheless, many pure-bloods continue to cite them as evidence of their own higher status within the wizarding community.

In the early 1930s, a 'Pure-Blood Directory' was published anonymously in Britain, which listed the twenty-eight truly, pure-blood families, as judged by the unknown authority who had written the book, with 'the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines'." (lazy quote from Pottermore: Pure-Blood)

This provides certain background for the existence of Muggle-hating (and by proxy muggleborn-hating) part of society, but what led to the support Voldemort got for his rebellion?

Let's look at the political situation

"Ignatius Tuft 1959 - 1962 Son of the above. A hard-liner who capitalised on his mother's popularity to gain election. Promised to institute a controversial and dangerous Dementor breeding program and was forced from office.

Nobby Leach 1962 - 1968 First Muggle-born Minister for Magic, his appointment caused consternation among the old (pure-blood) guard, many of whom resigned government posts in protest. Has always denied having anything to do with England's 1966 World Cup Win. Left office after contracting mysterious illness (conspiracy theories abound).

Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties, but was soon confronted with the first rise of Lord Voldemort. Jenkins was soon ousted from office as inadequate to the challenge." (Pottermore: Ministers for Magic)

First, we had two Ministers that resigned before getting full seven years. One was generally controversial and was forced officially, the second one was controversial among pure-blood faction which may have had something to do with his resignation. Then we had Squib Rights marches, which were met with rioting and are another indicator of the general social mood being against opinions supported by pure-blood faction.

So we have pure-bloods for whom the world is falling apart. Muggleborns get elected, squibs demand rights. And here arrives Voldemort with promises of making Britain pure again. He perfectly capitalised on the feelings of then marginalised group and used them as his followers. The moods and events in the timeframe of original books are just a follow-up to the first rebellion, so the sides are already clearly marked.

Also, there is the "immigrant" part in the books which I forgot to mention. Draco says in PS "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families".
