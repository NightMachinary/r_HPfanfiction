Um... The majority did not vote for Trump.

Trump won because of the electoral college... Clinton won the majority. Liberals are pissed as this is the second time in twenty years the president has been elected by the voting minority. Every other nation who votes for their leaders is done by a popular vote. So no, your argument is completely wrong.

And that's the end of this convo. I'm not going to get in a political debate about Trump in a HP forum about Voldemort. I was just making a real life example how there are always people willing to be marked by leaders.
