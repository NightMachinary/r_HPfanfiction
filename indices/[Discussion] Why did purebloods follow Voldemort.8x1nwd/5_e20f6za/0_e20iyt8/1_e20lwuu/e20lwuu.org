  Many Trump supporters would allow themselves to be marked as Trump can do no wrong

When Trump got elected what I say is that the educated, "liberal" and "democratic" part of US society didn't wanted to accept the decision of majority and some of them even started talks about separating from the US just because their candidate didn't win.

It seems so named "liberals" forgot what word "democracy" means.
