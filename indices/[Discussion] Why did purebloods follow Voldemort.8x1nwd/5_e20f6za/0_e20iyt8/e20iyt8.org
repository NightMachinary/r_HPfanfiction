I agree with all the above.

I also think that more muggleborns started being born (due to the rise of the muggle population) in addition to cheap muggle goods.

During this time you have muggles seriously automate and advance at this time. Just like in real life, many small independent crafters and business went out of business due to cheap goods. I can't imagine it didn't flood the Wizarding world as well. Why spend a crap load of money on Wizarding made items when you can get cheap muggle items and modify them with spells? Only magical items were unaffected.

I compare the rise of voldemort to the rise of fascism in the west. Many Trump supporters would allow themselves to be marked as Trump can do no wrong. You also have many European leaders who loath Islamic migrants because they are 'growing in number and are not adapting fully to /country name here/ culture.'

Switch migrants to muggleborns and there you go.
