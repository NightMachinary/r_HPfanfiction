I could answer this, but I think I will let Dumbledore speak for me.

  They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.

The Death Eaters are, much like modern political parties in the majority of countries in the world, using an idealistic cause/wedge issue/talking point to justify their actions (we are cleansing the impurities from the wizarding world). Many people flock to banners such as this in order justify other things they want done.

Whether the death eaters truly believe what they are espousing is, in the end, irrelevant. Voldemort is more powerful and can force them to obey through a variety of means. From their perspective, they would rather be one of the people in power than not. This is a common thing among organizations looking for and succeeding in regime change.
