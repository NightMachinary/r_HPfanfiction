I asked myself the same question several times. I mean apart from simple story writing reasons I don't see it.

What I could come up with is mainly stuff like: Boredom, yearning for more power, hating the others. It's easy to hate others if they are made the "other". If they are portrayed as evil, uncultured etc.

But for the life of me - I cant figure out Voldemort. He is wasted potential. Both in the story and in the world itself. His motivation is unfounded, he was basically handed everything he couldve wanted without the need to make him cartoonishly evil. There is no reason for him to hate muggleborns or "the light" (I hate the term "light and dark"). Even moreso, his decision to name his followers the Death eaters? And the whole SchutzStaffel-outfit they seem to go for? Makes no sense. They are not only evil, they also look that way.

I wish Voldemort couldve been more subversive, more morally acceptable.
