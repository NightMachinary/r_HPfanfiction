I'll come back to this later, and someone might have mentioned this earlier, but there was a muggle-born Minister for Magic in the 60's. You also have Dumbledore at the peak of his powers and influence. It's not unreasonable to suggest that there was an increasing tendency for greater respect and tolerance. And on top of that, you might also have more muggle-born students with the baby-boomer generation coming to Hogwarts from the muggle world.

In that light, the Death Eaters are the cultural counter-revolution that always happens in every society when it begins to undergo significant change and power begins to disperse. Just as in the real world we are seeing the rise of authoritarian, nationalist politics that opposes liberalism and human rights, you get portions of the pureblood establishment dismayed and stressed about their self-conceived loosening of power. Remmber, Dumbledore himself is a half-blood by their definition, and even combined they'd struggle to get anywhere near him, magically or intellectually.

Then you have this extremely charismatic, influential, still good-looking wizard who's maybe just as powerful as Dumbledore, and he's got the ancestral bloodline to boot - and remember, he didn't go after the Wizengamot members. Besides the ones who were with him from the beginning, he got them young - Bellatrix, Regulus etc.. Voldemort could be extremely captivating when he wanted to be, and here's a whole section of his society just calling for something to get behind - a cause for young people raised with the notion that they're just better than other people because they're pureblooded. It's one of the more interesting facets of the books that doesn't get enough attention - how Voldemort hoodwinks an entire generation of Slytherin purebloods, and how he effectively steals the stuffy old pureblood establishment's children from right under their noses.
