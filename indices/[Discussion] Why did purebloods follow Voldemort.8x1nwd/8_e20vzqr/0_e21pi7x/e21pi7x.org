  And on top of that, you might also have more muggle-born students with the baby-boomer generation coming to Hogwarts from the muggle world.

Demographic statistic doesn't support this statement. In 79-80 years the birth count was ~730-740K and we know about only 2 muggleborns in Harry's year: Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley

Even if you take the max number of birth (~1KK) in some years, it increases the number of muggleborns on 2-3 people at most.

If such minority without proper relations in the Magical World can take over Old Power... I would say that such purebloods didn't have any power at all.

  It's one of the more interesting facets of the books that doesn't get enough attention - how Voldemort hoodwinks an entire generation of Slytherin purebloods, and how he effectively steals the stuffy old pureblood establishment's children from right under their noses.
