If you take into account how Dumbledore handled Slytherins vs others House rivalry in the school he's Headmaster of, was he really a problem for purebloods?

He removed himself from big politics and even Voldemort's rise in the both wars didn't make him return.

Therefore I don't see him opposing any pro-pureblood policies.
