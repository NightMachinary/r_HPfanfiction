Why do any bigots bigot?

Because there's always the disenfranchised amongst them who need a minority to blame. Because they might have power on a covert level (Lucius Malfoy's influence over Fudge) but that doesn't mean they don't want it on an overt level. Because /any/ consequences for them are too many consequences. Because the minority having /any/ rights mean they've got too many. Because they project their hatred of the minority on to the minority and expect that if the minority took power they would use the same oppression against their former oppressors so really it's just self defence. Because they don't see minorities as fully human. Because the minorities are /clearly/ less intelligent/capable and thus they should be kept under strict control for their own good.

That and we don't actually have much historical context for the start of Voldemort's rise to power to compare the rights that minorities had then with what we see in the books.
