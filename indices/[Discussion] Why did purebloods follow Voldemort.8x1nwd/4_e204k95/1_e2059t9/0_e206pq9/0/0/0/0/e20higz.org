Anti-semitism was wide-spread in Europe in the 20th century, even though there were high-ranking Jewish politicians. Genocide doesn't happen out of nowhere - but it doesn't take as much as you think it will take. And in a society where torture and slavery are accepted, genocide is just another step. If you are fine with elves being slaves because they're not humans, and consider muggleborns less than human, then you're almost there.
