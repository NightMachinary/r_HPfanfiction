  With such logic we can state that there's no guarantee that there won't be genocide in several years in USA

Have you seen the news recently? Because what I'm seeing is families being separated and incarcerated in prison like camps for the crime of fleeing violence and if they are released parents having to /pay/ to get their children back. I'm seeing rhetoric saying round up illegal immigrants and put them in these camps despite the government having happily taken their money and cheerfully made the process of becoming a citizen as long and convoluted as possible. I'm seeing cries to denaturalise naturalised citizens. I'm seeing raids by a government agency on people for the crime of 'looking' undocumented (ie brown).

No, we can't fucking guarantee there won't be a genocide in the US within the next several years. In fact, I'm fucking terrified that there will be. To paraphrase a tweet, we're now reached the part in the history book before all the maps get really arrow-y.

The serious reasons are 'A large proportion of my support are disenfranchised people who need a minority to blame and are willing to shoot themselves in the foot voting to do so'.
