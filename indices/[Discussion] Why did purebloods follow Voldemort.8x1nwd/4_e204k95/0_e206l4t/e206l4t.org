That's one of the gripes I have with pottermore; it doesn't make sense that a muggleborn would have been minister just 10 years before the rise of Voldemort. Public opinion (for/against) does not change that fast.

This is another one of those things JK really didn't think through. You dont have a black president 10 years before you put them in slavery. You don't have a Jewish chancellor 10 years before the holocaust. It just doesn't work like that.

This is one of those tidbits I feel justified in disregarding as it just doesn't add up in my mind.
