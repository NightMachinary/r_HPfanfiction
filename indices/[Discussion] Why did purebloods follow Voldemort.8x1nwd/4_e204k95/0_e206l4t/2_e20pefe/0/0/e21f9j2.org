That is true so I will point something about the holocaust then: Germany was the safest and most accepting place for Jews in all of Europe. It was one of the few places where they really weren't discriminated against, and one German person who didn't like them guy into power and turned the whole country against them. It's different than a Jew being in power before this, but it's a very quick jump from peace to murder.
