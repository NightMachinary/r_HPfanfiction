  Do you see anyone of them taking guns and going to streets themselves to shoot black people?

Somewhat baffled by this comment, I have to say. The point I presented was that preferring to associate with people of a certain social group (as Fudge prefers to associate with "pure bloods") does not mean that you are going to tolerate or be comfortable with open bigotry against other groups.

Thus why Lucius doesn't dare say anything anti-Muggleborn in Fudge's presence, even though Fudge himself prefers to associate with pure-bloods. The Trump comparison -- where Trump's administration is compared to Fudge's administration -- was to show that this is a realistic situation.

Somehow you have got from this that I was drawing a comparison between Trump's administration and the Death Eaters.

  Why then didn't the Ministry deal with them at that time?

Because they couldn't due to Voldemort's personal power.

  A good part of DEs we know about are from old well off families.
#+end_quote

Are they? We know the Malfoys are filthy rich; we know that the Blacks were moderately wealthy but not absurdly so. We don't know anything about the wealth or family prestige of any other Death Eaters, so far as I recall.

  Why did they throw it away and became literally Riddle's slaves?
#+end_quote

For the ones who are already wealthy and powerful, because they are true believers. But as Dumbledore notes, most Death Eaters joined with Voldemort in order to gain power -- they didn't have it already.
