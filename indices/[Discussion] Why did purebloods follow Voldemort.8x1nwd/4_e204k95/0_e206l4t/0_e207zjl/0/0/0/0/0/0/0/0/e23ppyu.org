  What stops them from doing anything they want without Riddle's support?
#+end_quote

Nothing, but they can't do it systematically and without repercussion since Riddle has the tactics and power to make it feasible as actual strategy. Alone they were nothing by comparison, just lunatics.

  10 years of war and no prisoners? It's either wrong or the government and the Light side are dumb idiots.

Did your read the series? ONLY Riddle knew more than a few of who the Death Eaters were, they were kept intentionally unaware of most of their compatriots for just that reason. The "light" (not a real canon thing) aren't idiots, Riddle was just a genius and highly paranoid.
