  Riddle was powerful sure, but others were not.

And? They don't need to be, if Voldemort is protecting them. In any case, no one knew who they were.

  And for Riddle himself the Ministry had Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

I think this is the wrong way to think about things on a few levels:

1. Dumbledore very much did not work for the Ministry. He was doing his own thing.

2. "Having Dumbledore" only counts for anything if you can engage with Voldemort in a direct confrontation. But it seems clear that neither the Ministry nor Dumbledore were able to pierce the spells which kept Voldemort hidden.

3. As far as we know, OotP was the first time Dumbledore and Voldemort had ever duelled, as they had avoided each other until that point. And that duel was even enough that I would not be confident in putting all my eggs in the "we have Dumbledore" basket. Indeed, if anything I would say Voldemort had the edge in that duel, given that Dumbledore needed to be rescued by a third party (Fawkes) to avoid taking a Killing Curse.

  Look at the list of Sacred Twenty-Eight

  A good part of them are Riddle's slaves of sympathisers.
#+end_quote

As the article you linked explicitly notes, the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" was a vanity project of an individual wizard and essentially reflects his personal favourite families. It is not a reliable listing of which families are actually influential in wizarding society, and indeed contains several notable absences.
