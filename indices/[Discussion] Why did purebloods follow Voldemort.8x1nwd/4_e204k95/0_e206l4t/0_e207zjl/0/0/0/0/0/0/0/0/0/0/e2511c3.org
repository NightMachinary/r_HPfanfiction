  Please, be more consistent.

You are confused. That wizards can teleport doesn't mean they can do any magic without repercussions. Apparition cannot be tracked, but spells can. Wands keep track of the spells used with them, so unless you disguise yourself and make a perfect getaway, you can't just go around throwing Unforgivables unless you've got an ace in the hole to deflect the heat, it's stupid. Remember, it was the backing of Voldemort that let the Death Eaters operate that way, not just being a wizard.

  Is this why he called them by names in the graveyard scene?

What are you on about? Obviously Voldemort knew them all. My point is that as Kakaroff states directly in GoF, no Death Eater knew every other Death Eater. Voldemort alone knew them all, and as Crouch said, it was precisely to prevent traitors from implicating them all.
