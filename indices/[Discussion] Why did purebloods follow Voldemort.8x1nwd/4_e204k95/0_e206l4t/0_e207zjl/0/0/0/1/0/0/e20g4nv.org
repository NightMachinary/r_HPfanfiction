Expect you leave much more traces in our world than in magical one. Especially in the current society.

Death Eaters don't need weapons - they have their wands. They don't need transportation - they have apparition (which as I already mentioned is untraceable). Oh, they certainly had their people in the Ministry (Rookwood being a known example), but the head of DMLE was Barty Crouch, who had no mercy for Death Eaters. He authorised the use of unforgivables against them and didn't hesitate to send his own son to the living hell of Azkaban.

And of course, even in our world, many terrorist organizations keep on evading law enforcement.
