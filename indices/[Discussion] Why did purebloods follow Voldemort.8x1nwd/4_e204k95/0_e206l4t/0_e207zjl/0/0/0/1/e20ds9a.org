Welcome to the charms of asymmetrical warfare against terrorists. Death Eaters names were largely unknown, their bases were unknown, and with magic, they could transport instantaneously and untraceably.

On the other hand Ministry people, Aurors, Hit Wizards, the media. Those were all public figures. So for eleven years Voldemort tried to either recruit or eliminate all talented wizards. So for eleven years, he used the fear-inducing tactics. Killing the families of those who spoke against him, so they would find them all dead when returning home.

He knew where to strike, who to strike. Ministry didn't. And the potential targets were too many to sufficiently protect them all, not even taking Voldemort's power into account.
