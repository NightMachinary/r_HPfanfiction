  So the Aurors were so bad that you just can wear a mask and do whatever you want -- no one will ever find you...

  May be his base was hidden. But he didn't just sit there all the time. Especially if you remove all his support, he would have to move and take some actions in order to get a new one.

No one knew who the Death Eaters were, so they couldn't simply remove his support. Not to mention, again, aside from Dumbledore and Amelia Bones, no wizards are known to have been at Voldemort's level, and Voldeort could teleport to escape.

  Still we know about jokes about “wealth” of Weasley family and not once the similar joke to someone in Slytherin.

The Weasleys are very poor though, and that at least is partially due to having so many kids, which is unusual for British wizarding families (notice how most only have one kid, two at most). And we don't exactly get a bunch of Slytherin dialogue, much less some personal enough to be about others lacking wealth.
