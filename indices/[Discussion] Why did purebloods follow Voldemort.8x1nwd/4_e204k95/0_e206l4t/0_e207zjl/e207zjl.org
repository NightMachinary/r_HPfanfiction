  That's one of the gripes I have with pottermore; it doesn't make sense that a muggleborn would have been minister just 10 years before the rise of Voldemort. Public opinion (for/against) does not change that fast.

I disagree entirely; I think it's excellent worldbuilding: the shock of a Muggleborn Minister for Magic caused the more extreme corners of society to resort to increasingly violent and desperate means to enforce their bigotry.

I think perhaps the dissonance is coming from the idea that Voldemort's regime had popular support. It didn't. Most of magical society is anti-blood supremacy like most of Muggle society is anti-racism, though many people likely retain unconscious biases. We see this in a variety of ways:

1. In the election of a Muggleborn Minister for Magic.

2. In the fact that Malfoy's use of the word "mudblood" was shocking and is intended as a clear parallel to the "N-word" IRL.

3. The fact that in GoF it is noted that Lucius Malfoy would not dare speak anti-Muggleborn views in front of Fudge, even though Fudge himself is noted to have a predisposition to look favourably upon those of "pure blood" (just as it would be political suicide to say "I hate black people" in the Trump administration, even though Trump's inner circle is composed entirely of white people).

4. The fact that the moment Voldemort falls in 1981, his entire movement collapses with him.

5. The fact that Slughorn and the Slytherins rally a good portion of the wizarding population to return with them to Hogwarts and fight the Death Eaters/Vichy Ministry off.

Basically, the Death Eaters are successful largely because of Voldemort's personal power. They are very much trying to enforce policies which go against the views of the vast majority of the populace, and the moment Voldemort is removed from the equation, the "liberal" status quo is restored. The actual number of Death Eaters is, what, 30-40? Even with the smallest figures for the magical population, that's a tiny minority. Everyone else is just a scared person who cares more about keeping themselves and their family safe than standing up for a principle.
