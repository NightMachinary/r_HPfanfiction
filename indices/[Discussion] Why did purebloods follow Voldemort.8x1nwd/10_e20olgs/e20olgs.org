I think the main point was that while (some) purebloodd had the money and establishment they were few. The number of purebloodd was either sinking constantly or took a steep dive during Grindelwald. The, had a muggleborn minister, they had Dumbledore, and a ever growing half blood/muggleborn population. They were scarred to loose that power as well.

In addition I think you see the post voldemort as pre voldemort population. Voldemort clear ly targeted rich and influential non putebloods firstly, even if we know more of his purebloodd victims(more relatives left over). So we can assume the purebloods had in the end a better balance and could fill the ranks.

And lastly I think you overestimate the purebloods influence. I think it was the only lucius with any influence, all the non imprisoned death eaters had no real positions of power. If they had all that much power, why would they need to pressure and threaten the wizengamot. That the purebloods ruled the gamo is a fanfiction thing.

I always thought about the Wizard racism like I view the modern American racism. More like an underclass and uneducated people thing with a few honchos riding on those, but with no real backing in the broad society. And maybe some subconscious bias.
