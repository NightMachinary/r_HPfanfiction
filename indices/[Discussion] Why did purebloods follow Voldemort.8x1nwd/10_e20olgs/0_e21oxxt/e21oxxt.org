  I think the main point was that while (some) purebloodd had the money and establishment they were few.

After the first war a bunch of known Death Eaters got their way out of Azkavan and the they were living happily until the Riddle's second rise.

  In addition I think you see the post voldemort as pre voldemort population. Voldemort clear ly targeted rich and influential non putebloods firstly, even if we know more of his purebloodd victims(more relatives left over).

There weren't many indicators of the opposite. The first war was about 10 years long. While government admitted it was devastating, still it allowed known Death Eaters escape any investigation and the corresponding imprisonment.

If those DEs filled the void and raised during the war, as you're saying, it's an even bigger reason to investigate them more carefully.

Still we know that Malfoys and Notts were influential even before Riddle.

  If they had all that much power, why would they need to pressure and threaten the wizengamot.
