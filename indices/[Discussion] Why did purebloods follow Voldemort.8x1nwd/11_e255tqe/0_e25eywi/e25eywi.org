It's a good question why we don't see almost no one from the older generation despite the statement that wizards and witches live a lot longer than mundane people.

Somewhere on Pottermore it's stated that majority of magical population are half bloods for a long time, therefore I don't see a lot of hate towards them from pure-bloods. Arrogance -- yes, hate -- no. Even Malfoy Jr. was ready to befriend Harry Potter who is half-blood.

Also we see that Riddle's inner circle contains influential people, for example Malfoy, Lestrange, Nott -- people who had what to lose becoming Riddle's slaves.

Mark -- is some magical artifact that is permanently printed on your body and allows the Master to cause your pain. It can accept that they were brainwashed, but still...

I believe that people in power don't trust so easy and tend to calculate possible consequences of their actions.
