People in power. Well are they really in power the purebloods sure are but are these particular families in a position of power they think is sufficient? Or do they believe that they have something to gain by joining a cult/terrorist group? That is the question on the level of parents of the people you describe.

My guess is that their parents saw a way to gain influance and were in to deep for their kids to make any other choice than to join up.

The mark is not only an artifact to cause pain but also an artifact that inspires fear and give power. I don't think its likely that the pain causing effect was that well known nor used a lot especially at the start of the movement. (what we see in the books is all late stage stuff not how it started out)
