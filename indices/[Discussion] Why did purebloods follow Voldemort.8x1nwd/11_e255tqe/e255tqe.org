I have read your question and some of your comments.

Its important to first establish purebloods power in society at the start of Tom's rise. At that point the social and economic situation of the wizarding world has been subject to major change. The rise and fall of Grindewald must have changed the views of of society as major events are bound to do. There was more openness in the ruling class towards half bloods and muggleborns. Not to much for sure but still a little.

On the other hand pure bloods aren't a homogenus group some are rich and powerfull some poor. Those without most wealth and power will have hated the rise of muggleborns and half bloods. While the richer will have seen in Tom a chance to close the ranks of power off for new comers while having their own power grow (however misguided that view may prove to be).

The establishment in other words while still mostly pure blood will have had enemies. A normal situation after a major change. Being part of the "ruling" group doesnt mean much if you are not part of the part that actually does the ruling.

Tom's path to power began in school. Seen by all as powerfull inteligent and charismatic. No torture and slavery there yet. He makes "friends" followers. But only after he returns back from abroad more powerfull he starts to really built the Death Eaters. Which is not a political group by any means. It is a terrorist group annex cult built around Tom himself. And as with any terrorism group and cult there is a bait and switch team going on. There are big promises to draw you in but in the end you are the one making the sacrifices. People get indocterinated and blackmailed into following.

You have asked i believe why the pureblood parents let their children join? Well how many pureblood parents are around? All the DE's are young those who knew Voldemort in school seem to have been killed off. So there is not much to stop them it seems.

Why take the mark? You seem to think they view it as a mark of slavery. They view it as a mark of power they are Voldemorts elite and the mark allows them to speak with his voice.

Any other questions i have missed?
