To say that there is no reason for purebloods to join Voldemort's movement, you would have to assume several things:

(1) Blood supremacists have enough political power to institute the laws and reforms that they want

(2) Actions or laws passed from blood supremacists would not garner protest from a generally pro-muggleborn and pro-muggle public

(3) Voldemort is incapable or unwilling to persuade key pureblood activists/politicians that his Death Eater movement is good or beneficial to purebloods

I think that purebloods having all, or most political power is unlikely because Wizarding Britain, in the 20th century was generally moving away from pureblood ideology. This shown by:

(1) The election of a Muggleborn Minister in the 1960s

(2) The rejection of a bill by Araminta Melifula that would make muggle-hunting legal

(3) The use of "mudblood" being taboo in Wizarding culture

(4) The "death" of Voldemort causes the status quo to return

As [[/u/Taure]] mentioned, Voldemort is the only one who is holding the Death Eaters together. He is the only one of the Death Eaters capable of really standing up against Dumbeldore. Once he is gone, the Death Eaters lose morale and the movement ultimately collapses from a lack of heavy hitters. Voldemort is the guiding hand of the organization. This is shown in GoF. During the Quidditch Cup, the Death Eaters attack. However, they are attacking for amusement, rather than any real purpose.

Blood supremacists join Voldemort because they view themselves as the disenfranchised, the ones without power. Their way of life is being eroded. They join Voldemort to regain power and to establish blood supremacy. They don't have the influence to do what they want in the legislature, and can't influence ministerial elections to get their candidate to the top. They submit to Voldemort because they believe in their cause.
