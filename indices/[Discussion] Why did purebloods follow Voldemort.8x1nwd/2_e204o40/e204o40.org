The purebloods didn't have all the power. There was a muggleborn minister at some point and in GoF i believe, we find out that someone as influential as Malfoy doesn't dare to speak of his beliefs in front of the minister. I believe that a large part of Voldemort gaining followers was due to backlash from the purebloods loosing a lot of their power.

But yeah i too find it silly when i read a fanfic and apparently the purebloods already ruled everything, so they decided to help Voldemort to rebel against themselves lol.
