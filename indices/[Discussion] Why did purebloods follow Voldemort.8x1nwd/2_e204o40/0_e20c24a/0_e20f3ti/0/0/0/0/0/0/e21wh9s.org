  Riddle couldn't be at several places at the same tine. He was powerful, but not multiple.

The thing is. He didn't have to be. That's the whole thing about asymmetrical warfare. It's the defenders who have to be everywhere.

  If the power was the only argument, he wouldn't had needed his DEs.

While his personal power was a key factor, he couldn't do everything by himself. He needed an army to strengthen a terror effect. He needed spies, he needed bigger forces to be able to quickly destroy muggle villages, and he certainly didn't want to have to go after families of everyone who opposed him personally.

  Using analogy with Nazis, Hitler didn't personally kill all those Jews. He used this supporters and build the system that did it for him. Remove the support and he would had become nothing more than a ultra crazy person.

That's a bad comparison. The whole system was established when Hitler was in control of the state, this types of cleanses only appears in DH.

Of course, Voldemort hasn't attacked everyone personally, but he was the one who could eliminate those who were the biggest danger.
