Without a proper (public) support such group would be easily dealt by the government.

To start a civil war you should have a big power on your side. Very few people in power can follow such extreme words only. To get more support you need bigger problems to blame muggleborns for...

Pre WW2 Gernany is a good example. It was in very bad state after WW1 and Jews were used as scapegoats for the majority of problems. Nationalists gained public support and we all know the results.

If Magical World went the same way, what problems did it have that muggleborns were blamed for?
