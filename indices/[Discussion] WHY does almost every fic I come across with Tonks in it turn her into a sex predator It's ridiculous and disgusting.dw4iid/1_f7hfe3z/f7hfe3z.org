I haven't read the rest of the fic you screenshotted, but being called a “cute kid” by an adult in isolation doesn't seem like a predatory remark, and /without knowing anything else that happens in this fic/ I would probably assume that the description of Harry blushing and whatnot is a result of Harry reading too much into a comment from a girl he thinks is pretty.

Its probably a strange form of author wish-fulfillment; the author remembers when they were a kid and had a crush on an older girl, and then they write a fic where such a relationship happens without thinking too hard about the real life consequences and why that would be really unpleasant. There is a lot of that kind of thing in fanfiction, but I try to remember that it's just a free story about wizards I'm reading online and just because something cannot happen healthily in real life doesn't mean it shouldn't be written about. For me, when I encounter that kind of theme in fiction treated unrealistically, it's like a thought exercise to imagine the implications of a world where various aspects of our understanding of “consent” magically do not exist.
