So was I the only kid at weddings and such where people would call me cute and have me blush. That's a thing right. I am not crazy. It's not gross, to me this seems like a normal interaction with an older lady (early 20s) my girlfriend does it to my cousins all the time (minus the wink). If later she actually tries anything then yes she is gross, but at the moment it just seems like a playful complement.
