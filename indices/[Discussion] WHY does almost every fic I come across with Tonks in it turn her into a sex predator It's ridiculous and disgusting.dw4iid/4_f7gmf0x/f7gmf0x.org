Not to defend this, but Tonks was predatory in canon too. Not necessarily to kids, but that scene in Half-Blood Prince where she grabs Remus, shakes him, and tells him it doesn't matter that he keeps saying no, she's going to keep pursuing him, puts her firmly in the domestic abuser category. It doesn't seem out-of character that a person who did that would also prey on kids.

I'm not opposed to fics with dark themes, but yeah, I hope the writers understand that they're writing something dark, and don't make light of it.
