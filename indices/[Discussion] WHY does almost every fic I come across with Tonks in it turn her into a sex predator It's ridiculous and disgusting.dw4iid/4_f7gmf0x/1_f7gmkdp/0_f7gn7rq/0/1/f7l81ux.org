People have this weird thing where they forget that Harry Potter is written by a person who can make mistakes, and that the characters in it aren't real people that would respond to situations like real people would. That scene was meant to show how Tonks was devoted to Remus and that his being a werewolf didn't matter to her. In canon Remus wants to be with her but doesn't think he, as a werewolf, deserves her. Their canon relationship as a whole was meant to show a man who thought his disease meant he didn't deserve her or love in general, and that she wanted him to see that was wrong and that she loved him regardless.

But hey context doesn't matter so Tonks is an abuser and Remus' hangups on accepting love don't matter /s
