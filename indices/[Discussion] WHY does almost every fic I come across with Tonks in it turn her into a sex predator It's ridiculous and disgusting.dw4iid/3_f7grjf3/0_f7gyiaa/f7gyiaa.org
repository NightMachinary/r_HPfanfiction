  Was what Tonks said in bad taste? Inappropriate? Deserving of criticism? Sure
#+end_quote

She's just trying to tease him. Moody even comments on it right in the next sentence. There isn't even anything that inappropriate about it.

  [calling Tonks a pedophile] = conflating inappropriate behavior with a devastating crime
#+end_quote

Being a pedophile is not a crime. Rape, molestation, abuse, etc are, but just being one by itself is not.
