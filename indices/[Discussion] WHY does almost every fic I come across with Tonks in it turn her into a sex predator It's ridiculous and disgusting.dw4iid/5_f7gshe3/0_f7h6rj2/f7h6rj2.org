Maybe that comes with the territory? I mean Tonks can basically be anybody (we don't know if she can fake being male 100%, but even if she can't grow testicals she can otherwise still appear male!) she wants to be...maybe that does screw with ones morals and look on life etc.?

I mean I do loath thieves normally, but if I could change my appearance like Mystique (from X-Men) or Tonks can? You bet I'd probably steal stuff because no camera would enable them to catch me easily (just switch appearance!)
