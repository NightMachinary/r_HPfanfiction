Tonks has always been a bit.. I don't know if dodgy is the right word, but she definitely lacks the stricter morals you'd normally find with professional Aurors.

I think the reason there's so many Harry/Tonks ships is because out of all the Harry/Older Woman ships there are, thats the one that could most realistically have happened in canon. Now, whether or not in she was actually as â€˜dodgy' as she appeared or if it was just a flirtatious/tomboyish act I couldn't say. Personally a lot of my irl humour is flirting-based so I could sympathise with that, in fact I'm inclined to believe such is the case for Tonks since that aspect of her personality seemed to calm down after getting into a relationship.

Also, I don't know where OP is from so this could end up being irrelevant, but in the UK the age of consent is 16, which means from Order of Phoenix onwards (where Tonks was introduced) it isn't pedophilia.
