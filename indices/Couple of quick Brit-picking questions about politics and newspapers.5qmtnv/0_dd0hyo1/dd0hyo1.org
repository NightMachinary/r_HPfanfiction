I would think Remus would read the Guardian or the Independent (from 86 onwards). I don't really have any evidence for him being left wing beyond it seems to fit his mild personality and his type of poverty. If he's looking for jobs he would probably pick up others like the times and the telegraph as well.

Rowling has actually given us a lot of hints about the Dursleys and their political beliefs. They love the daily mail and Top Gear, they seem to support capital punishment, and they live in suburban Surrey. They are total Tories. In later years I imagine they went over to UKIP. They would adore Thatcher.

I don't think Snape would care that much about Muggle politics, and I'm finding him hard to place. My gut says he's a conservative but he did grow up in a labour heartland. I can't decide if he would like Thatcher. I've never been good at his character :(
