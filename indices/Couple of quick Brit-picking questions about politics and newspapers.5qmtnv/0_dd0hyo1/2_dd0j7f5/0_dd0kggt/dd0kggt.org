When does he refuse help? Snape makes him wolfsbane because he can't make it himself. We see him living with Sirius in OOTP and it's implied he's living with Tonks's family in DH. I believe Rowling also says that James supported him financially when he was alive. Remus has a lot of shame and self loathing, but I don't think he refuses help when he needs it or wishes to deny that to anyone else.

Also regarding Thatcher - she seems to be the exception to the rule for most right wing misogynists, probably because she explicitly shunned feminism and deepened her voice. Most misogyny I've seen directed at her has come from the left.
