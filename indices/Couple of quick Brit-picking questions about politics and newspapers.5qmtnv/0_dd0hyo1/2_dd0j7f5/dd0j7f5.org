I have to massively disagree on Remus. In my opinion we see ample evidence of Remus refusing help and wanting to do everything himself, what he prizes and dreams for is freedom over safety which is right over left. He would rather be free of his condition and poor than never have to worry about money. Also would Vernon and Petunia approve of a woman in charge with regards to Thatcher?
