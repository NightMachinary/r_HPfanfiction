Yes, but you claimed that right wing/left wing was the same thing as authoritarian/libertarian, which is simply not true. The privacy v security is a social argument not an economic one, so it isn't linked to being right or left wing. Let's be honest, wizards seem socially authoritarian, and economically right wing.

Why are some people libertarian? Because the idea of freedom and private property is important to them. For example, Americans are generally more libertarian than Brits - the strong belief in private property, right to privacy, right to carry guns in order to oppose the government if necessary? Yet we are happy with banned guns, constant legal surveillance and here in Scotland there are literally no trespass laws in rural areas.
