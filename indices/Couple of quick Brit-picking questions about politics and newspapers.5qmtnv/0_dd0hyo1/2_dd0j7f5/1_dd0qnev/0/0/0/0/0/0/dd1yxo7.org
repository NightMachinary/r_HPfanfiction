He was right of centre, although not a patch on right wing in America. he was an strong anti-communist, and initially believed strongly in free market, although gave that up (obviously) during WWII. He demonised the communist jew, and created an opposing ideology - fascism. His ideas definitely changed over time, and socially he was complex - liberal to Germans but anti-liberal to anyone else. Placing him as mildly right wing and strongly authoritarian is pretty accurate.

You've totally got your ideas mixed up here. You're not describing left and right politics at all. As I said, you can be left and libertarian as much as right and authoritarian - look at the UK right now, where the Tories want to dismantle the NHS and the welfare state and are pro-capitalism and trickle-down economics, but have introduced some of the world's tightest security controls whereby the government can legally store and access ALL citizens' phone and internet use. It's right wing economics but totally pro-security and anti-privacy - right wing authoritarian. then look at left wing economics and libertarianism - generally known as anarchy, the political state not chaos!

You're right, compromise between either end of each scale exists, but the two scales are not linked. That's where you've crossed your wires totally.
