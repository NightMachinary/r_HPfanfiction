You've been saying that, but applying it to right and left wing spectrum, not authoritarian to libertarian. That has been my point - left and right has nothing to do with the freedom to security scale.

I completely understand you feeling like that - I've read a bit about social anarchism/left libertarianism, eg Rothbard and Hess, and it's an interesting idea - that all natural resources are owned by the collective and shared equally, but that we become stateless and ruled entirely by private judgement, with organisation done by voluntary committee. Proudhon talks about 'property as liberty' and how private property is what keeps us free of the state and able to use our own judgement. It's interesting - I don't personally think it would ever work, my own left wing views are mildly authoritarian, however the position definitely exists, and much more so in America where libertarianism is almost constitutional than here in the UK, where we're used to ancient totalitarianism!
