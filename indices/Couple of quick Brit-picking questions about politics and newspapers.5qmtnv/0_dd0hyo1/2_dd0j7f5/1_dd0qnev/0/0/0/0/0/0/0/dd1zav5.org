If you look back I've said all along they don't line up. I think it was in the first post I made. I have said they aren't the same axis but one often impinges on the other.

With regards to the authoritarian stuff the question is why. Like Armys as an idea are they there to keep you safe or to protect your freedom or in this case are they the same thing. Times like this they serve the same purpose. Its a compromise put together due to the screwy situation the world is in right now. In an ideal world nobody would have armies but this isn't an ideal world at all.
