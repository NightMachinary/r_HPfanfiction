Hitler was never right wing economically. He had huge public work schemes like the autobahns run by the government which by all accounts is economically left. The scales tell you where your ideas fit in with the rest of the world but why do you believe that, where do those beliefs come from? If you pull back layer after layer of where your own beliefs come from you have you have a starting point, a point where you just believe it to be so. Like imagine toddler asking why, each time you get a bit further along until you reach a point where you say because it is. Now politically most people reach that point where they believe either everyone should be free to live their lives or they should be safe and never have to worry. That's just what they believe, now reading and understanding economics and the like give ideas and policies, compromises and such but these are built from their conviction. They aren't mutually exclusive at all but as you move from ideal worlds to the real you have to compromise. Can you have a free economy or does it need some framework and monitoring? Can people be safe without a safety net or welfare if things go wrong. Ask yourself how big of a mistake is a person allowed to make? If somebody invests all his savings into a bakery which goes bust because the other bakery in town is good friends with the miller so gets ingredients cheaper and therefore everyone goes to it what happens? The man now has no money and no form of income, should he be let to rue his mistakes, should he be helped to scrape by on a miserable existence until he finds more work, should he be comfortable or maybe live in conditions equal to the average living conditions of the country? If you want him looked after the money has to come from somewhere which means taking it from someone else, the mans mistakes cost everyone. You are restricting what they can spend their money on because you're taking it for the failed baker to live on. Does that affect how comfortable he should be? Do you interfere with the laws and subsidise the bakery so it never fails, where does that come from. To provide security you compromise freedom and vice versa. Right wing economics is based around freedom and the ability to fail. Left is built around support and security where nothing should go wrong because its monitored. Government interference is against a true free market and it tries to provide security for those who use it. Neither would function without compromising towards the other.
