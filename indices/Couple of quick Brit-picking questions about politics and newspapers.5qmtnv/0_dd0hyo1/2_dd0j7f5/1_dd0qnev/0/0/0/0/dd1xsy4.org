The core ideas... like economic or social values? Then they fit right into the scale. And as it shows, you can be economically left wing and authoritarian like Stalin, or right wing and authoritarian like Hitler, or you can be left wing and libertarian like Gandhi, or right wing and libertarian like Ayn Rand. Left and right don't link to social values at all. I don't see how you can claim there's a cause that means suddenly the freedom v safety debate becomes an economic issue. It has nothing to do with left and right politics.
