No, you've got it a bit mixed up. left wing and right wing in actuality refers purely to economics, whilst authoritarian to libertarian refers to social issues and state control by government. there's a good diagram here that explains it in quadrants: [[http://commentsfromleftfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-27-at-10.50.25-PM.png]]

and their web page here explains it pretty well: [[https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2]]

In the UK, Both our main parties are authoritarian - the Tories to the right and labour to the left. In the US, both are more libertarian, but actually both right of centre. And the Russians are very left and very authoritarian. For example.
