It has everything to do with it. It is the fundamental belief that all other ideas are drawn from. They don't oppose each other which is why right vs left is so hard to define. If you take it to the extreme the true hard right is Laisse-faire where by you can do whatever you want so long as doing so doesn't bother anyone else. The idea of safety and security lends itself to the idea of looking after each other, its a question of what are you willing to compromise on. Privacy vs security etc, human beings can never operate in a system where they have to work together because at our core we're all different.

Left Libertarian to me says you're fine with privacy over security but would be willing to compromise on your right to spend your own money, i.e more tax and welfare. Having someone spending your money to help people instead of spending on whatever you want and if that is charity and others so be it? I'm not saying either side is correct but there reaches a point for each person, something personal, an almost inexpiable point where they have a priority that takes precedence over everything else. For a society that has safety for everyone then their freedom has to be compromised, the way they live their lives has to have some person or government that imposes the safety net/welfare that looks after those in need. If you take safety and compromise to give more freedom you'll find the modern labour party. Do it from freedom and you'll find Thatcher's torries.
