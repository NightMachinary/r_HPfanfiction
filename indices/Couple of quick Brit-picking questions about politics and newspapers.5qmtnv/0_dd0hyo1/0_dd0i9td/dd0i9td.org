That matches most of what I was thinking. I was leaning Labour for Snape, mostly in a "I hate them all, but I hate these guys the least" way. I figure his dad probably got fucked over by Thatcher's union laws, which made their home life worse, and despite Snape's general anti-Muggle attitudes he probably hates some more than others, and would be pro-Labour just because of how difficult the Toris made his childhood.

Also: Top Gear is indicative of our politics? I had no idea.
