Yeah that would make perfect sense to me.

In the UK Top Gear (and Jeremy clarkson) has a stereotype of appealing to right-wing people due to it's sometimes offensive humour and emphasis on over priced cars. This is not always the case - I like earlier top gear seasons and I am left wing - but it's a short cut to saying someone is like Jeremy clarkson basically. Rowling said that Vernon loved top gear in response to people demanding that they bring back clarkson despite him, you know, assaulting someone.
