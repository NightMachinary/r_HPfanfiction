I appreciate that, but my experience in the north east, even in so-called Labour safe seats, is that there are a lot of people there who, even if they don't vote Tory, continue to blame the unions. I was rather horrified to work with the daughter of a miner who admired Thatcher. The Scottish are clearly more principled, and good on them.

I get that a few people voted Lib Dem in the 90s, but as far as I'm aware they only got something like 20% of the vote share. The race was always between Labour and Conservative in the rest of the UK, which is where the characters OP is talking about lived.
