Oh I appreciate that the political scene is totally different south of the border, but I was just clarifying - especially as, ultimately, a huge part of the Labour heartlands was Scotland at the time. They lost 40 seats in Scotland at the last election - and the last time Labour had fewer than 40 seats in Scotland was the early 60's.

Scotland sent 9/10 Dem seats to Westminster every year since the early 80's, too - they took over from the 10 or so seats that used to be Tory up here. There hasn't been more than 1 Tory seats since the '92 election - we really haven't forgiven them.

Yes, I understand that this might not be directly relevant to Snape, but it's worth being aware that not all Labour heartlands are the same, and not everywhere is it between Labour and Tories - even in the 90's.
