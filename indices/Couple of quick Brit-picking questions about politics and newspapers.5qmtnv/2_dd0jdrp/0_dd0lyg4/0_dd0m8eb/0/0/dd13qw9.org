You're missing the point. In Britain and possibly else where no matter what promises the politicians make certain voters are so tribal its stupid. People in the North often will NEVER vote for the conservatives because of things done over 3 decades ago. Simply because the torries are the torries they won't vote for them no matter what. That's silly, Trump being a nutter and having nutters vote for him doesn't mean there wasn't some republicans going to vote for him simply because he was the republican candidate regardless of policies.
