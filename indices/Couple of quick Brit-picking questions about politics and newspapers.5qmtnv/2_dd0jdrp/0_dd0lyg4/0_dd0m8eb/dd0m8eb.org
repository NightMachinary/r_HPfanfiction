I don't think you need to put torries in there. People vote more for labour because they feel they should. Education teaches torries are bad and labour is for the poor.

Remember you can never argue with an idiot because they are unwilling to accept they might be wrong. Policies only matter to those wise enough to be willing to change their mind.
