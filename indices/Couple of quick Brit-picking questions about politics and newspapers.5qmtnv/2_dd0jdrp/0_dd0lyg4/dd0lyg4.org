The thing about voting Tory in the UK is that for some, it's more about the prestige of pretending you're not poor. My grandma for instance would always say she vote Tory, because she prided herself of being above needing any help, which is what labour represented. Even though she was fucked over time and time again by the actual policies they implemented. I imagine Vernon would be much the same, voting Tory just because he's not part of the "riff raff". I doubt he'd actually look at policy.
