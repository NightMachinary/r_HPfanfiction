In the 90s in Britain it was strange John Major was thought of as rather weak and the whole no referendum on Maastricht thing. In 97 came new labour, now the series normally ends around then but they got a landslide win due to the charisma of Blair compared to Major. They had been growing support for years, how? New Labour could be the fhought of as the first modern political parties that put votes over policies, they offered what the most people wanted. An example was a leaked memo where the New Labour lot were told to support football teams because that's what the 'little people' do. The question then is would they appeal more to Vernon than a weak leader?
