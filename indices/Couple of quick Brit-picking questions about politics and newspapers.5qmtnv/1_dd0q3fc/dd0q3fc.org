Lupin might also read The Times and possibly a LIb Dem voter, if he wanted to be on the voter's roll. If he wants to lay low, he might not register.

The Dursleys are Daily Mail through and through and Tory voters. They would have voted for Maggie and reluctantly voted for Major, probably on the basis that they couldnt bring themselves to vote for Kinnock. I can't see Snape being bothered by Muggle politics or even reading a paper.

It would be interesting to look at their viewing choices and how they reflect their views.
