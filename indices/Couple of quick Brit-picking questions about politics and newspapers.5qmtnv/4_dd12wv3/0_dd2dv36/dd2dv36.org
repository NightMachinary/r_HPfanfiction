I appreciate your input and agree with you mostly (I think Remus would at least consider working in the Muggle world even if he didn't live there entirely), but it wouldn't work for this particular fic. I need him there for the plot.

But I definitely agree it'd be good to see happy-as-a-werewolf Remus wrangling dangerous creatures. I'm not sure I could do it justice, but who knows, maybe in future I'll give it a go.
