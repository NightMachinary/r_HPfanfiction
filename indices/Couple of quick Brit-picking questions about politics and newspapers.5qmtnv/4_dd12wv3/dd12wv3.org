Brit here. Here's a general comment you didn't ask for.

Remus would not work in the Muggle world. Very, VERY few magical people would. They are "in" on the secret. If you have to work with strangers who know nothing of magic then you are /pretending/ to be someone else around them. Having to live a lie would grate against any person and become intolerable.

J.K. Rowling's world building gives you a lot of leeway in determining magical careers. What we do know is that Werewolves are effectively lepers and not trusted in Magical society.

But Remus was also a very intelligent and knowledgeable enough to teach at a premier magical school. His temperament endeared students to him, he seemed to know a lot about magical creatures; I think the likely job he would find is something to do with magical creatures. Perhaps care of them or study of them. We know bugger all about adult life in JKR's world. I imagine you could write a very decent story following Remus as he's used by people to capture or care for dangerous animals. I assume his werewolf side allows him to heal quicker and lends his body a robustness and preternatural strength.

If anyone could write a story about Remus learning to live with lycanthropy and just straight-up owning it I would be so happy.
