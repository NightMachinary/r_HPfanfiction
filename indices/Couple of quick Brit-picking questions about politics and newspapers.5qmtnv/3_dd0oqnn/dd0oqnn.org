I reckon, based on what we can see of him in canon, Vernon would be Conservative, leaning towards UKIP, staunchly anti Europe/pro Brexit whereas Petunia would be a Conservative leaning to New Labour, a so called Worcester Woman.

I think Remus, depending on where he lived, may have read one of the regional newspapers when it came to applying for jobs, such as the Express and Star, a regional paper covering Shropshire, parts of Worcestershire and the whole of the Black Country.
