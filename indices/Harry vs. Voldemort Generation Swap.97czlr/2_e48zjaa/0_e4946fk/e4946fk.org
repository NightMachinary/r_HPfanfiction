Yeah, that was what I was going for! Harry's win in canon was pretty much blind luck. I know that was the point, but a more balanced battle between the two would be fun to see.

And for older Harry to have grown up while Grindelwald was in power (not old enough to be part of the battle, but old enough to remember) and then see history starting to repeat itself would lend itself for some really good introspection and character moments, I think.
