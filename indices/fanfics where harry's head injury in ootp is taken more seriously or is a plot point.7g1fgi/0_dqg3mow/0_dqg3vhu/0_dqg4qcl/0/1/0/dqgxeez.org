1. Longevity has nothing to do with toughness, not in biology for certain, and I don't recall any evidence for that in magical species

2. I don't recall this, what is the source? In real life biology, resistance to toxins and poisons, even diseases, does not bestow resistance to physical damage, but with the magical world, who knows? Seems like it could go either way.

3. I don't see this as relevant, many would describe boxing as a violent and dangerous sport even though they use safety methods to minimize the chance of death. Wizards can survive direct contact with bludgers because they're supernaturally tough or the bludgers are charmed, but that doesn't mean Quidditch still isn't dangerous and bloody.

4. I don't think this supports either option. Harry thought the bludger was trying to kill him, but Dobby didn't want to kill Harry, so perhaps Dobby knew the bludger couldn't kill him because of a charm. Or, as you proposed, he knows wizards are tough enough to likely survive it. Or Dobby doesn't know anything about Quidditch and bludgers.
