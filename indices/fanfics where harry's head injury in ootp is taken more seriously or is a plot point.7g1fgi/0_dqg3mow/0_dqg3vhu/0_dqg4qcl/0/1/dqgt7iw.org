I feel the opposite in terms of likeliness, given:

1. Wizards live much longer than Muggles.

2. Wizards can shrug off Muggle poisons.

3. Quidditch is noted to be a violent and dangerous sport.

4. A bludger being dangerous was a plot point in one of the books.

These, in combination with my argument above, seems to me to heavily suggest the first of your two explanations: that the possession of magic gives wizards superior resistance to physical injury (this being a separate issue to the also very useful ability of healing magic to repair injuries that are sustained), and not the latter (that Quidditch is played with Holodeck Safety Protocols engaged).
