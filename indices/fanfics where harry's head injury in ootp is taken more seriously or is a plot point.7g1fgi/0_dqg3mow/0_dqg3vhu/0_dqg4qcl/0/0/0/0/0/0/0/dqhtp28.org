While on magic broomsticks that travel at over twice that speed. And anyway, I find it more impressive that humans are able to routinely hit small objects traveling over 100 mph with a stick (baseball).

That's perception, not reflexes.

150 mph was a firebolt's max speed, it didn't hover at 150mph, seekers wouldn't always be going that fast. And we're told in canon it usually takes hours and sometimes takes days to find the snitch, so not sure how impressive that is. Presumably the snitch doesn't leave the quidditch field, so that's a small area, and it travels more slowly than brooms.

Without knowing the actual speed of spells, this doesn't say much. Humans have demonstrated the ability to pluck arrows out of the air, that seems pretty impressive too.

Also, I don't recall many (or any?) spells actually being dodged in canon. I remember Harry diving behind a gravestone in Goblet of Fire, but Harry didn't actually dodge the spell, it just struck the physical object he had taken cover behind, and he started moving before the spell had been completed.
