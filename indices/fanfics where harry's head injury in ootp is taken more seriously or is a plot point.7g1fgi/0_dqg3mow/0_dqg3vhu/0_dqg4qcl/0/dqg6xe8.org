  They hit with enough force to break an arm at least.

If they are charmed, presumably there is no reason they couldn't be charmed to strike a head with less force than an arm.

  Also the whole point of bludgers is that they hit things with force.

The point of boxing is to hit the other guy as hard as you can, but boxers still wear padded gloves and other protective gear to minimize the risk that someone dies.

We have presented two possible explanations for Harry not dying from that bludger.

1. Wizards possess some form of supernatural durability or damage resistance - at least for their head - that goes unmentioned throughout the rest of the series or
2. Hogwarts bludgers are charmed to never strike with enough force to kill, just as they are charmed to chase targets

It seems to me that #2 is more likely given the numerous magical objects we have seen, although I certainly have no issues with #1 (especially in fanfiction) since it doesn't directly contradict canon. And if one counts the movies, Newt giving a muggle a helmet while not wearing one himself might support it, although maybe Newt was just going to rely on the Shield Charm and other spells.
