Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and assume there's a magical element in the bludgers on the bats. Or JKR just didn't do her physics right.

Because generating enough torque with one hand and a small bat to force a dense iron ball into speeds over 100 mph to hit other objects moving at speeds over 100 mph all while balancing hundred feet in the sky on a broom? That's peak athleticism combined with beyond human hand-eye coordination and timing. Sort of like beaming onto the Enterprise while she's moving at warp speed.
