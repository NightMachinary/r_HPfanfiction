I think this is a good idea! Perhaps Orion gets into a situation where he has to be a double agent, and Snape coaches him. Since he's Regulus's and Severa's son he has sneakiness in his genes.Also, are you sure you want the mother to be named Severa when Snape is Severus? lol.

Or, creepily, maybe Orion visits the Inferi cave and sees his father in the water.
