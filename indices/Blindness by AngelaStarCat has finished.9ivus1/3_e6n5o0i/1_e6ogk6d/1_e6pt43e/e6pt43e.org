Dr. Manhattan went through a nihilistic period in the graphic novel as well. I definitely recommend reading it at some point, because the arc of his epiphany on Mars is amazing. There's a lot of symbolism and connections that didn't make it into the movie.

I'm a bit surprised that you would compare Harry to Dr. Manhattan, though. Rather than feeling disconnected from humanity and caring too little, Harry's problem during the final three chapters seems to be that he cares too deeply.
