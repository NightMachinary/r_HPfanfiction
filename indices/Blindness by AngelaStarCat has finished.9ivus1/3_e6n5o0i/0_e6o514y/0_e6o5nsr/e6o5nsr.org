Oh, I'm in complete agreement that it was an intentional narrative decision (for the less human bit, at any rate) it's explicitly stated at the end that Harry doesn't believe himself to be human, after all, and I'd argue that his path to dehumanization became somewhat apparent once it was revealed he no longer needed to eat. I'm just saying it made the story very slightly less enjoyable for me, as I preferred it the earlier chapters when his abilities could be explained through his unique perspective into magic and it's workings.

As I said in my post I find Angela's exploration of the hallows to be incredibly fascinating and by far the most unique approach I've come across in the fandom yet. I thoroughly enjoyed all the creative lore Angela introduced or expanded on. I just found the narrative prior to the introduction of the hallows and their merging with Harry a bit more endearing.
