I've been a massive fan of the premise and the execution of how Angela handled the disability/ability she gave Harry. The way she conveyed his "sight" was incredibly novel and interesting to read. The H/Hr relationship had a nice, slow build up and felt genuine. The exploration as to the nature of the Hallows was also very unique and intriguing to ponder.

Though I have to agree that the story did seem to get away from itself after a while. I'm not adverse to powerful!Harry fics, and I believe that at first this fic handled that quite well, but after a while Harry became less and less human and sympathetic, which, while it ultimately makes perfect sense and even seems fitting and logical given the progression of the nature of his abilities and the depths they go to, in the end made the story a bit harder to enjoy. Thankfully Angela still left plenty of humanity in his behavior by the end, particularly in regards to his interactions with Hermione, but I'll admit I was put off by the borderline nihilistic sentiments Harry was beginning to express.

The author's note at the end made it clear that Angela's had a very, very rough time and I'm sure that impacted the story to some degree. So rather than simply whine about the tonal shift or the somewhat unsatisfying ending (though she did express a possibility of more in the future if she feels like it) I'll say thank you, AngelaStarCat, for an amazing read and for taking up your very limited time to share with us so utterly unique and wondrous a story!
