Sad to see a story that started out with such optimistic and utopian leanings end on such a note. The story I fell in love with was about Harry and Hermione's struggle in reuniting the magic and mundane world. Sure Harry can kill with a look and Voldy becomes a non-issue very quickly, but trying to change the world would have taken a different type of power. That's the story I signed up for.

But it's clear from the authors note that Angelastarcat isn't in the right space to write something like that. Its left me with the same type of disappointment that For Love Of Magic did. I think I would rather both of those fics go unfinished that have the rushed, depressive endings we got.
