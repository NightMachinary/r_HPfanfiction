Be honest about it, but explain your reasons. Just saying "You write shit, I'm outta here!" won't do any good, but something like "I really don't think that a Harry/Giant Squid/Basilisk soul-bond fic can be done well due to X, Y and Z. X is especially problematic because of Q." would work well to get your point across.

If the author then says that he believes that an m/m/m/m/squid gangbang can save his concept, tell them that you will no longer assist them in this venture. But maybe they will see your side of the issue and make changes. Or you might end up killing the story, which is what I have accidentally done to "Castles in the Sky" when I pointed out that no one would be interested in 50k words of training montage with just Harry in isolation.
