I've had this problem lots of times before. In the end, this is how I learnt to deal with it:

- Not your story, not your problem. You can help, but you shouldn't be rewriting stuff. You'll never get it Perfect, you just improve it a bit at a time and they learn

- Explain why you are making changes. I often write little grammar lessons and link to sources about writing.

- Be encouraging but honest. People see through false compliments but there is usually something you can find, and as things improve you praise their effort and progress.

- If all else fails, pretend you got a new job and don't have time anymore.
