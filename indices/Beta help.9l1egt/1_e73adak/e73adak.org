If I were the person I think I would appreciate you discussing it with me. Don't go straight in and change it, but ask questions to get them to consider it for themselves. As colespot has said say what you can where possible, but I think a gentle discussion to try and help them see the flaws in the narrative, style and so on would be a good way to go.
