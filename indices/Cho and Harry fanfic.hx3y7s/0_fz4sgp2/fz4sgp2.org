Over on [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]], you can find:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/No_Good_Deed/No_Good_Deed/][No Good Deed]], a one-shot by Jeconais. He also has another one-shot, All Night Long, which is not what you're looking for, but does have Harry and Cho as main characters.

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] and its sequel, [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Midnight_Duel_Midday_Love/index/][Midnight Duel, Midday Love]], by Draco664. Both multi-chapter stories. You may need a site login, or maybe just click on a link to say that you're ok with stories rated 'Mature.'

The only story on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] that I've read that has Harry and Cho as main characters is a one-shot in which Harry is talking to Cho about how things went wrong.
