I find AO3 absolutely not easy to navigate but the opposite.\\
Without a recommendation here I wouldn't find anything on AO3 and the tag system is broken. Some stories have more tags than info what the story is about. FFN didn't invent the wheel either with their search, but at least it works.\\
Yes, I also noticed the changes that you can no longer switch to desktop mode and find it annoying. Let's hope they don't shot the databases with the changes.
