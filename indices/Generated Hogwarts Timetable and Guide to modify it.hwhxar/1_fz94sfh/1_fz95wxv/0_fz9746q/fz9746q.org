I'll give it a try hahaha. For a routine, lessons are usually set out with 6 periods in the day, and depending on the school, starts around 9 and ends around 3:30, but private schools (which I imagine Hogwarts to be like, being a boarding school) mostly end at 4. Days are: form time (at Hogs probably just breakfast and getting ready) until 8:55/9, 2 periods, then break (15 minutes, more if longer school days), then another 2 periods, then lunch (most have 1 hr, again more if longer school days), then last 2 periods. But it is different as Hogs only has 8 core lessons, whereas we have 8-12 until GCSE years.
