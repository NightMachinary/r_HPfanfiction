So there should be less classes? Could you modify my tables on the concept page and show it to me? I'm talking about the second wide table down. The first one is the known lesson counts from canon and I tried to fill in the gaps. Could you also suggest a daily routine, when should the lessons start? I know that in 5th year there were 4 periods in the morning and 3 afternoon. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year]]
