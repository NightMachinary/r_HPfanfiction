  I will also say that this bit:

  #+begin_quote
    The 6th and 7th years have the same classes as there weren't any houses
  #+end_quote

  was actually a feature in my original document, so this isn't actually a difference.
#+end_quote

Sorry about that, I will delete that part.

#+begin_quote
  I don't like having time-turners be required for some schedules for some students, as it screws over students that wouldn't be given a time-turner and therefore are limited in their electives.
#+end_quote

My idea was, that in third years students choose at least two electives. After that, they pair the electives together in that year, that everybody can attend them. I assume, that most students don't take more electives than 2, and almost noone takes more than 3. The few exceptional students, like Hermione, can get a timeturner. I also assume, that there are "trending" elective pairs to take, so most of the time the new students take those and there isn't any problem. The teachers can also promote those pairs, e.g. Arithmancy - Divination as both can predict the future.

  Also, I noticed that some classes have more class time (more periods) dedicated to them than others do, and it varies by year.
#+end_quote

Yes, I tried to be as close as possible to canon, and it's like that. I collected the known classes in a table on the 'Concept' sheet, than expanded the numbers next to it in another table to fill up the holes. Maybe a few more lessons still can be added to it, for example some muggle studies lessons.

  Plus Arithmancy is by default paired with Runes, but there are also standalone Arthimancy classes but none for Runes.
#+end_quote

Arithmancy is paired with Muggle Studies in Elective 1. But even if they were grouped together they not forced to occupy the same timeslot. It's just allowed. They can overlap, but it's not necessary. The number of lessons per week is fixed though.

Thanks fir the review!
