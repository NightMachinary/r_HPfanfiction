[[/u/LittleDinghy][u/LittleDinghy]] here. Fantastic job. I fully realize and accept the many shortcomings of my original post but have not had the time to really dive back into it and fix/address it, and I whole-heartedly appreciate this.

I don't like having time-turners be required for some schedules for some students, as it screws over students that wouldn't be given a time-turner and therefore are limited in their electives. If you remember, Hermione only got the time-turner because she was such an exceptional student. That said, it's a minor quibble.

I will also say that this bit:

#+begin_quote
  The 6th and 7th years have the same classes as there weren't any houses
#+end_quote

was actually a feature in my original document, so this isn't actually a difference.

Also, I noticed that some classes have more class time (more periods) dedicated to them than others do, and it varies by year. For example, third years have four periods dedicated to CoMC, but fourth years only have three. Plus Arithmancy is by default paired with Runes, but there are also standalone Arthimancy classes but none for Runes.

I will definitely look into this further and use it in place of my own for most things. After all, mine was very flawed.
