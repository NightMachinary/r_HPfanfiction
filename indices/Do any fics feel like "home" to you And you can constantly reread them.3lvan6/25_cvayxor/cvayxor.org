Great question! Glad you asked.

/Alexandra Quick/ does. I have to take a few months in between each reread, but I can find new little things each time I read, and make connections between things that I hadn't noticed before. The way Inverarity creates the world of Magical America is so incredibly detailed and feels so authentic that everything else is really just extra (even including the astoundingly well-crafted plotlines and storytelling, and the spectacular character development).

It may be the only reason I'm "proud to be an American", because I feel "at home" reading it, and I get all the cultural things and the expressions and the realistic portrayals of Midwestern life, even though I instinctively feel revulsed by most blatant patriotism.

It /is/ getting almost excruciating waiting for AQATWA, though. I think I'll get back to writing my continuation fic.
