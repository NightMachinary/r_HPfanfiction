I love Captain Jack from Torchwood. He makes me feel safe and confident and just a little bit daring. And when the whole team gets de-aged (yes, I know those are usually stupid) and sent to Hogwarts, well, I just love linkffn(The Magic of Torchwood). Not finished, but I still re-read it every once in a while.

Also love and re-read Nightmares of Futures Past, though its incompletion depresses me.
