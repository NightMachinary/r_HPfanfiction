I don't read it a lot, because it's a one-shot and I don't want to inadvertently memorize it, but every time I get back into fanfiction (it happens every couple of years) I come back to linkffn(A Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl), which is kind of my platonic ideal H/Hr fic---warm and funny and quiet in a way I always hope for when I open a new one, in spite of how rarely I see it.
