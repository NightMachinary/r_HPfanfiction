So you guys might have seen me post [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=157356][Harry Potter and the Four Heirs]] more than a couple of times before.

It's hilariously terrible, but the reason why I keep going back is because of the nostalgia. Not just because of what the fandom was a decade ago, but because of who, where and why I was at that time. All I had to worry about back then was not being caught asleep in Statistics class. Now, among other things, I've got to worry about paying the rent and having a life at the same time.

In fact, that site in general is good at taking me back. That and Portkey.org. (No longer a shipper tho)
