Whenever I feel like the quality of the remaining Marauder era stories that I haven't read is too bad for me, I always go back to The Life and Times. I think I've read it over twenty times now and I still enjoy it. Unfortunately, life has gotten busier for her and she's on a bit of a hiatus. She says she's still working on it, but intermittently when she can.

Edit: I also go back to the Lie I've Lived occassionally because the way Harry is in that story is basically how I picture James actually being, not the horrible way he is written in a lot of fics where he's constantly thinking about Lily and whining about why she won't look at him. He's a sixteen year old boy from a very wealthy family. I think he would be a bit of a flirt with a lot of girls and not constantly thinking about the one girl.
