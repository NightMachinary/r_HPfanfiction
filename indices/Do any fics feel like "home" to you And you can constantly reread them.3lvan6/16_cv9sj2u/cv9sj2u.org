Like you, I have anxiety as well, and getting away to an easy fictional world is so helpful.

Sunset and Sunrise Over Britain by bobmin at fanficauthors.net.

Hope and White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais

A few fics by Bedelia that I grabbed off the net before she removed them for editing and then lost them

Linkffn(Came Out of the Darkness)

But the fic I reread the most is The Lioness Prophecies, a 7th year Snape/Hermione fic. It's been removed from the net but I have an epub copy of it. I reread it at least once a year. It's seriously so good and so relaxing.
