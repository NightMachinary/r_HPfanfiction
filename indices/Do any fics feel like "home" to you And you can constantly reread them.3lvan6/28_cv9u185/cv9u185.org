Oh lord, yes. Many, many, many. I keep a list of favorites and try not to look at any of them late in the evening, because chances are I'll be up half the night on an addictive reading marathon, cocooned in good memories. The majority of favorites probably date from my early years in HP, when I first tripped over the concept of a(n) OTP and fell headfirst into Snape/Harry fandom, where I have remained ever since.

There are also certain authors who embody everything I love about fanfiction, and I return to their works again and again. I often wallow in stories not just for themselves but for the particular skill and voice of the author; some writers push every button I have. They can do things with words that take my breath away.

I should point out that many of my favorite fics provide pleasure and reassurance even though the stories themselves are anything but cozy or comforting, and some are downright painful. Maybe it's the catharsis. Or maybe I'm just a hurt/comfort junkie and enjoy a bit of transgressiveness and ambiguity even in my comfort reading.
