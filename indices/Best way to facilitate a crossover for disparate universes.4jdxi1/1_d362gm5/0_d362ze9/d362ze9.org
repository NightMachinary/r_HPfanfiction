I've done that once or twice in some story ideas. My 2nd year Harry in Wonderland just had Harry awakened by Alice landing on him during her fall after he was knocked out by his running into the platform wall. Never got much farther than that though.

I'm working on an original series that crosses over exported parody characters from How to Train Your Dragon, Harry Potter, Dazzler, Punisher, Buffy, and about a dozen more literary series with the characters all going to one high school. I'm still debating if I explain why all these characters are going to a high school together or just take a refuge in audacity.
