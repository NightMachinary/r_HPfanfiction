You could simply be brazen enough to offer no explanation whatsoever. In the only crossover I've written, the HP characters we know and love were transplanted to universe it was being crossed with (they were born there, grew up there, and will stay there), and I've basically been cultivating a standalone story that essentially boils down to "HP in another world". No explanation needed whatsoever.

You may lose some readers for it, but a few will appreciate the move for the sheer chutzpah it requires.
