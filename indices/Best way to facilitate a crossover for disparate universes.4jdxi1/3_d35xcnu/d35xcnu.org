It really depends on the other universe.

I think some crossover writers bend over backwards to build in a veil or an trip to an alternate universe using ancient magic when really all you need to do is say, "yes, these things exist in the same universe."

Like Harry doesn't have to time travel to live in a world where Marvel characters exist.
