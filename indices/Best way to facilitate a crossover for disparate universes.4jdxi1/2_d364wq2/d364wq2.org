Really, the best way to get a crossover going is whatever is briefest.

No one much cares how your characters got into the wrong universe, and unless you have some grand ideas for tying them together, it's best to simply get it over and done with as quickly as possible. There are far too many crossovers that waste multiple chapters on the story of how Harry (or whoever) came to fall through the veil of death (or whatever).

For that reason, if you can get away with it, you should skip the crossover mechanic completely. Mention it later, if you don't want to feel like you're ignoring it. At least, that's my preference when reading. I usually end up simply skipping the first chapter of every crossover (time travel fics are the same).
