The hard way of time travel for Harry into the Star Wars universe was done in linkffn(Shiver Me Timbers! by Wolfd890) which I thought was pretty good since most HP/SW stories are portals through time, concurrent, or universes connected by the veil.

I do like the idea of having both universes be happening next to each other as a branch due to a decision that was done differently. It reminds me of my old world stepper story idea where my five-man band would get blown from universe to universe as they tried to catch a criminal who was causing issues in each universe to facilitae a new one where his SO didn't die by his own hand.
