Steelbadger's LoTR fics? Yeah those are awesome. S/he usually pops in and out from time to time.

I'm assuming the first ME fic is Getting too old for this? It's a humor fic. It is kind of cracky too. Would suggest Harry Potter: Geth if you're looking for action.

You havent touched Asoiaf crossovers? Those are awesome. The prime examples are Wizard of Harrenhall, The Black Prince, and The Difference One Man Can Make. The first and last one are base and lore building with Harry [[/spoiler][wasn't sure how he got there for the first one and a spell mishap in the field for the latter]]. The second one is a reincarnated Harry.
