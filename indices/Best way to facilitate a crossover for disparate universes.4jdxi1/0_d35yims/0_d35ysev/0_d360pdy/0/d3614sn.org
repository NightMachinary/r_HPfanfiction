Yeah. The stories are good, I just couldn't remember the writer's name.

No, I don't know the ASoIaF/GoT universe so I don't read them. I tried to watch the series but was rather uninspired, couldn't finish the first episode. I like to know both universes as intimately as I can before reading them.

I tried HP: Geth but didn't really get into it. I liked the idea but I prefer human!harry series though I may try again someday. I do like cracky but Harry Stu on its own isn't funny to me, it's just lame.

Now a Harry-Stu in ME who constantly bumbles? That could be hilarious. When everything goes his way, it gets lame. Kinda like the freewritten [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/45/Harry-Potter-Drabbles][Harry-Stu]] I wrote for Legend of the Seeker. Too perfect of a character means the story is boring to me.

Which is why my Harry-Stu!Legend of the Seeker story won't ever be turned into a real story because there isn't any way for that Harry to be stopped by anyone in the Old or New World. Even their gods would fall before him.

I'd like to see a good Harry/Hermione[pref romantic but teasing!Platonic would be good] Warehouse 13 where they're the ones hired, not Myka and Pete.
