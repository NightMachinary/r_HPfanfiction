The fics I've mentioned from asoiaf only use the location. It is completely AU.

Some ME fics YMMV, I'll give you that. However, MoD!Harry's supposed to be more level headed if you're going for the asventurer!MoD or insane as per some crack fics.

Legend of the Seeker? Sorry haven't heard of it. Will google though. Same with Warehouse 13.

Anyways going back to topic, other than the ways mentioned, there are some crossovers that Potter was summoned (e.g Wizard Runemaster) from another world.

Or just say fuck it and do it like Harry Potter and the Technage; America has no statute because of Superheroes. Which leads me to another petpeeve. Marvel has too many crossovers with HP. I haven't seen any decent DC crossovers.
