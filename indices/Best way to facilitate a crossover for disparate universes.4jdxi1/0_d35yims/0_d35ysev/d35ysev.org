SG1s work for the reason you suggest.

Every Mass Effect crossover I've read was a terrible Harry Stu where Harry was to be the Human Spectre but didn't want to be it until Fem!Shepard shows up and he joins up to so he can save the day every time and she'll fall madly in love with him. #dreck

I usually avoid LotR because they're usually slash. I've read four or so that were awesome, two of those were the same author and one was comedy where horny!harry was a 12yo Elfling.
