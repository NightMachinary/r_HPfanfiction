I've seen SG1 crossovers seemlessly integrate the HP and their universes. I think the reason for that is its a secret government project and it's in 'murica.

Mass Effect crossovers play on the MoD!Harry very well. I love Madness effect [[/spoiler][where Harry is the epitomy of a quintesential Ravenclaw]].

There are some crossovers, some GoT and LoTR fics, are MoD!Harry that was reincarnated into the universe. These stories may or may not have their memories intact.

These are just a few that could seemlessly integrate the two universes of your prefered crossover.
