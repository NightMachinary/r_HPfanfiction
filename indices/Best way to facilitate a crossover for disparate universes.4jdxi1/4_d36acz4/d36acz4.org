Let's see...

For Star Trek I've used the events of Star Trek occurring in the same universe as the ones in HP - wizards a secret society on Earth, and there's a similar secret society on planets like Vulcan. As I recall, in the 'verse I made Cardassia wiped out their wizards, and there's different policy planet by planet.

Then there's use of various enchanted objects in conjunction with each other - I've used that in Grimmauld Place where there are a ton of potentially powerful objects that could act with or against each other to engineer an unexpected reaction.

There's the use of time travel - especially in fics involving universes like those of Black Sails or Pirates of the Caribbean - and then there's also the involvement of a higher power to cross 'verses over, which I think is generally a little uninteresting unless the powers involved are well-developed and interesting.

There's a lot of different ways to approach this sort of universe-hopping, but the way it's approached depends on how much effort you want to put into a cross-over and how separate you want to keep the initial worlds.
