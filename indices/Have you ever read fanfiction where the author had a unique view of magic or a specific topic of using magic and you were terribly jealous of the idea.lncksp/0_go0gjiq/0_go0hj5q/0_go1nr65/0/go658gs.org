There's a lot of immature writers writing fanfiction. By immature I mean not very skilled yet, it's not necessarily about age. Neil Gaiman said writing fanfiction was a good way to hone your craft and I think that's good advice. Inevitably though, it means there's going to be some not very good ones. It can be annoying as a reader but great for the writers to have this place to practise.
