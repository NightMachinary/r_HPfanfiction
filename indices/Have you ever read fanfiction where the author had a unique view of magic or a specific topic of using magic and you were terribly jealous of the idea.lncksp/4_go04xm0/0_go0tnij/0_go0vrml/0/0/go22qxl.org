Yeah that's Miranda Flairgold. She was on her third one and was going on a rainforest expedition and just vanished. It's probably more likely that she was kinda done, had an amazing time in the rainforest and decided not to do fanfic any more, but I've always wondered if she was really unfortunate and something happened to her.
