One of my favorites was a fic that linked virginity with magic in a non-ick kind of way. It had implications about how virginity had been used in the past to enslave witches, etc, but focused more on the witches of Hogwarts using their virginity with powerful, ancient magic spells to create a giant ward that protected the school from a Voldemort invasion.

It had its share of smut, and the key to the ward being permanent, of course, came from losing virginity, but it was just really a neat concept. It included goddesses chosen by the witches who also afforded them protections while their plans were in motion. But the catch there was the goddesses only came out once when called upon.

And the last thing that I thought was fascinating was how the writer wove in religion. In the story, Hermione was a Catholic who struggled with the ideals of purity and abstinence and got great comfort from a Sister of the church during the summer holidays. That turned into a very interesting plot point all its own that I loved! It didn't denigrate religious beliefs but somehow wove them into the story with some plausibility.
