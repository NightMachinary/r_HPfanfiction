Linkffn(11160991) has hands down the best system for divination in any fic I've ever read, where it's a full, perfectly legitimate field of study, but people gradually forgot that as they focused more and more on prophecy, which is its most enticing but also least reliable branch.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, while I don't recommend the fic itself, has a (mostly) incredible system for occlumency and legiligency that several other fics, most notably Ashes of Chaos, have just straight up stolen.
