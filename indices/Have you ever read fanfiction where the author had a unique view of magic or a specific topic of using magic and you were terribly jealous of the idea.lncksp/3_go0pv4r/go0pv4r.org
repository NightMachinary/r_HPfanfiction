There was one harem fic that had the coolest 'family magic' system, where Harry was like... experimenting with introducing new magical abilities into bloodlines or something? I can't remember, haven't read it in years and years. I always thought it was really creative and interesting. Can't imagine pulling something like that off myself, and haven't seen anyone do it well since.
