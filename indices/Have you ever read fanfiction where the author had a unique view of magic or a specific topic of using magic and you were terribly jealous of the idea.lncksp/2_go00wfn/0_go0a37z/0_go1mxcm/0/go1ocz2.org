But if you gave the credit I don't see a problem tho. For example, I really love the fanfic 'I'm still here' and stories based on it (by Kathryn518) and the stories based on it give her credit too. I actually first read a story based on it and that's a beautiful way to not only use ideas, but also make fanfiction authors more known and thus everyone wins. And it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission after all
