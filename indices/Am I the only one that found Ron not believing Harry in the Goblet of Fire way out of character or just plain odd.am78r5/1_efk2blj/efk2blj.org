Yeah I never really liked that. I mean come on Ron; you know that Voldemort and Death Eaters have been after Harry, ever since he defeated their precious master back then on that fateful October night; how is it so hard for you to believe that someone wouldn't try and get him into a tournament; that's so dangerous, that people could die from it?!

I love Ron as well; and feel like he's often under written, I just really dislike how Rowling wrote him in several different places, like he's someone who's into chess, he thinks ahead when he plays chess; you have too, in order to win; so why not use that to your advantage? Just feel like that was an unfortunate waste.

I love Rowling; but yeah, more than once I was disappointed by how she wrote something.
