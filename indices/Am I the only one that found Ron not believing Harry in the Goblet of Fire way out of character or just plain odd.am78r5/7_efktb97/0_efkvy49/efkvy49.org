This one I actually see as possible. Weirdly enough, this could happen from a combination of fear for his family (he might be jealous of them but the Weasley are a close knit family so he will worried), the stress and discomfort of being on the run (not being in a place that they are used to can stress the human body out a lot. Even vacations can cause it) and the heightened emotions, all of this multiplied by the locket and it's 'evil' aura led to Ron leaving. I was much more shocked that Hermione didn't also burst even if they portray her has have better control over her emotions.

I'm rambling and sleep deprived, in case something doesn't make sense.
