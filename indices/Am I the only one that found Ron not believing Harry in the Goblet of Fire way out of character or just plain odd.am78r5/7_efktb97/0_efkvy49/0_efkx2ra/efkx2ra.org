I did mention that it's entirely plausible. I just felt that plot point unnecessary and would've been better used if Hermione were to blow up. It would be so out of character for her and we would know vividly that it's the Horcrux 's doing.

It would also even the odds as both Hermione and Ron would've had their disagreements with Harry at least once. Harry already did with the both of them during OotP. This would've showed that all three of them are equal and necessary to each other.

And not to mention, reduce the Ron-bashing as Ron would've stood up for Harry.
