I actually didn't mind the disagreement Ron had with Harry in GoF. It was completely believable. OotP has him defending and backing up Harry which is awesome too.

It's in DH where I was annoyed, not with Ron, but JK's writing for having to create that fight because he's scared Harry and Hermione might get together. Don't get me wrong, it's entirely plausible, but I feel it was slightly unnecessary in the context of the story.

Hermione is always portrayed as being the ultimate loyal friend even in GoF. This would have been a perfect place for Hermione to get annoyed because of the Horcrux and maybe blow up at Harry while Ron tried to calm the situation. Hermione grew up with 3 full meals a day too and it would make sense that the Horcrux affected her badly. It would have cemented the fact that both Ron and Hermione are equally important to Harry despite their disagreements.
