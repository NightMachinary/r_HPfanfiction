One other thing- in the follow up to the fight, Ron's not joining in with the jeering. And Harry's always the one escalating the situation further- he literally snarls at Ron in the aftermath of the floo talk with Sirius and mocks Ron after throwing the badge at him. So even when there are potentially overtures from Ron to mend their relationship before the First Task, Harry's the one stomping them down.
