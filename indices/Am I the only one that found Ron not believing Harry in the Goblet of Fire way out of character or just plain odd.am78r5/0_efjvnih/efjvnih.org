I think we often forget that Harry was actually disappointed he couldn't enter. The movies had him say "rather you than me" but in the book he earnestly agrees with Ron that it would be cool to be a triwizard champion.

It's not so much jealousy of Harry being a champion, but that it was something they both wanted to do and it appears as though Harry found a loophole and didn't share it with him. Ron knows he will always be in Harry's shadow, just as he will always be in the shadow of his brothers. Like many arguments, it's about something much more.

Don't get me wrong, it's shitty. But he's an angry, 14 year old boy. Teenagers are not always the most patient, sensitive, self aware creatures.
