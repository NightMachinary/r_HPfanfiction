Take this combination of characteristics and you have Ron:

- He lives in the moment, enjoying the now. He doesn't think very deeply about the future.

- He forms opinions and sticks to them even if he forgets why he has those opinions.

- He's he's not afraid of pissing off people people with no authority or power over him.

This results in a guy who's fun to hang out with but is incredibly dense and prone to being butthurt over stupid shit.
