Nah...(Mo-)Ron was blinded by being a jealous little bitch!

Harsh? Maybe, I admit I don't like the character (IMHO he's useless! Good for comical relief only!)!

Seriously, Ron has the only thing Harry really wants:

A family with parents, maybe siblings (We don't really know if Harry would want any, but we know he wants his parents from the Mirror of Erised!), a home!

Ron who has all this however wants something else (without wanting to lift a finger to achieve it!):

Ron wants money, fame, recognition (He doesn't want to be "just another Weasley") - but sadly Mr. Ronald Billius Weasley doesn't even try to become something special! Hell, he doesn't even have a special skillset like his brother Charlie who is probably good with animals and Bill who probably is quite good at all things magic (he's a curse-breaker and learning how to crack a ward or a curse can't be all that easy!)
