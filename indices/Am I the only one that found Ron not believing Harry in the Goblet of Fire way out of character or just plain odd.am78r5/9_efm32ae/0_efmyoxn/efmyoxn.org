The guy who, on a broken leg, stood between Harry and the apparent mass murderer Sirius Black, is useless and good for comic relief only? That guy? Really?

And he did this at 13, showing much more bravery than many adults would in that situation.

Let's not forget 12-year-old Ron, the year prior, venturing into the Forbidden Forest with Harry to face his worst fear because he wanted to save his friends and the school. He knew they were going after spiders, he hates spiders, and they're all well aware of how dangerous the forest is, and Ron bloody well did it anyway.

Probably should've just stopped reading when you went to "Mo-Ron" tbh
