The adventuring and overshadowed by his siblings thing largely covers it, plus Harry, Ron, and basically everyone other than Hermione actually wanting to/being excited to enter the tournament before Halloween. Their disagreement lasts less than a month, he's 14, and he quickly comes around when he sees the danger firsthand. And canonically, Harry isn't the greatest friend and is partially responsible for the fight. We basically go through the series from his perspective, he doesn't really communicate well with others in general.

Remember that, from Ron's perspective, he doesn't know that this is a serious plot situation^{TM}

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."

At this point, Harry is already aware that something is going on with Voldemort from his visions AND that "Moody" thinks that the Goblet was hoodwinked in a murder attempt. Ron literally doesn't have that context, and Harry doesn't tell it to him, hence his heightened feelings of jealousy and betrayal.

And they even had an earlier conversation about how they might get their names in the Goblet.

  “Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,” Harry said. "I would've if it had been me ... wouldn't have wanted everyone watching.”

Then during their fight, Ron brings up exactly what Harry said earlier.

#+begin_quote
  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you.. . . I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

Harry's the one who's escalating the situation here. Obviously he's not fully responsible either- he's a panicked 14 year old, etc.- but Ron's reaction is far from unreasonable. Keep in mind that at the beginning of the fight, Ron is actively trying to fight down any jealousy and put up a positive front, trying to be happy for his friend.
