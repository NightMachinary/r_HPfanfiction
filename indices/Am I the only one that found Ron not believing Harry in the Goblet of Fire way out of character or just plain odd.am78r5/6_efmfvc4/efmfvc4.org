I had a random thought the other day that in hindsight the idea that Ron runs out on Harry twice feels a bit dated when it gets to DH so it would almost have more symmetry if Hermione was the one to walk out on Harry in GoF.

It could have worked too; Hermione is also conspicuously absent during the after goblet draw 'Party' when Harry gets back to the common room, and Ron could feasibly be waiting to talk in the dorm to speak to Harry in private as he was. The scene could be Ron believing Harry absolutely, and Hermione falling out with him in a similarly teenage fashion the next day; perhaps Hermione as strictly rule abiding is not pleased with Harry appearing to enter himself?

Obviously the main problem would be the scene where Hermione gets hit with the tooth growing jinx and later ensuring Harry could learn the summoning charm properly without Hermione to help him - but those could have been worked around - and Harry finding out about the dragons would have been less convoluted with Charlie being Rons brother.

It would have made Rons 'betrayal' (or perhaps I should say abandonment) of Harry more of a surprise in DH and help balance out the discrepancy between Ron's and Hermione's friendships with Harry.

Just a thought
