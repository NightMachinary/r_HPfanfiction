I'm not Irish, but please try to avoid talking about the IRA. Broadly speaking, it's best to leave these political/recent history subject to historian and researcher, and depending of how faithfull you are to canon, your character should not care about it. Canon pureblood are fully integrated to Magical Britain and their only separation is about National Quidditch Team, they also should not care about Muggle troubles.
