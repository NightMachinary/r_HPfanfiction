Another comment here already addressed a lot of main concerns. Just a small nitpick of mine, the characters are children. Children have pride and embarrassment issues, along with many others. The thing to remember is that they're human, not just villains or good people. What I'm hoping to communicate is that characters can develop over time, they can hope for forgiveness for past issues even if they can't articulate it well, and an insightful character will (hopefully) pick up on this.

In my opinion, a reference on good characterization is The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter on FF.net
