Avoid the mindset of "fixing canon". I can always tell when the writer thinks that /they/ would have done a better job writing Harry Potter. They wouldn't have and their fics reflect that.

Avoid bashing. It's frankly boring, overdone, and almost always reflective of a writer that poorly understands canon or has the above mindset.

Avoid muggle-wank/forcing science in. People frequently read fantasy for fantasy. Besides the canonical nature of wizards simply being superior, a wizard grabbing a sniper rifle and shooting death eaters feels like an arm chair warrior who's watched too many action movies. Harry Potter is a world where souls exist and magic recognizes a secret stored within a soul. I don't doubt that wizards study the world around them but muggle theory like the body of knowledge of physics ais overruled by magic.

Avoid unidimensional characters, especially with your OCs which seem like you will have plenty of.

Spent 10 minutes editing each chapter. Unless you're writing with a style like Realignment, editing's important. No one expects perfection but no reader likes random capitalized words and missing periods.
