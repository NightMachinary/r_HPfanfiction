Lazy linkless phone posting ahoy! I may come back and get the bot to do it right once I'm off work if no one else does it first.

Harry Potter and the Iron Lady is about the fall of the Statute of Secrecy, so close-ish to your request.

Love in the Time of the Zombie Apocalypse has the characters dealing with far bigger issues than secrecy and the ensuing fallout of muggles finding out about magic is a big part of the story.
