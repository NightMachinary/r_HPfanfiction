A world with technology similar to what we have now plus a small selection of spells would look very very different. A simple Aguamenti conjures water out of nothing, breaking conservation of mass, momentum and energy. A simple everlasting magic fire breaks conservation of energy. Give engineers a box that breaks any of these laws (doesn't matter how exactly) and they can break a lot of more complicated laws, aecome up with a lot of crazy stuff. A Jupiter in a week spaceship should be on the easy side of things if you can just ignore the tyranny of the Tsiolkovsky equation. Free energy is easy. Cures for most diseases that only the super rich can afford because there's not enough magical creatures for potions ingredients. Time travel? Let's see what happens if we send entangled qubits on a time trip!
