As people have pointed out Hagrid did not know Voldemort was Tom.

But there is another layer here. As far as Hagrid knew Tom was just a concerned prefect thinking he found the monster and who was in charge of it. A teen who made a mistake a lot of other people, adults, happily ran with. Hagrid has no idea he was set up. - The attacks stopped after this, but Hagrid could have easily figured that the true culpit just realised he was handed an out through to Hagrid's "lucky" arrest.

And Hagrid is not the sort of person to hold a grudge afainst somebody who, as far as he knows, tried to do the right thing, I think.
