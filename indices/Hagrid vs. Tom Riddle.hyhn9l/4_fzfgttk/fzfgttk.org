To be fair, Hagrid was expelled for raising a class XXXXX beast into the castle, which is a perfectly appropriate punishment. Tom Riddle may have used him as a scapegoat for the death of Myrtle, but Dumbledore protected him from the worst of it and it doesn't erase the fact that he brought a known wizard killer into the castle and was trying to raise it.

This is why he was not granted back the right to carry a wand, even after Harry proved his innocence.
