Ah yeah, you're right. Dumbledore protected Hagrid by making sure that the murder charges didn't stick, since the only thing they had actual proof of was the Acromantula.

Also, I'm not sure if Harry actually proved Hagrid's innocence in the eyes of the law, just that he wasn't attacking the students this time around. Not sure if his name was actually cleared.
