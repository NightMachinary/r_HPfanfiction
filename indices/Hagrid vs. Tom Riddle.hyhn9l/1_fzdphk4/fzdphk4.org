The longest 'grudge' we see Hagrid hold was towards Slytherin in general, and even that wasn't outright loathsome hate. Hagrid seemed prone to short term anger (e.g. his rage against Karkaroff, and his disappointment in Madame Maxime) but not so much a long term, hateful attitude. He couldn't even sustain his cold shoulder towards the trio (for dropping his subject) for too long in book six.

I like to think that even if he knew that Tom Riddle was Voldemort, well, he:

- Sort of moved on from his expulsion.

- Was just too good of a person to carry lifelong hatred

- Wasn't Snape, who kept lifelong grudges towards many things in life.

- Preferred to not think about or talk about it, as evidenced by him going 'mysteriously deaf' when the topic came up.
