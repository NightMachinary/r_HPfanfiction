For some unknown reason Dumbledore keeps Tom Riddle's identity as Voldemort secret. I have no idea why. Now as another commenter mentioned I don't think the knowledge of his identity would swing any inner circle/diehards away from him as they knew who he was in school. It may only sway a few bigoted purebloods away.

And it might actually backfire in terms of punishment. Eg try to get a law passed to have all marked deatheaters kissed/thrown through the veil. Tough enough when they believe Voldemort is a pureblood. But once it's known he's a halfblood and it's how can we give the ultimate punishment to these poor purebloods who were deceived by an evil halfblood. It's not their fault.
