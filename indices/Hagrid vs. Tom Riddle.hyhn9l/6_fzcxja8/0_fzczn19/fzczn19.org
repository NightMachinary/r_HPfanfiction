First of all, most of the Slytherin bashing is fanon. In canon, all we see is Hagrid's mention, Ron's on the train, people being cautious around Slytherins, and some of the Slytherins being pricks.

Also, in canon, we see Hagrid show resentment that his wand was snapped and he got kicked out. Why would he not hold a grudge against the person who caused that?
