Ehhhh... I feel like the fights in Cadmean victory are just people throwing Fiendfyre around like its candy on Halloween.

It has been a while since i read it so i might be exaggerating but i always felt Fiendfyre shouldn't be used in battle. It's supposed to be near impossible to control and I just can't see anyone being stupid enough to use it while also having to concentrate on evading enemy fire and making sure you don't accidentally burn you allies to a crisp.
