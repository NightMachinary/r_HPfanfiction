Harry IS Death, who set up the circumstances to manifest in the human world by giving his Cloak, Wand and Stone to three humans and waiting for the bloodline to be infused enough with his essence to permit his being born in the form of Harry Potter. He sent his Herald, the Grim, ahead of him to prepare the way - the Grim was born as Sirius Black. By gaining a mortal form, Death now knows Himself from every angle and has overcome his last weakness - that Death itself cannot die. Having died, Death is now perfected.
