I'm just going to mention it here since this jogged my memory and I'm curious if anyone even knows the name, but does anyone know they fem!Harry story where Harry starts off as a boy, Voldemort has captured Harry (and may have won the war), and turns him into a girl, before either raping or forcing Draco to rape Harry? Harry ends up pregnant, and Draco ends up falling in love (and I think helping Harry escape). I didn't really like it, but the sheer morbid curiosity I have for it has been jogged by this post.
