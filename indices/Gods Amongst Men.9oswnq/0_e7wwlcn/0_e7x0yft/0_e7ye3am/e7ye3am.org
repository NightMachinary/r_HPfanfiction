Isn't this comment you just showing biased opinion. Lots of writers use Ron bashing as a story point and to be honest in lots of storys with this make sense, including this one. Ron clearly has a major inferiority complex and with the timing their friendship can crumble quite easily. And while Dumbledore isn't actually a bad person I do believe he is extremely mis guided authors sometimes tweak that to make it a bit more extreme. Just because you don't like something dosnt mean you can shame others into sharing your opinion.
