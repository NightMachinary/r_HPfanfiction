Haha I was intrigued by this as I only ever find fics with Charlie in which either

- He is a small side character
- He never commits to any relationship
- The main (fe)male character is intrigued by him, but Charlie doesn't turn out to be his true love
- Leather, dragonhide, etc, etc
- He isn't able to talk about his emotions very well
- No scenes from Charlie's POV
- He is mainly or only used as a romantic/sexual plot device and doesn't really matter as a family member, friend, colleague, whatsoever
- His character is /so/ strongly built around him being a dragon trainer, that he doesn't seem to have any other characteristics that are not directly related to this
- His character is /so/ strongly built around him being a dragon trainer, that he doesn't seem to have any history before becoming one
- Wrong facts about Romania
- All or many of the above

Still I only found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9978764/2/Annie-Are-you-OK][this]], which doesn't look too promissing. Oh well, tell me if it's any good
