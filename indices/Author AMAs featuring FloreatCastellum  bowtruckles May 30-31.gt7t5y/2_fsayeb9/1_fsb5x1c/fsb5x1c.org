I started writing fanfic when I was 12, not realizing that it was a thing other people did until I went on the internet, lol (I'm going to decline to say what fandom, but it wasn't HP). I wrote some original stories too through high school and college, but I think they're lost forever. I doubt they were any good.

But for HP specifically, I have Cursed Child to blame! I read the play when it came out, and immediately wanted to reread the series after that, which I hadn't done for years. After that, I just needed more of it and too many ideas were playing out in my head for me to not start writing them down.

The Romione fandom was so welcoming to me when I first started posting fic in 2017 which I'm so grateful for! So encouraging. I feel fortunate that nobody's been critical or discouraging since them.
