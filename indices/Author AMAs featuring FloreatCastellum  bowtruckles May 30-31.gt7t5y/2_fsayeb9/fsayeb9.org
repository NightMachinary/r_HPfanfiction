When did you first start getting into writing fiction (and what was it about, if you're willing to share)?

Was there anyone special that encouraged you along the way? Or maybe someone whose criticism drove you to prove them wrong?

Thanks so much Flo & RP for doing the AMA and posting all your wonderful stories!
