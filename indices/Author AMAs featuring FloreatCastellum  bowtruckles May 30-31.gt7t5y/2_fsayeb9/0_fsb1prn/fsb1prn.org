My first fanfic account was made when I was... probably about 10? I used it until I was about 15. The stories still unfortunately exist out there in the internet. The less said about them the better.

I wrote because not all the books were out yet and I was desperate for more Potter. I think previously I had written little child stories, usually about horses because I loved Black Beauty and other horse books.

Then I stopped writing for a few years and picked it up again at the end of uni, but didn't actually really write anything properly until Not From Others, which I started around the time my mum was first diagnosed with cancer. It was a nice emotional release and something to write on the long train journey to go visit her.
