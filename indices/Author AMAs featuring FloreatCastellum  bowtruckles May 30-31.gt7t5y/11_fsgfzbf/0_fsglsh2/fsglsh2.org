The Aurors is a funny one because at the time I had been watching a lot of Luther and I really liked how a major part of the tension and anxiety was that the viewer knew more than the cast in regards to what was going on, thereby dodging the usual smart detective gathering all the suspects and explaining how he deduced everything. It's easier to do on film of course when you can really show tension through a sinister shadowy figure in the background, but I think there are ways to do that in fic.

So, I revealed to the reader only who the killer was fairly early on. Some people love this, some people hate it - it had the consequence of a lot of my readers thinking my OC was dumb, because what was blindingly obvious to them was not so for her. But I think watching her and Harry accidentally stumble into a trap, skirting achingly close to the edges of the truth, and ultimately concealing enough of the villain's plan was a fun way to write some very tense scenes. I don't regret doing that - I think it would have fallen more flat if people had guessed who dunnit and I kept treating the reader like an idiot by pretending they didn't know.

For Aurors, I definitely planned it out very carefully and made use of the chekhov's gun principle - I had a whole wall of post-it notes planning each and every aspect of the mystery and plot, the different perceptions of each character and what they could possibly know at each stage, etc, etc. I think... after all that, I got bogged down in some details and missed a few others. Quick fix plot devices (which I still maintain are not used in canon in the same way they're not used in my fic!) became the bane of my life as reviewer after reviewer criticised me for not using them, I felt that I was sacrificing some characterizations for the sake of keeping my extremely delicate plot, and gradually it just sucked all the joy out of the fic for me. It was the most effort I have put into a fic, it ended up my most controversial, and it's the only one that I can't bear to reread. I still think about some of the more brutal reviews I got for it, and every now and then I still get very nasty messages about it. Honestly the experience was just miserable for me and it was a while before I felt comfortable writing again. This is strange because it remains one of my most popular fics, and there are certainly certain /scenes/ and ideas that I am proud of.

BUT then the idea for Hollow Ash came along. I took on board a lot of the criticisms of Aurors, and definitely kept some elements of planning - I listed certain clues I knew I had to drop in early, and I knew the basic arc I wanted to follow, but I took a much more organic/gardener approach. It was a much more enjoyable experience for me, I think it's a better fic, though it's not as popular. It takes a more traditional mystery approach in that the reader is not privy to scenes showing who the villain is, but I kept a slight twist in that I didn't make it entirely clear what the crime was from the start either - I wanted to avoid opening with the standard discovery of a body. But I think this helped me build up a creepy atmosphere that suited the psychological shift of my OC better, and was probably more representative of the scandi-noir and modern gothic horror that I happened to be reading at that time.
