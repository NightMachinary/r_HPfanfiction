Thank you for the detailed answer.

I read The Aurors first and thought it was superb... must check that I actually left a review saying so. I must say I prefer mysteries where the reader is also left in the dark but this story was strong enough to overcome that.Hollow Ash was definitely a better story but they're both well worth reading.

Having been a beta reader for a couple of prominent authors, I'm well aware of the nonsense that gets posted on review pages. There are some useful comments but far too much is idiotic drivel that can be ignored.

I mentioned Chekov's Gun because it tends to be a divisive point in the genre. I can see it from both sides and wanted to know your thoughts, so thanks for that!

I look forward to reading more of your stories in the future.
