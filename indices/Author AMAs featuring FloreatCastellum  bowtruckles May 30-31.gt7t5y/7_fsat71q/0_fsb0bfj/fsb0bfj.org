I did surprise myself in really enjoying writing Snape when someone requested it, and wrote him a few more times after that. He's such an interesting character and while I would never describe myself as a Snape fan, I wouldn't describe myself as a Snape hater either. I enjoy the nuance and conflicting aspects of his character a lot, and there's so much you can do with acknowledging that the reader knows more about him than the character he's speaking to. It's also sometimes fun to indulge in his bitterness and angst.

My other controversial character I love to write is Hugo Granger Weasley. I deliberately write him as an obnoxious, rather difficult child. This was originally intended as a tribute to Adrian Mole but he ended up growing his own personality too, which is a perfect clash of Ron and Hermione's personalities, and possibly on the spectrum a little too as I took influence from things a family member did as a kid. Frankly I was bored with next gen kids that were all perfect and lovely and endlessly sweet, and I find him far more endearing as a more authentically annoying child. Some people love him and find him just as endearing and funny as I do but I get a lot of reviews absolutely appalled that I have written such an obnoxious child. That's ok by me, I completely understand why some people hate him and I don't expect people to get behind all my headcanons. He's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, just like kids like that in real life.
