I think Ron and Hermione can both be kind of controversial depending on what corner of the fandom you're in, but personally I adore both of them. Aside from that, I have a couple fics that explored Percy's rift with his family, which I really enjoyed.

I've also really enjoyed writing Cormac McLaggen because he's just so smug and arrogant and it's fun to lean into that.

Are these characters controversial enough? I mostly just stick to the Weasleys and Harry, lol
