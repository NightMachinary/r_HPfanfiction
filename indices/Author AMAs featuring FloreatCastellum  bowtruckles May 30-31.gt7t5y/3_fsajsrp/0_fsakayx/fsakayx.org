I love writing Harry so much. ‚ù§ He's my boy.

I don't really know why, but he speaks so clearly to me and feels really natural to write. He has the perfect balance of having some serious issues that can create some emotionally powerful moments, but also being reserved and resilient enough that I don't feel I'm having to write paragraphs of soppy angst with him sobbing and spiralling in despair. I also love his sense of humour and that can be savagely satisfying to write.

I don't like writing Luna. People ask me to write Luna all the time because she's very much a favourite character, but honestly I find her really boring to write. Don't get me wrong, I do like her as a character - I named my dog after her - but I actually find her quite flat. Her character can be summed up as "weird but in a nice, non-threatening way", and she just doesn't really seem to show much emotion in general. She's purely a device to help Harry's development and has none of her own. While I do like to flesh out characters and develop them myself, I just really can't be arsed with this girl. I also have a conspiracy theorist in my family and I find him exhausting too, so that may be part of it.
