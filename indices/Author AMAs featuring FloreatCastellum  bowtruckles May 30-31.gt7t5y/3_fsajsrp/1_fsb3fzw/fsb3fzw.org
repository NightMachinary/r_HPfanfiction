I love writing Ron. I relate to him the most of any of the characters in the series and it feels very natural to get inside his head. Ginny is fun too!

There's no characters that I particularly dislike writing, though some are more difficult than others - for example, I have to be in just the right headspace to write the twins. And some I'm just not particularly interested in writing, even if I like them as characters. Neville springs to mind, but even in stuff I write that takes place at Hogwarts, he's just... not really involved. Even though I think he's great!
