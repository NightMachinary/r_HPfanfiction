I always find it interesting when people choose to pursue a single pairing. Have you ever found yourself tempted by a non-canon pairing? If so, what was so tempting about it?

Kind of related to this, how do you approach new story ideas?

When I think up ideas it's some story or situation that grabs my attention, and the pairings, if they exist, are chosen to further the themes of that story or situation. Do you start from the pairing instead, and then decide on a story that best shows off some specific aspect of their relationship? What is the hook that that grabs you when you think of a new story idea?
