I do actually have a couple of non-canon pairings but they're for very minor characters and they're not... I don't feel that I'm changing anything in canon because they've been left relatively open ended. This is predominantly Scorbus and Deamus.

But no, generally I've never been tempted by AU. People kept telling me I would be but it's been years and I've not run out of canon stuff to explore and it's become sort of my niche now. I am mostly Harry/Ginny, but I've also written Ron/Hermione, George/Angelina, James/Lily, Percy/Audrey, and so on, and they all provide me with different dynamics to have fun with. Plus I have the next gen characters to have a bit more variety if I want.

In terms of the second question - for my long fics it's definitely plot based, although my writing is always fairly character based, so it's often a case of "how would Harry deal with ___?" and constructing the plot from there. For my one shots and shorter stories, it depends because so many of them I did based on prompts people gave me but it's usually because I want to explore a certain theme or moment that I think could pack an emotional punch/just be really fun to write. They tend to be very character based.
