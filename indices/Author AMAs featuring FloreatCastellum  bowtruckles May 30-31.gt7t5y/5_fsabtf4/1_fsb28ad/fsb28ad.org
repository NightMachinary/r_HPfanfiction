I'm not usually drawn to non-canon pairings that would break canon pairings, if that makes sense. Similar to Flo, I do like ones like Deamus and Scorbus where there isn't really canon evidence but it doesn't contradict canon. I haven't actually written any of them, lol, but never say never!

As far as approaching new story ideas... it really varies. 95% of what I write is for the same pairing so usually if I get a situation-based idea, I have to first ask myself if it even makes sense/suits the characters that I prefer to write about, because I don't want to force something that isn't true to them. Sometimes even if I like an idea, I have to admit to myself that it wouldn't work for Ron/Hermione and just let it go. But if it's a more character-based idea, then I'll try to let the scenario play out in my head. And if I can automatically come up with dialogue or lines, then it'll feel like something worth writing and usually that's when I'll open up an email draft on my phone and start furiously typing, haha.
