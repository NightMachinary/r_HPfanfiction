I was there during Mugglenet Fanfic's heyday. I camped out on the beta boards and it was basically a necessity to create or get someone to make you a banner to advertise your story. Fics tended to be more speculative as not all of the books were out yet, but there were also a lot more tropes, in my opinion, that have now died away - like the idea that the Head Boy and Head Girl would get their own private dorm. Naturally this meant they could shag in peace after a long enemies to lovers slow burn with mounting sexual tension.

Contests were more frequent, drama was rampant. Reviews were brutal.
