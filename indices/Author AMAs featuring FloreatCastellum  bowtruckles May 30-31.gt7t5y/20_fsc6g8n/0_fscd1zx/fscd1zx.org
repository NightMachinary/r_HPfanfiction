This question is a little tricky for me because while I've been reading the books since before PoA came out, I only became active in fandom in the past 3-4 years. I've definitely noticed a migration from ffn to ao3, which is a huge positive as ao3 has a much nicer interface and user experience. I've been happy to adapt to that!

The fandom has definitely slowed and calmed during the years I've been active, so there's fewer fests and probably less engagement overall, which is totally fine. My expectations are usually crazy low anyway and it's important to remember that the last book came out 13 years ago and people have other interests. It also lends itself to less competition and leaves room for new creators which is great!
