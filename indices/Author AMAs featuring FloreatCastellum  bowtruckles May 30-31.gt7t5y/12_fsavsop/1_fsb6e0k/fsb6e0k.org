I'm not really active in any other fandoms other than HP. I think because this world is so expansive and has so many possibilities, it just feels more inspiring to me. I just feel really connected to these characters.

If I did have to choose... wow. Maybe Hunger Games? There's a lot of possibility in that universe, but it's also an even darker world than HP so it might be difficult to be in that headspace for too long.
