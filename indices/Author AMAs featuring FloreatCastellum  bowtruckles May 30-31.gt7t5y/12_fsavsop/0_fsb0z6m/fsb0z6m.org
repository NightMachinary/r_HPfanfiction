I haven't written fanfic for any other fandom and don't think I would - while I love lots of other things, none have grasped me in a creative way in the same way HP has. The possible exception is I have taken some character cues from Brooklyn 99, which I really enjoy.

Otherwise I also really like the LOTR films (I have read the books a few times, but they get a bit more heavy for me), His Dark Materials, A Series of Unfortunate Events, some classic stuff like Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice, and I love getting into a good series like Orange Is the New Black, How to Get Away With Murder, Fleabag, Broadchurch, Unforgotten, that kind of thing. I'm not really into the other big fandoms like Doctor Who, Star Wars, Percy Jackson, etc.

I did love Game of Thrones but that final season... I'm not even angry about it, just deflated. It sapped all my earlier enjoyment out of me lmao.
