Thank you!

There's a couple things: I've had an idea for an amnesia fic involving Hermione and Shell Cottage but I've never been able to work out much more than that, haha. I have also wanted to write a ‚ÄòRon and Hermione go to Australia' fic, but those tend to follow a lot of the same plot beats and I think I would struggle to make it feel fresh even as I was writing it.

As far as pressure... hmm. I don't know! I guess I'd never post anything that I wasn't proud of (I only post like 10% of what I write), so it's probably more about meeting my own standards. But you really can't please everyone and quality is so subjective anyway.

I would actually love to write original fiction, I just need an idea üòÖ I am still having a lot of fun writing HP fic so I'll be around for little while yet!

Hope you're safe as well. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
