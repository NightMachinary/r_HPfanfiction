Here's a few to start...

Ron and Hermione don't get married until they're about 25, and then their pregnancy with Rose - completely unplanned - comes along a couple months later. This may be an unpopular opinion because Hermione does love to have control, but I think it's a great lesson for her that she can't micromanage every aspect of their lives.

Percy and Bill were the only Weasley kids to have “proper” (according to Molly) weddings. Everyone else eloped.

Unable to sell it, Draco has to live in Malfoy Manor for the rest of his life.

Hagrid lives FOREVER (or maybe not, but he lives a verrrrry long time). Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione visit him at Hogwarts and send him baby announcements and photos which decorate his hut.
