I probably wouldn't ever write about infidelity - it's not in character for any of the ones that I like to write about, and anything with dubious consent (or no consent) is also just a hard no. I also couldn't write anything with Ron or Hermione being with someone other than them, even the other people they date in canon. It would at least really, really be a struggle. I need them together!
