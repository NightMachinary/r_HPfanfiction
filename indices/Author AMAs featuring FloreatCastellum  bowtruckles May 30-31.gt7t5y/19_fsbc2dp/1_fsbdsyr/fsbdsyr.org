I do reject a lot of requests for a lot of reasons. I'm not averse to smut, but sometimes people request, erm, fairly /niche/ stuff that I'm not comfortable writing. Sometimes it's not even that but I just don't think it's realistic for the characters - for some reason I get a lot of flaming marble requests and idk how to make it stop. I'm also rarely in the mood for over the top cheese/fluff.

I'm also not comfortable writing about rape, though I have alluded to it in my writing. I'm also not comfortable writing about Ginny's experience of being groomed in CoS.

ETA: I'm also not interested in exploring the afterlife any further than shown in the books or any dead characters coming back, meeting others via time travel or anything. Grief and loss is a powerful theme in the books and I want to keep it that when we lose a character, we really do lose them.
