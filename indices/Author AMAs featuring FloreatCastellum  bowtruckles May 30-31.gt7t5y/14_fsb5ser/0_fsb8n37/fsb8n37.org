In the past I just dragged myself through it, but tried to remember that if I was bored it probably meant my audience was too so I should probably try and change something about it.

Lately I've been having severe writers block though so am starting to abandon/put on long term hiatus a couple of stories. I'm really hoping the spark comes back so I can pick them up again.
