No, I can't skip it. I know myself well enough to know that if I skip it, I'll never go back to it. One thing that has worked for me is changing the POV of the character if you can - I know that's sort of generic common writing advice, but it's been helpful for me. Sometimes you don't realize you're in the wrong perspective.

But if I can't do that, sometimes I'll change the approach as far as where I'm starting in a scene - if you start too soon before the action, it can feel like plodding through lots of exposition that you probably don't need. That said, I don't think you should ever really, really force it. If the words aren't coming, there's probably a reason and maybe that's just not the direction the story is supposed to go. It can help to take a step back and think of new ways to get to the ending that you want.
