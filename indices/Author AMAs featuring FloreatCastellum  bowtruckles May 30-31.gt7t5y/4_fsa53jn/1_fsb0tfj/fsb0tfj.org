More of a gardener for sure! Since I usually write one-shots, there isn't much planning involved - I just have a general idea of what I want to happen, the general theme, etc. For the multi-chapters I've done, I'll usually have a document containing the basic plot beats and maybe some dialogue that I want to be sure to include, but nothing as detailed or deep as what you shared. Underlying themes and character arcs are usually just all in my head. I'm always very impressed when people have very detailed, organized outlines, I'm too impulsive and impatient for that.
