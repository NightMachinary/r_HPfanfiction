I'm definitely more of a gardener - the one fic I planned in minuscule detail I found it a miserable experience and though it was well received it's not one I'm fond of. I usually have a clear idea of where I want them to end up and very often certain scenes I will plan out, and make sure to carefully drop in certain clues or foreshadowing, but I have more fun having a flexible approach so I stick to that nowadays.
