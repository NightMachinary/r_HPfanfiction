How do you plan your stories? I've been increasingly curious about this ever since I read a [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/perfecting-the-independent-harry-genre.38553/page-2][DLP post]] from Blorcyn about how he would write an independent!Harry story.

To quote:

#+begin_quote
  Pitch: When Harry thwarts Voldemort's return for the third time he realises that his life has a time-limit and he'll never be free to live outside Hogwarts until he ends the evil wizard, once and for all.

  Theme Premise: When a schoolboy who has been targeted by a terrorist organisation takes it into his own hands to hunt the terrorist leader down, he learns that no one man can change the world by himself.

  Narrative Principle: Harry seeks to defeat Voldemort actively across his remaining years at Hogwarts, squandering his resources along the way, until he learns his lesson and starts to build to his own strengths rather than challenge his enemy's.

  [...]

  Flaw: Harry thinks he can take on Voldemort by himself, because he's always reactively defended himself from Voldemort by himself.

  Psychological need: Harry needs to learn that what he can do as part of a group is greater than what he can do alone.

  Moral need: Harry needs to learn that being part of a group that cares about you means listening to other viewpoints.

This way of thinking and planning was really interesting because it made explicit that which is generally subtext in my own planning, which historically is much more focused on /events/: how do I get the character from point A to point B. I have since tried to incorporate lessons from this planning approach though there is only a certain amount you can do that for a story which is already in progress.

Do you do anything like this? Fitting together character ideas like a puzzle, building your story around a kind of moral/thematic scaffold? Or is your process more organic? Or are you a "gardener" not an "architect" and you just put pen to paper and see where the story takes you?
