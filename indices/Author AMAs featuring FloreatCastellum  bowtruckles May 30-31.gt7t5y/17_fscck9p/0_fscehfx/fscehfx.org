For sure! That's completely normal. Sometimes I just want to read, or real life takes up all my time, or just other outside factors (like a global pandemic....) can really affect feeling inspired and motivated. So sometimes I do find it a little hard to get back into the swing of things, I feel a little rusty at first. But once that passes, I'm usually so happy I started.

I've been a little bit writers-blocked lately - I have ideas but I'm struggling to find the words for them. I just try to remember not to force it, and it'll come back eventually.
