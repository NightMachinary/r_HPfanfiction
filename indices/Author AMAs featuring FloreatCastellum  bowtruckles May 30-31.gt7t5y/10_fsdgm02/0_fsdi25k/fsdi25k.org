As long as I can remember! When I was in first grade, my school library did a thing where you could write your own book and they'd have it bound, and it would even have an â€˜about the author' section and everything. Mine was about a dog (typical me). My mom still has it. So yeah, I always really liked creative writing assignments in school. It wasn't until junior high that I started writing short stories outside of school for fun, though.
