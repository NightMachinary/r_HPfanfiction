I think I'm proudest of some of my Ron POV fics, especially Envy, and some of my outside POV fics like The Bureaucrats and Know. Really I think my missing Hogwarts moments is where I create the work I'm usually most satisfied with, though it's rarely the most popular.

There's a few short fluffy fics that I wrote for the sake of the request that I cringe a bit at looking back, and there are parts of the Aurors that I just... really hate now.
