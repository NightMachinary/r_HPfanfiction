I find myself proudest of ones that are departures from my norm and challenged me to do something different. Two that come to mind are Off-Kilter and Of Owls and Ollivander's - they're not Romione, but I'm pleased with how they turned out. I also really like one called A Family Affair in which Bill is planning his wedding and has to decide if he's inviting Percy. For Romione, it's got to be all my best lies.

I'd like to forget I ever wrote one called Waiting, I just no longer think it's particularly in-character. That's the only one I'd consider deleting. Oh well, such is life!
