(Hi Bullwinkle!) There are some tropes that I don't like and won't include - Hermione calling Ron “Ronald” is one of them, she only does it once in the books when she's furious with him and it usually comes off condescending rather than an endearment.

This is a great question - I might edit my answer with additional thoughts later!
