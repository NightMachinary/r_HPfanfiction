I struggle to write while on any kind of moving vehicle, or in public - I get distracted easily. The ideal setting... that's tricky, it kind of varies! I usually write on my phone so if I can sit on the couch or in my bed and type away without too many distractions (like an interesting show or someone talking to me), that works pretty well. Usually I'm pretty adaptable though!
