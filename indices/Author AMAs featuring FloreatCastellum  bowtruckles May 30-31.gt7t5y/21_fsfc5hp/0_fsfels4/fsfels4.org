Yeah, for sure! Omg, I love fics where Ron and Hermione are together a little earlier than they officially do in canon.

Some AU fics I really love are: The World I Leave Behind by NES85; The Book of Morgan LeFey and its sequel The Final Reckoning by LavenderBrown; In Search of Hermione by AzaleaBlue; The Changeling and the entire Armistice series by annerb - really all of annerb's AUs are great

Ahhh I feel like there's so many I'm missing but those ones are a great start!
