Something I really love about Lemony Snicket's writing is how concisely he can say something really devastating or revealing. I'm very much a less is more kind of person, and I do try and emulate that to give my writing more punch. I think there's a temptation in writing, when you want to make characters suffer, to really go into a lot of detail about exactly what happened to them and exactly how they feel, when it's more interesting and engaging to let the reader infer.

I also love Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials - that level of writing is just... so beyond me, really beautiful. I had an excerpt from The Amber Spyglass as a wedding reading. Stunning narrative and a perfect example of a book that can weave in very adult themes into a child's perspective without the sort of dumbing down that you sometimes see in Rowling's writing.
