Thanks! My writing style has drastically improved over the years. I look back at fics I wrote when I first began writing HP fic in 2016 and I'm just so grateful I never posted them, lol. I think I'm much better at pacing, phrasing, and just having things flow more naturally. All of that I think just comes with practice.

I do strive to improve but in a very informal fashion, I haven't taken a writing class since college several years ago. If I come across an article with some good writing advice I try to keep it in mind. I don't usually use a beta, though for ambl I did. So I guess in that respect I would be self-taught, but I also have a degree in English which is a pretty formal foundation on which to build. So both, I guess, lol

As far as rules... well, I think there are very few hard and fast writing rules, there can always be exceptions and if you worry yourself too much about it, it takes all the fun out of it. Sometimes I do struggle to remember that I can and should just use “said” in a dialogue tag, it's always a little freeing when I take that to heart!
