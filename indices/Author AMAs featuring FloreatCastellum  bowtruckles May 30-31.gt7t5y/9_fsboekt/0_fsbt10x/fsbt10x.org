I did do a writing class at the start of the year - sadly I never got to finish it because of Coronavirus, but it did lead me to write something original that will be published in a magazine this summer under my own name. I was also able to take techniques/methods from it to help me target areas I know I have a problem with - my over use of "said Harry excitedly", for example. I also got a lot out of analysing texts provided by the teacher and created by the other students - in general it was a lovely, supportive environment that I think really helped and I would like to do something similar again in the future when we're not all in lockdown. It also gave me a better grasp of rules that I think I understood at some level but had never really had set out for me so plainly before.

I think when I look back at NFO and Aurors I can see that I have improved, but I have to confess it was rarely from the criticism I received via reviews. In fact, there are elements of both stories I don't like but think I wrote trying to please specific reviewers, and I think a large part of my self improvement is that I've stopped trying to audience please as much. It's ok that I don't please people that wanted a super grimdark account of Hogwarts that year with militirisation and so on, because I'm never really going to be to that audience's taste anyway. I don't really care if fewer people read it, but I've found my audience has only grown as I've come into my own. It's a big part of the reason I drifted away from ff.net - to put it plainly, the audience was too massive and the nitpicking/entitlement from people who simply had different tastes to me was too much for my mental health.

The constructive criticism that has genuinely helped me has been from betas and community groups on discord, where it is usually more measured, well intentioned, and collaborative. I also think there's something to be said for developing an eye to reread your own stuff and being honest about it, thinking about the quality of the feedback (or the radio silence) and being self-aware enough to neither inflate your ego nor beat yourself up. Then... practice practice practice - I wrote an absolutely ridiculous amount last year. I feel like I was naturally going to get better through sheer intensity alone.
