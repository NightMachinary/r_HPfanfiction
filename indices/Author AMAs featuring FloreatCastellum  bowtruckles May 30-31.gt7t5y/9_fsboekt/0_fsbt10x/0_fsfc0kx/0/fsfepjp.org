Thanks! The Hinny discord (the link for which is on [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]] ) is a lovely place. I'm on a discord detox at the moment but can often be found there usually. The writing book channel in particular is fab for collaborative beta work, and if you @britpicker, all us Brits descend to help people avoid Americanisms/give strong opinions on the north-south divide.
