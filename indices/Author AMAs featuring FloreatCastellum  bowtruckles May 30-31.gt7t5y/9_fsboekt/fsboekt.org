  Hello there! I consider both of you very talented fanfiction writers, in terms of how in character your characters are, and how interesting the ideas behind your stories are; but beside that, I also consider your writing styles entertaining and able to convey feelings and emotions.

  So I wonder, how much do you feel your writing style has improved through the years? Did you actively work to improve your writing (like, reading articles about it, going to writing classes, asking for second opinions etc), or are you mostly self-taught? Which writing 'rules' you struggle the most to follow/you don't like, and which come more naturally?
