I'm flattered you think it's clever, I think cowardly would also be a fair description! But for me I mostly take a word of God approach and just sidestep round/carefully ignore stuff I don't like. Where information is conflicting I just pick the version I prefer. The books come out on top though, I don't regard the films as canon.

I'm not sure about your other question.... I think... it was probably canon compliancy over the ship for me. Harry naturally doesn't appear much in NFO, the first proper fic I wrote, I just wanted to see what happened at Hogwarts that year. But at the same time, I knew that I shipped them.
