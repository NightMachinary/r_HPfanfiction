My love of a particular ship, for sure - I just needed lots more Ron and Hermione than what the books gave me and just started writing (and looking up fic too). I do enjoy reading AUs and have written some non-canon-compliant things too, such as a fake dating fic in which Ron never dates Lavender, but I truly love the canon! There's so much to work with already that I don't often feel the need to branch out. I'm so glad those 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue are basically blank, because then everyone can imagine what they want.

To me, the only true canon is the seven books. After that, I just pick and choose what I like. I almost never write far enough into the future for CC to be a consideration but I don't envision Hermione as Minister for Magic, and I probably would just ignore most of the events of the play if need be. Pottermore... I like it as a guide, but if I write or read something that contradicts it, I wouldn't consider that to be “AU”.
