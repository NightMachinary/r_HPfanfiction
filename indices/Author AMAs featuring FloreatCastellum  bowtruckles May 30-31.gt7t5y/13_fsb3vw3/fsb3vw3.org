Obviously both of you write canon ships, but I was wondering what came first? Your preference for/interest in canon compliance or your love of the particular ships? I ask because I guess I would describe myself as having been converted to Hinny by fanfics, not canon.

And a related question... do you use a hierarchy of canon? Like, some things are more canon than others (e.g. books > Pottermore > Twitter) or do you take a more all or nothing approach? I know Flo has a quite clever solution to CC's divisive reception, for example.
