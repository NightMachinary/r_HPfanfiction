Well I've got a surprise for you: this is the only long Dean/Luna fic with them as a main pairing that I could find. It's part two of a series, but part 1 happens at the same time as part 2 so reading part 1 isn't necessary. It's really fluffy.

This was a cute, fuzzy one-shot. Luna gets aged up a year so she's in the same year as Dean.

This is my favorite story that features Dean/Luna. They are not the main pairing.
