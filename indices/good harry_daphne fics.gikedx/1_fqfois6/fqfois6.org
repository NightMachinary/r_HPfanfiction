My personal favorite is the noir mystery fic Unatoned by SeriousScribble on ffnet.

Here's the description from the author's site: "After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn...AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG"

It's a really dark fic, FYI.
