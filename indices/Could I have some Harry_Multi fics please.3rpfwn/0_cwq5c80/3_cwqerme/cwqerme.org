Hermione/Harry/Ron fics are called menage et trio and there's a few I heartily recommend starting with this guy if you want something canon compliant.

This one has pretty much the same story line but with a happy ending and slightly worse structure.

And it really shouldn't be a surprise that there's very little trio stuff, this sub is *dominated* by straight guys who are -in general- quite averse to any male/male stuff.
