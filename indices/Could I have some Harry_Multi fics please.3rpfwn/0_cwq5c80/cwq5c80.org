*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): it's one of my favorite HP fanfics. Harry and his girls make up a power team.

*Harry Potter's Promise*, linkffn(3974563)

*The Harem War*, linkffn(11035814): I actually don't like this one, but it's worth mentioning

I'm surprised that there is no Hermione/Harry/Ron story. Given the amount of Harry/Multis out there, it would be nice to see a Hermione/Multi for a change. So, why not turning the golden trio into the lover trio?
