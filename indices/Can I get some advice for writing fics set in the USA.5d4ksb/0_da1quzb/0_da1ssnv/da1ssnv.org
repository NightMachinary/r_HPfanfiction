Holy wall of informative text. This should be required reading to anyone not from the US writing about any US magical school.

Also research history, local dishes/ foods for the feasts. In some southern areas young kids drink coffee so it could easily replace some people's "pumpkin juice". Since the school is in Massachusetts you can have a Boston Vs New York quidditch rivalry or something to parallel muggles baseball.
