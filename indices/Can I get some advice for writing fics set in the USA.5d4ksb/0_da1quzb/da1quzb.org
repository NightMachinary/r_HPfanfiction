1. Well, wizards in Britain seem to celebrate Christmas, so I don't see why Thanksgiving wouldn't be an option. And unlike Christmas, there are no real religious connections, so that wouldn't be an issue.

2. Unless you're in the Pacific Northwest, California or the East Coast, trains generally aren't an option for getting from all over the place. I don't particularly remember what gas prices were like back then, so I can't comment on the costs of driving, and I /really/ have no idea how practical planes would be, since I never was on a plane pre-9/11, and afterwards, there would be too much unexplainable stuff in a muggleborn student's trunk to get away with (unless a witch or wizard did some trickery). But don't forget you can set up some sort of whimsical solution. Something like the Knight Bus would be perfectly fine as a solution. Greyhound Buses for example travel all over the place. You're probably just overthinking it. Shit's magic, yo.

3. The thing about the American Education System is that treating it like a whole (especially pre-Common Core, and I'm *not* getting into that argument, so don't even bother) is pretty stupid. Generally it's a thing that varies by states. Some information that may or may not be useful.

Schooling could basically be broken into these components: preschooling, K-12 education (public school (will be discussed later)), collegiate/technical schools and post-graduate work. The only one required anywhere as far as I know is K-12.

School years generally went (at least, how it was for me. Things probably have changed in the last six to twentysome years):

- Preschool (optional). Generally children 3-5 years old. Partial school days.

- Kindergarten. Not optional as far as I know. First year of K-12. When I had this, it was a half day thing.

- First Grade. First year of full day schooling. Basically the first year of what we would call Elementary school.

- Second Grade. Second year of full day schooling.

- Third Grade. Third year of full day schooling.

- Fourth Grade. Fourth year of full day schooling.

- Fifth Grade. Fifth year of full day schooling. Often, but not always, the last year of elementary school.

- Sixth Grade. Sixth year of full day schooling. Often the first year of what we would call Middle School. Basically this marks the point where school gets far more intense than compared to previous year changes, and elective courses are now a thing.

- Seventh Grade. Seventh year of full day schooling.

- Eighth Grade. Eighth year of full day schooling. Often the end of Middle School, though some Middle Schools also host the Ninth Graders.

- Ninth Grade. Ninth year of full day schooling. Often the first year of High School. Also called Freshman Year.

- Tenth Grade. Tenth year of full day schooling. Also called Sophomore Year. No, I don't know or particularly care why.

- Eleventh Grade. Eleventh year of full day schooling. Also called Junior Year.

- Twelfth Grade. Twelfth and final year of full day schooling. Also called Senior Year.

College is sort of a catch all term, used for both colleges and universities.

One thing to note, if you're talking about a muggleborn's previous place of education: Public schools in US =/= Public schools in UK. Public schools in the US are schools for the public. So, state run, tuition is a part of the taxes, and so on. Private schools are the ones that people in the UK would call Public Schools (as far as I know). Of course, homeschooling is often a thing.

For example, I grew up in Michigan. In Elementary and Middle School, we had this thing called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Educational_Assessment_Program][MEAPs: Michigan Educational Assessment Programs]] which had tests in what I want to say were 5th grade, 8th grade and /maybe/ 3rd grade, but I'm not too sure on that one. When I was in High School, we had things called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Merit_Exam][MMEs: Michigan Merit Exams]], though I think it has been replaced with something else. I'd have to ask my friend who teaches in Detroit. They were taken Junior Year, and used to require taking the ACT, one of the two major exams used for collegiate admissions (the other, and more popular, is the SAT). I do know that Michigan has switched to the SAT some point in the last six years. I couldn't really tell you about other states. Fun Fact! On the Michigan Merit Exams, the highest grade possible was an Exceeds Expectations. Also, a teacher doesn't mark homework or tests/exams, they grade them.

Which is probably my big point for cultural points that you want to know: America isn't a homogenous nation in any way. Each state has a distinct difference in culture. I've lived in Michigan, Indiana, Alabama and potentially (if these damn people ever get back to me in the way that seems incredibly likely) Colorado. Each of these is drastically different from the other. And within each state it can vary greatly. For example: Michigan is composed of two landmasses only connected by the Mackinaw Bridge. I'm from the Upper Peninsula, which only contains ~3% of the population of MI but about a third of the landmass, and is culturally more similar to Wisconsin, Minnesota and Canada than the Lower Peninsula (especially more true the further west in the UP you go).

Other random things to know:

Biscuits and Gravy is mostly a Southern Breakfast, are absolutely delicious, and about the only time I'll ever eat biscuits (they are way too crumbly, and get in my beard way too much).

[[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/southern-biscuits-recipe.html][US Biscuits]] =/= UK Biscuits.

Breakfast foods include things like cereal, waffles, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake][pancakes]], eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, sometimes steak or fried chicken (or chicken fried steak (steak fried like a chicken)), grits (a Southern thing, I can't stand them) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_browns][hash browns]]. The possibilities are /literally/ almost endless.

Coffee is FAR more common than tea.

Mom, not Mum.

Guns are for more common. I had a fun discussion with [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] about it not too long ago. It's more common in more rural areas (so, basically the middle of the country), especially with rifles and shot guns.

Color, not colour. Honor, not honour. You get the idea.

Distances can be much, much longer than you would often see in England. I've done a two and a half hour drive (so, five hour round trip) as a day trip multiple times. Hell, we once did a four hour drive into Canada to buy a toilet as a day trip when I was younger. It was an eight hour drive to get from my undergraduate college to my parent's house, and I only traversed a couple states (MI to Wisconsin, WI to Illinois, IL to barely into-Indiana).

That's all I got off the top of my head. If you have anything else, don't be afraid to ask!

EDIT: Forgot about Holidays. Really, the Big Five are: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and the Fourth of July (Independence Day). Of those, Halloween is the smallest, and is kinda just celebrated for the hell of it. The other four are days when school is either cancelled, or not in session, and state and federal offices and buildings are generally closed. Other days to note: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day][Memorial Day]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day][Labor Day]] are two that generally are very celebrated (partially due to the time of year, nature of the holiday, and the fact that they are ALWAYS a Monday, allowing for families to travel and get together to celebrate), and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day][Veteran's Day]]. Those are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head that have schools and government buildings/services closed too (excepting Fire Departments, Police Departments and whatnot).

EDIT TWO, ELECTRIC BUGALOO: I think this is my longest comment? Fun.
