Ran away. I don't really know of anything else, but it can vary by region so much.

Steak for breakfast is fuckin' delicious. Sure, it's not the best quality steaks, but still pretty good. Mostly a thing if you went out to eat somewhere for breakfast. Chicken is probably more common (particularly in the South).

When I would visit my grandpa back when he was alive, breakfasts were generally: Eggs, hash browns, sausage or bacon, buttered toast, fruit (bananas or grapes), shredded wheat cereal, coffee and water/milk/juice. Sometimes pancakes, with homemade maple syrup. Of course, he was a dairy farmer, so breakfasts had to be chock full of energy.
