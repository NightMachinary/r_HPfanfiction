  You're probably just overthinking it. Shit's magic, yo.

Yeah, you're probably right on that.

The language and spelling differences I've mostly got; consulting the web when in doubt. I do have one question though: do you know a good slang term for "ran away"? I know "buggered off" is too British, but I also learnt "scarpered" is actually Brit. Eng., and I can't really find a US equivalent. (I can't used "fucked off" because it's an 11yo talking to a teacher. Also, if there's regional things, the kid grew up in a Vegas suburb.)

The breakfast thing is very helpful. But seriously, steak for breakfast?? Is that a regional/class thing? It sounds like the kind of oddity a stupidly rich person would indulge in.
