See, this is why I find the location such a poor choice. It's right in the middle of the Berkshires and a well-trod destination for sightseers nearly year-round, even back in the 1800's. If they wanted to hide all the spellwork, creatures, and students flying around on enchanted appliances, you'd think Maine or upstate New York would make more sense. Or, y'know, Ontario.
