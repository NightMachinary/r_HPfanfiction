Getting to Ilvermorny - not sure how much of IRL Mount Greylock you're able/willing to incorporate into the fic, but there are roads that lead to the monument at the summit, so it's entirely possible muggleborns could take cars or buses. Mount Greylock is a significant tourist attraction; no one would ever notice. (In fact, my high school took several field trips there).
