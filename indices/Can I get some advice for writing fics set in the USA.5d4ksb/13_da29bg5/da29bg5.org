I've always thought of American wizards as fundementally different in the character of their whole civilization. Modern wizarding society seems to have tremendous holdover from late medeival times, but around then America was just being explored. This is what makes me think American wizards would definiatly celebrate Thanksgiving, because they would be much more isolated from the rest of wizarding civilisation and probably relied on their muggle neighbors more.

As a side point, Brazilians speak Portugese, so there would be a significant issue for Spanish speaking students there. Not much better than an English speaking school.
