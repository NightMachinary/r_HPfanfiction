1) Thanksgiving can be compared to your standard harvest feast. "OMG, we haven't all died! Hooray!"

Homecoming is only a big deal in high school and even then it might not be a big deal. At my school we had a homecoming court that dressed up and paraded around the football game, but no dance or anything.

As far as other holidays, probably just the big ones. Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and if you wanted to put a fun twist on it, you could figure out a more wizard-central look at the 4th of July.

2) It may just be me getting whimsical, but I'd kind of enjoy for them to arrive by hot air balloon or something else completely out of left field. Floo or portkey is kind of boring, and train has been done.

3) Graduating depends on credits more than GPA. You can have an absolutely abysmal GPA but still graduate because you've technically passed the required number of classes. An example would be something like this:

4 math classes 3 science classes 4 english/literature classes 2 foreign language classes 1 economics class 1 art class 3 history classes however many of whatever classes are left. It's been a long time since I was in school. This is what I can remember of my graduation requirements. Remember that it can be different depending on your state/school district as well, because we are American and can't make anything straightforward and easy.

Basically, so long as you take the required number of classes and PASS those classes, you can graduate. Sometimes people can even graduate early because they buckle down and focus on taking only the required classes, and don't worry much about electives. So let's not worry about AP or Honors courses because those just muddle up the basic GPA system

4.0 - A 3.0 - B 2.0 - C 1.0 - D below 1.0 - F

Usually, so long as you have a 2.0 and have taken all the required courses, you can graduate. Obviously, you'd have some trouble getting into a good college with that, but you will have done the bare minimum.

Other things:

- Consumerism. I know it's pretty big everywhere but in America we really, really like it. Maybe I'm stereotyping my own country, but we seem to like having "stuff" more than other countries. And in school in particular how much stuff you have impacts your social standing.

- Spelling has already been covered, but also keep in mind these:

-jumper = sweater\\
-trainers = sneakers\\
-trousers = pants

-lounge = living room

-chips = french fries (only time we call them chips is "fish and chips"

-crisps = chips

-pudding = dessert. We only use pudding in reference to the actual custard-like dish

-biscuits = cookies

Our biscuits most resemble a scone, but they aren't really the same thing. I am not sure what British thing I could compare them to. Some recipes taste a lot like soda bread, I guess...

football (at least the kind you're used to) = soccer (it's only recently becoming more popular, so your kids will probably reference American football more)

- In most HP fanfiction based in England I see a lot of talk of Indian takeout. We do Mexican food here. We love huge burritos and tacos (OMG, tacos...) and salsa and guacamole. We don't call it take out. We just go out for some Mexican.

As far as other foods go, please do not listen to Buzzfeed's many "lulz, American food is sugary and orange and deep fried." articles. I'd be happy to list some "normal people" American dishes if you want.
