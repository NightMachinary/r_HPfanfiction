The dance may be standard in some places, but none of the schools in my area did it, so I can't really say.

4 English classes = one every year of high school, basically. Kind of a waste of time, yeah, but then again WELCOME TO THE US EDUCATION SYSTEM! hahaha!

As far as dessert goes. Basically anything sweet after dinner = dessert. No matter what it is. Cake, pie, cobbler, ice cream, fudge...all desserts.

As far as "typical" foods, that differs depending on region, but I can give you some "safe" foods that you can mention and are pretty standard wherever you go.

- spaghetti
- meatloaf
- various casseroles
- chicken (fried, baked, roasted, grilled, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets)
- rice is a pretty standard side dish
- macaroni and cheese
- salad is always safe
- scalloped potatoes
- chili is nice, usually served in winter
- ditto with various stews (like beef with vegetables)
- green beans
- sandwiches (just regular ham and cheese or chicken)
- oatmeal for breakfast
- cold cereal
- turkey is eaten usually on holidays
- junk food, of course. Hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, pizza..

I'm not sure what else to list, because to me it's all just "food." If I Google specific lists then I get either weird regional foods or nonsense lists like the ones Buzzfeed loves so much. The ones that make it sound like we eat nothing but corn dogs and fried Oreos. That should be a good start though. I can probably come up with some more if I actually think about it.
