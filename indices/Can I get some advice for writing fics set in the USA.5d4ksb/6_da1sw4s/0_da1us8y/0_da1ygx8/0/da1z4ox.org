Afters might be a Brit thing. Possible also only middle/lower classes.

I realise meals would vary on those things, I just used "normal people" because it's the phrase [[/u/Trtlepowah]] used when offering their list.

We do have it every year of school, it's just that when [[/u/Trtlepowah]] said "4 english/literature" I thought they meant 4 per year, in the way math is seperated into different classes.
