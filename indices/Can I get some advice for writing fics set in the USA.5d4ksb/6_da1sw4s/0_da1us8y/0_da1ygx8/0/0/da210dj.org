Hah, sorry I tried to give a really simplified list of foods that "most everyone" could agree on, without getting into regional foods and whatnot. Mostly because Googling it gives you a bunch of ridiculous lists that don't seem realistic. I figured you won't need a super varied list of foods unless your story revolves around food.

But yeah, it's tricky to break the entire country down in one post simply because different regions feel completely different from each other, almost like their own countries.

And yup, sorry. Those lists of classes was basically what you'd be expected to take in your entire 4-year high school career. So 4 English classes spread over 4 years.

I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions if I confused you at all.
