"Afters" is not a term I've ever heard. "Pudding" refers specifically to [[http://imgur.com/WSYyRV4][this dish]], though there are various flavors. The only catchall term for after dinner sweet stuff I've ever heard is "dessert".

"Normal people foods" vary wildly based on a ton of different things, such as race, class, and meal. Like, that's an incredible list you're asking for.

As for the classes, it's really odd to me that you wouldn't have an English class every year you're in school. They just get more and more advanced as you get older. They start out focusing on the language aspect and move towards literature.
