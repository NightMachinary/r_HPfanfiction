Huh, I thought dances were pretty much standard. Was your school an outlier or have I just got unreasonable expectations from the media?

This probably isn't relevant to Ilvermorny, but how do you end up with 4 English classes? I understand math because you guys split it up into trig/algebra/etc (we just had one single math class that covered everything) and science is obvious for chem/bio/physics, but I don't understand how you'd split up English classes beyond one of language and one for literature. (We had single English classes, but GCSEs have a lang. and a lit. exam.)

Would you mind elaborating on the pudding/dessert issue? Is "afters" used at all (refering to any after-dinner foods)? My sister uses pudding as a catch all term, but I always considered it to only mean cakes and pies. Is that what you meant or is your pudding more specific?

I'd also appreciate the list of normal people foods. (Or a link to somewhere more reliable than Buzzfeed.)
