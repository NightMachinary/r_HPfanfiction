In my time, the four years of English classes (Freshman to Senior) were broken down for focus, though this isn't an across-the-board thing:

Freshman = Grammar, spelling, punctuation, parts of speech; basically assuring that literacy had been covered.

Sophomore = Composition and literary forms

Junior = English literature

Senior = American literature

The last two may be swapped in order; some administrations feel that older English lit evolves into American lit. Others focus on American lit first as being more accessible to the modern reader, then go back to the English stuff when the language is more... English.

Mealtimes info:

Breakfast is some sugary cereal with milk, heated oatmeal or if you're going to need the calories; eggs, toast, bacon or sausage (in links or patties). Pancakes/flapjacks or waffles with maple syrup for a ritzy meal. Beverages for this meal are usually milk, juice, coffee or tea.

Lunch: a small version of Dinner's main course, usually transformed into some kind of sandwich. Weight-obsessed teen girls will eat salad (don't worry, they'll gorge on Snickers bars mid-afternoon). School-provided meals include a piece of fruit and the ubiquitous half-pint folded-cardboard milk container. Upscale schools offer it in skim, whole (3%) or chocolate versions. Anything to add dairy rather than succumb to the fruit punch/soda pop conspiracy.

Dinner: Appetizer/salad (and this only to pace the eating if the Main course isn't finished cooking), Main Course + side dishes, Dessert. Pudding is specifically a dessert made from gelatin and cream (usually), often with marshmallows or whipped cream mixed in.

Or to put another way: wherever a meal exists, there will be an attempt to add dairy- cream sauces, cheese baked in or baked on top or served in chunks... except in tea. Americans who put milk or cream in tea have spent too much time with foreigners. They are ambushed and force-fed Jolt, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew until they understand their error.

By the way, weird trufact: in Georgia, if you ask for a Coke, they'll ask 'what kind'? That's because Coca-cola is based there, and anyone from the region has substituted 'Coke' for 'soda' or 'pop' in their terminology as a survival technique.
