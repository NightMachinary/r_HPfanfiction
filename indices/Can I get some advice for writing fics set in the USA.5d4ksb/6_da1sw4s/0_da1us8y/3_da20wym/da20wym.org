  Is "afters" used at all (refering to any after-dinner foods)?

It's regional. It wouldn't be odd for one person to use it sometimes; it would be odd for everyone to use it consistently. I believe I got the term from my Pennsylvanian grandparents.

  I'd also appreciate the list of normal people foods.

Growing up, almost every dinner in my household was beef or occasionally chicken (cooked in an oven), potatoes or corn, and a vegetable. Broccoli, peas, and carrots were common options. Seasoning was mostly restricted to salt, pepper, and ketchup (of which only salt was applied during cooking). Meatloaf happened on occasion, as did spaghetti. We made pizza once per week.

The grandparents also did tuna and potato salads -- the less said, the better.
