Thanksgiving - it would appear very, very strange to any muggleborn's non-magical neighbors and grade school friends if they did not travel home from school for Thanksgiving. I think the school has to give them that weekend.

Travel - honestly, with how spread out the US and Canada are, I would almost go with staff members (or house elves?) apparating to students' houses and then side-alonging them to school. Like you said, anyone rural is going to have have a lot of travel to any kind of central meeting point. If each staff member got ... 6-8 kids - who were given a /very strict/ departure time to be ready by - it could all be done in an hour. And special luggage portkeys that don't work on anything living for the trunks, those could just be dropped on top before apparating.
