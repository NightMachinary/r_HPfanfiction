Unless the kid "visited friends" every T'giving, or you could say it was too expensive to fly them home for 4 days - yes, I would find it really strange if a neighbor's kid were in boarding school and didn't get T'giving off. Which would make me ask a /bunch/ of questions about the school, which is precisely what they want to avoid.
