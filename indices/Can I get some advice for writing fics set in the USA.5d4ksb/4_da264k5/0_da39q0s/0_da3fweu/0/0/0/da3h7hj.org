  Boarding. School. I think we're assuming a certain amount of money.

That's quite the assumption. A fair number of kids at boarding school are on financial aid (see: myself)

  And I'm pretty sure that any parents whose 11-year-old (or 14-year-old) is away from home for the first time would want that kid home for the first possible holiday.

I turned 10 at the end of my first term in boarding school, and I didn't go home for any in-term holidays. Admittedly this was not in the US, but there's a fair argument to be made that taking just a few days off just worsens homesickness and such when you get back.
