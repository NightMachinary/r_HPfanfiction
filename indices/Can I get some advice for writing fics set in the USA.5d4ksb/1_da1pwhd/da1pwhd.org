I think Homecoming would be a massive must-have, especially for muggle-borns. Thanksgiving holiday is typically off on the day and the day after, back to school Monday. Sometimes they give you a half day on the Wednesday as well. I would also assume that magical America has their own exams and would discourage magical people from assimilating back into the Muggle world, but allowances must be made.
