Eh, I would say drop Homecoming since there aren't any other schools. Students vs. alumni doesn't make sense as the whole point of Homecoming is that the alumni come to the school to watch the current students play. As much as Homecoming is a thing IRL, it makes zero sense in a context where there is only one school. If what you're looking for is a school dance type thing, Prom would be much more appropriate and easily incorporated.
