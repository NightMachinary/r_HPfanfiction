The most important thing about magical society in the Americas, in my mind, is what was going on with the magic users among the fifty million or so inhabitants that were present before colonization.

Either a) there was a Statute of Secrecy in the Americas at that time -- possibly also intercontinental trade preceding Christopher fucking Columbus -- or b) magical settlers sent over Obliviators in droves. In the first case, you'd also need that American Statute of Secrecy to be sufficiently strong that mages in the Americas simply didn't care enough to intervene when their muggle counterparts were being slaughtered or dying from smallpox.

That's to explain why magic isn't public while the Americas are full of white people, which is a bit of a prerequisite for what you're dealing with. And that will give you some insight into what you want your school to look like. The next step is to determine which European magic schools had members in which colonies to found schools (assuming any of them got a foothold).

You also need to determine how much influence nonmagical education has on the magical world. Do magical employers sometimes expect employees to have college degrees? Are a lot of students muggleborn? Are their parents involved in their education? Do mages often have muggle jobs? If so, magical schools will reflect muggle schools a lot. Otherwise, they'll diverge.

This is a rather complex topic, if you give it the attention it deserves.
