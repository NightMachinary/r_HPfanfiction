More considerations (since we talk about America, I will replace muggle with no-maj):

As of 1927, magical America was very isolationist, just like its no-maj counterpart. We know no-maj USA did a 180 degree on Isolationism during WW2, but what about magical America?

No-maj Americans are heavily armed. Attacking them carries significantly higher risk than attacking British muggles. America is also a far more violent country than Britain, with homicide rates at least 4 times higher.

Class distinction and family status are not nearly as important as in Britain. If you take a look at [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/201426/the-richest-people-in-america/][richest people in America 2016]], majority on that list are FIRST GENERATION billionaires. The Waltons (Wal-Mart) are 2nd generation, and only the Mars family inherited their wealth from more distant ancestors. Political dynasties are just as hard to establish. Clinton outspent Trump by 2 to 1 and still lost the recent election. Kennedys and Rockefellers are still on the scene, but they are hardly influential now.

Americans highly value individual achievements. Regardless how much your parents accomplished, if you are a loser you are still a loser. In fact, the society especially despises losers from rich/advantaged families. On the other hand, popular kids (usually with some good skills) often get a pass in schools, and they tend to be the bullies there.

Speaking of bullies, US schools began taking it seriously after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre][Columbine Massacre]] in 1999. In a country, where high school kids could get their hands on assault rifles easily, bullying your fellow students carries a very SIGNIFICANT risk. You never know when you pushed your victim too far. Then in 2010, a British girl named Phoebe Prince committed suicide following months of bullying in a US high school ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Phoebe_Prince][Phoebe Prince Case]]). That was the point where most US schools started cracking down on bullying hard. I have two children who have been going to several schools (due to moves) since 2010, and ALL their schools take bullying very seriously.

I speak mostly from my own experiences. The US is a large country with significant differences across geographic regions. I personally spent most of my lives in California and Colorado, with an interlude in Texas.
