I think it's just the term "fall break" I didn't know. I knew getting Thanskgiving Day weekend off was a thing; it makes sense to extend that to a full week if you're going to have a mid-term break. I've just heard a lot more about spring break, probably because that's the "exciting" one. (I like crime dramas; spring break apparently makes for a good time to kill people, especially all those partying college kids.)
