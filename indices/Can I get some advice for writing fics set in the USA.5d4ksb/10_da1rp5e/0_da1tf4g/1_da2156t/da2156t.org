My highschool and my college had a week off for fall break - in October. It was almost exactly the same as spring break, but yes less party trips. I think this must be regional because it sounds like [[/u/silvercookiedust][u/silvercookiedust]] doesn't know of it? I grew up in Chicago and we had it and now I live in Hawaii and schools here have it.
