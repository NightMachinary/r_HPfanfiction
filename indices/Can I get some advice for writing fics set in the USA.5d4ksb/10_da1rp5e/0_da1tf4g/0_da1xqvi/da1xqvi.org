Fall break, which is often called Thanksgiving break, is generally only three days off school. Thanksgiving is always on the fourth Thursday of November, so we get Thanksgiving off, the Wednesday before it, so people can travel, the Friday after it, and then adding the following weekend, that's what fall break is. If people do travel, it's to see family, not to go to beaches like on spring break.
