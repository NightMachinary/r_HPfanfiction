1) Thanksgiving I think would definitely be celebrated. Not sure about how old Ilvermorny is and if it pre-dates colonization, but if muggleborns attend, there is definitely thanksgiving. FWIW, Canadians also celebrate thanksgiving but theirs is in October wheras the US thanksgiving is at the end of Nov. A lot of private schools in the US have "fall break" so maybe you could have that fall over Canadian thanksgiving so that those kids could go home and then have the school celebrate US thanksgiving with a couple days off etc.

Homecoming is an American high-school and college tradition that is celebrated in the fall (every school sets their own "homecoming weekend") where there is typically an American football game played (this could be substituted for that American quidditch thing) and a lot of alumni come back for the game and/or the whole weekend. Also most schools host reunions for the classes that graduated 10 years ago, 20 years ago and so on during homecoming weekend. In highschool there is oftentimes a homecoming king and queen crowned (usually seniors voted by the rest of the school) as well as a homecoming court (all of the people nominated). IIRC, the movie Mean Girls has a pretty accurate depiction of homecoming. The homecoming dance is only attended by students, not all of the alumni who come back.

2) Getting to school - I think you should do something similar to hogwarts where all the students go together after meeting at one checkpoint (like platform 93/4). We do not have a great train system in the US, but having everyone meet at a "secret" terminal or gate in Boston International Airport would make sense. It could have a floo for magical kids and muggleborns and their parents could just fly there like regular muggles do. For poor kids maybe add in a line that those tickets are paid for by the school.
