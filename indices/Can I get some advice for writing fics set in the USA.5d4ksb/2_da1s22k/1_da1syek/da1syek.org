Also Homecoming is a school dance centered around the 'school spirit' high school football (not your football, our US football üèà) game. Football season is in the fall, Homecoming usually is in the early middle part of the season (early October/late September), and the homecoming dance is preceded by various school spirit activities throughout the week.

Labor Day is a holiday celebrating the triumphs of labor unions in securing collective rights for their workers. Wizards shouldn't celebrate it. Also Veteran's Day only was created after WW1 or WW2, unless the wizarding community seriously participated in those wars, they shouldn't celebrate it. (Those are both banking days in the US and federal employees have time off.) the Fourth of July is tricky. If wizards were involved and fought against UK wizards during the American revolution (reasonable) then yes, celebrate it. But more to the point the Fourth of July is on summer holidays so Ilvermorny shouldn't be hosting a school celebration anyway.

Also most schools are out by the beginning of June/end of May, I still don't know when U.K. schools get out but I think Hogwarts ends later than us. 2.5 months for summer holidays is usual. September 1st is a late start for us but some schools do begin right after Labor Day (wtf those people). Depends, again, on the state.
