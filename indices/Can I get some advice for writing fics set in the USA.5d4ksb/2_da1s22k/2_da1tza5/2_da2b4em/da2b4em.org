On the topic of trains going up the side of a mountain, it actually /has/ been done, just with specialized equipment, and purely for tourist use: the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitou_and_Pike%27s_Peak_Railway][cog railway]] climbs Pikes Peak, a mountain on the far eastern side of the Rockies. I imagine with the addition of magic the feat might require a bit less in the way of specialized equipment.
