I thought Thanksgiving /did/ have heavy religous connotations, which is why I thought wizards wouldn't celebrate,* but if it's not then I can see it happening. I did read about the issues it had regards Native Americans, but Pottermore says Ilvermorny had a lot of interaction with Native Americans in the early days so I certainly think they're more equal about these things.

(* I know Hogwarts does Christmas, but that's as much a cultural holiday as a religious one.)

I hadn't realised trains were such a big thing. I dismissed them because (a) I felt it'd be too much like the Hogwarts Express; (b) it'd take so long; and (c) it has to get up a mountain.

That info about boarding schools is good to know. I went to one by choice and over here it's mostly seen as snobby thing to do. Definitely different attitude to yours!
