  4) boarding schools are really, really unusual in the USA. There are some really expensive college prep ones (mostly in the Northeast) for rich kids, but overall, kids who go to boarding schools are assumed to be juvenile delinquents being shipped off to military boarding schools to straighten them out. I went to a state run boarding school for gifted students in the south and the first reaction I usually get when I tell people that I went to boarding school is "holy shit what did you do wrong?!". Ha. So be sure to work that in, because 'I'll send you to boarding school if you don't shape up' is a common threat to keep kids in line here and Ilvermorny students will have to explain over and over to their family and friends that it's a 'college prep' boarding school, not one for juvenile delinquents.

Haha, I didn't even consider that. I have a friend who finished high school in a boarding school. The high school where she lived was terrible, so she applied to a pretty good one down south somewhere and got in.
