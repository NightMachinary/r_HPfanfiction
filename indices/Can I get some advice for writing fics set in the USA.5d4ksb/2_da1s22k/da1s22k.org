1) thanksgiving actually makes sense for wizards to celebrate. It's a nonreligious feast holiday celebrating peace and cooperation between native Americans and European settlers in one colony. The meaning behind it can be easily exported to wizarding good relations between native wizards and immigrant wizards. However, most Native Americans have very mixed feelings about Thanksgiving because after the tradition was established the settlers kept moving west and killing and relocating Native Americans and claiming their land. So the argument can be made that Thanksgiving is a holiday that gives lip service to cooperation with natives while not actually living those principles. But if Ilvermorny actually respects native students and traditions Thanksgiving could be less of a one-sided affair.

2) Trains would be the most reasonable and historically accurate choice. The USA had an extensive rail network that we were very proud of (e.g. the First Transcontinental Railroad was dedicated at completion by a US President), and freight railroads in the US are still the best/among the best in the world. Passenger rail declined or was bought up and destroyed by car companies in the 1920s/30s to encourage car sales but magical train lines could have been easily hidden from automobile companies. Railroads have a bit of folklore around them in the US; folks often packed their belongings and waited at the train station to be picked up and whisked away to a new life. After the Civil War, reconstructionists came down to the south on railroads with everything they owned in carpetbags (ergo the nickname carpetbaggers). Settlement of the western US usually involved taking the train as far west as it could go and then traveling on foot the rest of the way. (Stories of actually magical railroads are not abundant however.) The Boxcar Children is a hugely popular old US children's book series based on four children running away and living in an abandoned railroad boxcar until they're adopted by their previously unknown kind old grandfather. Etc.

3) there are standard exams but usually the results affect the teachers more than the students. State funding to the school is determined by how well students do on the tests (the better the grades, the more money they get... yes, it is fucked up and a self perpetuating cycle and public schools close when their students don't do well, leading to scared teachers teaching to the test and outright teacher-encouraged cheating.) All the standardized tests are set by the state however. And they're all different in every state. Only about half the states have school leaving exams, otherwise everything is determined by GPA. The nationally standardized tests like the SAT are college entrance exams, which are way better set than state testing. In the US our universities are much better run, testing-wise, than our mandated public education because public education falls under state purview and it's a mishmash of state testing but college standardized material falls under national standards/national degree certification organizations.

So if you include an occasional (every 3/4 years) set of standardized tests that the teachers are more nervous about than the students are, that would be a nice little call out to US K-12 culture. You have GPAs, extra credit, and high school graduation correct.

4) boarding schools are really, really unusual in the USA. There are some really expensive college prep ones (mostly in the Northeast) for rich kids, but overall, kids who go to boarding schools are assumed to be juvenile delinquents being shipped off to military boarding schools to straighten them out. I went to a state run boarding school for gifted students in the south and the first reaction I usually get when I tell people that I went to boarding school is "holy shit what did you do wrong?!". Ha. So be sure to work that in, because 'I'll send you to boarding school if you don't shape up' is a common threat to keep kids in line here and Ilvermorny students will have to explain over and over to their family and friends that it's a 'college prep' boarding school, not one for juvenile delinquents.
