A lot of these posts have been informative about Muggle America but what they're lacking is advice on how to translate that into a magical system.

For example, with Hogwarts JKR took the Muggle tradition of using letter-based grades (A, B, C...) and gave it a magical twist (O, E, A...). A largely similar system but with a more eccentric angle.

Similarly, if you're going to be taking inspiration from GPAs in American schools, just using the GPA system wholesale feels a bit too Muggle. Just like Hogwarts, I feel like you should take the system and give it an eccentric twist to make it feel more magical. So, for example, we know that there are such things as magical numbers. Seven is the most magical number, five is also a magical number but less so than seven, and six has traditionally been associated with bad things. So you could make it so that getting a GPA of 5 is decent, getting a GPA of 6 is disastrous, and getting a GPA of 7 is genius-level unheard of.
