Canadian adding my two cents, eh?

1) As mentioned before, Canadian Thanksgiving is in October to celebrate the typical harvest time. We here in the great white north celebrate (and when I say celebrate I mean these are days off from work/school or constitute stat holidays) Christmas, Boxing Day, NY Day, Family Day (varies from province to province), Victoria Day, Canada Day (July 1), Heritage Day (the name is different in each province), Labour Day, Remembrance Day and various provincial days spread throughout the year, though my knowledge of them is scant at best. In short, yeah, I think American wizards would totally celebrate Thanksgiving based on it's cultural/historical roots. From what I've gathered Ilvermorny has Celtic and Native American influences so it could be a nice marriage of the notion that European witches and wizards came over with the explorers.

2) Transport... Oh man. What a gong show. I can't stress how imaginative you'll need to be for this one. Imagine driving from France to somewhere in the far Middle East and you've approximately got the distance it would take me to get from my home to Massachusetts. Canada has decent rail-lines but it would be a two day trip minimum. Not to mention most cities (especially out west) don't have passenger train stations. Speaking as someone who flew pre 9/11 I can tell you it was easier but cost prohibitive. Flying to America from parts of Canada is absurd, and it always have. I could pay $200 more and fly across an ocean for the price it costs me to fly across a continent.

It's magic, so use your imagination!

3) I have no idea what homecoming is. That's an American thing. While it's true, we play hockey and a lot of it (too much but I'm just bitter they don't show the same amount of basketball) our love of high school football is much smaller and far less fanatical than our southern neighbour. We have school dances, that's still cool. But homecoming and prom is foreign (to me the prairie girl, anyhow).

4) As a tidbit of culture, you've underestimated the French Canadian component of Canada. They're weird (to me) but they're still Canadian, and they... Are stubborn. Incredibly stubborn, particularly in regards to language. On more than one instance they've refused to speak English to me when my (admittedly horrendous) French is exhausted. Terribly frustrating, and often rude, the French Canadians are probably less likely to trot off to some English speaking school run by Americans. I think they'd rather be shot.

5) Schooling is all over the place all throughout Canada. Here in Alberta, primary school is kindergarten (usually age 5) to grade 6 (typically age 12), junior high is grade 7 (age 13) to grade 9 (age 15) and high school grade 10 (age 16) to grade 12 (age 18). There used to be provincial exams in grade 3, 6, 9, and 12 but I think they got rid of the primary and junior high school exams (not 100% on this) and kept the grade 12 exams.

We've gone through several grading schemes here but from my time in school (in the 1990s! I'm old) was 1-5 system, 1 being you're a functioning vegetable and 5 being supreme being of child-like genius. Not quite so drastic but you get the idea. Junior high and high school used grade percentages and we did not use letter grade/GPA scale. That's university level stuff. I will make a mention to semesters because I know that hasn't been mentioned yet. Canadian semesters (at least in university) differ from American. We here start school in the fall after the Labour Day weekend and end school in the spring in April. Primary and secondary school go from late August/September-late June.

Canadians don't have an SAT so its individual to each province how to test students but we all take similar courses (english, math, social studies, science(s), phys-ed) that university's base entrance on. We also have vocational schools for students who don't belong in academia and would rather get a trade.

Also lets not forget that there is another school in America! The Salem Witches Academy was quoted in GoF (I could have gotten the name wrong-- its 3am) so I can assume there's other, smaller schools scattered around the USA. Most importantly I think Canada would have its own school, and knowing the French, probably more than one.

Logistically, even counting in magic, it would be nigh impossible to get a student from White Horse/Yellowknife/Iqualit/Churchill/Flin Flon etc... to Massachusettes. With such a small population spread across a huge landmass it would be difficult to say the least to get remote students to the school. Kids from eastern provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, PEI, Newfoundland/Labrador/New Brunswick) could have an easier time getting there. Plus I feel like we'd have our own ministry, and therefore our own schools, laws and traditions in wizarding Canada, but that's me.

Culturally speaking:

- North Americans drive a lot. It's a car-based culture-- public transit on the European scale isn't quite there yet everywhere (major US/Canadian cities excluded)

- Line up, not queue

- Check not cheque

- Soccer not football

- Apologize v apologise -- Americans use Z instead of S

- We typically live in suburbs, not in city centers

- legal drinking age is 21 (USA) and 19 in all but 2 provinces (18 in Alberta and Quebec); bars/pubs are closed to minors

- metric/american (kilometers to miles, liters to gallons etc...)

- baffling soda/pop/coke debate: pop is the usual nomenclature used for fizzy drinks in Canada and some northern states; soda is American nomenclature. Coke is a purely southern American thing that is a blanket statement for ALL fizzy drinks.

- tea is drunk here but not the way it should be. It can be cold, cold and sweet, with shit bits of candy in it. You name it, we have a tea that tastes like it

- gas/gasoline not petrol

Speaking of just Canadians here:

- poutine is real but not an everyday thing-- and it's fries, gravy and cheese curds ONLY

- We don't say eh, but we do apologise a lot (sorry)

- Canadians still use the u in honour, behaviour, colour etc... but it's acceptable not to as well

- centre not center, theatre not theater, liter not litre

Best of luck!
