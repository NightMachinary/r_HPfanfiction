  Interesting info about French Canadians. I guess in that case they probably do have their own school.

I wouldn't be surprised if the French Canadians had their own /ministry/

  While I knew they used them, is it common to refer to imperial units as American?
#+end_quote

As far as I know, imperial units are all together different than American (this is what my parents have told me countless times anyhow), and it is referred to /generally/ as American and /not/ Imperial. However, being as it's a school in America, I don't think the distinction should come up. Miles are miles, right? (I think so... I'm sure somewhere I'm completely off the mark)

  ... are you sure you don't say "eh"?

Haha sometimes the stereotype is a good lead-in. I personally don't know anyone who says it, but I'm in the prairies and my surroundings are more 'redneck' than 'east coast fishing village.' Here you're more likely to hear people say y'all, yeehaw and howdy than eh. However Canadians /do/ say it, unknowingly, all of the time and it's probably the biggest character flaw we have as a nation.
