Thanks, I appreciate getting a lengthy Canadian opinion!

The Salem Witches Institute isn't actually a school according to JKR. She's said on Twitter that it's like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Institutes][Women's Institute]]. She only revealed that last year though and so many people assumed SWI was a school before then. I've used it as such in previous fics, but I'm trying to keep this one in line with the new information from Pottermore, which says there's only 11 major magic schools in the whole world (of which we know the names and locations of 8). Any others aren't registered with the international education body and are "often short-lived and poorly-regulated" and of questionable quality. Apparently home-schooling is a big thing among wizards.

Interesting info about French Canadians. I guess in that case they probably do have their own school.

While I knew they used them, is it common to refer to imperial units as American?

  Canadian adding my two cents, eh?
