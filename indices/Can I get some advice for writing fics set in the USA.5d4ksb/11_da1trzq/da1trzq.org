1) Thanksgiving

I do not think that magic folk would celebrate it bc in the USA it is used as a way to ease guilt about the genocide of Native Americans. Magic settlers in America seem to have been more afraid of muggles than Natives. I think that the entire magic traditin would be a celebration of fusing cultures. Perhaps, however, the founding of Ilvermorny would be considered a comparable celebration to Thanksgiving. Isolt taught Native children wandwork, and Native children taught Isolt and company their magic traditions (left ambiguous by Rowling). Certainly, foods were also exchanged, like turkey. protip: we spell it Halloween. And probably magic people would still celebrate the fourth of July.

2) Travel

Honestly, I think something like the Knightbus would work. Buses are a relatively popular mode of transportation here. Buses based on region (a west coast bus, a mid west bus, an east coast bus, a southern bus and then east/mid/west Canadian buses).

3) GPAs

You've got it right, mostly. Schools decide what constitutes an A, B, C , D and F. Not teachers. Typically an A is 100-90, a B is 89-80, a C is 79-75, a D is a 74-70 and an F is a 69 or below. This is variable, of course, and I think Ilvermorny would have a different grading system. SAT or ACT are national aptitude tests that are intended to give intellect a number, to rank students. Most (probably 95%) require it, and then those that don't ony waive the requirement if GPA is high enough.

As far as Homecoming/Prom are concerned, it's really just a school-sponsored social event coinciding with the (american) football season. I suppose Ilvermorny could have similar celebrations for the beginning and end of the Quodpot season.
