I think the single biggest thing is how drastically people from different parts of the country talk. I mean, I know that the UK has a bunch of variations in accent and manner of speech, now extrapolate that to a country the size of all of Europe. Like, it'd be weird if someone from Chicago say "y'all" and it'd be weird to have someone from Dallas say "you guys". And it'd be weird for anybody to say "yinz", but people from Pittsburgh do anyway.

Then, of course, the different ethnic groups in the US often speak in vastly different ways, to the point where linguists consider African American Vernacular to be its own dialect of English. Then you've got hispanic people, who often use both Spanish and English interchangeably, and mix words and phrases from both together. This is a generalization, obviously, but there have been entire academic papers written on the subject, and I'm not interested in writing another.

The speech differences across the US are incredible.
