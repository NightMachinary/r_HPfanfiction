This is quite a project you have here, so I guess I will try to answer your questions in order.

1. Absolutely. Thanksgiving is pretty huge here. It's a time to be with family and celebrate our blessings (traditionally even if you aren't religious you go around the dinner table and say one or more things you are thankful for). So at least the muggleborns should get time off.

2. You can do literally whatever you want. Floo stations, obstacle courses, ride thestrals, leprechauns, Knight Bus V2(though this is rather lame), goblins who are nice, whatever you want. Make it an efficient and believable system. Or don't, it's up to you.

3. You got it. I think the most widely accepted GPA standard is out of 4,, with 4=A, 3=B, 2=C and so on. Some classes like gym are oftentimes pass/fail

4. Issues: I don't think you need to talk about anything you don't want to. They're kids, and what comes up between kids, especially without their parents, is completely up to the authors creativity. So you could have a racist southern white kid/Mexican/black/Asian whatever slowly come to terms with it, or you could have nothing like that at all. You can have a kid from Michigan ask how to purify water, or a Native American kid use different magic. The one thing we are not is uniform. Though we tend to have a lot of state pride, and enjoy sports a whole lot. Some kids are taught how to shoot a gun at a young age, some kids are beat quite handily, some kids grow up in extremely strict households (religious or military parents), some kids are spoiled brats (west coast vegan no corporal punishment culture). Just inserting some common stereotypes for you to use.
