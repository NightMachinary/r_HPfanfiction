Graduation from high school is dependent on passing grades in the primary focus classes: Four years of English and Math, two years of Science, and two or three years of Social Studies. At least two years of passing grades in another language are often required as well. Participation in some form of Physical Education each year is often an added requirement that will prevent a student from being given a diploma if unfulfilled. Being in the marching band or part of the yearbook team can often substitute for this.

The societal purpose of high school in the 90's is to keep under-18's off the street and busy so they won't cause trouble- literacy and a sense of citizenship are predicted side-effects. The high-school diploma is necessary for entrance to universities, colleges, trade schools and/or military service, although a student can elect to bypass all that by taking a GED [Graduate-Equilvalent Diploma] test. GED's are looked down upon compared to diplomas as they usually are done by those who got into some form of trouble that prevented normal attendance in regular school: jail, prolonged illness or pregnancy. Exceptions are for those who were home-schooled or that took the GED so that they can attend University before they turn 18. They're not considered damaged goods- they're just weird.

So, really, anyone attending Ilvermorny would be most likely to 'take the GED's after being home-schooled'.

Aside from that, I recommend the works of Inverarity, starting with linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle).
