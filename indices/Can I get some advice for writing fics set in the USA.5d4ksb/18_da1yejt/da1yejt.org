As someone living in Canada here's my take: GPA is not so relevant before college, but you can add it if you like. It makes school a very competitive environment, as it's not only your grade, but your average versus that of the class which will be computed in order to give you your GPA.\\
So a student getting an A- in a class where the average is A may end up with a lesser GPA at the end of the year than someone getting a B+ in a class where the average is F or D-.\\
If you fail a class, the grade is 0, even if you were two points under the passing grade.\\
You have two GPAs, also. One given at the end of semester and one given close to the start of september of the following year, which gives the opportunity for those who fail a class in a semester to take it again in the next semester (winter/summer) and score a better grade, which will erase the previous one.\\
However, the GPA given in september is a permanent mark on your record and even if you take the failed class and pass it, you will simply have a 0 and the additional mark counting toward your GPA.

People, at the middle of a semester, can also choose the DISC a class so that it counts as abandonned in your record, but prevent the F.
