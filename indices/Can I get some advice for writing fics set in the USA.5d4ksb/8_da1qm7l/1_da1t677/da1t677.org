  I'm sure there are some cultural differences between how certain characters may act depending where they are from in the States. This may show in dialect as well. Depending on where your characters are from, they may use different words for similar things (soda/pop/soda pop, etc). Just some stuff to keep in mind in that regard.

I hadn't considered that. I'll look more into it, especially for the main characters. Thanks.
