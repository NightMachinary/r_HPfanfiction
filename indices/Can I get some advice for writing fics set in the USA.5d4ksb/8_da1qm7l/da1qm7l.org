  There are no national exams (like GCSEs / OWLs) but SATs can be taken by choice and are often required by colleges.

While it is true that there are no national exams, the same is not true at the state level. These exams are required to graduate from high school. As for the SAT, there is a choice between SATs and ACTs, and most colleges accept both scores, or whichever is better. These scores are then used for placement in courses at universities.

I'm sure there are some cultural differences between how certain characters may act depending where they are from in the States. This may show in dialect as well. Depending on where your characters are from, they may use different words for similar things (soda/pop/soda pop, etc). Just some stuff to keep in mind in that regard.
