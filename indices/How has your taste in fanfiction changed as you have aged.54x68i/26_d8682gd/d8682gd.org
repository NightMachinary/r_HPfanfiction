When I first started reading Harry Potter fanfiction, some 7 years ago, I loved canon compliant, clearly based from the books fanfiction, preferably focusing on Hinny or not showing the romance at all. (I never could stand Romione)

Then after six months or so, I got sucked into different stories that didn't so obviously play to the canon, as that is very stifling to ones creative sense. I reread the books during this period, and began to see things from a Harmony point of view, because as a kid, I had always figured Hermione and Harry would get together (and reading the sixth book, I had thought this would happen when it showed Ron and Lavender acting like their only source of oxygen was each other's mouths), and in the earlier books it could have so easily gone either way.

Which, rather unfortunately lead to my love of bashing fics, as they were the ones that tended to mainly be Harmony, and focus on those two, rather than canon pairings. They remain my guilty pleasure, and I can't help but love a good bash fic every now and again.

Which leads to my newer tastes in the fandom, mainly crossovers, crossovers, and more crossovers. The Girl Who Loved, is one of my absolute favorites, but the story that really lead to my love of Harry Potter crossovers, was some RWBY/HP crossover that wasn't particularly well written, and was Harry/Yang/Blake, it was bad, but it opened up the world of crossover, and from thereon in, I was hooked.

Crossovers are still my favorite genre of HP fanfiction, but I also love fix it, redo, or time travel stories, especially ones where Sirius lives, if nothing else, and my Harry ship still tends to be Harmony, but I am leaning more towards just crack ships, or Harry x girl from whatever it's crossed with. (HARRY X USAGI 4LYFE)

I cannot stand slash though, and I'm bi. It's weird, I just hate it to the point it has ruined otherwise perfectly good stories, except the slash destroys it.

I guess too many of them are just "Oh by the way, Harry is gay, oh by the way, Harry is gay, oh by the way, Harry is gay" or they just destroy Harry's character and make him submissive or overly dominant, and just generally don't know how a gay relationship works. (HINT HINT IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS A STRAIGHT ONE WITH DOUBLE THE PENISES!)

Oh dear lord, this isn't a comment, it's become an essay, with a writing style stolen from Rex Harrison.
