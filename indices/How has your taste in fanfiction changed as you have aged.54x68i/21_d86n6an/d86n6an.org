I started reading fanfiction when I was 12, which is 12-13 years ago. I would sort by pairing and then browse through all 40 pages of hermione/Draco on ff.net and read through every summary and click anything that was remotely interesting. There was no sort by reviews and i read sooo many bad stories lol.. The first story I ever followed was linkffn(parenting class by icypanther) and I used to wake up early every Monday or whatever before school to read her update. She was always always on time with her weekly update lol!

Then I started getting into Harry/Draco in high school and reading more rated M stuff because a lot of my friends were into Yaoi. And I guess due to teen angst I became drawn to really dramatic fics where Harry is traumatized and I stopped reading fics with pairings and only read Harry abuse .... And when I became less angsty I focused on friendship or family themed fics which led to time travel and AUs so Harry could meet his parents ... Which led to getting interested in political fics and crossovers.... And then master of death fics since MoD!Harry is featured in a lot of crossovers ...

In the beginning, I read basically any fic with any plot but now I like to read canon-compliant fics or EWE out of loyalty to the books I guess. I also used to read character bashing but I can't read that anymore and love to see a close knit trio. And I don't like to read romance unless the characters are of age. I can deal with poor writing and love cliches though, hehe
