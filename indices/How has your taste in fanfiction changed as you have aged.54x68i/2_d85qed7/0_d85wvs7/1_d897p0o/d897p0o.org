I mostly read buffy fics on Twisting the Hellmouth, so a lot of crossovers were involved. The stargate crossovers have all blended in my mind, but here's some others.

Faith centered Rome crossover. Requires little to no knowledge of the show(I thought it was massively overrated), haven't read the sequels.

Ginny becomes a Slayer during the battle of Hogwarts. Diane Castle is a good writer, and has that rare ability to write long fics without it getting tiring.

This one is pure Harry Potter, without the magic. Sounds horrible, but it is good. Slightly OP Hermione, but it makes sense in the setting.

One of the few Stargate crossovers that isn't total crap.

One of the few time travel fics that is good. Veronica Mars crossover. Only nitpick is that the villain doesn't feel world ending.

Mediancat is also a decent author. The best way to look around is to try a few stories, and then check out the authors and their favourites.

Sorry for the short list, but it has been so long since I've read any Buffy fics, and I didn't have an account to keep track of stuff. There was a Star Trek crossover where Buffy is brought out of cryostasis, a couple of decent Firefly crossovers featuring Spike and Faith I think, one where postcanon Xander joins the Stargate program after he escapes possession.

Finally, here's a Worm crossover that is sadly unfinished. I never rec unfinished stories, but this is one of my all time favorites, and has so much potential.
