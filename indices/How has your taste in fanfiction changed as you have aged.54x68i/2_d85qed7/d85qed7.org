I only started reading around 4-5 years ago, and that was mostly Buffy fanfic. I've always been a massive bookworm, and an English major, so I had somewhat high standards(read:always hated bashing).

Did the same for Buffy, and I only read a few fics that had the common badly done tropes,(Buffy and team fix everything, everyone else is incompetent etc). I learned how to read the warning signs after a few stargate crossovers and one harry potter crossover. Then I found out about the tvtropes rec lists, and read a ton of Buffy fanfic from there. Read HPMOR, which I liked(in parts, not the ending and definitely not the beginning).

Then I got into Worm and Worm fanfiction for a few years, and the standard of writing was way better, and I enjoyed even the fix fics,(because the original story is kind of depressing, especially if you marathon it). If anyone knows sites with similar or higher standards than spacebattles and sufficient velocity, please tell me. Any fandom goes.

I only started reading Harry Potter fanfic properly after Seventh Horcrux, Harry's Island Home, and Applied Cultural Anthropology. I only read fics that are recommended here(and some authors' fav lists) now.

I still like almost all the fics I used to, except the tropes I feel are overdone. Rather than age, being repetitive puts me off of some stories. Some I've barely run into are Master of Death Harry, and marriage contracts. Might be a few stories I could enjoy in there before I get tired of it.
