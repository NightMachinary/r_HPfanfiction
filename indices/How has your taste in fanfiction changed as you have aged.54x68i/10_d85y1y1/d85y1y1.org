I've become more focussed on how I can give better reviews.

99% of the time (and this is barely an exaggeration), whenever I click a review page for a story I loved, there are only brief lines of support or questions about the frequency of updates. I'd like to be more helpful, so I try to point out areas of specific description, dialogue, or narration that I enjoyed.
