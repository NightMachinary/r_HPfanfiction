Almost everything has changed. I started out fascinated by dark!Harry fics where every character the author didn't like was bashed into oblivion. Most of them were Harry/Hermione, which has also changed completely, as Hermione is a character I'm not particularly fond of nowadays.

I think the biggest determining factor that changed over time, apart from my ability to recognize quality writing, would have to be my choice of setting. I severely struggle to read fics set in Hogwarts these days; they all read like the same thing, and I have a hard time getting interested in them. Because of that I tend to prefer fics that, whether post-war or contemporaneous to canon, take place elsewhere.

I also made complete flips in my opinion of certain characters, primarily Dumbledore, who is now my favourite, as well as Snape and Draco, who are firmly in the dislike category where they belong.

I'll still give almost any fic a chance, though. It's kind of hypocritical of me, but even after talking about learning to recognize quality writing, I still get the days where I just want to lie down and read a nonsense soul-bond fic.
