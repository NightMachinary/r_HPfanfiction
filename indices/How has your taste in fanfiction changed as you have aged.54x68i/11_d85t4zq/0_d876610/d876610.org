I sorta agree with what you said about the choice of setting, but I also feel that it goes back to the repetitiveness of canon-rehashing. It seems like the fics that I enjoy the most now are fics that are AU in some way. The more AU the better.

Although Hogwarts centric fics for me are can still be fine as long as they focus on less "canony" events.
