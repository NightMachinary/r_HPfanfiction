I started really young with Sailor Moon fanfiction. I cared more about adventure than romance and I liked het best, also being extremely young I only wanted young characters. Then I got into Gundam Wing fanfiction and discovered slash and romance. Once I got into Harry Potter I was sort of a veteran Fic reader, but it still took a while for me to care about adult characters. I still prefer slash over het any day and I have a higher standard for quality. I used to be able to read anything as long as i got more story and now if it's badly written I'll quit it immediately without thought.
