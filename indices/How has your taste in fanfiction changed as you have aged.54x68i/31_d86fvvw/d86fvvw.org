In this fandom, gen fic is my favorite "genre" since I have minimal tolerance for shipping these days -- though I do enjoy a good rare pair, now and and again.

I like extreme AUs, crossovers, OCs, short fics, and crackfics more than I used to. Part of this is probably because they tend to be more inventive than /Canon Rehash No. 9286/.

Bashing and senseless OOC is a good way to get me to stop reading. Same goes for cutesy author's notes that have more plot than the story or aren't otherwise treated as footnotes or update notes.
