Well, I've only been into it for about half a year, but in the beginning I prefered "lost moments" kind of fics, like /Not from others/ and post-war canon fics, and then I moved on to time travel fics, but now I prefer AUs (those that go off a tangent at a certain point) invovling some of the following characters: Sirius Black, Narcissa Malfoy (like in The Merging), N. Tonks (girlfriend, mentor, "big sister", whatever) and Remus Lupin.

I've still got a weakness for the "Marauder's Era" time travels though, as long as it's not Harry going back and calling the teenagers Lily Evans and James Potter "mum" and "dad". Turning of the Sun, where he's a Ravenclaw in the year above them (and Dumbledore's a really cool bloke), whose best friends are Xeno Lovegood and other Ravenclaws, as well as Frank Longbottom, Edgar Bones and ... Bellatrix Black (I don't think even the author predicted that one), is my favourite at the moment. And I enjoy A Mishap and an Opportunity too, where it's him (a 'partial' metamorph this time) and "his twin sister Jocelyn" (Tonks) who are going back (131k words in and no one's the wiser about their identities).

As for ships, my preferences have gone from Harry/Ginny to Harry/Tonks. Ginny's still a better match than Hermione though, at least towards the end of book 6, after the sectumsemprea incident.
