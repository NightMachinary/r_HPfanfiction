I pretty much kept the same taste from high school compared to now. I like reading rape, unexpected pregnancy and younger characters with older characters. Drarry has always been my OTP but Snape/ Hermione or Hermione/ Lucius has grown on me. If a fanfiction is too "perfect" with not enough drama or meaningless plot/ sex I can't read it.
