I'm with you I have been reading since 2008 and have found that my taste in fanfiction stories has changed a lot. When I first started reading like you I was rebellious but I was also dealing with depression so many of the fics I read had themes of depression.

As I have grown older and become more mature I think my taste has changed as well. I now love fics where Harry finds family or goes back and is a father figure. I think age is a factor in the way that most people mature as they get older and find their tastes changing.
