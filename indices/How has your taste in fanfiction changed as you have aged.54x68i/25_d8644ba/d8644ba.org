we're going to ignore that bit of time I shipped Granger/Snape, mmmkay? (well, except for that one series that amused me).\\
I'm also not particularly a fan of H/HR anymore. I /do/ like the 'Harry fucks off and does his own thing' trope, but Hermione being the only one on his side gets old. Especially if they go with some unrequited confession or other.
