I used to like fics where everyone lived happily ever after. But as I grew older and started writing my own short stories and began attempting a novel(Still in Progress), I discovered that I have a penchant for quite downtrodden endings, or even just realistic endings based upon events. So fics where after 7 years of war, trauma at school, many years of an at least negligent if not outright abusive family, Harry just wants to escape, or has a total mental breakdown that's great it's realistic, and a bit depressing, cause you now what, life often is depressing, it's how we deal with it that makes the happy moments. If Harry and Co. deal with their issues like adults than that's even better.

It's one of the things I've actually come to dislike about canon, very few of the things that Harry has occur to him affect him on a deep emotional or mental level, 10 years of negligence bordering on abuse, nah it's cool I got friends now, oh shit a teacher died cause of me, not gonna be erased by one platitude from Dumbledore. It goes on like this throughout Harry's time at Hogwarts and there's some mental backlash in Order of the Pheonix over Cedric's death, and then again over Sirius' death, but not to the level it should be.
