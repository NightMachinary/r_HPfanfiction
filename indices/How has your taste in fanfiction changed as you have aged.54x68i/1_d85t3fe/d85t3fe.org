I've only been reading HP fanfiction for about a year now, but I've gone through hundreds of fics -- a 150k+ might take me two days. I'll give anything a chance still, though bad grammar and spelling might make me close out a fic.

I can't think of too many tropes or styles that I really can't stand -- maybe when Hermione reads like a boy-obsessed middle schooler when she's supposed to be 17 and has lived through a war. Or when the protagonist continuously makes bad decisions and doesn't learn from their mistakes. Characters need to make reasonable decisions based on what they know at the time. Extreme OOC also will make me drop a fic.

The biggest change in my taste seems to be sex scenes. If a man's penis is said to be coming from his waist, I just roll my eyes and close out the fic. Come on people, that's basic anatomy, you obviously have access to the internet to post the fic, look up a picture of a naked person if you haven't already seen one.

My favorite sex scenes are the more "realistic" ones. Give me slightly awkward first-time sex, someone getting a cramp, the girl not always having an orgasm (or multiples), someone complaining about sex being messy, or characters that are supposed to be comfortable with each other being able to laugh with each other when someone falls over changing positions. Finding sex scenes like any of those are rare, though, so I make do with what I can find.
