In some ways I have gotten more discerning in my fanfic. I personally enjoy divergence fanfic and will just drop a story as soon as divergence points are added that aren't included in the premise (i.e. what if harry was sorted into hufflepuff, oh BTW in chapter 4 I'm gonna just throw in an older Malfoy sibling just cause.) With so many stories out there I don't suffer through hoping it will turn out well eventually, and instead move on the next.

In other ways I have gotten less discerning. Two ideas stand out, one being the pairing focus of the story, as now I will branch further out from what I initially liked, probably because I identify less with any given character so the pairing doesn't have to center on them. The other is an acceptance of lower quality mechanical elements of the story, such as spelling and grammar, up to a point. The content of the story has become more important than the periodic use of an incorrect verb tense.
