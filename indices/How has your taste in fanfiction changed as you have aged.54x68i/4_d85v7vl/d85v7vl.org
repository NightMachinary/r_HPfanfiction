I won't tolerate fridging or certain types of sexism these days. I'm almost to the point of rejecting overly generic female characters, but that would leave me with very few fics to read. I pretty much automatically reject harem fics, in part because it's almost invariably blatant wish fulfillment in lieu of proper character motivation and in part because it usually devolves into generic girlfriends differing mainly in hair color.

I analyze fics more. I'm searching more for originality. I've become sick of fics with Harry Potter as the main character.

I also dislike canon more and more, and I prefer fics that diverge from it more. Single point of departure early on or everything's different, either way.
