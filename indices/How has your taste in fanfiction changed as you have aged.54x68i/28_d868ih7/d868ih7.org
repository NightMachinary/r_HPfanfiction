I've been reading HP fanfiction almost continuously since I was 12, and I'm 26 now. My taste in humor has changed of course (the parody fic my flair is from used to be my absolute favorite, now it barely gets a chuckle but I just like the nostalgia), and I rarely read comedy fics anymore. I've always liked reading about Tom Riddle, but in the last couple years I've been focusing more on Harry after always ignoring him. I've also gotten less forgiving of things like casual sexism in fics and lack of characterization.

Unfortunately, it feels like I've read all the good ones, so the only thing left now is to write some, while halfheartedly exploring in new directions...
