Interesting, it was the reverse for me! As a teen I couldn't picture having any kind of romantic interest in teachers (they were "old", eww!) and Hermione/any adult squicked me out. But years later IDK--something about the pairing really grew on me and now it's 90% of what I read. I've regressed, clearly. :p
