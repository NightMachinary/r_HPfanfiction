I guess as I got older my thinking became less black and white and allowed for a bit more grey regarding student/teacher relationships when the teen in question is older and already thrust into adult situations (dodging death, trying to save her world). But I think it has to do with the fact that I liked Hermione a lot as a character and was really unimpressed with the canon romance between her and Ron. As an adult I'm more into reading fics with a "star crossed lovers" angle (where character development and the journey of something that seemed impossible from the beginning is more important than if the two end up happily ever after), and this ship tends to have that plus the fix it aspect of giving Snape (another favorite character of mine) a little bit of a break compared to canon. In theory I should like Dramione too, but I find canon Draco unappealing and haven't found enough gems that successfully address his weaknesses of character. There's an older (albeit long winded) [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/granger-snape.html][essay]] on the appeal of SSHG among older fans by Red Hen that I found pretty interesting.
