Clearly. ;)

It's not a judgment on the people who do like the pairing, it's just how my relationship with it evolved until we broke up. ;) I can see where your younger self would have rejected the Hermione/adult pairings, but it would be interesting to know what drew you to it later, since my experience was the opposite. I suppose if you don't know, you just don't, though. Liking something is a lot harder to quantify than not liking something, I think. I certainly couldn't explain why I love most of my favorite fics if I had to.

Sorry if this is a bit rambly, it's 2:52 in the morning here and I have no idea why I'm awake.
