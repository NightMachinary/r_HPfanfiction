I've been reading HP fanfic on and off since 2003, so quite a while, I suppose. I was a teenager when I first got into it, and I had a crush on Snape, largely because of Alan Rickman, because that is the kind of teenager I was. Hermione was the most eligible female, and as a teenager, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with that pairing. The schoolgirl fantasy, I guess? An early attachment to nice girl 'tames' bad boy clich√©s?

I can't read that pairing any more. I'm an adult now, and...yick. Even if Hermione can be excused for her hormones leading her to questionable ground, Snape is the adult - even if it's 'twoo wuv', he should be laying down the law, don't stand so close to me until you're old enough to worry about having grandkids before your parents kick the bucket.

Not to mention that the seventh book served as a wake-up call for me about Snape, and I lost all interest in him save as a side character.

These days, I'm more likely to read gen starring Harry that isn't too dark nor too fluffy. I'm not too picky about the writing except that the plot has to make sense and I hate cheesy dialogue.
