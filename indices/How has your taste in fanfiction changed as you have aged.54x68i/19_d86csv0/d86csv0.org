It has and... it hasn't.

I was into fanfiction before HP was even published in the states. (Yay reading geocities fanfic sites on dialup - fun times!)

My tastes have changed in that I like different kinds of stories now than I did when I was younger. I don't read as much drama or angst stories these days. Today my preference is more for humor with a little bit of romance, with a healthy dose of adventure as well.

But I still go back and read some of those old stories. My current ffdotnet account dates back to 2002 (though I had one before that that got hacked and I lost it). I still have stories favorited from that time 14 years ago. I even still reread them once in a while.

Some of the old ones have held up, some haven't. I try not to reread the abandoned ones that were good because I just get disappointed that they were never finished. I don't delete them though because, well, I /did/ enjoy them at one point and they've even given me ideas for my own fanfics.

I certainly come and go from different fandoms with my reading preferences. I usually come back around to a core half dozen or so (of which HP is a member), but I branch out into quite a few. After nearly 700 favs on ffdotnet, I have quite the collection built up!
