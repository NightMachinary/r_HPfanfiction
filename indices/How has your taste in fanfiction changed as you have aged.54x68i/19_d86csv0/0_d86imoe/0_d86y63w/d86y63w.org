Probably! I'm a 90s kid through and through. I've still got copies of fanfics saved on /floppies/ so that I could read them offline.

I prefer canon pairings but will read others, and I've never been /too/ picky, but there are certain genre's I don't like that I've always stayed away from. Never been a fan of horror for example.

I started off with Sailor Moon fanfiction, then DBZ, and then other shows. Once I started reading HP I was all for fanfics of it.

I'm still using my second ffdotnet account (like I said, lost the first) and though I cringe at some of the fics I still have fav'd, I like to keep them as kind of a memory of where I was and where I am. I know it sounds silly, and some of my old favs may be lost forever, but I think it's good to go back and look at them now and then.

I think fanfiction is part of the reason I ended up with the degree I did, though I've always loved reading even before I found fanfics.
