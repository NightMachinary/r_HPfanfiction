Sounds like we have similar fic backgrounds! Cut my teeth on all kinds of geocities and ff.net trash in the early 00's (Digimon Forever lol). Wouldn't read anything diverging from show's canon or my OTP. Once HP got ahold of me my interests remained similar although I never developed an OTP and I think that lack helped me branch out into other pairings and non-canon. I know what you mean about keeping old stuff for the sake of it. Sometimes I peek at my original ff.net account and cringe at the stuff I put up and favorited haha.
