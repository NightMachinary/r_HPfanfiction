Age is a factor, but I have found that the bigger factor is "the more I read, the less I forgive weak writing."

Cheap tricks, bad characterization, obvious trope abuse, overly-powerful/clever/whatever characters - these are all stuff I used to eat up, but now I'll put a story down right away if any of it comes up. I won't even give a story a shot if the first paragraph describes the weather.
