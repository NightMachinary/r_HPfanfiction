The only thing that comes to mind at the moment is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826429/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic]] by Sage Ra.

It features a psychotic, magic-obsessed Harry who wishes to force the world (or the wizards anyway) into a situation to prove whether or not they deserve the gift of magic.

It's still in progress, and Daphne hangs around a bit, but Harry isn't at all interested in romance or dating.

I thought it was pretty entertaining for a while, but I'll probably wait until it completes (assuming it gets completed) to reread it all rather than keeping up with the updates.
