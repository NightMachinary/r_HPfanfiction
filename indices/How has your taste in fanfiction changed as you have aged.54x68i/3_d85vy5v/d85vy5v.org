My taste has changed quite a bit since I started reading them 2 years ago.

I used to gloat over Ron bashing, but no longer, and that's why I soured on quite a few of my former favorites.

I began to despise canon rehash a while ago. Now this has become my greatest pet peeve, especially in time travels.

I started out as a dedicated H/G shipper, but after reading a few great H/Others fics, my mind has changed. Now I'm fine with any non-slash Harry pairing as long as Hermione, Ginny, or Ron are not bashed.
