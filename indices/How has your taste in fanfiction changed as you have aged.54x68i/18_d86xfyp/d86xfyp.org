When I was new I was naive. Soul Bonds, Lord Potter, I'd read it and most likely like it. My favorite pairing was Harry/Hermione (still is, but more on that later). Nowadays, I'm more selective. No soul bonds, marriage laws can be done well (but usually are not), and maybe it's just me but if I have a Lord Potter fic, I'd love to see a Harry who really has to deal with the mess that is politics. I don't necessarily beleive he should have the full rights as a lord/member of the Wizengamot/what have you, but still. Legal age of 17, so I don't think him getting involved at 16 is that unheard of.

On pairings. I'm not as hardcore Harry/Hermione as I once was (Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne can be fun too). I guess I'm looking for fics that are more in depth. A bit more adult, if you will.
