I started reading fanfiction in the summer of 2005. Originally I was there for smut under 10k words and tended to read stuff based on live action Disney shows.

These days, I tend to set my minimum word count at 100k and search by characters I hope are interesting, usually based entirely on separate or at least lush canon. If i try to read short things, what I seem to find are a great premise that started well and died in the summer after book one; it is just so infuriating to have your engagement and time investment squandered!

I have noticed that my amount of time reading fanfiction and number of quality friends are inversely proportional. Cutting off friends due to substance abuse problems has really stepped up my reading with no signs of slowing.
