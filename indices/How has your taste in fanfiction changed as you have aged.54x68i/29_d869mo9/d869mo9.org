I think I'm in the minority here when it comes to reading fanfiction. I just started reading early into the summer, because I wanted to see what Harry 'could' have been, I use the term loosely. I doubt Harry could have been the heir to Gryffindor and as far as the Peverrel line, well according to JK, every wizard is related if you go far back enough. But there is something interesting to me about a Powerful MC, if done right the fic can be really good, yet there are only a handful of fics that do so.
