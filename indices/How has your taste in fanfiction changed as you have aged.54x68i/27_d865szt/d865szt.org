I don't like things that are super dark and violent. I used to be ok with sad endings. Not anymore.

Of course, I never got to really read fanfic as a kid or teen. But I played a number of imagination games involving fictional characters, so I think that counts.

As an adult, I like complicated characters who all think they're the main character of their story. Even villains have to have a good motivation for their actions.

Any story that is basically just a soap opera bores the hell out of me.
