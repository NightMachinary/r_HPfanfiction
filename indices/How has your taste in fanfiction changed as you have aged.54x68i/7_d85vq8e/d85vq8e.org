My taste has gotten objectively worse, I think. Thanks to stuff like Kindle Direct, when I want an original novel or work of fiction, I have hundreds of times more options than I did in 2001. So that means I'll no longer read stuff like /Alexandra Quick/, because when I want a Harry Potter fanfic, I want it to star /Harry Potter/! If I wanted an original work, I'd go and read an original work for free on Kindle unlimited. Back when I started reading fanfic, that just wasn't the case. Also, now that there's just so much well-written fanfic around, I've become so narrowly focused on reading only fics that do exactly what I want it's probably unhealthy. If your Harry/Hermione fic has just one thing I didn't like, I can drop it right away, because I've got thousands of other Harry/Hermione fics to choose from. When the fandom was knew, that wasn't the case. Instead, I'd have to be a bit more forgiving of authors, and maybe broaden my horizons a little bit. Nowadays I find reading fanfic is an extremely self-centered act of wish fulfillment, rather than the act of exploration and discovery it was previously. I'm not sure how to change that; the non-challenging, fast-food type of fanfic is so easy to find, and so enjoyable and tempting to me, that I doubt I'll ever read a challenging fic again. So I guess I've become a worse person as I got older! Isn't growing up supposed to go the other way?
