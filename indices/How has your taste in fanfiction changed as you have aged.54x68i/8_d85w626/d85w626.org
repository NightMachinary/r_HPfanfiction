Age wasn't a factor for me. I started reading fan Fictions 2 years ago and I was around 20. My taste at that time was Harry/Hermione mainly. I enjoyed Harry Crow. I went through the top favorites fics pretty quickly.

Over the short period of time my taste did change. If I a see overly helpful goblins, Lords and Ladies, rebellious Harry then I know that the fic is a cheap immitation of higher quality pics. I know not to read them. So in a way I did move on.

Now I enjoy something different. I enjoy rare pairings. Recently I am reading one with a female Voldemort. Overtime I have noticed it has gotten harder to please me too. So that's another thing.
