When I started reading fanfics I was very particular to the type of fic I read. It was almost all straight laced Harry/Ginny. It was a very formulaic, and frankly, a very boring taste. That must have been about 4 or 5 years ago. By that point I had read the Harry Potter dozens of times each. I was reluctant to see the status quo change much, if at all. I didn't want to read something new, I wanted to read Harry Potter. About a year after that I got /really/ into the MLP Fandom. For me a new Fandom means a chance to delve into new fanfiction. The way MLP fanfics worked was so radically different to Harry Potter, due to what the source material is. One is a book series with a set overarching plot. 99% of Harry Potter is variations on a theme: killing Voldemort while Harry goes through Hogwarts. The difference is interpretations of character. An author would start with, "If I change Harry to be this, then..." My Little Pony was rather different. It is an episodic kids show that often plays with a variety of styles and plots. Characters in MLP fanfics are pretty static throughout the entire Fandom. Their personalities rarely change from the outset of the fic. Therefore MLP was less about different variations of characters going through the same plot, it was rather the same characters going through different plots. The pure /variety/ of bad guys, conflicts, and settings are something I've never seen in any other Fandom. I now once again almost exclusively read Harry Potter fanfics, but the desire changed. I crave both setting changes and character changes, but paradoxically I love the structure of HP fanfics. I know that the end result of almost every fanfic is going to be, Harry defeats Voldemort and gets the the girl (or Draco). I want to know the journey, I want to know who's taking that journey, and what motivates them. Above all I want to read something I've never read before. Even if the whole thing stinks of cliche if just one element is new, then I'm happy.
