Maybe since it's a groundhog day fic, after 3 runs the line sees his mind as an adult and he passes without issue.

There are other ways to get through explored in other fics: tunneling, throwing crumpled paper from outside the line, getting an older student to do it, flying to the top of the room on a broom where the line doesn't reach.

And Ron because either Harry gets annoyed at his jealousy over and over, or wants to give him eternal glory and money.

Dumbledore because I like fics where Harry realizes how much Dumbles manipulates his life.
