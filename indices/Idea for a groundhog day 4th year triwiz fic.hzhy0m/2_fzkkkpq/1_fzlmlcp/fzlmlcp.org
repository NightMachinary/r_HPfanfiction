Maybe he pits Ron in to show him what Harry had to deal with in the tournament. Kind of like a just desserts situation. Ron wanted to join, and didn't stick by Harry's side despite all theshit they've been through the last few years. Just to be clear, I like Ron. I think he's an immature berk, but he's a teenager, it's expected. I don't think him, and Hermione work as a couple(I also don't think Harry/Hermione work either).

Honestly, i'd have liked if no-one got in a relationship right out of a war, and school. JKR was mental with that epilogue. They need time to find themselves, and i'm gonna stop now. This got away from me a bit.
