My favorite dark!Harry fics (none of these Harrys ever join Voldemort):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): This Harry is not so much dark, but highly manipulative. He skillfully uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry was actually raised by his own loving parents and never went to Hogwarts. The quote "All roads to hell are paved with good intentions" very much applies to him. His actions have brought peace and prosperity to millions, but he also employs torture, assassination, kidnapping, extortion, and sabotage as his policy tools. He loves his family dearly, but will not hesitate to manipulate them for his political goals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Nice short curb stomp fic featuring an overpowered and slightly sadistic Harry/Ginny couple. This Harry is a snake animagus and likes to hide next to Ginny's tits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore's death and allies with Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe. Harry's friends have become avid war profiteers in the end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and kill the fuck out of their enemies again. Dark humors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): This 'Harry' thinks he is Voldemort, he acts like Voldemort, he has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever. He eventually succumbs to the unrequited love of a Weasley woman.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who had once against escaped justice.
