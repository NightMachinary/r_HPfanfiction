/River Styx/ by *Vanessa Li Potter* : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9623987/1/]]

Summary: /Harry chose to join Voldemort and is now known as Filldeserp, his most loyal follower and heir. Years later, can Neville and the remaining of the Order of the Phoenix have the strength to fight two powerful Dark Lords? PreHBP. Translation of the fic by Parvati-Blossom./

P.S. Filldeserp is only Harry's dark lord acronym as Voldemort is Tom Riddle's.
