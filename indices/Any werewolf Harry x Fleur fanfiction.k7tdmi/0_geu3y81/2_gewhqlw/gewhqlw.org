In FILFY Teacher, a DxD/HP crossover, Harry was bitten in third year. But that's just setup, the primary story happens with an adult Werewolf Harry post-War who's just broken up with a cheating Ginny and moved to Japan to get away. It's basically "Adult Dad Harry in DxD" really, but pretty good if you like that crossover. If you want focus on the post-Third Year stuff, not that, though.
