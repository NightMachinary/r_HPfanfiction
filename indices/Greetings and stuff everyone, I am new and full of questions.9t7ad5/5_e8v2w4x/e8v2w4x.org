This might sound silly, but please properly capitalise your title (well use proper capitalisation in general). I honestly don't care if you use British or UK spellings, but using UK terminology is very important because it is part of the world building (i.e. trainers not sneakers, etc). Lastly, write a good summary. It is the best thing you can do for your fic. It also helps you think about what is important and how you conceptualise your story.

Be passionate about your story, because your readers can feel it. Good luck!
