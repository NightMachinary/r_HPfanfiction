Hi. Welcome!

If you get back into the swing of writing and post your stuff here, keep in mind that some of us can be pretty critical, but it is (usually) in a constructive manner.

Depending on what kind of HP fanfiction you like, there's also some common and popular tropes that are not very well received (sometimes despised) in this community.
