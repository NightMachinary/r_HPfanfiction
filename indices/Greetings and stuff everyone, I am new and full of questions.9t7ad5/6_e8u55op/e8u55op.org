hey! xD cool to meet somebody else new to fanfic writing. i just started my first story ever this week too. i got a beta last night too. so that's cool. anyway, yeah i've been around this subreddit a couple months now. mostly lurking. :D be careful around here, cause people seem to downvote with prejudice. they're merciless assholes about it. my last two posts about just asking for a beta and putting a link to my story and asking for help with it are at 0 votes. soooo. yeah. pack of blood hounds here. not the way i'd go about it if i wanted anybody to even be here, but whatever? if they want to drive people off with asshole behavior who are just asking for help they can feel free.
