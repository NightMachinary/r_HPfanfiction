Uhm I am not defending the downvoters but you do realize that it might be because of your writing style? I guess some people just dont want to deal with fanfic authors not using capitalizations but a rather colloquial style and so you got no upvotes from them. This sub here is one of the nicest I know, merciless downvoting without a good reason is something not happening very often.
