Well let's take that last reply. If I was your editor, this is how I'd reformat it to obey some basic rules of grammar while also trying to retain your "voice" as an author:

Ok. Thank you. I do want to learn. I want to get better. I do want to hone the skill and stuff. I want to write. Sorry I called people assholes and stuff. I'm not lazy. I won't say I can't do it, but I was taught it wasn't wrong to say "I don't know" when you really don't know. And I really don't know grammar or paragraph stuff, so that's just different with you and me I guess.

Anyway it's just frustrating and confusing, 'cos I did fix it but then I got told to put it back how it was by someone else.

So what am I supposed to do? Who do I listen to with that? Keep it how it is or put it back? Could you tell me how it's supposed to be?

It's important to note that what I just posted isn't perfectly grammatical, nor is it meant to be. I put capitals in the correct places and broke it into paragraphs where that seemed appropriate, and I replaced "cause" with "'cos", as it's used more often than "'cause", but YMMV on that one.

The result is hardly different from your original post but doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out when reading it. Capitals and paragraphs are important because they break text up so it can be read more easily.

Some very basic rules are: 1) A new sentence should always begin with a capital letter. 2) Proper Nouns (names and so on) should always use capital letters 3) Doesn't apply to this post, but when writing dialogue, lines from different speakers should always go on new lines. 4) There are no hard and fast rules with paragraphs but generally it's a good idea to start a new one when you're moving on to a different topic or direction.

Hope that helps.
