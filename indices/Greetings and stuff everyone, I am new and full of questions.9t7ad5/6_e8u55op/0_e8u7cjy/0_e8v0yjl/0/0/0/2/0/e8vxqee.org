Here's a dirty little secret about writing. It's very inside baseball and something a large chunk of people don't want you to know.

You can do it.

The only thing preventing you from doing it is you. A negative attitude of perpetiual failure will lead to perpetual failure. There is nothing preventing you from improving but your own attitude. There's plenty of free resources available online to learn. I'm pretty sure the entirety of Strunk and White's Elements of Style is available in PDF for free online.

You've said you're. A lot of who you'll be dealing with on here are adults. The 'woe is me' 'I can't do it' sob story is cringe worthy because it is nothing more than an excuse Go look in the mirror and tell yourself you can do it. Because you can. Don't ever, under any fucking circumstance, for any fucking reason, say you can't do it again.

But you will have to thicken the skin, as it were. Even here you say 'I just wanted tips!' but after you got them, whined about internet points and how that made things harder. That's a terrible attitude to have about anything.

Now writing is a skill that needs to be developed and nurtured. A lot of youth have a romanticized vision of writers sitting around in some idyllic paradise and then just magically writing down pristine copy. That is utter bullshit.

Lets compare it to another skill. Let's say, cooking, If I were teaching you how to cook, it would be incredibly irresponsible of me to say, let you serve raw chicken and then act surprised when it poisoned people. Your story is currently the raw chicken. There's nothing preventing you from baking it in an oven. And I doubt you'd ever say 'well I can't do that it's too hard I just don't get it!'

Writing works the same say. The assumption when you put something on the internet is that you want commentary or review. The bane of the internet comes in the anonymous nature of it all. I have to assume you have at least a basic knowledge of what you're doing. Like at a restaurant, I must assume the chef knows that the poultry needs to be cooked. So I can say 'this chicken is raw' and have that have meaning to the chef. If you don't have the basic knowledge to understand such commentary, then a lot of basic commentary is going to seem more negative than it is. Of course it's problematic if someone says, "that's a fragment" and you don't know what that means.

Of course, not having knowledge of grammar isn't surprising. God knows they teach it for shit in schools. I've often argued that I didn't properly learn English grammar until I learned Latin in college because the professor was smart enough to know that the high school education on it was lazy and that it was essentially to properly understanding Latin.

Any community is going to assume a basic level of knowledge from people in it. Don't be offended when they use terminology that you don't understand. Ask for clarification. Saying 'I don't know," and even worse, using it as a justification, is the laziest thing on the planet. Made even worse by the Google era where answers to virtually any question are at your fingertips.

Calling people elitist assholes because they expect proper grammar in writing is akin to calling people elitist assholes because they expect you to not crash a car into them on the road. It is the most basic staple of writing.

As for slack cutting. Never ask people to hold you to a lower standard than they hold themselves. If you constantly get breaks there's never any incentive to improve. Of course, it doesn't seem like you really want to hone a skill all that much. I myself can't imagine wanting to do something as tireless or thankless as writing and posting a story without also improving my own ability. But that very well could just be some weird quirk of my own.

To not be wholly negative. The responses here and the short bit of story do reflect solid voice in the writing. It's not nearly as mechanical as a lot of first attempts. And voice can be a very difficult thing to develop. So that, as a whole there, is a good start.
