There isn't anything wrong with saying you don't know. No knowledge can be gained without first understanding the lack of knowledge. But the problem comes when it becomes an excuse. Lack of knowledge does not invalidate criticism. Wrong, with or without knowledge, is still wrong. Saying 'I don't know' without following it up with 'but I can go look it up!' is asinine to me.

I can't help without seeing both versions. I'm making an assumption based off of general commentary here that I probably only saw the second one and never the first.

I am more than willing to provide feedback if you want to send things to me, but I can't really answer your specific question here without some more context. I know [[/u/rpeh]] gave some general paragraph advice below as well.

Grammar is weird in that, well, it's....sort of...optional. But not in the way most people assume when someone says optional. A quick example would be that sometimes it's okay to use fragments or run-on sentences. That can be a stylistic choice. However if a seven sentence paragraph has six fragments in it, it's going to read choppily and disjointed and I'm going to assume the author doesn't know what a proper sentence is.

But before you can get to the point where you can ignore grammar you have to know grammar. And to be able to articulate why you're choosing to ignore it.

But there's also a lot of terrible writing advice out there. Like never starting a sentence with a conjunction or ending one with a preposition. Both are utter bullshit. But, without understanding what a conjunction or preposition is you can't understand why.
