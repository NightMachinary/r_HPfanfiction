that's /my/ point though! this /isn't a writing sub./ it's a fanfiction sub! it's not like some professional elitist cliche writer's club workshop! it's a fanfiction subreddit. at least that's all i thought it was. but then you guys come on me all like, gotta use that grammer, gotta use those letters, this is so shameful, this is horrific, this is so laaaazy. what the fuck?

that's my point. how the fuck do you guys even expect me to want to stay here and learn to be better if you're just gonna get on my case the second i post here, no matter how my story looks? it's /my first story!/ that's my point. my first story, and you guys shit over it cause it's not up to your writer's club high standards. it's not /gonna be/ up to your standards because i'm not a fucking elite writer! i'm a 14 year old girl who's never written shit in her life, and i don't even got the time to write! i got homework, i got chores and shit to do. i just came in here looking to have fun trying out writing a story. that's all. and i thought you'd be all chill about it! but you aint chill. you're snobby and arrogant and pretentious.

i'm not looking to be the next stephen king or whatever. but you guys all seem to think you already /are/, and you can be super crazy critical of people who yeah, maybe don't care on the same level as you do about it. fuck. why are you guys so damn serious and intense about it?

like i said. didn't even think this was some professional writer's workshop to begin with! i thought it was just some hpfanfic reading and writing site. like. casual. fun. you know? but no. you guys are all elitist asses about it. you're all so good and talented you gotta shit on peeps who don't got half the skill you do, or the same drive or whatever.

is that really a bad fucking thing? that i'm just a girl who wants to try writing outta curiosity? for the fun of it? i don't wanna be all furious editing long hour workshop stuff. so what? shouldn't that be cool with you? with anybody? i just wanted to dip my toes in here, not full on throw myself into grueling cement breaking work.
