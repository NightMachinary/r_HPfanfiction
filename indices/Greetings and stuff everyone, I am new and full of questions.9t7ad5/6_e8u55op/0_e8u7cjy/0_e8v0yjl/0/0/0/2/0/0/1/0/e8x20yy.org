Reminds me of the story of an American visiting London. He approaches a smart-looking gentleman with a bowler hat and briefcase and asks, "Hey, buddy! Can you tell me where St. Paul's Cathedral is at?"

The gent rolls his eyes and replies "Do you know you should never start or end a sentence with a preposition?"

The American replies, "Gee you're right. Sorry 'bout that. Where's St. Paul's Cathedral at, asshole?"

Or as Churchill is reputed to have said, "Ending a sentence with a preposition is something up with which I will not put."
