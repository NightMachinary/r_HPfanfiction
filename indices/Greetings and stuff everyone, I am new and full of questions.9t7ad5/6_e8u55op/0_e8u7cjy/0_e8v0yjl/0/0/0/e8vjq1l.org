Yeah, but as Floreat is saying, you didn't bother with basic grammar and formatting in a writing subreddit. That's not a very good look. Compounded by the fact that it seemed to be more out of laziness than anything else. Then there's the whole 'there I fixed it it took FOREVER' which is two fold. One, it implies you knew it was wrong because you were able to fix it, which further supports general laziness for not doing it in the first place. And the implication that 'forever' (when the time between posts certainly wasn't 'forever') to edit 2000 words is....problematic.

Then you have posts calling it 'exclusionary' because people use capital letters. You're not Hemingway or Joyce or Beckett. You have not earned the ability ignore basic grammar and get away with it.

Grammar in writing is akin to your first impression in real life. If the first thing I see from you is a lack of interest in basic structure or formatting or grammar, why should I bother reading it?

I can only imagine the amount of profanity [[/u/rpeh]] would send my way if I sent him something to read that ignored basic grammar and structure. Granted, his response would probably be, "Wait you don't do that anyway?"

But a beta does not exist to fix your writing. You need to fix your writing. The beta should exist to give it a second pair of eyes, to see if themes are working as you intend them to, and to catch the shit you miss. Wanting them to do it all for you isn't what their purpose is. And again, seems lazy on the part of the writer.

The whole excessive use of double negatives and trying to sound like Applejack aside, most writers despise laziness. And even more so when it's laziness pertaining to their hobby, or in some cases of the people you'll meet on this sub, their livelihood.

I myself am paid to write. That means I probably look at writing in general a lot differently than most people. Multiple times, and this very well may not be your intention, but with your style this is how a reader preceives it, you whine about writing being difficult.

No shit? Writing is hard? Who'd a thunk it. Writing is a skill cultivated by determination and practice. Do you think Stephen Curry would take kindly to you standing next to him and missing a three pointer then if he offered you shooting advise to whine and say 'well it's just hard for me!'

Sure, now, a full fifteen years since I started really writing, I can sit down and shit out an essay on a random topic that intrigues me in a couple of hours. But I sure as shit couldn't do that when I started writing.

When I realized I liked writing, after writing things that I'm sure were terrible but have since been lost to time, I read about writing. I read about literary theory. I took classes on writing. I reread books by authors I liked and tried to analyze style. And then, most importantly, I wrote. I wrote a lot.

You're not me. Which is probably a good thing. That might not be how you process and function. But never once did I look for an excuse or use the difficulty of it all as a scapegoat.

I read your first thread, looked at the story, saw the terrible formatting and went on my merry way. I didn't up or downvote because I don't care. But what I typed here is the impression I, a rather experienced writer, got from your own words. And really, the only positive thing I can say about it is that you tried. Everyone's first writings suck. The only way to get better is to keep doing it.

But you will not improve if you can't be arsed into typing with proper grammar.
