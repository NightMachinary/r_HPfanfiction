ok. thank you. i do want to learn. i want to get better. i do want to hone the skill and stuff. i want to write. sorry i called people assholes and stuff. i'm not lazy. i won't say i can't do it. but i was taught it wasn't wrong to say "i don't know" when you really don't know. and i really /don't know grammar or paragraph stuff/. so that's just different with you and me i guess. anyway it's just frustrating and confusing, cause i did fix it but then i got told to put it back how it was by someone else. so what am i supposed to do? who do i listen to with that? keep it how it is, or put it back? could you tell me how it's supposed to be?
