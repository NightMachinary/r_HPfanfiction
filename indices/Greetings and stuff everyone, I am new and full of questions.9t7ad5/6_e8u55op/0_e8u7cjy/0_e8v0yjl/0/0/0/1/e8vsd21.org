i ain't lazy ok? i just didn't expect to be expected to go full dive on in with this shit the second i posted my first chapter. sorry, but you guys got way too damn high expectations for anybody new here. i just wanted to have some fun, write some fun ideas, whatever. but you're all being hyper needle critical right off the bat. and that's insane. i ain't lazy. just don't want to instantly jump to your high standards. not that i even could, cause again this is my first story.

like do you get that? please? i didn't come here for some rocky training montage to become a super awesome high class writer lady. i just wanted to have a little fun, get a bit of tips, that's it. is it really wrong not to want anything more then that?

yeah it took me forever in my opinion. /because i haven't done it before!/ the point shouldn't be the issue. yeah it was hard for me, because /it was my first time doing that./ of course it was. but you guys don't want to give me that? you don't want to cut even a inch of slack here? seriously?
