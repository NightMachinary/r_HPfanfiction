ok look. i can handle capital letters. ok? i'll put those in. but the whole grammar stuff? the paragraph structure stuff? i don't know /how/ to do that right! i barely scrape by with it in school. i suck at it. i don't get it. so. i don't know, just gonna have to suffer that. i tried "fixing" it too, but then i got a message from somebody else telling me to try to put it back into the single line format and break it up again! so i don't know. i don't honestly know what to do. i don't know what you guys want on that front. i can't do it though. but i'll try the capitals and the spelling at least. ok?
