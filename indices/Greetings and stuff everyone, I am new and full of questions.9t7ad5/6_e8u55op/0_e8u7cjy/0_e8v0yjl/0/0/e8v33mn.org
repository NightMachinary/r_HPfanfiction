alright. thanks. i ain't never written a story before though. i can't help it if it's actually harder for me to do then all you serious guys. yeah formatting and capitals took me a long time, but that shouldn't mean i get dogpiled with downvotes. not everybody has the same level of skill you know? it really is hard for me. i clearly /could/ be bothered, cause i did go back and fix it all as best i could. just saying, discouraging peeps from trying to participate ain't gonna help nobody.
