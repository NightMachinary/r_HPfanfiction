It's just psychological and a quick way to show how people feel about something. Its a reddit wide thing, not specific to this sub Don't take it to heart. Certainly don't start calling everyone assholes.

From my perspective, I think a likely reason people were downvoting you is because you were saying things like "how do writers do this, it took me half an hour" about simple things like formatting and capitals. Well, firstly, they do it as they go along. With practice your writing will get better and you will have to spend less time going back and fixing stuff. And secondly, half an hour isn't really a long time. People here take writing seriously and go through several drafts. Your attitude made it seem like you couldn't be bothered- controversially I don't think there is anything wrong with this. It's fanfic, no one is paying you and it should be for fun, so spend as much or little time as you want on it. But be prepared for those who take it more seriously to be less than impressed, especially if you are specifically asking for their help.
