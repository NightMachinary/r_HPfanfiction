Hey! Welcome, I'm doing the story rough draft to my first fic as well, however I think this place is great, everyone gives solid advice and is super helpful. They're nitpicky about certain details, sure, mainly just americanisms in the British potterverse, which I think is fair. But they're all super nice about it.

I am just finishing Not From Others which is a 7th year fic from Ginny's POV and it's amazing, really hit me emotionally and got me invested. It made me cry yesterday I was so deep into it, so I'd strongly recommend it!
