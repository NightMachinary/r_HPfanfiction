Oooh, maybe some humor/crack? Don't take it too seriously and these are some very fun fics. linkffn(Seventh Horcrux; A Black Comedy; Make a Wish; Harry the Hufflepuff) are classics.

Or some AU action? linkffn(Heartlands of Time; Bungle in the Jungle).

Maybe something else? linkffn(Stages of Hope; Becoming Neville; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue; Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)?
