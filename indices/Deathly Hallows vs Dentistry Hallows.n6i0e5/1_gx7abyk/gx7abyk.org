To the alternative powers Tom knows not, I wrote this dialog between Harry and Ginny (from linkao3(22663204)):

  ... or about the ‘power that the Dark Lord knows not'. I had to suffer the half-an-hour Hermione's rant about the mess the Hogwarts Library catalogue is two weeks ago, and so I guess I am one of very few pureblood witches who knows what the Dewey Decimal Classification is. I think it is the safe bet that Tom, who grew up in an orphanage and very permanently left the Muggle education when he was eleven, has never heard about it either. What if that ‘power he knows not' is knowledge of the Muggle libraries, where you will be able to locate necessary information, whereas he could not? Crazy is it? Why it is crazier than the Dumbledore's love? Or some random Muggle weapon you have heard about and Tom has no clue.”

  Ginny was happy to observe that it was the first time in a long time when Harry really laughed thinking about the library catalogues.

  “How do you know? I was hiding from the Dudley gang often in the school library, so I heard about Mr Dewey even before I started at Hogwarts. That's a weird coincidence. Perhaps you found the power which will conquer Tom!”

  Ginny face hardened when she heard about Harry's hiding, but she managed to smile in the end at least a bit.

  “Can you imagine the Hermione's face if she found out that managing library defeated Tom?”
