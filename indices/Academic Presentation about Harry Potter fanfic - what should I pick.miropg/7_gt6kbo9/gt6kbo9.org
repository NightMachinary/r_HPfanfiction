There are a lot of resources you can draw from. Unfortunately most of those sources are biased and incomplete. I don't know if there has been a comprehensive study of fanfiction (I know of several studies that dealt with slash fics etc.).

If you want to put real work into it and try to make a real presentation, there are a few ways to do it. The first is to spend several years reading old fics and trying to get a feel of the fandom (obviously not an option). The second is to use a shortcut like fanlore as someone already suggested.

The third, and the one I would recommend, is more controversial. There are Odd Ideas by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]]. It's a collection of hundred of little/large stories over the scope of 16 years, from 2005 to present. If you want an overview of fanfiction in it's nuances, that's a good place to start. Especially if you want to avoid slash (although why I have no idea, since most... I will stop there to not give you ideas).
