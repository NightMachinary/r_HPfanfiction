If you do an overview of the fandom tropes you can mention the slash stuff.

If you call it out, you might mention that this trope seemed to start with Kirk/Spock back in the fanzine days of Star Trek.

I think you would be safe in saying almost any trope will have an example in HP fanfiction - which is pretty amazing. This field is so prolific, so very many fanfics out there to suit almost any taste - I find this such a rich fandom to which I keep coming back.
