Harry Potter fanfic is a HUGE and many headed topic, so I would highly recommend that you hit on a specific aspect of the topic.

If I were doing a presentation I would probably go with something along the lines of "Why it (HP fanfiction) is so popular and how has it continued to be popular for so long" but I would second a previous poster's idea of "what is trope" to give a good, small, staring point.

-I second the use of fanlore as a shortcut/ starting point.

--> Fanfiction is NOT a new thing, and it did not start with Harry Potter (Star Trek anyone?) but the widespread use on the internet, forums, blogs, etc. by the same people (age-group) as fans of the original texts catapulted HP fanfic well beyond most previous fandoms.
