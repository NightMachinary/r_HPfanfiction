this might be a bit much for a schoolwide audience, but if you want to talk about parallels between fics and real world issues that would be interesting. Pureblood vs muggleborn vs Muggle debate (racism, bigotry, etc.). Stories taking on Tom Riddle's childhood and his psychological development, Statute of secrecy breaking leading to the escalation of a Muggle vs wizard technology arms race and eventually an apocalypse. I think some of the stories that go into magical theory are pretty cool (transfiguration and thermodynamics connection).
