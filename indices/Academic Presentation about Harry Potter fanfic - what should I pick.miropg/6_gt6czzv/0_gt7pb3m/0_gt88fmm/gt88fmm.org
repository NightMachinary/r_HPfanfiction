There is a reasonably well-acted audio version freely available. It can be pretty easy to get pretty far into it pretty quickly.

But MoR seems pretty atypical to me? It is famous for what it does, and might be a good example of one thing out of many that can be done with fanfiction. But it is still something rare and not really typical of the fandom, to me.
