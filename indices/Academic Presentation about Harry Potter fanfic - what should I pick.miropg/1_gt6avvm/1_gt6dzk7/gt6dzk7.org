I like this approach. Any presentation that calls out specific fics, ships, tropes, etc is going to be hit-or-miss with a general school audience. Maybe a high-level overview of those topics. Like "what is a trope" and how they come and go in popular media including fanfic. A timeline can show how the HP fandom is special due to its longevity and maturing fanbase, without being specific enough to make anyone tune out if they don't like a specific trope/ship/fic.
