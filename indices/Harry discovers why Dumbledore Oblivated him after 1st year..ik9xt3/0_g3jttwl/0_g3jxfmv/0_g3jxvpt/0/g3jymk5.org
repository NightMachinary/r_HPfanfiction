On the bright side, there's enough room in the human mind to store a lifetime of memories, even if they were photographic, so I had to adjust it a bit.

The main issues with that scenario would be more in terms of short-term memories, unless someone screws up the Obliviation, which is arguably possible for even someone on Dumbledore's level if it's done often enough.

Of course, there are also possible negative effects of repeated obliviations.
