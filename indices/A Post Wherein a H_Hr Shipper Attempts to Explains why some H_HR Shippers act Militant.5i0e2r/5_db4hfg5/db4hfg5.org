I quite like the H/Hr ship. What I don't like is the way it is pulled off in so many fics.

Like you said, I grew up reading about /Harry, Ron, and Hermione/, and I think they're all brilliant characters. Unfortunately since Ron ended up with Hermione in canon, the 'militantness' of the Harmony ship-dom has translated into a hate-boner for Ron, and that's what I can't stand.
