I agree wholeheartedly. I always find it very difficult to find new, quality Harry/Hermione stories among the endless pages of Weasley, Dumbledore, etc bashing. Its such a shame, because some of these stories even have a half way decent premise, but then jump off the deep end with awful bashing plots (love potions, etc.)
