Meh. Pairings are an afterthought at best. If I like a story, I like it regardless of shipping. The writing quality is much more important. If a fic manages to sell me a pairing, I don't mind if it's Harry with Ginny or Hermione or Luna or a merfolk water witch (<- someone pls write that).

Except for H/D and H/Snape. There's no excuse for Draco or Snape. E-v-e-r.
