You don't really explain why the fans are so rabid.

On the other side of the coin, I think part of the reason some people respond so negatively to Harry/Hermione is that most popular pairings in the fandom involve Harry or Hermione. So while a pairing like Harry/Draco might only incite the annoyance of Harry/Ginny fans, Harry/Luna fans, and Harry/Snape fans, a Hermione/Harry pairing irks Harry/Ginny fans, Hermione/Ron fans, Harry/Draco fans, Hermione/Draco fans, Hermione/Snape fans, Harry/Snape fans, etc. I'm not saying that every fan of all of these fandoms hates Harry/Hermione, but the pairing sinks the majority of fanon and canon ships.
