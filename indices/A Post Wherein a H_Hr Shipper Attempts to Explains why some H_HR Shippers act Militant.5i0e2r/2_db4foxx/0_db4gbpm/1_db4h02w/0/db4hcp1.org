That's fair. For the sake of answering your question, I think it probably comes from insecurity. Non-canon shippers feel like they constantly have to justify their pairing, and therefore go to great lengths in their stories to make their pairing functional. So for example, I've noticed in a lot of Harry/Hermione stories that the Weasleys and Dumbledore often become evil incarnate and are doing everything in their power to prevent Harry and Hermione from being together. These plots always feel very shallow and are incredibly distracting and poorly written.
