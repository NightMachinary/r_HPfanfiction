I don't like Harry/Hermione because I think they're incompatible but I avoid it as much as I can because of that section of fans.

It really does go beyond defensive. It comes off more like bitterness really. Canon offended some people (evidenced by the awful Ginny bashing that occured post HBP). They felt cheated and tricked because they thought it was all swinging their way. I know the fact that it didn't was genuinely shocking to that subset of fandom.

I know some were also getting mocked back then. Even before HBP, I remember Harmonians (only a small part of a larger group, I know) not having the best reputation. They were really, really sure they knew the story and some found the resulting attitude aggravating. Post-HBP, there was some mocking of their previous confidence that did make them more defensive and angry.

At least, that's how I see the source of the militant behavior. I just think the reaction is actually horrible for the ship. The bashing fics end up turning away ambivalent fans (I ship Harry/Ginny but I will read almost any other non-canon pairings - even found love for Neville/Ginny and Harry/Tom - but I won't go near any more Harry/Hermione fics.) And the twisting of interviews like they're still striving to change canon only keeps that 'militant' reputation going.

As for Rowling's genuine support, the quotes I know of are in reference to Hermione/Ron and Harry/Hermione. In some ways, Hermione would fit better with Harry. Even in that 'either way' quote, she's referring to the experiences Harry and Hermione share that Ron disappeared for. However, Harmony fans have used these to also invalidate Harry/Ginny when Rowling has reiterated that Ginny is perfect for Harry. A little before she made the mention of Ron/Hermione/Harry (the "either way" quote), she stated that she stands by the fact that Ginny is his soulmate. Ginny and Harry being a perfect match is something she has not wavered on and all Harry/Hermione quotes I've seen have been made as an alternative to the sometimes rocky relationship of Ron/Hermione and not the 'perfect match' scenario she built around Harry/Ginny.
