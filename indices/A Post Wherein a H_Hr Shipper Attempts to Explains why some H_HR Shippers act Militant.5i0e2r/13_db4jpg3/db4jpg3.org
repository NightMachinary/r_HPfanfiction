Personally, I think nearly all of the HP shipping is unnecessary and silly. How many of us are even still close friends with our friends from sixth grade, let alone married to one of them?

It's generally wish fulfillment from people who are attracted to the actors in the films, I have noticed. When it isn't, it's a deliberate style choice to choose someone "different" like those OC stand ins like Susan Bones or Daphne Greengrass. Of course, an OC love interest is usually bad too, as it is frequently an authorial insert.

Long story longer, I agree with Rowling in that very little time really should be wasted on romance in a fic /set at Hogwarts/. Harry should date a bit but trying to find "the love of your life" at 15 or 16, let alone 11 or 12 like many authors do, is ludicrous.
