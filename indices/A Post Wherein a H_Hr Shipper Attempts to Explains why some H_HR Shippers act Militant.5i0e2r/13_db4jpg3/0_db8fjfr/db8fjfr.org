It's a little different considering that the wizarding world is explicitly stated to be tiny in Britain- only one all wizarding town, everyone goes to Hogwarts for a free education, etc. When everyone in your world that is your age went to school with you, yeah you're going to date/be friends with people who knew you in school. It happens in small towns all the time.

I do agree that getting into a permanent relationship by fourth year is absurd.
