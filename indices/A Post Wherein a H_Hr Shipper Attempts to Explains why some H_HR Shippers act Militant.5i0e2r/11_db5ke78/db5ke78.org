I actually think its a good thing to justify a pairing, just not in the way that those shippers are doing it. The writer should justify it through their writing by developing both the two characters and the relationship. Not just have the two characters announce their secret love for one another at the beginning, not by making Ginny and/or Ron evil or removing some sort of manipulations that hid their true feelings from their own self, and not by placing the two together through some magical means like soul bonds or marriage contracts (I've seen both utilized in interesting ways, but usually its just a way to put two characters together).

I wouldn't mind reading some well written H/Hr fics, so I wouldn't mind if you recommended some, but its a ship that I don't seek out on my own because of the problems I mentioned above. I really like Rorschach's Blot's fics, and he has a lot of H/Hr in his stuff. And for the record, I don't like ready any fics with romance as a central part if it isn't well developed. So while I generally prefer H/G, there are plenty of H/G fics that I have no interest in.
