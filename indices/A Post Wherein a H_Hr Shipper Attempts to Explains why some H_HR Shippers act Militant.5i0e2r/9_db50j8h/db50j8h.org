Here's my reasoning: the H/Hr ship views itself as direct competition to the canon ships, so of course they will be more militant, and also why you have a bigger proportion of H/Hr shippers being completely blind to any canon evidence against their ship.

Now, obviously not all H/Hr shippers are "delusional militantists". But why is H/Hr the most militant ship? Why not something like Ginny/Luna or Hermione/Neville, even though both are just as "fanonical" as H/Hr? The answer is simple. Because the books built up all this interaction between the trio. Regardless of whether it's platonic or not, more presence between the two characters is always "positive" to your ship. It means more opportunity to look for the tiniest cracks in the canon. Ships that have no threat whatsoever against the canonical "order" are by definition more peaceful, because since there's almost or no interaction, there's nothing to be militant about.

The natural evolution of this vocalness is proclaiming that it's better than the canon ships, that the fanon should have happened. So you have to get Ginny and Ron out of the way. And how is that usually done? By bashing. Which is why the vast majority of the Weasley bashing (especially Ginny and Ron, since they are the direct threat to the H/Hr ship) is done by Harmonians.

It's been a problem for more than 10 years, since HBP came out, and while the number of H/Hr shippers has gradually decreased over time (at least in the book fandom, the movies are something else), the Harmonians have only become more desperate to prove that their ship is the only true one. Which explains why they completely misinterpret JKR's words from the Wonderland interview, which further fueled the militancy. In their view, JKR did not say "In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit [compared to Ron and Hermione]", instead it's "Harry and Hermione MUST be together, Ginny and Ron can just fuck off".

And by the way, the truth really is that the films have had an impact on people shipping H/Hr. Maybe not you personally, but in general. In the words of the Rubio meme:

  "Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Steve Kloves didn't know what he was doing. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing. Steve Kloves was undertaking a systematic effort to change canon, to make the HP series more like the rest of his Harmony dreams.

  That's why he supported turning Ron into comic relief, glorifying Hermione, adding more Harry/Hermione moments and reducing Ginny into furniture. It was a systematic effort to change canon. When I'm screenwriter of the HP films we are going to re-embrace all the characters that made HP the greatest series in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest series in the history of the world."
