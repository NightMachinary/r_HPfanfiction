  To me, it seemed more from those comments she made that she wasn't sure that R/Hr would work out or not, rather than emphatically saying that they would never work out, especially towards the end of that interview.

I mean, Jo more or less said that the two were fundamentally incompatible, and that the relationship was written as "wish-fulfillment", because she wanted to keep the characters the same as when she first plotted out the series. That seems really damning to me, and the whole "they'd probably be alright" qualifier seemed to be just that: a qualifier aimed at diffusing blowback from R/Hr shippers. Obviously, it didn't work.

Really, that interview had almost nothing to do with JKR shipping H/Hr, as the media initially reported, and more to do with her essentially de-legitimising R/Hr as a ship. And, tbh, I kind of agree: I think canon would have worked out more naturally if the trio had simply remained platonic and found romance elsewhere.
