  But it was not just a qualifier - she actually does refer to her earlier comments from DH about Hermione's weakness for "a funny man

True, but I'm predicating this on wish-fulfillment and fundamental incompatibility being much stronger words than the ones she uses for Ron and Hermione being together. I do agree on inconsistency though: It's really odd that JK claims that a relationship was wish-fulfillment and they're /fundamentally/ incompatible, which are such strongly negative things to say about a romance, then says things like Hermione has a weakness for funny people and they'd be okay with counseling. I mean, fundamental implies that there is a conflict between who Ron and Hermione are at their cores, and no amount of counseling or compromising could fix that.

  And if it were just a bone thrown for the R/Hr shippers, she wouldn't have been so vehemently pro R/Hr in CC.

I'm not so sure about that. Now, obviously the backlash against that article was the erroneous supposition that Harry and Hermione should have gotten married over Ron and Hermione, but there were thousands of impassioned articles, op-eds, listicles, and forum posts on why Ron and Hermione were so great together, independent of whether they were better than H/Hr. So much so, that I think it very nearly drowned out the Piers Morgan-sized smugness emanating from the H/Hr camp. One could argue that had JK actually meant R/Hr were not a compatible couple, the enormous response could have convinced her to keep with the canon ships. Of course, this is all speculation, so I dunno.

  I disagree. I think it would be better if they just became a threesome ;)
