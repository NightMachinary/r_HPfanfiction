I think that JKR's whole stance throughout the interview was rather inconsistent. I agree it would be damning if she hadn't said the stuff at the end. But it was not just a qualifier - she actually does refer to her earlier comments from DH about Hermione's weakness for "a funny man:. And if it were just a bone thrown for the R/Hr shippers, she wouldn't have been so vehemently pro R/Hr in CC.

  Obviously, it didn't work.

It did work, because the blowback came after the biased reports of Sunday Times, Hypable, CNN, and not after the actual interview came out.

  I think canon would have worked out more naturally if the trio had simply remained platonic and found romance elsewhere.

I disagree. I think it would be better if they just became a threesome ;)
