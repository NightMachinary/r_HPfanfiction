  Where did this come from out of curiosity? I've never heard of it.

It was from one of the American presidential candidate debates back in February where one of the candidates (Marco Rubio) decided to repeat the same point four times in the space of like five minutes. [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rubio-robot][And thus, the meme was born.]]

  However, and forgive me if I'm incorrect in saying this, didn't Rowling have input on the screenplays or even final approval?
#+end_quote

I don't blame you for thinking this, since it is a common misconception within the fandom. David Heyman admitted himself in 2010 that JKR did not have that much of a role, and he also said that the most important people were, in order: Steve Kloves, himself, and the director. When asked if he was working regularly with JKR, or that she let free rein, he said that he was "a little too free".

JKR was only involved in choosing the actors (such as that they had to be British/Irish), keeping to the very main plot points, and answering any questions the actors or filmmakers had. That's it. There was no real input from JKR.

  Couple that with comments Rowling has made in interviews since Hallows came out concerning Ron and Hermione not working
#+end_quote

To me, it seemed more from those comments she made that she wasn't sure that R/Hr would work out or not, rather than emphatically saying that they would never work out, especially towards the end of that interview.
