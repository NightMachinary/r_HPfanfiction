  Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Steve Kloves didn't know what he was doing. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing. Steve Kloves was undertaking a systematic effort to change canon, to make the HP series more like the rest of his Harmony dreams. That's why he supported turning Ron into comic relief, glorifying Hermione, adding more Harry/Hermione moments and reducing Ginny into furniture. It was a systematic effort to change canon. When I'm screenwriter of the HP films we are going to re-embrace all the characters that made HP the greatest series in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest series in the history of the world.

Where did this come from out of curiosity? I've never heard of it. Also on the movies, I also agree that it is incredibly regrettable what the screenwriters did to Ron's character. I ship Harry/Hermione, but Ron is still great and was a big part of the books. It was disappointing how he was handled in the movies. Same goes for Ginny, the screenwriters had a giant opportunity to correct what many perceived as a problem in HBP and Hallows and flesh out her character more. However, and forgive me if I'm incorrect in saying this, didn't Rowling have input on the screenplays or even final approval? If she had any input at all, I can totally see why many of the more "militant" H/Hr shippers could have spawned from/ and even defend movie canon as they could see that as evidence of Rowling "changing her mind" so to say. Couple that with comments Rowling has made in interviews since Hallows came out concerning Ron and Hermione not working (note that interview said nothing about her and Harry) along with other things, and boom you have a sizable portion of the fandom who has felt trodden on (whether this is true or not) come out the wordwork acting nasty after finally getting their supposed vindication.
