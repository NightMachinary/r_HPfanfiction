I personally have never encountered a militant H/Hr shipper. I tend to stay away from places like tumblr, where they tend to congregate. What defines the pairing for me is the sheer volume of fics in the pairing. Like I said, it's a pairing like any other to me, but there's just too much of it for it to be anything other than repetitious for me. Even if it's the best fic in the world I won't read it because I'm so tired of Hermione as a love interest.

You and me both, friend! Ship and let ship, I say.
