I guess I was just trying at first to explain militant attitude expressed by H/Hr shippers, and then realized a lot of what I was saying applied to all fandoms. I just want everyone to get along, and give constructive feedback on fanfiction rather than use reviews as a way to flame an author's opinion on a pairing or how they wrote their story.

EDIT: As far as your comment about hearsay goes, I would say this however: Don't let a select group of individuals (even if they are loud and obnoxious) define a fandom for you. I've had my opinion dismissed about my preference for Harry/Hermione on the sole basis that folks assumed I was just one of the many cliche trotting fans of that pairing which honestly is really frustrating and disrespectful.
