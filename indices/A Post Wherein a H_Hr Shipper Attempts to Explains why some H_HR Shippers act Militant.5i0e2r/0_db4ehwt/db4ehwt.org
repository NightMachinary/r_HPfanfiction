Um... I'm reading over this and I'm not seeing where you explain why and how H/Hr shippers are /more/ militant about their pairing than most other ships. You're just pointing out that all of us are prone to militarism about our ships, a point which I will definitely grant you.

Now, your point might be that H/Hr shippers /aren't/ more militant about their ship, to which I will counterpoint by saying that everything, and I do mean everything I hear about H/Hr shippers is that they can be goddamn /rabid/ about their pairing, even if they have calmed down over the years. Hearsay, yes, but it's hearsay a lot of people will back up.

If I am wrong about your intention, can you clarify the point you are trying to make?
