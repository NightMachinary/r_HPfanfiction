I do not like the H/Hr ship as a general rule. I just never got the feeling that they'd work as a couple. Mostly because Hermione is extremely strong-willed and bossy, and Harry quite often seemed annoyed by this aspect of her. Not to say that no couple has ever had their incompatible sides, but fanfic authors NEVER address this problem in their stories. Hermione nags and railroads everyone around her, and Harry just passively does whatever she says.

I have read some fics where they are basically friends with benefits, and I like those ones quite a bit more. I'd actually like to see more casual relationships within /all/ the pairings, and not all this talk of soul mates and happily ever after amongst a bunch of 15-year-olds.

*Edit I realise that my comment did not address militant shippers. I apologize. Apparently I just needed to get this off my chest and this thread was the closest thing to the subject that I could find.
