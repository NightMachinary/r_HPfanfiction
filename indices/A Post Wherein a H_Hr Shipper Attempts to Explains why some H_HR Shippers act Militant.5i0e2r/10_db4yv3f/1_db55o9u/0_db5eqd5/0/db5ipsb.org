Thanks for the kind words, things have gotten better. I loved Harry as soon as I picked up the books because I could relate to him. And he wasn't a whiny victim side character, he was the hero of the story. Hermione's heavy-handed methods -while not done maliciously- seem to me like they would actually be harmful to Harry. Even as an adult, I'll have a reaction ranging from intense annoyance to panic attacks when confronted with personalities like Hermione or Ginny. Since I relate to Harry so much, my headcanon always assumed he'd have the same tendencies.

If Harry is going to be paired with anyone, I feel like it would have to be someone who understands give and take, and would know when and how to pick their battles. Hufflepuffs are usually portrayed as the empathetic ones, and Slytherins would have the savvy to know when it's worth arguing a point and when it's best to back down and try another approach. Hermione, in particular, has too much of an "I'm right and you're going to do what I tell you." mentality.
