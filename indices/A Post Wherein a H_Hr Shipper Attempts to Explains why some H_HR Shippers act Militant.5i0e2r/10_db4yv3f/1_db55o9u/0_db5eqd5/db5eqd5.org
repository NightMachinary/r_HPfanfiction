I hope things have got better for you. I was never an unhappy child, competitive, bit of a loner caused by the realisation that I was bored by the level of my friends conversational skills more than anything I loved about my sport and my time in university was people with 'chat' wit that could battle sometimes mean or bullying but the challenge made it unimportant. That whole house stereotype is why I like the pairings I listed. I think after the Chamber of Secrets Ginny's world view must have been shattered even if she only accepted it years later. I don't like how the pairing was written in cannon but extrapolating it kind of makes sense. I just prefer the idea of a Slytherin girl with a low brooding bullshit tolerance who enjoys verbal games.
