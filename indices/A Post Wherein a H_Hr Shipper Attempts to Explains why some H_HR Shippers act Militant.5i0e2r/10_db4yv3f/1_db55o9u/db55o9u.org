  I just feel a Slytherin mind set would work well with Harry and it opens up a lot of plot potentials that were never explored by cannon.

You get me. I was raised similarly to Harry (No cupboard under the stairs, but the constant reminders of not being wanted, scapegoating, being targeted by bigger/stronger kids in the family? All happened to me) I don't think even JKR got this particular part of Harry right, honestly. But from my experience, someone like Hermione or Ginny would not work. Even when someone's intentions are good, being too forthright can feel like an attack or an attempt to control, both of which make me dig in my heels and resist whatever the other person wants. Personally, I always felt like Harry would need someone who was a bit more flexible in their outlook on life than Hermione or Ginny are shown to be. Going by house stereotypes, a Hufflepuff would be able to provide the quiet, unconditional acceptance Harry would need and a Slytherin would have the good sense to know that browbeating Harry would be less than ideal and adapt their methods accordingly.
