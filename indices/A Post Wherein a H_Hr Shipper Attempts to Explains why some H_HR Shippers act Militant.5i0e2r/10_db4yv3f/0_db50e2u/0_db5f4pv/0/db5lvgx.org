That essay is excellent. It brought up so many points that were nagging in the back of my head but I could never pin down. I always get angry on Harry's behalf when an author pairs those two and automatically makes Harry's character jump through hoops to work better with Hermione.

Maybe the reason people like the pairing is because they like /Hermione/ and so of course she should end up with the main character?
