Throughout the books which are Harry's 3rd person POV Hermione is constantly described as shrill and irritating. He is often found avoiding conversation with her, I explained in another thread why I dislike Hermione and someone replied agreeing with me and linking [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/]] Which I found an interesting read. That suggests the cannon evidence isn't really there an I like to imagine cannon ended just before the epilogue, that way Pottermore, cursed child and JKR interviews never existed which generally do more harm than good. I actively avoid reading any interviews or Pottermore so my head cannon can take over. For example I can't believe anyone would work with Hermione, Ron can live with her, he's used to her and rather relaxed to balance her but imagine working with her. She'd be a nightmare, I've read fics where this is a subplot that were quite good but I've heard Pottermore gives her a stellar career. She doesn't play nice with others, we know, we read the books.
