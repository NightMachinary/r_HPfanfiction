While I agree with some of what you say, I do think there is a tendency amongst Harry/Hermione detractors to "Hand wave" away folks who use canon and Rowling's comments to justify the pairing. Has she been misquoted in attempt to justify H/Hr? Most certainly and often obviously, but there are definitely things she has said that DO provide H/Hr shippers with legitimate ammunition (for lack of better term) to defend their stance. This sub tends to ignore that Rowling HAS said things concerning the outcome of the story, even though the things she has said aren't as damning as some H/Hr shippers would lead you to believe (looking at you clickbaity news sources claiming that Rowling explicitly said that Harry and Hermione should have ended up together-that just didn't happen). For me, it has always been enough that JK admitted "that it could have gone that way" as I believe she said, because it means that at least the author herself could see a scenario where it worked out, even if it didn't turn out that way in the conclusion of the series.
