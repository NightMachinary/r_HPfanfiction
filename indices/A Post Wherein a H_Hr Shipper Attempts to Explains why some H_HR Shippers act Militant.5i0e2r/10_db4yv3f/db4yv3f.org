I think you gloss over the righteousness of H/Hr shippers. My preferred pairings are HP/DG or post Hogwarts Gabrielle. In my opinion Harry's life and personality lends itself to two types of women, he lacks love so hufflepuffs, Susan Bones pairing. Why? Because Harry has never had someone to love him unreserved with the effort and friendship an huffepuff brings. Alternatively Harry is a lonely sassy grumpy get, but that's okay because he always tries to do the right thing. He could do well with someone cunning, able to match his sass, battle wits and cut him down when he needs it which is why I like Harry/Slytherin girl pairings.

I know that why he ends up with Ginny is she has all of the above, she loves him like all Weasley do, she is sharp and willing to cut him down like Christmas in fifth year. That being said I'm not a huge fan of how limited her character often is and it doesn't have potential blank slate characters like Daphne and Susan do. What H/Hr shippers are awful at is denying that their pairing doesn't make sense but they just want it to work. They more than any other shippers are millitant because they think they have evidence. They have a habit of quoting, often miss quoting cannon and JKR as Evidence for their pairing. This /evidence/ they feel justifies their believes as it /proves/ something. I will never claim Harry/Daphne has any real backing or endorsement I just feel a Slytherin mind set would work well with Harry and it opens up a lot of plot potentials that were never explored by cannon.
