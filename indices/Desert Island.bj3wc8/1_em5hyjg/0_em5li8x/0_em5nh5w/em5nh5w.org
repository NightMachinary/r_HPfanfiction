Right? But the crazy thing is that they do! That said, if slash isn't your thing then almost the entire fanfic community can be written off. Just from AO3 that I've read so far....

I remember the plot of a few others and some of these I don't remember /super/ well but they were all written well, at the very least. There's also a whole set of Eric/Kyle I refuse to go into (especially the one where Eric is a literal Nazi who meets Kyle in a concentration camp...) so those might be good too. Also, I haven't looked into any fanfics for this on fanfiction or anything else.
