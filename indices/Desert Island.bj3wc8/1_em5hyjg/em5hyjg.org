Oh this is a neat one!

*3 Fanfics*

The Darkness Within, The Rewrite linkffn(5957714)

A Part of Me linkffn(3340621)

And this isn't even a HP fanfic but a South Park one (They have surprisingly good fanfics in that community.) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/446370][From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell]]. It's not fluffy, in fact it's really dark and fucked up, but wow is it good. (Like a lot of South Park Fanfics, I cannot overstate how amazing some of these are.)

*3 Books*

Obviously these are gonna be from the HP universe... Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and the Half Blood Prince, and the Deathly Hallows.

*3 Movies*

Gonna need something lighthearted after those fanfic picks so...

Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Moana

The South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
