The author Minisinoo retired from fanfic to write original fiction. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] was a well-written "Cedric Lives" AU.

My favorite former fanfic writer is Naomi Novik, who wrote the Temeraire series, a Napoleonic Wars alt history with dragons. It was originally based on a Master and Commander slash fanfic. The slashy stuff never appeared in her published works, which disappointed many in her fanfic following. Novik was also a founding member of the Ao3 team, so she was never one of those awful "Fanfic sucks and I'll sue if you write it" authors like Anne McCaffrey (Pern) or Anne Rice (Vampire Chronicles).
