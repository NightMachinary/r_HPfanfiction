[[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][George Norman Lippert]] is a published author who also wrote 5 books (books!) of HP fanfiction, with other works set in the same universe. With Rowling's endorsement, no less. He also has a bunch of other stuff worth checking. Always had a soft spot for him, since his first two HP books were my introduction to HP fanfiction in general.
