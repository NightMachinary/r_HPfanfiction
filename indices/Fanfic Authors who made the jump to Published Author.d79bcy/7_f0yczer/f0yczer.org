Cassandra Clare! She used to write hp fanfiction, I didn't like it very much but I loved her published work. The Dark Artifices are her newest completed trilogy and The Infernal Devices is also a lovely trilogy by her, there are a bunch of companion-books as well and she has a few more books that are going to be out within the next few years in the Shadowhunters universe. I would skip The Mortal Instruments if I were you, You don't need to read it to understand what's going on in the other series because most everything is explained for audiences who don't want to read every single book.
