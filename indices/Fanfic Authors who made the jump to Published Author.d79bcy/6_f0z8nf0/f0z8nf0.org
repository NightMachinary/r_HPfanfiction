[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrew-Seiple/e/B011YIBPNM/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1530637036&sr=8-1][Andrew Seiple]] is a published Author whose primary Original Character (Doctor Dire) first graced our screens in [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm]] during his days writing as /Lost Demiurge/.

Dire now stars in her own book series, with several interesting plot twists.

Yes, he's not (AFAIK) an HP author, but he is a fanfic-writer-turned-proper-author...
