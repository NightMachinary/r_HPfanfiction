What canon has is not so much plot holes as plot quicksand --- where what appears to be a hole at first glance is plugged by some vaguely ground-like substance, except you'll still quickly sink in it if you try to stand on it. In this case, as per the Wiki, it would appear that something like the Trace /cannot/ be put on adult wizards, even if you tried. Uh... why? Never adressed. It is what it is.
