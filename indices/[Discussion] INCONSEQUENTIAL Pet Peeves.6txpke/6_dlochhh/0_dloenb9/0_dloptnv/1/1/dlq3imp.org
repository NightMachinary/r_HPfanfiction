They did use an age-line for example in GoF.

Also, we do not know if the trace is something put actively on a child or if it just is a big map that shows magic near minors (similar to the map in the FB movie).

Really, there is one single thing that makes trace consistent: Somehow, the ministry can tell if magic is done near a minor. It can tell which spells are cast and the location. It cannot tell which wizard triggered the trace.

That makes the story consistent: How TMR could murder Riddle Sr., how Dobby triggered the trace, how the ministry detected the patronus in OOtP and how they knew what happened in PoA.

The reason for the trace and the RDoUS is also obvious: An untrained wizard is unlikely to be able to fix damage he might do and probably is less responsible overall.

The trace doesn't open more plot-holes than time-turners, it's actually semi-consistent to some other concepts.
