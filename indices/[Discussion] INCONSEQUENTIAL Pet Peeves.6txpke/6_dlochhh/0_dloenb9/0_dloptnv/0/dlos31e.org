Specific to the Riddle-Morfin murder situation, I reasoned out that Dumbledore's explanation of the process was incorrect, even based on his assumptions!

Thankfully the simpler solution is that Riddle used the Imperius/Possession on Morfin and had him do the actual killing of the Riddles. Much easier for Morfin to remember actually killing them with his own wand instead of making up a fake memory of it, and with Tom casting the Imperius in the Gaunt's shack, his spells would be ignored.
