The peeves I essentially have to endure are the ones I've committed in the past.

Using 'lead' when intending 'led', as in not the element but the past tense of the action a leader performs [and so, I swallow]

Prophesy & prophecy in the same story/chapter/[paragraph, damnit]. At one point I tried to excuse it by saying 'prophesy' was a verb where 'prophecy' was a noun, but bullshit will be male ruminant feces no matter how you try to mask it. [swallow]

'Notice-me-not' isn't a canon spell. [swallow]

The Trace being on the wand- I know how it works now, but back in the day the fanon led me down a different path. So, in order to avoid hypocrisy... [swallow]

Here's one that isn't mine; 'owlrey'. It's such an obscure word that is only more common in our fanfiction due to theme. It's still a speed bump, but I'll let it pass.
