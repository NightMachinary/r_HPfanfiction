Regarding Hogwarts, I get irritated when the author mentions graduating from Hogwarts. No, UK kids don't get fanfare or a party, they just leave school and get on with their lives. I know it's usually US authors assuming that their experience is everyone's experience, but 5 seconds of Googling can save one a lot of trouble.
