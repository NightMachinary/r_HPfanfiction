Yeah, me too. I don't think Hermione would let herself be nicknamed so, but it's not implausible for someone to make up this nickname for a longer-named person like Hermione. And Gin is, in some respects, much more ridiculous, inasmuch as "Ginny" is /already a nickname itself/, but it fits her personality better than Hermione.
