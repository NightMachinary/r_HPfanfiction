It's not really something that will /always/ make me abandon a story, but if it's bad enough I'll have to stop. For me, the issue is misspelling stuff like names, places, incantations, etc.

/THERE'S A WIKI FOR A FUCKING REASON./

People who misspell stuff that's ported over from canon have either done so for artistic reasons - like in stories such as /To Reach Without/, where the author's interest in language leads to the inclusion of symbols and accents and stuff in words (which I don't mind because it's obviously intended and kinda cool to read) - or because they aren't paying attention to detail, and the latter just makes me sigh sadly when I see it. With the wealth of resources available to ensure proper spelling of canon components, it's disappointing that people who identify as fans of HP can't even do simple stuff like spell /Dolores Umbridge./
