It showed lots of boys thought she was pretty, but in canon she only dated two before Harry. I'm fine if the author makes the change for a specific purpose, but my specific gripe is when they do it for no reason. It's like other fics that make Harry a professional quidditch star but a chaser, not seeker as in canon. The change makes no difference to the plot, it just grinds my gears a bit.
