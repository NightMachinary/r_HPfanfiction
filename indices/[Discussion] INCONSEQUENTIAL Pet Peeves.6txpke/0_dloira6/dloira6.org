I hate when the author randomly changes a completely inconsequential fact in an otherwise canon-compliant fic. Like I've seen a lot of stories (typically set post battle) where Ginny is mentioned as dating a lot of boys in school. The point is made but has no bearing on anything and the author isn't trying to portray Ginny in a poor light, but it's just there. What's the point?
