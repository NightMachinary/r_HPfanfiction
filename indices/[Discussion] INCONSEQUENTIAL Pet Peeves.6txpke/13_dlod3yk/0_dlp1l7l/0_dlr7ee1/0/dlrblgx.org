But that just opens a can of flobberworms. If that's so, and it's specifically expensive... how are the Weasleys paying, again? What did all the poor kids do? Surely Tobias Snape had no money aside that he'd yield to give for Snape's education. Plus, where would all that gold be /going/ in the first place? Not in paying the House-Elves, obviously, and they grow the food themselves, not to mention the Professors can conjure, Transfigure or magically repair any non-edible equipment they need. The only place this money could go would be into paying the teachers and assorted human staff. But there aren't that many teachers, said teachers don't look /that/ wealthy for the most part (could Snape not have traded Spinner's End for something a little larger and comfier, if he'd had the large salary this would imply), and the idea of Filch or Hagrid having a high-paying job is laughable. What else? Taxes? Doesn't square too well with Hogwarts calling itself independant from the Ministry to the point that the Ministry had very little pressure to express on them.
