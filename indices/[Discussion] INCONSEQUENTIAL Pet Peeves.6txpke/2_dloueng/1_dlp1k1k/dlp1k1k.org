Using an incantation (any incantation) for Apparation is indeed really bloody stupid. It's not even really a "spell" as such. On the othe rhand... I can easily excuse "/Fiendfyre/" being its own incantation. /That/ one is clearly a powerful Dark spell that would presumably have an incantation, and perhaps it is best for an author without much imagination to use the spell-name as incantation rather than make up some unconvincing /Canis Latinicus/.
