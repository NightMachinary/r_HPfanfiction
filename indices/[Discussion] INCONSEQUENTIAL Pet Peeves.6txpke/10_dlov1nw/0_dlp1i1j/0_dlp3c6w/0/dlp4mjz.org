I'm on board with you, but a lot of people want their fanfiction to read like an additional book that Rowling could conceivably have written ("more of the same" to curb their disappointment that there's not more of canon). Moreover, a lot of such departures seem to be more the authors /misunderstanding/ the canon facts rather than purposefully changing them, or at least that was the case in older stories. Magical cores are an interesting idea, and some stories like linkffn(Core Threads) make their existence and their behavior part of their premise, but you'll find people who seem convinced that cores exist in the /canon books/'s continuity, and it annoys most people on this sub to no end.
