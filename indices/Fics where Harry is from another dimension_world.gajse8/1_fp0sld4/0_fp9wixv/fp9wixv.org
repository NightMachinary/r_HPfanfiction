One of my favorites.

As for "Harry from another dimension/world" stories, try these. Most of them are Harry /going/ to another dimension, rather than /coming from/ one, though.

linkffn(Fortune Favors the Damned by AkoyaMizuno). Harry gets transported to another universe, but still has a connection to Voldemort.

linkffn(A Step to the Right by CatsAreCool). When Hermione is sucked into a strange vortex, Harry follows her.

linkffn(Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday by bobsaqqara).

linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest). Master of Death Harry crosses into the Marvel universe.

linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm). Something goes wrong on the Gringotts raid, and Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna wind up in another dimension.

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Ritual of Merlin's Choice by AngelMorph). Harry and Luna try for a redo in another dimension.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper by Clell65619). Harry is given another chance in a different dimension.

linkffn(World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren). Harry is summoned to another dimension. He's not the first one summoned. Very good story, but there are mentions of slash (nothing explicit - the original Harry in the dimension was in a relationship with Draco).

linkffn(Strange Reflections by LeQuin). The last thing Harry needed after winning was a family of Potters showing up.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side by Clell65619). Voldemort banishes Harry into a dimension where everyone is the opposite sex.

linkffn(Results of a Proper Introduction by dunuelos). A dimension-traveling Harry helps other Harrys.

linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon). Harry swore to defeat Voldemort in all forms.

linkffn(Where We Only Cry From Joy by Southern Hearts). Harry is summoned to another dimension.

linkffn(The Archeologist by Racke). Curse-breaker Harry wakes up in a grave belonging to Rose Potter.
