Tom Riddle is like Tyler Durden from Fight Club. In his childhood, Tom is the only friend Harry has and the only kid who dares to stand up to Dudley's gang of bullies. In Hogwarts he is always the man with the plan, he punishes Snape, Malfoy and Filch when they bother Harry, he is the charismatic inspiring leader of the DA and he doesn't know that he's helping Harry bring about his downfall.

Alternatively, he's disgusted of what his true-self has become and wants to take over Harry's body and destroy the current Voldemort.
