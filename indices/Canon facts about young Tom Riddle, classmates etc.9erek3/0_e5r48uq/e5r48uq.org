There's [[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/tom-riddle][Pottermore]], [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/riddle-family/tom-riddle/][HP Lexicon]], and the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle][Harry Potter Wiki]]. I personally use HP Lexicon the most, but they all have their value. The lexicon and Wiki both offer easy to search lists for potions and spells and the like too. If I remember right, though, the Harry Potter Wiki's compilation of info includes everything Harry Potter, from the books, to the movies, to PS2 games, and so forth. So, be careful if you choose that one as your fact-checking source, because if you count the books as canon, but not video games, some spells or potions may not be canon to you and may make your story "AU" if you use them.
