In my opinion there are already quite a few stories chronicling Riddle's life from infancy through his school years. Most of them involve the insertion of an OC or time traveler, but even so I feel like that period of his life has already received a thorough treatment from fic authors.

Fics that cover Riddle's years after Hogwarts are rarer, and in particular there are almost no fics that explore what happened during his years spent out of England. I'd love to read a well written fic on that topic.
