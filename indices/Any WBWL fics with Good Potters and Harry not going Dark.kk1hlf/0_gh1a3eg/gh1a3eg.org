“Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin” is somewhat close to what you're asking for. It subverts a lot of WBWL tropes and is generally a really good fic in my opinion.

A few notes:\\
* James and Jim (Harry's brother) start out shitty, but they genuinely improve. And yes, Harry does do a revenge thing, but it wasn't over-the-top.\\
* The prologue is very misleading; it's written to look as if it's fitting into the regular tropes of the genre. If you don't like it, skip it and come back to it later. I didn't like the prologue, but this is still one of my favorite fics of all time.\\
* This fic's tone is a lot darker than canon, so if you have a problem with that this probably isn't the fic for you.
