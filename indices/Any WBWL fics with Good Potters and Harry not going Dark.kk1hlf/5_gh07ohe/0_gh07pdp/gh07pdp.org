  When Voldemort attacked Godric Hollow, James Potter died defending his twin girls while Lily was away. Charlotte Potter was proclaimed the Girl-Who-Lived who destroyed Voldemort, while her twin Harriet was left a squib and sent to be adopted by her aunt Petunia Evans.Ten years later, Hogwarts letters are on the way, and Petunia's greatest fear is that her daughter might turn out to be a witch after all.
