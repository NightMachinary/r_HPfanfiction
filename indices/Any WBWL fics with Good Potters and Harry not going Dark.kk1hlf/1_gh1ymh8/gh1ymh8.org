[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10639968/1/][Neglentia]] is a fantastic one-shot with two sequels. Voldemort is dead, people are sane, it isn't some absurd Dumbledore plot. Harry suffered from a fairly serious case of neglect, and the plot is about major events where he comes to terms with his childhood.
