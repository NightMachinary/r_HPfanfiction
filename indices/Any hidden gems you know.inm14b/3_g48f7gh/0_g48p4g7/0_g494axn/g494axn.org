More so I just prefer broody and socially awkward. In this fandom, that's usually Snape. Sometimes Draco. There's some great Theo fics.

I read a really good fic once with Marcus Flint who was dyslexic instead of stupid.

My pairings in other fandoms should check out. Daryl Dixon, Sesshomaru, Mr. Gold, Tarrant Hightop/Madhatter.

Basically, any weirdo.
