All the fictions over there are either Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Severus, I don't know about other, but hidden gems for me, are fictions that focus on original plot, or with interesting world building, good AU and etc., and have a few views because neither Ao3 or ffn.net have a Trending option search, not fictions that focus on relationship and really not on overused ship.
