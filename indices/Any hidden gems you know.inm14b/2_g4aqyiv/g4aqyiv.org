A few kid-Harry stories:

- A Magical Childhood by Kendra James. Pre-Hogwarts. linkffn(5926057)
- Making Lemonade by Dayja. Pre-Hogwarts (ends at Sorting Feast). linkffn(11123626)
- The Switch by Bearbone. Unfinished, but the setup is complete and you can fill in the blanks. linkffn(11769956)

A fun read that is truly "hidden" because it's not on the usual sites: [[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by mouse (gen)

And a truly unique time-travel story: The Young Adventurer's Club by Artemisgirl. Snape/Hermione but they're the same age. linkffn(9993319)
