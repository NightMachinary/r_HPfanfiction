There's this one time travel tomarry fic (don't worry, there's literally no smut, only implied, it's a VERY slow burn that's not romantically centered, and there's no adult/teen nonsense) where Harry had an "accident" and travelled back in time to the 1940s and attended school with Tom. It was called /"Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat"/ , I'm pretty sure, and it was AMAZING. The romantic tension was nonexistent in the beginning, and Tom and Harry had this on and off friendship/rivalry thing, and it's not even centered around them? It builds on the home lives of some other supporting characters, like Orion Black, and gives some insight to the suffragist movement and the Muggle world a little bit. Druella and Walburga are also both characterized pretty well outside of "bad no good harpy jealous women", and honestly I live for the plot. There are also as lot more things that happen, but there's too much to really describe out of things that would be spoilers. I really recommend it, it's not edgy or dark or anything, it's actually a pretty good contrast amongst "overly-pretty-succubus-dark-powerful-Harry" slash fics.
