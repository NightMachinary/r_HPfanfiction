This is a story where Snape makes friends with the portrait in Slytherin common room and one night, the man in the portrait steps outside and becomes a bad arse DADA professor and later on, there's a romantic relationship. The man has come from the time of the Founders, so the fanfic has historical levels and also the present-day battle against Voldemort. So even that the romance is there, it gets descriptive very rarely and the amounts of research that have gone to most of the details in history (and sometimes otherwise too) are commendable.
