A Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow on AO3 is really amazing. Its at 59 chapters right now and there has been no romance. Its an AU where Voldemort won and Harry goes to Durmstrang. It starts off a little slow been becomes VERY interesting and pretty dark. The new triwizard tournament tasks are downright terrifying but really fantastic. Also the only fic with use of necromancy that isn't over powered garbage or utter nonsense.
