I read a lot of Remus/Sirius, so these all feature that pairing.

For funny dialogue and a really inventive version of the triwizard tournament, there's 'Into the Fire'. It's got excellent charactarization as well. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013#workskin]])

I love everything by the Divine Comedian. As far as I'm concerned they're the best writer in the HP verse, with really unique, funny and scary takes on things like boggarts and polyjuice potion and dementors. 'Blackpool' is really popular on this site, but I'll recommend another one which features an alternative ending for the 31st of october, 1981. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982]])

For a fancy, very literary style, I'd recommend anything by Montparnasse, who writes both slash and femmeslash. For instance linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10400106]])

A novel-length coming-of-age one that's very popular is 'All the Young Dudes'. It gives Remus a very alternative upbringing and backstory and otherwise keeps to canon. It's excellent if you like binging on the 70's and the music of that decade. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]])

Finally, this is perhaps the most heartbreaking story I've ever read. Sticks to canon, is beautifully written and deeply traumatizes you. You need an AO3 account to read it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392015]])
