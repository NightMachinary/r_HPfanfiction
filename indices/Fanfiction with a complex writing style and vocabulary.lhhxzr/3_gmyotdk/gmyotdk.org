As much as I lament that poor grammar and incorrect English are common in fanfiction, it takes a lot for it to be a showstopper for me. I can forgive a lot for a good story, particularly if I can tell that the author is using English as a second (or subsequent) language. That's not to say it doesn't bother me, though.

As for sentences that are "too short," Ernest Hemingway would like to disagree.

Yes, I am being somewhat facetious, but short sentences are effective and are often being promoted over longer, more involved, sentences.

I suspect that a lot of the simplicity in what's being written is due to a couple of things. Here in the US, at least, the books assigned for reading in school no longer emphasize older works that were written when eloquent and flowery language was more common, with longer sentences with multiple subordinate clauses. Second, I don't believe that middle and high school students are being taught to diagram sentences anymore, which is a useful technique for learning how to read and understand, and thus be capable of correctly writing, long and involved sentences.
