Shameless self-promotion:

My story might meet your criteria. I was lucky enough to have some merciless high school teachers who pushed me to become a better writer. My writing isn't flowery, but I use a rich vocabulary and pay close attention to clarity, rhythm, and flow.

Furthermore, ESL readers have said my story is easy to read, particularly because there's so much dialogue. And other readers have told me how genuine my dialogue sounds.

To balance the self-promotion, I can also recommend /[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants]]/ by Endrina.
