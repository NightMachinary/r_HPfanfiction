No problem -- thanks for asking!

The background for my fic is that I found JKR's epilogue incredibly depressing ("Former child soldier marries high school sweetheart and enters law enforcement!"), and I wanted to write an alternative.

Personally, I grew up tremendously during college, and I'm giving my characters something similar, only without the actual university. So Harry meets loads of new people, has various girlfriends (but no harem), slowly deals with trauma, explores new magic, etc. I also give Hermione a lot of attention, but not as much as Harry.

The first chapter should be enough to give you the flavor. The writing and story improve considerably over time, but chapter one is a solid start. And the overall mood is very fun, with minimal angst, so it's a nice escape from outside stress.
