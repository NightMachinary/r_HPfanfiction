I divide learning to write into four stages:

1. Very simple (e.g., the typical primary school essay)
2. Too ornate: purple prose, too many adjectives, "emerald orbs," etc.
3. A return to simplicity, only more nuanced than before. Better rhythm, a richer vocabulary, etc. You'll see this in well-written straight journalism.
4. Mastery (i.e., the author's voice). Great prose writers have a distinct voice, and some are more flowery than others. But they are always clear, and words are chosen carefully.

  the latter often leads to purple prose and bloated word-count as the author tries so hard to put in all that fancy grammar.

That's stage 2, and the writer needs to learn to tighten their prose first.

One thing I like about canon is the way JKR's prose grows up along with Harry. All the books are well-written, but the each book is aimed at a successively higher reading level.
