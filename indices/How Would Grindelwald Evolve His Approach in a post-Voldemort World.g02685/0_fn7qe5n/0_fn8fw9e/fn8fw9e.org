Interesting. Up front, I was asking this to get the brain juices going for how to go about doing this in a story. I like this suggestion. One thing that came to my mind (since it would also be in line with other events in the story I'm drafting) is for some young Muggleborns to be caught by some governments using thier abilities. The wizards catch them experimenting on children, and as a user below points out, this is a universal agreed upon issue so it might be enough to force the issue, as you put it.
