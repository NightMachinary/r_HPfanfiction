Political route. Point out how much forces were tied up with enforcing the statute, especially since the Death Eaters didn't stay away from muggle targets, tending to launch hit and run attacks, leaving the aurors to clean up the mess. Hence the Death Eaters were using the statute to their own ends, therefore it was aiding them.

​

If the statute is ended, however, the muggles can assist and in fact in many cases can clean up messes themselves.

​

Apeal to the conservatives by pointing out that this exposure to the WW will stop muggleborns from entering the world ignorant, while sneakily pointing out to the progressives that this will cause more muggle elements to be introduced to the WW by neccesity.

​

Apeal to their wallets by pointing out the opportunities gained by making muggles pay for magical experiences and products, which will create jobs.
