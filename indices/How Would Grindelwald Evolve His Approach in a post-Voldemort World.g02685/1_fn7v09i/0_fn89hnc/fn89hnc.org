Interesting suggestions, especially on the level of tactics. I don't think the wizards in government care the expense of the cover-ups since they treat being revealed to the Muggles as an extremely grave possibility. I do think that if something suitably extreme happened (and kept happening) to wizards - especially children - then that might be another kind of cost that could substitute for money. Maybe more so, since it goes across political lines. Say, Muggle experimentation on undiscovered Muggleborns when their strange abilities are captured on camera?

What do you think?
