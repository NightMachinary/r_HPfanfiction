Been a while since I read that fic, but IIRC it's quite the opposite, she sees her daughter, and it's NOT her, time is not a loop. She feared that her daughter would be her and all that, but when the girl is two, Astoria realizes that's not the case.

Edit: Just re-read it the ending. Definitely think that's what the author meant.
