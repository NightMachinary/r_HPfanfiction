It's a time loop, I think. Astoria is looking at her daughter in the end, thinking that she's going to grow up to travel back in time and marry Harry too. Astoria realizes she and Harry are going to be killed, since her father (Harry) and mother (herself) were killed when she was younger.

At least, I think.
