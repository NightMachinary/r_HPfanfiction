In Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694), Harry has no use for 'The Quidditch', and he feels it could be quite dangerous if you fell off your broom. So Harry experiments with special underwear treated with /Arresto Momentum./ Harry then test his invention by jumping up during class and leaping off the Astronomy tower. After he lives, Hermione shouts, "Harry Potter I hope you DIE in detention!" "I can arrange that!", shouts Professor Sinistra.

That's not the only spell he puts on underwear. This Harry's a little odd.

In Harry McGonagall linkffn(3160475), Harry and his sister do build a functioning hoverboard inspired by Back to the Future. Harry uses it to good effect in the Tri Wizard tournament. The epilogue had Harry and his sister with Sirius and Remus open a quidditch shop selling the hoverboards.
