They weren't endorsed by Rowling, it really irks me that people advertise it as such. He didn't understand fanfic as a concept so specifically sought out her permission to write it unnecessarily, and then when she said yes as long as you don't make money from it (which he is cheekily ignoring by having a Kofi link in my opinion), it somehow got twisted into her endorsing them, which would be a completely different level. They're decent enough fanfics, there's no denying that, but they're not a higher status than others.
