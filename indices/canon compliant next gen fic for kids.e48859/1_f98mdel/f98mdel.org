I've recommended this series several times, and it seems to fulfill your needs. They were actually my very first introduction to the world of HP fanfiction. It's a series of books by [[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][George Norman Lippert]]. They're canon compilant, and they follow the story of James and Albus and their new friends in their school years after the epilogue. There's a total of 5 books (yes, books), and they're really well written, and the narrative style matches that of Rowling very well. They were even endorsed by Rowling herself at some point. You can find them all in Lippert's [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][site]].
