This is one of my favorite next gen fics. I felt it captured the feel of the original seven books. I don't remember how kid friendly it is as it's rated T and I haven't read it in a while. But the story is centered around next gen kids like Teddy Lupin. It was written shortly after DH was published, so it has the feeling of reading more of the books due to direct references to parts of DH
