At risk of being downvoted into oblivion-

Have they read The Cursed Child? Its the play that was released based on the epilogue. Its been released in book that you can buy and I think you could have a lot of fun reading it with them if you guys split up the roles and acted out the voices. It would be age appropriate reading if they read the original series without any trouble.
