The thing is, it's hard to do the kind of novel things you seem to be looking for well. Mostly because they make bad stories. But, if you're just looking for different then there are tons of fics that use unique or interesting plots. If it's written well then it's sure to become a classic. (Or if it's written badly enough. My Immortal.)
