Not who you asked, but it really does depend. I'd take a moment to browse the first few pages of your selected fandom & see which fics have been marked CNTW. I've been in fandoms where every fourth fic was CNTW, not because of any messed up stuff inside, but due to a combination of people not wanting to deal with warnings, not wanting to spoil the plot, not understanding what CNTW even means (some people believe it means "no warnings apply," which it doesn't) or because the fandom was old and mostly reposts/imports and they were default marked that either by the authors or the importers.
