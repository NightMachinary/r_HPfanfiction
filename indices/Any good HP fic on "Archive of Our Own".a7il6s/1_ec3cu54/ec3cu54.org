I see you posted this in multiple fandom subs. My suggestion: learn how to use the search. [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq?language_id=en]]

You can exclude pretty much anything (including rape and violence, higher ratings, relationship categories, and any other tag) from your search. "creator chose not to use archive warnings" should probably be excluded if you absolutely don't want to risk reading fics that might have that content as well.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/unofficial-browser-tools?language_id=en#triggertools]] there's also programs like ao3savior that let you create global blocklists for tags you don't want to see.

There are over 67,000 HP fanfics on the Archive rated General audiences or Teen and up audiences that do not contain: Graphic Depictions Of Violence, Major Character Death, Rape/Non-Con, or Underage. If you tailor the search to what you're looking for, I bet you'll find at least a few stories you like.
