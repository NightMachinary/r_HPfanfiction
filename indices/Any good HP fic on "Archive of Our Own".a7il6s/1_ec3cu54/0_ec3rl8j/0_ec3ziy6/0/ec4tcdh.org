  I don't get what feels like 80% fics where Harry cheats on Ginny with Malfoy.

Yay, insecure butthurt shippers who are salty and make cheating and bashing stories because their ship is delusional. It's either Harry cheating with Malfoy on Ginny because she "sucks" or Ginny is "cheating whore who only cares for Harry because of his money and fame". Author who publish such trash and readers who read that shit are the worst part of fandom.
