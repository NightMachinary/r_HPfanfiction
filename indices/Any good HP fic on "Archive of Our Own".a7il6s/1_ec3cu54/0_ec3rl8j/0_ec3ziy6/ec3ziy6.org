Yeah, plus that tendency to include tags for ships that are just there for the author to shit on them.

Like, if I'm searching for Harry/Ginny I have to add a rediculous number of other filters just so I don't get what feels like 80% fics where Harry cheats on Ginny with Malfoy.

And even with all those gone there's still plenty of stories that just mention Harry/Ginny in passing while focusing on someone else entirely.

The tagging system of AO3 is a hot mess and could really use some kind of rework.
