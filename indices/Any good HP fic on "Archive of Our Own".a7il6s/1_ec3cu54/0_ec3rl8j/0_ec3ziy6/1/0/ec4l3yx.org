First off it's not. Yes, there's lots of slash but there's lots of non slash too and while the LGBTQ scene is definitely a huge aspect of the site it never claimed to be exclusively for LGBTQ content.

Secondly my issues with the tagging system have nothing to do with slash and everything to do with the fact that it doesn't differentiate between ships that are actually shipped by the story, ships that are anti-shipped (which are included simply so they can break up and make room for the real ship), and all the other 20 ships the author included because they were mentioned in a throwaway line somewhere.

Heck, even if a story is explicitly tagged with "former Alice/Bob", the tag is counted as a variant of "Alice/Bob" and thus still shows up in "Alice/Bob" searches, even though it's the exact opposite of what someone searching "Alice/Bob" is looking for. That's just bad site design.
