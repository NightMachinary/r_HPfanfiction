I love AO3, it's so easy to get around and you can easily read an entire fic without having to go chapter by chapter.

â€‹

Play with the search function, go to a fandom you like [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]] and start with the simple search on the right side. You can exclude many things. And start with sort by kudos, you'll get the stories that people have liked. Once you find a fic you like, check the authors page and see what the author has favorited.

I don't pay a lot of attention to more then the first line of tags, and if the tags are longer then a couple lines I tend not read it.
