I also have no idea why Hermione or Nevile stick around. They mostly seem to be stock characters for the Slytherins to go "lol, silly dumb wrong Gryffindors, worrying about morality and shit." And every problem is solved by Harry being an amazing genius who is never wrong about anything ever.

The firs part was great, but every installment after that has really gone down hill.
