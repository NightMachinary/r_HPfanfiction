Sure, in the sense that writing any canon 'good' character as an antagonist is 'bashing'. In my opinion, the author of SaS does a good job portraying Dumbledore and James' perspectives so that it's believable why they would think of themselves as being in the right. That puts this fic on a different level from what I would call 'heavy bashing' in which the bashed characters are one-dimensional baddies.
