I have some favorites on Ao3 that are less than 90k+ words. That's a pretty steep requirement. The only longer one I can recomend is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series. It's a WBWL Slytherin!Harry fic that is currently partway through book 5, clocking in at 578k+. The first book in the series is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]].
