I remember there being a (Ravenclaw!Harry?) story where he keeps leaving cat treats for Mrs. Norris to keep Filch out of his hair. He comments on it when the Chamber of Secrets gets opened and Mrs. Norris gets petrified, saying something along the lines of "I know it wasn't you that did this, I saw the cat treats you keep leaving."

No idea which fic it was, though.

EDIT: Found it, the series is called "Harry Potter and the Consequences of the Trip to the Library in Primary School" and it starts here: linkao3(12915570)
