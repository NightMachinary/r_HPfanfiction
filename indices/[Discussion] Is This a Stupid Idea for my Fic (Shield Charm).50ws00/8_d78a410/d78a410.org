Sounds fine. One thing, though:

#+begin_quote
  There's also no such thing as "high level" versions of spells. For instance, there isn't a stronger version of the Shield Charm that only elites use.

Don't get too hung up on that. It is canon that there is "Incendio" and the /Fiendfyre/ spell (how the latter is cast, I do not know).

It is canon that there are definite differences between these two spells despite them both conjuring flames. /Fiendfyre/ destroys to a much greater extent than /Incendio/, there is something integral to /Fiendfyre/ that eclipses the lesser spell in its destructivity. I do not know how this is done, however certain fanfics have fiendfyre being an almost sentient manifestation of magical flames that is out-of-control from the moment it is conjured and that the caster of the magic must "reign-in" control of the spell to make it obey their requirements.

Through this comparison we can suppose that there /are/ spells which are inherently more powerful than other spells that perform similar effects. In this vein we can presume this is not limited to magically conjured flame and can extend to magical shielding with little further explanation needed. It doesn't need to be "Protego Maxima". A relatively easy way to introduce the /concept/ of higher-level spells would be to write something like:

Addendum: Got a bit carried away. This is quite an interesting topic to write about. I carried on writing this really to just persuade you to be a little creative with your world/magic-building. Let us call the following my /library oneshot/.

As soon as Harry awoke the Saturday following his talk with Dumbledore he made his way to the library. He held a written pass from Dumbledore himself in hand and gave it to the Madam Pince, she looked at Dumbledore's loopy signature sceptically while he stood waiting. However much she didn't want to she was duty-bound and relented, nodding him towards the Restricted Section with a harsh warning of keeping quiet /lest he tempt fate./

She was definitely no Voldemort but he'd rather not upset her. He shuffled past her and into through the metal gating into the restricted section. Fortunately there was no one else there and he quickly found the Defence Against the Dark Arts shelves, keen to learn the more powerful protective magic that Dumbledore alluded to. He'd noted down everything he could remember Dumbledore saying when he had returned to his room that night; Protective charms like Protego were just the start of the journey, Dumbledore had said. "A simple spell of singular utility, widely adaptable and malleable with practice."

To possess the skills he wanted, no - /needed/ - to develop, Harry would need to dig deep and understand how protective magics work on the /conceptual/ level - no easy feat. He browsed the old tomes on their dark wooden shelves contemplatively. Where was best to start ... Harry huffed before pulling a small, well-worn book from a lower shelf, /Thicker than Blood: The Magic Within./ He found a comforable looking chair and, unfamiliarly, found himself quite looking forward to furthering his knowledge; this wasn't about making teacups dance, this was about /life and death/ for him, preferably the former.

--------------

Harry found his eyes wandering to the clock on the wall, he'd silenced it ten minutes into his study session as it was impossibly distracting. To his surprise he'd found that four hours had passed since he'd last got up, when he needed parchment for notes. He had almost thirty inches of material from this one small book, almost all of the notes were perspective-changing and left him in awe of magic more completely than could ever remember being. Was this what Hermione felt like when she read her books? He looked at the shelves surrounding him with undisguised glee.

There was so much more to the field of defensive magic than he imagined. He could barely scarcely believe that hundreds of years ago people crafted charms that brought entirely new /concepts/ of magic to the fore, and defined myriad methodologies to casting them for every scenario you could possibly think of. Their ideas were so powerful and /true/ that they are still used today. No one had invented anything that surpassed them yet.

Harry read through his notes again. Some of his writing was so cryptic he had to go to each page he referenced to cement his understand of what he was waffling about.

/Learn to make spells more compact - more difficult to block - pg 36/

/BLOOD IS MAGIC - YOU ARE MAGIC - pg 146/

And underneath that: /MUM IS A GENIUS!!! DO HER PROUD!/

--------------

He still had forty or fifty pages left of /The Magic Within/ and had finished it not forty minutes later. There was nothing truly impressive in the latter end of the book, though it tied together a few ideas it had been shifting around since the start. Charms that create shields around you aren't very different from the manifest shape of the Patronus charm. One could, theoretically, explode out their Patronus to form a sphere around them... it was a tantalizing prospect and warranted practical experiment.

He did get a rush out of one line in the book. /The Patronus casting, while admirable to know in itself, is impractical as only well-developed mages can give it form enough to repel volumes of foes, more practical spells would be.../

Harry had almost laughed when he'd read that. In his third year he repelled hundreds of dementors to stop them from devouring Sirius's soul! If that didn't count as "volumes of foes" he didn't know what would. He had to try learning these "more practical spells" and see if they were any easier to learn, if he could cast a Patronus he had a good chance of getting the hang of the others. He had a list of almost a dozen he would try to cast by the days' end if he could manage it.

--------------

It had been a month since that first library visit and Harry was hooked on learning - more avid than Hermione, even. Why wouldn't he be?

He'd been back to the restricted section six times since that first visit. He need a new pass from a teacher each time and had discovered that if your help a professor with something, such as helping to tutor a first-year lesson on your free time, then you could get the pass as a form of reward. Part of him wished he'd gotten the Prefect's badge over Ron because that would let him access the Restricted Section at his leisure.

He'd learned so much in the last month - more than he could believe. He thanked the gods that seemed to watch over him for his twin-wand. He was certain that without it he'd be dead many times over. Voldemort had much more experience than him with this sort of thing but he was determined to close the gap. He just needed to take it day-by-day and layer advanced concepts ontop of simpler concepts. Eventually, with practice, he'd get there.

Once you've finished educating the reader on the "limits" and general concepts of magic, you can get away with saying:

/A scythe of deep-red exploded from Voldemort's wand with a thunderclap. From the moment of it's casting Harry had paled, then thrust his wand out, a split second later Voldemort's black magic fragmented and blew apart in angry sparks./

Voldemort's eyes narrowed at the magic Harry had thrown out. He wasn't impressed, but he wasn't unimpressed either.

/"I see you've learned some tricks since last time," said Voldemort./
