I interpret it as Voldemort using a Shield Charm with a level of mastery that allows him to literally conjure a physical shield. The end result is no different than if it was explicitly stated it was a conjuration, but the way in which this end result was achieved speaks to Voldemort's skill. I'm not implying that the physical shield is the ultimate version of the Shield Charm, just that this is something Voldemort can do with it. In the same vein, I believe Dumbledore's fire whip to be a manipulation of the Fire Charm.
