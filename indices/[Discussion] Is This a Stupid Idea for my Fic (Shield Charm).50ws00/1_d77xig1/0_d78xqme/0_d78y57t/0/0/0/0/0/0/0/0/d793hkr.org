Thematically speaking, I find Voldemort inventing a way to block the Killing Curse fitting for him. For Voldemort, the KC isn't as final as for someone else anyway. I feel like he doesn't get credit for surviving a direct hit. Sure, Harry wasn't reduced to a wraith thanks to love magic, but Voldemort survived the KC all the same.

This is more fanfic-specific than general headcanon. It's an interpretation that's useful for the fanfic I'm writing. I take a flexible approach to canon.
