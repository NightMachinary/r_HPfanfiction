The following is stated with the intent not to continue an argument but rather to flesh out my ideas.

My principal objection to an innovation allowing defence against the killing curse is thematic. The unblockability of the Killing Curse formed the basis of the entire HP storyline and was the principal factor in Harry's specialness. To have a block be discovered is to undermine the basis of the story.

Furthermore, the unblockability of the killing curse to me clearly represents the inevitability of death. If spells are magical representations of concepts, then the concept represented by the Killing Curse is death. Not only would a block undermine the theme of accepting death, I feel like the reason why a magical defence can never be made is because it is impossible to avoid death. Even the universe itself will one day "die".

I think wizards have as good a chance of discovering a block to the Killing Curse as Muggles have a chance of breaking the second law of thermodynamics.
