I don't believe so, no. Remember that Hermione was warned against changing the timeline and especially against meeting her past self.

The fact that such a thing had to be actively avoided, even though we know from the "first time" through the timeline that they didn't meet themselves, indicates that it is possible to change the timeline.

I think the PoA time travel situation is this: if you use the time turner "correctly" i.e. in accordance with good practice, then a closed loop is the result. That is safe time travel. But it is possible to use it badly and mess up the timeline.

The real change to the time travel mechanic in Cursed Child (other than the increased range) was that you don't have to live your way back to the present but rather the time turner is capable of taking you forward in time back to your present.
