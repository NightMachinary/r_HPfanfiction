Actually, something you mentioned in your review of the CC play on DLP made me think about it a bit. You said that you liked the new time turner because it showed that the Wizarding world isn't stagnant, new magic can be created. Voldemort has shown with his flight spell that he can do things no one else can. That's why I think it's not inconceivable that he could have invented a version of the Shield Charm that defends against the Killing Curse.
