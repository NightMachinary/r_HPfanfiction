Do you think such a shield would defend against the Killing Curse, though? It seems to me that if you're using the shield charm, your defence, however it manifests itself, is fundamentally magical in nature, and thus shouldn't defend against the Killing Curse. This is because though it manifests physically, it's still a conjuration Charm not a conjuration Transfiguration.
