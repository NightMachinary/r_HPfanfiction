  In OotP, Voldemort conjures a silver shield. I believe this is the standard Shield Charm, which Voldemort can manipulate to manifest as this silver shield.

I think we may have discussed this before, but I always read this as a physical conjuration of a literal physical shield made of silver.

After the spell hits, Voldemort expresses surprise that it was not the Killing Curse, which indicates that at the time he conjured the defence, he was expecting the Killing Curse. Which in turn implies that he would be using a physical not magical defence.
