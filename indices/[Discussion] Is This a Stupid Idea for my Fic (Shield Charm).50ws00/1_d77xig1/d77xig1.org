In broad terms, this is basically the interpretation of canon magic I use, as in, mastering a spell allows a wizard to do some things with it that you don't normally see. It's actually supported by canon. In OotP, Voldemort conjures a silver shield. I believe this is the standard Shield Charm, which Voldemort can manipulate to manifest as this silver shield.
