I'd hand that plot back to the people that suggest it: There's no realistic way a Gryffindor!Harry becomes a Dark Lord.

What /is/ possible is to have a Gryffindor!Harry who later loses all relevant Gryffindor traits and becomes a Dark Lord. But I dunno that that was what you meant?

For all the annoyances Gryffindors can be, they just aren't Dark Lord material. The drive to even get there is fundamentally lacking. The worst incarnation of Gryffindor is McLaggen: Arrogant, entitled, narrow-minded and convinced of their own righteousness, but fundamentally too lazy to do anything of relevance.

Which is not to say Gryffindors can't have visions or be politicians or rulers, see Dumbledore. Just, I'd think they'd go about that in a way that couldn't be called "Dark Lord". The way Canon is set up, that seems limited to Slytherins by definition, at least if they had those traits already during school.
