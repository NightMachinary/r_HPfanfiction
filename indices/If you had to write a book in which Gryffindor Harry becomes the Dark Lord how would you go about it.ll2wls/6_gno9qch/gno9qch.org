I'd kill off the Dursley's early on, have him be adopted by the Weasley's, but then start to lose them one by one. Put him into a corner where his choices become to either use dark magic or lose the people he loves. Give him a reason to be dark, but FFS don't just have him shrug his shoulders and decide maybe being a dark lord wouldn't be so bad in the very first chapter.

As a side note I suppose I really need to give "The Sum of Their Parts" another chance. I like the concept, but i absolutely despised the first chapter.
