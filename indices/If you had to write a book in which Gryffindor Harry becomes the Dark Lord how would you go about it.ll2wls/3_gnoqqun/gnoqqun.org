Well... the only Gryffindor that we see almost become Dark Lord is Dumbledore so for that you'd need Harry to meet someone with seductive ideas about constructing a utopian society. It reminds of that arc from the Charmed series where the witches create a society where everyone is expected to be good and any transgression is punished severely through mutilation and even death.
