Leaving aside that in Canon there is only one (the) Dark Lord anyway, pretty much this. Whatever definition one would use for a general "Dark Lord", presumably it'd involve some sort of personal desire for power, not power in order to bring, say, more equality or justice.

This is also why I wouldn't call a hypothetical GreaterGood!Dumbledore (the real thing, with Grindelwald, not the Fanon trope) a Dark Lord. The angle of what the power is for is different.
