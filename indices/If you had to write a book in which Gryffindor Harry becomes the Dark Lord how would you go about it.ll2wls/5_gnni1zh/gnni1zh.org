Basically the Sum of their Parts. Harry is tired of magical world never changing, takes matters into his own hands to force change. Starts by targeting Voldemort supporters who avoided capture/repercussions through their influence/gold. Slowly starts to be viewed as a Dark Lord by the population. Although, if I were writing it, I feel like Harry would see himself more like a Punisher type vigilante, rather than a titled "Dark Lord" it would be others who see him as such.
