Sum of their parts does this pretty well with Gryffindor!Harry going rogue when the Shacklebolt Ministry starts going after werewolves as Dark Creatures in anti-dark pushback.

I'd say that a Gryffindor Dark Lord Potter would likely grow out of his insurgency with the DA- if the ministry pushed him too far, Dumbledore somehow fell out of the picture at a critical moment, or the Second Wizarding War dragged on much longer Harry would get more militant and aggressive towards his enemies, with his army of followers getting more and more used to following his orders and accepting him as their leader.

One Scenario is that Dumbledore dies during Umbridge's reign of terror (Old Age? Perhaps the Death Eaters assassinate him to remove their biggest obstacle before their big reveal?), and as a result the membership of Dumbledore's Army are radicalized by the martyrdom and Harry is made the new primary ministry scapegoat in Dumbledore's place, pressuring him to resort to increasingly violent means as the DA begins to see all non-Potter authority figures as enemies in the civil war.
