I really like this, even though I don't really know what's going on yet. I don't usually like first-person stories, but your prose is excellent, IMO. You should definitely keep writing. As for constructive criticism:

#+begin_quote
  I turned the handle and entered the room. There was indeed someone in the room.
#+end_quote

This line sounds a little awkward, IMO. Maybe just replace the second sentence with something else, like:

#+begin_quote
  I turned the handle and entered the room. A tall witch stood at the window, idly watching the children in the Alley as I had done this morning. At first, she had her back turned to me...
#+end_quote
