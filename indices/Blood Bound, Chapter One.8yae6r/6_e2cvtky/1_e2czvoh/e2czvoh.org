I agree, that part stood out as different from the rest! Also typo here:

Overall, it seems like it is a story line that doesn't have to conflict with canon (which are my fave fics), and also can examine some interesting ground about morality.What are our choices when we are under duress? How do we move on and prove ourselves? Who are we trying to convince, everyone else or ourselves?

Good luck, and keep writing!
