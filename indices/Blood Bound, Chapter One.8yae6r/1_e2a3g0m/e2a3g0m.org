It's a really interesting premise and one I've not read before. You put in enough information to hint at the protagonist's background, while still leaving it enticingly vague. The only problem is the fact that it's too damn short! I'll be heartbroken if it's left like this. Please continue, because I'll definitely follow if you do.
