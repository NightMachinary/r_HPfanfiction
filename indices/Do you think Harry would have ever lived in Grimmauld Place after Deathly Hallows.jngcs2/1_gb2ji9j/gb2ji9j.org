I think you're thinking of a paragraph in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave
#+end_quote

By my estimation, Dumbledore comes for him about 2 weeks after school ends. So this is said about 3 weeks after Sirius' death.

Given his behavior with Mundungus and the fact that it was he who suggested they stay there in DH, I'd say, yes, it is entirely possible he lived there after DH. At least at beginning of '19 years later.' Of course, he also could've stayed with the Weasleys, Andromeda, or at Hogwarts.
