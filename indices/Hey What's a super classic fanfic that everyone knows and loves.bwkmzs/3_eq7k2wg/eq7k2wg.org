Almost everyone knows HPMoR, but only half love it, the other half hate it. I love it but it really depends on how you see the character. Definitely read beyond the first few chapters, they're a bit different than the rest.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

It's the number one fic on ffn.
