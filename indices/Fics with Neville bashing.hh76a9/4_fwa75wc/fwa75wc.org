  I just want to know if Neville haters exist!

I've made Neville slightly antagonistic in linkffn(12745758) mostly because I was annoyed by him being a "better Ron" in every other fanfic. I don't mind him in canon, but the "Potter Longbottom alliance" has long since become a reason to close the tab.
