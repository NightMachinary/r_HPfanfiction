I've seen it on occasion, but only when Neville is the Boy Who Lived and he's cast as James Potter blandly following canon Harry's story (while being very arrogant) so that the fics OC named Harry can have a two dimensional enemy to completely and frequently obliterate, all without ever risking the possibility of deviating from the canon plotline
