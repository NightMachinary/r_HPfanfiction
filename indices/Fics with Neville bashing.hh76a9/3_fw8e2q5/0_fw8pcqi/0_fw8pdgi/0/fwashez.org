It was quite some time since I've read this. Spoilers: ... ... .. . Harry's from the future, where Neville instigates some kind of 3rd war between muggles and magical, destroying Harry's family and most of magical. Harry's really vengeful here, imperiuses Ron to kill Neville and blow his own brain out with a bombards in Great hall. Ahhh, good old days.
