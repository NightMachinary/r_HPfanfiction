linkffn(9631998) The Thorny Rose has some relatively minor Neville-bashing, in the form of "he's a hanger-on of Severely Bashed Ron". He grows out of it in the second part of the trilogy.

I personally think Neville-bashing is as rare as it is because it feels kind of like kicking a puppy - same goes for Luna-bashing, which I also never see.
