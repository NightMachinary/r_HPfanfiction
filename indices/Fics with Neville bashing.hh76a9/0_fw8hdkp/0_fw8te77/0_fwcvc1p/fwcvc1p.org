Honestly democracy just made me dislike Hermione because as told from Neville's perspective she is both incredibly unreasonable as well as a sneering know-it-all intent on getting people killed because she feels she isn't immediately agreed with.

The one caveat as a story is that she is never compared to an anti-voldemort. She goes from anti monopoly policy straight to I want a system of government that will ensure me and my teenage friends all become leaders of the country and are willing to slaughter the current administration to get it.

And before people say well obviously Neville is not being reasonable and Hermione is actually right.

No. That's not true, it's portrayed like Hermione is actually in the right but she's never shown to be anything but the instigater and the first one to start Rally's and calls for violence. She makes one attempt at a bill Neville tells her is unreasonable on her first day then never does anything but attempt to dissolve parliament by threat of force of arms when they don't capitulate to her ultimatum.
