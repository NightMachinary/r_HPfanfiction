  Or you could just trim it down quite a bit to

    For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything...

  It implies a young Remus, and cuts down on the unnecessary portions that were present and adds in a bit more menace by ending where it does.

I like this a lot. I think you can make it a little smoother and even bring in a bit of flair by making it:

"For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, but the bitter war with You-Know-Who may cost him more than he can imagine..."

1) I altered the first sentence to flow better (i assume he will have more than a single adventure).

2) I changed "dark ascent" to "bitter war", but depending how the story is it may not fit (is it war at the start, or only war at the end? My headcanon is that the war was already happening when remus graduated).

3) I added You-Know-Who since it is in line with the time period and has a canon feel.

4) I changed the tense at the end to present from past, because that matches the opening sentence.

5) And then finally i changed "close to losing everything" to "cost more than he can imagine" because it feels more dire and dramatic to me.
