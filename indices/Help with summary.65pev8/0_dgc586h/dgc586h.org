It's got some bits in it I like, though it partly feels a bit redundant or long to me. If you cut

#+begin_quote
  fresh from school and emboldened by the support of his friends
#+end_quote

it would be more concise, and pack bit more of a punch and the bit at the end about the canon compliant account tells us it begins right after Hogwarts.

Or you could just trim it down quite a bit to

#+begin_quote
  For Remus Lupin, the Order of the Phoenix offers a thrilling adventure and a sense of purpose, yet the dark ascent of Lord Voldemort would bring him close to losing everything...
#+end_quote

It implies a young Remus, and cuts down on the unnecessary portions that were present and adds in a bit more menace by ending where it does.

In other news, this reminds me that I still have to read this. Maybe I should just make a FFN account to keep track of things like this...
