I love all of these fics but I'm not sure if they're good suggestions for beginners. I mean four of these are crossovers with Dresden Files, something that fans of HP might not necessarily like. I would personally favour suggesting fics which are close enough to canon (without being rehashes) so that the fans of the books might not be totally lost. Sort of like Ectomancer or Forging the Sword rather than Wastelands or Skitterleap.

Also, beginners would have an opportunity to start fresh, in a position where they are not instantly turned off by what we think to be cliches. Reign of Power, for example, would be a great read to people who aren't tired of reading about Lordship shenanigans.

Anyway, the ones you recommended are pretty good and if this gets more people to read them and/or into fanfiction then awesome.
