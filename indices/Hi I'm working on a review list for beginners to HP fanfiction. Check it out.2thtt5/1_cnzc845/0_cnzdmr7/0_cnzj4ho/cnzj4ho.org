Seconded. I started out looking for fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] that put you smack-dab in the middle of canon and /felt/ like a Harry Potter book. Something like /Browncoat, Green Eyes/ I would have felt viscerally /against,/ because I was looking for a certain kind of purity.

Similarly, when I first started reading fanfiction, /Wastelands of Time/ would have felt, I don't know - wrong, bad, stupid, take your pick. It would have been lost on me. Eventually, of course, you branch out, you start seeing the wild things people can do with the characters and the setting and the magical world.

Nowadays, I'm all the way back around to where I started and I have a great appreciation for stories that can really emulate canon tone (like Forging the Sword.) I have a pretty broad palate, but I do tend to really gravitate towards things that have that Original Flavor feel.
