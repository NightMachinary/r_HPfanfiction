Thanks for the input!

I suppose I was the opposite after starting fanfiction. I didn't like fics that emulated canon much, unless they were absolutely exceptional and super-amazing with character development.

However, I do see what you mean. *I will add a measure indicating AU-ness, and then arrange the stories in increasing order* - so readers can start off with stories close to canon, and as they see what can be done with fanfiction, progress through the list.
