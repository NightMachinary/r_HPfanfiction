The author's summary for VINCET:

#+begin_quote
  Some people, when crushed underfoot, simply buckle and lie dead still. Some find inner strength and fight back. Yet some others pawn their Aunt's wedding ring and hex their relatives. Shades of grey, argues Harry.
#+end_quote

And for the sequel, Vultus Serpentis:

#+begin_quote
  Every so often, a momentous individual makes their way through the world, making ripples in their path. Dumbledore and Voldemort were two such men, sending waves crashing, obliterating all else, and Harry grows sick of wearing a life preserver.
#+end_quote

I have a copy as well, if anyone's after it. (As an .rtf, but I can easily save to epub, mobi, and PDF.)
