Pretty much anything by hgfan1111. "Brighter than Sunshine" and "Learning to Fly" are the first ones that come to mind.

Brighter Than Sunshine: Official Summary: The smoke clears from the Final Battle and the world is not the same. But even in the darkness, a light can still shine, leading lost souls home. AU Begun Post-HBP, disregards parts of DH. Canon pairings.

Basically, Harry and Ginny have all of their memories wiped.

Learning to Fly: Official Summary: Harry is nearly broken by casual, well-meant cruelty. It isn't until he falls ill that he begins to find his way back home. AU Fic
