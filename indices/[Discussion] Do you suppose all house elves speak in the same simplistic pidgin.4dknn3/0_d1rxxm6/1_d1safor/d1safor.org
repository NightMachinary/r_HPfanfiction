  People who speak these languages (yes, languages!) are not unintelligent. Slaves were not unintelligent. Also, it has nothing to do with level of education; you could become literate and educated in a creole. It is a full fledged language (pidgins less so). You can communicate just as effectively speaking a creole.

Definitely. It's true that a more educated elf would be more likely to speak Standard English, but that's only because the education process itself involves teaching them standard English. If there were textbooks written in Creole (like you can see in Haiti), there's no reason an elf couldn't become super educated in Creole only.

In fact IIRC there was a push in Jamaica a while ago to introduce Patois-medium schools that taught English as a foreign language (as opposed to being entirely in English).
