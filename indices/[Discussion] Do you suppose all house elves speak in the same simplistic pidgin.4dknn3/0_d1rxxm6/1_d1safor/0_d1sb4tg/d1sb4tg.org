Exactly. Unfortunately the norm in the post-colonial world is for education to be only in the standard language/dialect, but it definitely doesn't have to be so.

Although I'm not sure that an educated house elf would necessarily speak a more standard english. It could be that norms of use developed in that " 'tis the mark of a house elf" to speak in the non-standard lect to their master. Like it could be that they have the competence to speak in standard english, but it's considered disobedient to speak it. I don't know if such a thing is attested historically in (real world) human languages, but I really would not be surprised if so.
