  Like it could be that they have the competence to speak in standard english, but it's considered disobedient to speak it.

The issue I see here is that our one data point (Dobby) doesn't speak Standard English after he's freed (he doesn't even try), making me think that House Elves simply don't care about learning Standard English since it's not like they're judges because they can't. Then again, Dobby may not be the best data point though.

  I don't know if such a thing is attested historically in (real world) human languages, but I really would not be surprised if so.

I forget the technical term but in certain communities women actually conciously modify their speech around their husbands because using certain words is considered disrespectful. I don't know if they ever vary grammatical structures, but it's something at least.
