Ok cool yeah I just wanted to clear that up because it actually is a huge misconception about pidgins and creoles.

What is critical here is not a human vs non human language, rather two different languages. What I mean is, in the real world only humans have actual languages (as opposed to communication systems, which animals do have, and complex ones at that). Also only humans can truly acquire a language (let's ignore the primates being taught sign language for a moment, to simplify my point). Therefore, we must assume that house elves (and centaurs, and goblins etc) are humanoid enough so that they are able to acquire and speak a natural human language. Therefore the issue becomes when kebolds' language meets English (or in other countries other non house elf languages) what happens?

We can then imagine that the kebolds that were not caught and exploited for human servitude remained with their native tongue. Among what became house elves developed a pidgin, for the necessity of communicating with wizards, and then developed into a creole, as the house elves ceased to use and pass to their children the original kebolds language.

Through this, though, the house elves are exposed to standard English. Now we have something called the creole continuum. While not everyone agrees with these categories and their implications, roughly we have three levels of variation within the creole continuum: basilect, mesolects, and acrolects. Basilects are varieties that are least like the superstratum (in this case English). Note I don't say that it's closest to the substratum (original kebolds language) because many different processes are involved in how creoles emerge. Then we have the acrolect which would be the variety that is closest to standard English. In between there can be many mesolects; different variations that are either closer or further away from English.

Your question pertains to this continuum; the house elves would speak the /same/ creole, just different variations of it. It is crucial, however, to understand that the goal of a creole is not to approximate the superstratum language. Acrolects can emerge because there is often close contact between the superstratum and the creole (but not always!). This would be the case with the house elves, especially as time goes on. In fact, house elf speech in HP seems very acrolectal, and it could be that it has converged with English to the point that it is just another dialect of English. Note that you can actually understand 100% of what Dobby is saying, even if you recognize that he speaks differently than standard. This process is called decreolization

In fact, there are many linguists who posit that African American Vernacular English (AAVE), a dialect of American English, derived from a creole, and is now (obviously) decreolized. (in case you're curious, the other popular theory posits that AAVE derives from DIALECT contact between the slaves and the slavers who spoke vastly different dialects of English).

Anyway, your hypothesis is probably correct; if a wizard was interested in their house elf's education, then perhaps that house elf would speak a more standard English. However, it depends also at what age they come to the family. Are they raised in like house elf training centers until adults and then sold? Or are they born into families?

If you still have questions regarding the linguistics side of things then maybe we should repost to [[/r/linguistics]]?
