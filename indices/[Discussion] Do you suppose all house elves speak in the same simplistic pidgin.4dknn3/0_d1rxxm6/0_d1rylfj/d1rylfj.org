Thank you for your brilliant answer. You're the perfect person to help me understand.

I didn't mean to imply that the pidgin English utilised signified a lack of intelligence - there are actually several ideas all mashed together in this question and I didn't mean to equate my questions about traits resulting from selective breeding and linguistic development as sharing a causation.

I think the word of "god" is house elves are derived from kebolds who were caught and domesticated. I'm not sure what that means in terms of their native language.

Would there be elves who assimilated and picked up human language more easily than their fellows? Would their descendants therefore likely /not/ speak the same pidgin creole or patois but instead a closer approximation of standard English/French/Spanish/Klingon? Is it just that we didn't encounter them in canon?
