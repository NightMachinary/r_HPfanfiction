Just another quick thing. If we're talking about the creole continuum, then it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine a difference between Hogwarts house elves and personal family house elves. Hogwarts house elves mostly talk amongst themselves, and therefore it would make sense if their variety is more meso- or basilectal than personal family house elves
