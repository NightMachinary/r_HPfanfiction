I am going to take this question very seriously because I was just learning about pidgins and creoles in a language contact class (I'm a linguistics major), and immediately thought of house elves cuz I'm a big geek.

First of all the answers to the questions in the body of your post will not answer the question in the title of your post. The reason (very simply and without getting into much detail) that pidgins emerge is because of two groups who do not speak the same language must find a language that they can both communicate in. Often times the subordinate group actually come from many different places and speak many different languages such that they also must find a way to communicate with each other.

So if we're thinking of the Atlantic slave trade, you have many groups of africans being enslaved, and then white English speaker enslavers (just focusing on English based pidgins and creoles for the moment though of course other, mostly European languages were the superstratum). The African languages are the substratum language, and the English is the superstratum language. The English speaking slavers simplify their own language (think how you talk to foreigners), and this simplified version is also heavily affected by the substratum languages(s) as the slaves use this simplified version to communicate both with the slavers and each other.

So that's a very simplistic overview of how pidgins emerge. I have not done the subject justice, and to be honest I am not an expert on pidgins and creoles though I am getting more into it.

As you can see, pidgins crucially involve more than one language. It would be interesting to think that house elves might have had a "native" language, but once, as a race, they became enslaved, a pidgin emerged and then became their dominant (if not only!) language (this is a process called creolization; a pidgin becomes a creole when it becomes the native language of the community, without widespread balanced bilingualism). In this case, yes, I would think that the house elves speak a creole.

I don't know if that's exactly what JK Rowling intended, but I think it's clear that with the house elves' speech she is drawing parallels to the Atlantic slave trade, and English based creoles that developed as a result. Linguistically, Dobby's speech does share some similarities to English based creoles, but I'll admit that I haven't done a full analysis (though I intend to at some point).

I think what's important is to understand that pidgins and creoles have nothing to do with intelligence. People who speak these languages (yes, languages!) are not unintelligent. Slaves were not unintelligent. Also, it has nothing to do with level of education; you could become literate and educated in a creole. It is a full fledged language (pidgins less so). You can communicate just as effectively speaking a creole.
