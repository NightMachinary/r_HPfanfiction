Kind of an intriguing question. If you ordered your house-elf to speak German, would they suddenly know the language? I don't know that we know what happens when a house elf is ordered to do something that is impossible (or at least not possible instantaneously) to them.

Perhaps that's why Kreacher is such a grump. Ordered to do a task that he is unable to complete.
