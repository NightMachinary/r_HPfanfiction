It's not actually all that simplistic. Dobby only speaks in the third person, while retaining most grammatical structures that English possesses. Winky simply uses a continuative present-tense structure for every verb phrase, and uses "is" for not only 3s but 1s/2s/1p/2p/3p as well, but similarly retains most grammatical structures. The rest of it is Buffy-speak and coining words for things they don't know the name of.

[[/u/vonham]] explained the rest of it well.
