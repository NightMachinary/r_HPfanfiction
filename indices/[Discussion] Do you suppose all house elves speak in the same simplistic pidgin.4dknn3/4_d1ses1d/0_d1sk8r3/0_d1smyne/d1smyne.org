Not sure if you are intentionally not saying who the main character (and their family) is... but I suppose I'm a bit confused since my understanding of the family was that it supported the blood purity ideals. Which leads me to think they would look down on house elves. Perhaps that's an unfair assumption. Can you explain what you think they value?
