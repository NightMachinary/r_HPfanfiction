I think it's an argument of nature vs. nurture. You are not born knowing a language, rather you pick up on what's spoken in your environment.

Therefore, how a house-elf speaks will depend on the house they were raised in. As most pureblood families treat their elves as slaves, they would not be concerned with their education. They would only learn language from their fellow house-elves in servitude to the family. Thus, the form of English we see Dobby speaking. He was taught by other Malfoy elves who have all lived in an abusive environment that does not see elves to be worthy of anything, nevermind education and intelligence.

I think I know why you asked this question, so I will pose a question back to you. If a "good" owner took over ownership of an elf and instilled values of intelligence, family, etc. - would that make up for a lifetime of servitude to an abusive family and conditioning to be a slave and have low self-worth? House-elves from the Black, Malfoy, Prince, etc. families would be conditioned by their time serving family members who believed in blood purity as well. Can you just flip a switch when a new master with different politics takes over the family? See Kreacher as an example of this in the Black family.

Further, what is the life span of a house-elf? Do they age differently than wizards/humans? Do we know how old Dobby was? In some ways, he seems almost childlike.
