It's not what you're looking for, but you seemed disappointed by the lack of responses, so here's a story that's involving Merlin and the world of Harry Potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8016336/1/Only-A-Boy][Only A Boy]] by Riddell Lee is a story where Merlin is the protagonist.

It's a crossover between HP and the BBC show Merlin, in which Merlin is reborn and Harry Potter doesn't exist.

The word count is over 270k at this point, and the last update was about two weeks ago, if you're into that kind of thing.

I kind of liked it, from what I can remember of it. I'll have to reread it again at some point, whenever it gets finished.
