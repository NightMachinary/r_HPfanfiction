Um...eventually? It's not really focused on Peter, but I'm working on a story that has a legitimate reason for Peter turning, has Wolfstar, and has Peter attempting to ruin Wolfstar by doing things that include polyjuicing as Remus and tricking Sirius.

My Peter is a capable and conniving wizard who felt betrayed by his friends when he needed them most, so he is going to make them hurt.

It'll be long, but it's not ready yet.
