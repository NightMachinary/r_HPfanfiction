Ok I can understand that. It's a bit of a sore spot in fandom because there are all these straight women who use gay love and gay sex and the issues we live and struggle with everyday as angst porn m, and also the way that western media has dressed homosexuality for so so long is that we're all morally bankrupt, so the implication that it was because he's gay that he's happy for his friend's kid to die or to become a nazi rather than he's gay and a human person with weaknesses and this was the beginning of the e slippery slope of his descent into being a death eater. But I get that the order we out words in can make meanings different and it's not always easy to realise what the implication might mean until someone reads it and is like â€˜what?!' lmao
