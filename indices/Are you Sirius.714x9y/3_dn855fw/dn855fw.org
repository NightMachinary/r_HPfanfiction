Top 3 choices:

1: Tonks (Because of Harry/Tonks possibilities, Tonks deserving to be a mother, and having one of the coolest abilities ever)

2: Sirius Black (Because he deserved a life as Harry's Godfather and could have done so much for society as a "good" Black)

3: Fred Weasley (Because losing a twin has got to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever and George needs him)
