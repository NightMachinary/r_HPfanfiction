My top 3 would be:

1. Sirius; depending on how his return happened, his could potentially be the most interesting to me since it opens the door to what's on the other side of the Veil and/or how would this effect other characters, especially Harry.
2. Cedric; again, not only was his death incredibly traumatic for Harry but with his death happening so early on, it'd be interesting to see how his return would effect the rest of the characters.
3. Tonks; for a variety of reasons not the least of which was that I felt she deserved better than what she got.
