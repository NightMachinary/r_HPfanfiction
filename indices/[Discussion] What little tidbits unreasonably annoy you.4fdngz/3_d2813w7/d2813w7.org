/That's not how legilimency works!/ It's not mind reading! You can't just look at someone and read their mind, that's one of the first things Snape tells us "The mind is not a book to be opened and read"

It's a /spell/! Harry reflects it with a simple protego, there is no instance where a character is being legilimenced in which he doens't know about it, and yes, like most spells someone talented can do it without a wand and non verbally, but you can't just look at someone, see what you want, and go on with your life without anyone even noticing!

THIS ANGERS ME WAY TOO MUCH AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
