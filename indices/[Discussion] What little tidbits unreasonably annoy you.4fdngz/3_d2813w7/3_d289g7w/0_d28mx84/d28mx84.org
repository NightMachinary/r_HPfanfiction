Probably because the book says it's not mind reading but then goes on to have characters use it as mind reading i.e. Snape using it to know what spells Harry was about to use in HBP.

I've always read Snape's "it's not mind reading" quote as being about the complexity of the spell and the mind, deriding Harry for thinking it was simple, but not about legilimency's capabilities. Legilimency isn't mind-reading /in mechanism/ but it does allow you to effectively read minds.
