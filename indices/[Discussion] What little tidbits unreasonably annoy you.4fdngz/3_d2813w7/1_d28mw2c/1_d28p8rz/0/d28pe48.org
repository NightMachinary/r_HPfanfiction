Seems like a good implication to me:

#+begin_quote
  Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.

  “I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,” he said gently.

  “Anything at all.”

  Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, “You'll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: “Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin...

  “No,” said Harry. “There isn't anything, Professor...”

We have Dumbledore considering Harry, which likely involves eye-contact, and then we have a number of thoughts swimming to the top of Harry's mind, exactly like when Snape performed legilimency on him in HBP.

There's another possible one in GoF:

  Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.

  “Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” he asked calmly.

  “No,” said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.

  “Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?” said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.

  “No,” said Harry vehemently.

Dumbledore established eye contact, asks some questions and takes Harry's answers as gospel. It would seem irresponsible in that situation to just accept Harry's word unless he has some way of being sure Harry is telling the truth, which we know legilimency is capable of.
