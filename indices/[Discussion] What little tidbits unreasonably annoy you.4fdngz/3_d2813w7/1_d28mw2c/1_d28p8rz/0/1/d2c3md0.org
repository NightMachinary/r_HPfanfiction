This is stupid. That train of thought is /obviously/ not legilimency. Harry is debating what to say to Dumbledore because Harry /trusts/ Dumbledore. He can't talk about the Polyjuice Potion or Draco because Polyjuice is illegal and Draco obviously isn't the heir. He doesn't tell Dumbledore about the voices because voices are a Bad Sign according to Ron Weasley. He does not want to be connected to Slytherin, so he /doesn't/ say any of these things to Dumbledore, even if Harry wants to help him.
