It's strongly implied that Dumbledore used legilimency on Harry a couple times without him knowing - for example, in the "Is there anything else you want to tell me?" moment in CoS.

Further, Snape's use of legilimency against Harry in their duel in HBP was pretty subtle. Harry didn't seem to feel it or notice it - the only evidence was the fact that Snape knew every spell he was about to cast before he cast it.
