I don't recall what fic it was, but whenever someone went to clear their throat, the author wrote that they scraped their throat. I'm sure it's probably still correct, but it conjures some seriously painful mental images, and I had to stop reading. From what I remember it was fairly good otherwise. Only time something so petty has stopped me.
