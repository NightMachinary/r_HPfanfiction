I'm going to be honest, I read Pottermore and it's all interesting...but it gets annoying to have little pieces of information added as an afterthought like that. Not to mention how cheaply its done. The most recent stuff about the other Wizarding schools and specifically more about the history behind Wizarding America were these little three paragraph blog posts. Which is fine, it's just that you'd think there would have had a little more with all of the hype she created over it. It also took about two seconds for people to find plot-holes or to realize that the other magic schools were basically named "Magic Place" in another language.
