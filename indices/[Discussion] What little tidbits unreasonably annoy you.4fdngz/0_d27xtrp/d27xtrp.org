My personal stupid little grievance is Movie!Harry riding trains just to pass the time, as though he's some hobo with unlimited amounts of money for the expensive ticket fares. And not really a little thing, but Movie!Hermione being perfect.

As far as the books go, there's a line at the end of the PA book where Lupin calls Ron "boy," I'm 100% sure it was intended to be Sirius's dialogue tag but it bugs me.
