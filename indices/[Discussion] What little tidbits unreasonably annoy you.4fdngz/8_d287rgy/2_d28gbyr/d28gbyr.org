I don't care about the interview itself. I guess in some ways Harry would be a better match for Hermione. In SOME ways they would be more compatible. My problem is how the H/Hr shippers reacted to it. Notice JK didn't say that Hermione was a better match for Harry, just that Harry might have been a better choice than Ron for her. But the whole community flips out and we have hundreds of posts and articles spouting "proof" that Harry and Hermione should have been together and "proof" that JK said she made a mistake. All the shippers are going on and on about how they were right and how their bashing of Ginny was justified. "We were right, Ginny MUST have love potioned Harry in HBP." I read all this and wanted to rip my hair out. Did any of them read the actual original interview!?!?
