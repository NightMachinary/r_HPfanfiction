Pretty reasonable to be annoyed with that, the community's reaction was ridiculous: H/Hr shippers were more smug than your average Brixton vinyl record shop; R/Hr fans out in droves bitterly complaining that JK had somehow murdered their childhood, in a way reminiscent of an old man yelling at a sidewalk.

The best part was that both sides were wrong. R/Hr has fundamental issues that makes it unrealistic wish-fulfillment, but H/Hr is really not that much better, if even better at all.
