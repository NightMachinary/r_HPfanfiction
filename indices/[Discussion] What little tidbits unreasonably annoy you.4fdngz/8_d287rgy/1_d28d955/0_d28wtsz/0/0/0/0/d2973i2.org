That similar marriages are pretty ridiculously common? Like...Molly/Arthur itself is a pretty close example, just that Molly is fine being a housewife where Hermione wouldn't be. James/Lily is another example. Just because they're opposites in certain respects doesn't mean at all that a relationship wouldn't work out. And considering that they're teenagers going through unholy amounts of stress, Ron and Hermione have a perfectly functional relationship.
