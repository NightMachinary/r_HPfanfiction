Well, no, because every marriage is between people who are seemingly different. You don't marry someone that is 99% like you. Like, this whole idea of them being polar opposites is something a child would think. I expect adults, or at least people old enough to get on Reddit, would appreciate that people are a bit more nuanced than that. So why waste your time arguing that marriages between polar opposites can work when that's not even the case here?
