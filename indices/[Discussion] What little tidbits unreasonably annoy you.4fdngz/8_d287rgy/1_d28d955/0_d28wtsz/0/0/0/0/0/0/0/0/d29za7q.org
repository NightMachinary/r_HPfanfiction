Clearly they're not polar opposites, that would be Dramione(ugh). The entire /point/ is that while they /are/ different, they're similar enough to have a completely fine relationship. And examples of relationships which are /a lot/ like R/Hr is James/Lily and Molly/Arthur; but for instance it's difficult to compare those relationships to a Harry/Ginny or a theoretical Neville/Luna relationship. That's why I brought up similar relationships in the first place.
