No, you're not repeating what JKR said. If you can find me the quote where she says that R/Hr is "unrealistic wish-fulfillment", I'd be happy to be proved wrong. As far as I know, the interview ended like this:

JKR: They'll (Ron and Hermione) probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues, and she needs to work on being a little less critical. [...] Ron's used to playing second fiddle. I think that's a comfortable role for him, but at a certain point he has to be his own man, doesn't he?

EW: Yes, and until he does it is unresolved. It is unfinished business. So maybe life presented this to him enough times until he had to make a choice and become the man that Hermione needs.

JKR: Just like her creator, she has a real weakness for a funny man. These uptight girls, they do like them funny. (Emma Watson then agrees with JKR.)

Secondly, if you're not here to get into hilariously overenthusiastic conversations about shippings...what the hell are you doing on this subreddit, mate?!?
