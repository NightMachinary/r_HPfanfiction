"[as] a young relationship. I think the attraction itself is plausible but the combative side of it ... I'm not sure you could have got over that in an adult relationship, there was too much *fundamental incompatibility*" - JKR, on R/Hr (emphasis mine).

"for reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron." - JKR, again on R/Hr.

Her saying they'll probably 'be fine' is an attempt to soften the blow, but JKR essentially says she torpedoed natural character evolution in favour of keeping the plot as she had imagined it (i.e. wish-fulfillment, as in fulfilling JKR's wish to keep the story as she'd originally conceived it). Plus, 'fundamental incompatibility' is a pretty damning accusation, wouldn't you say?

As for your second question, there's a lot more to fandom than shipping. At the end of the day, I couldn't care less who Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up with, so long as it makes sense from a narrative perspective. Even if it's Harry/Pansy, Hermione/Neville, and Ron/Fleur, if you can find a way to make those pairings make sense, then I'll read it. Look anywhere around this subreddit, and you'll see a whole plethora of conversations that have absolutely nothing to do with who shags who.
