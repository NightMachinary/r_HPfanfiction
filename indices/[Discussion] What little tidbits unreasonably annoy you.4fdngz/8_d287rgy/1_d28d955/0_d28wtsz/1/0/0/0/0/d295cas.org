It's hardly a ridiculous definition of wish-fulfillment. Authorial wish-fulfillment is absolutely a thing, and if you don't believe me, why don't you take JKR's word for it? Here's the full quote:

"I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of */wish fulfillment/*. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility."

But, I'm sorry, I'm using the term wrong, aren't I?

And, it's absolutely an attempt to soften the blow. You can't say people are fundamentally incompatible and probably wouldn't have lasted in an adult relationship in one sentence and then say they'll be fine in the next. That part of the interview is completely at odds with everything she says beforehand.

You have the prerogative to like what you like and disown what you want to disown, I couldn't care less, but if you can't see how R/Hr is "unrealistic wish-fulfillment" after Jo practically said it herself, then I don't know what else to say.

As a side-note: I wasn't the one who downvoted you.

Edit: And suddenly, no response, when you were incredibly talkative beforehand. Funny, that.
