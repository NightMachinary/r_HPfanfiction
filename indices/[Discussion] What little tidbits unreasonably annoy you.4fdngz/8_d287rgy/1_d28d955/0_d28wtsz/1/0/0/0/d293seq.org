Uh, that's the most ridiculous definition of "wish-fulfillment" I've ever heard. In fiction, it's used to describe characters built for the sheer purposes of fulfilling wishes. A good example is 90% of OCs/super-powerful-Harries/etc. If you want to use it that way, okay, but know that you're pretty much misusing the definition. English isn't always purely literal.

Also, cute how the part you disagree with is an attempt to soften the blow. How convenient! In the entire interview it's pretty obvious that JKR's overall neutral, and if she really disagreed with the pairing she wouldn't have written stuff like the Quidditch World Cup with them still being a couple.

Also, as I said, being ridiculously overenthusiastic about shipping wars is part of the fun of such fandoms to me, so.

As a side note, if Cursed Child includes a R/Hr divorce or anything of the sort...well, I'll respect JKR's characters and what she wanted to build, but holy fuck am I going to disown that just like many people disown the epilogue.
