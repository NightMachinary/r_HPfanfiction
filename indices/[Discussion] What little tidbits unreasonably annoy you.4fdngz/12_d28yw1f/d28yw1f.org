Fanfic - when the author is mad that Dumbledore didn't tell Harry that he houses a horcrux, or about them in general, or any number of important things Harry needed to know by the seventh book. Even though first of all it's not actually clear when Dumbledore figured out the horcrux part. Fanon says he might have started to get suspicious after the chamber and had the suspicions confirmed after the graveyard, but even then it's just that Voldy made a horcrux, not that he had multiple and that Harry contained one. And second of all - you don't tell that to a fucking eleven year old. Maybe after the graveyard, but not when Harry's a first year.
