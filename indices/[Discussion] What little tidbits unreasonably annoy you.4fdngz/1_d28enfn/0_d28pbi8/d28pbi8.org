I agree that there are some inherent problems with the position, but I think its ridiculousness can be vastly decreased simply by reducing the points earned. Something in the area of 1-5 goals would be much more reasonable. Depends on the average points scored by a chaser per game though, should be somewhere in that ball-park - maybe less (considering the additional tactical value of ending the game by catching the snitch).
