Trying to make the game more realistic, I kind of change the roles of the positions in my mind. Obviously Chasers are the offensive players. Compare it to soccer, they'd be the strikers/attacking midfielders. Beaters are sort of the defensemen. Compare it to hockey, you can have offensive and defensive defensemen. Offensive talent would correlate to preventing the bludgers from making it to the streaking chasers while defensive would be actually trying to hit the players. The best strategy for this defensive game, in my mind, would be hitting the bludgers in the positions to guide the chasers toward the outside, making it a tougher angle to score on the keeper. Similar to Hockey where you guide them to the outside. Keeper is the keeper.

As for the Seeker, there are a bunch of changes you could do like altering the points given for catching the snitch. A change that I've been thinking about is to award no points at all for the snitch, it just ends the game. (Granted, this idea would mean Krum's move in the final made no sense. But be honest, it didn't make sense to begin with.) Instead, snitches caught could act as a tie braker in league play similar to goal differential in Soccer or ROWs in Hockey. So, in league play, a win would be 3 points, a draw would be 1, and a loss 0. Ties are decided by snitches caught. In international play where its elimination, you would want to prevent the opposing team seeker from catching the snitch while you hope your chasers and beaters can do an appropriate job catching up on the score board.
