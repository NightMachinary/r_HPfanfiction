Seekers in Quidditch are bullshit. Like, I understand that JK needed to make Harry's quidditch heroics seem more, well... heroic, but /what the fuck/. Granting fifteen goals for catching the snitch and ending the game is a broken system and totally overkill. A seeker's importance suddenly outweighs everyone else's by a significant margin.

It's stupid as shit. It's like if goals by forwards counted as three goals instead of one in football.

Also, on the topic of quidditch; I'm not sure if this is actually canon or not, but in jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]] (i.e. the quidditch fic that everyone and their mother recommends), Ron says in a conversation that there's a draft for quidditch like in American sports. This annoys me for no logical reason other than that the fic doesn't take place America, so there's most likely no draft.
