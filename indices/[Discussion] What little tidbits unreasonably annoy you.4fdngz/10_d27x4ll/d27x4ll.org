Decided I should put mine in a comment-

I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Rons coughs, covering a laugh.

Ron thinks the name is funny. WHY? Besides the muggle reference of pompously introducing yourself like James Bond it makes no sense to me.

He is a wizard, why is that name funny to him?

1) Malfoy means "bad faith", which wouldn't be my first choice. But Weasley is derived from "weasel" which is a byname for "A deceitful or treacherous person". Wouldn't be my second choice either.

2) First (and last) names he would know even if isolated: - Xenophilius Lovegood - Luna Lovegood - (probably) Pandora Lovegood - Galvin Gudgeon (Chudley Cannons seeker) - Ragmar Dorkins (Chudley Cannons manager) - Sirius Black (named after a constellation) - a great many Chocolate Frog Cards - a great many other quidditch players - probably at least a couple of his brothers school friends

Family/Relations: - Septimus Weasley (grandfather) - Cedrella Black (grandmother) - Ignatius Prewett (great uncle, and Percy's middle name) - Lucretia Prewett (great aunt, Black name with celestial connection- asteroid) - Billius (uncle, and Rons own middle name) And who knows that else (besides Mafalda, Muriel, Tessie).

I won't go into all the meanings of names but I don't find Draco to be of any note. It's a constellation and it's latin for Dragon both of which are pertinent for their world.

It just disconnects me when I read it because it definitely isn't Ron being mean, but I don't see any reason for him as a pureblood wizard to find humour at the name.
