Out of Ron's siblings, the only one with an unusual name is Ginevra, and it probably seems normal to him because he grew up with the name and Ginny goes by Ginny. Ron's parents have normal names as well. If you look at [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-original-forty][Harry's original class,]] there are about 5 first names (not including the Patil twins) that aren't relatively common British names (Lavender, Millicent, Pansy, Hermione, Blaise). And you'll notice that only one of those is a boy's name. All of the other boys in the class are named things like Stephen, Vincent, Gregory, Trevor, Kevin, Anthony, Theodore, Michael, and Ernie.

On top of that, most of the names you listed (Septimus, Cedrella, etc.) are actual names, though they're old-fashioned and unusual. Draco isn't generally a proper name. So it's unusual to begin with, and seems even more unusual because it's an 11-year-old's name.

Just because he doesn't recognize the James Bond reference doesn't mean that Malfoy doesn't come off as a little ridiculous. He bursts into their compartment with his two silent bodyguards and goes into his pompous routine.

Ron certainly knew the surname, and the snigger was probably a defense mechanism as well. He wanted to tear Malfoy down before Malfoy tore him down first (which Malfoy does in the next breath).
