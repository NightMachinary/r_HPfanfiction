"Wards".

I don't care if it's used in every other fantasy franchise. It's not used in HP. In the books, "wards" were called "protective enchantments/charms", or simply "protections" and so on. "Wards" sounds like such a generic, dry, unimaginative word for that sort of thing. The terms used in the books gave a certain impression of /magic/. You got the feel that Hogwarts has some ancient, mystical protections deriving from it's grandeur. "Wards" on the other hand, sounds cheap, plastic, mass produced and technical.

Yes, it's easier to just write "wards", and it probably doesn't matter to most readers, but in my opinion, this is just an example of the way fanfiction can suck all the beauty and magic from HP, by making magic such a generic, common and mechanical thing. Language is a magic all by itself, folks.
