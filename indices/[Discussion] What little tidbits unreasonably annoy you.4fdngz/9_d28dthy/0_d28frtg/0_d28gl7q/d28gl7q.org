It's possible, sure, but it just feels...weak. That's probably the best way to describe it. Like, sitting in a chair now and trying to mimic the movements and imagining hitting an iron ball and it just feels weak, like there wouldn't be any real power behind it. I agree, throwing seems doable but hitting gives me pause.
