Eh, I imagine the beaters jobs aren't so much to hit with power, but to deflect in general directions. The bludger itself automatically tracks players its near, so as long as they can get it somewhat on course it'll do the rest.

I'd think the chasing game would be very up close and personal. Throws wouldn't be more than 10-15 yards, because throwing a ball at high speeds while moving in a three directional space would be really hard.

Also, for all we know the balls have some sort of charms to aid in this. If the bludger is already charmed to fly and chase down opponents, how hard would it be to make it easier to redirect?
