I could be mistaken, since I haven't read Quidditch through the ages in a long time, but I believe there's a spell that gives brooms the equivalent of stirrups/footrests for riders to place their feet into? That would give them a lot more stability with which to move around and react, the same way it does on a horse for polo/archery/etc.
