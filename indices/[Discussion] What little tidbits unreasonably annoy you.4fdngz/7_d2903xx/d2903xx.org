"Always".

I hate Snape and hate that he gets redeemed for this. I always hate that people somehow reduce James' love for Lily. The guy married her, started a family with her and died to buy her and Harry time to escape. Just because he didn't (and frankly couldn't because he was dead) devote the next 17 years to protecting Harry and spying on Voldemort doesn't mean he loved Lily any less. He and Lily were a matching set of patronus, as in literal soul mates. Snape's patronus was an imitation of Lily.
