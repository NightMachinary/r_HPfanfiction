Teen pregnancy in fanfiction (hell, pregnancy in fanfiction - period - but it's worse if it's teen pregnancy!)...I mean I don't know why ANY AUTHOR would find that cool or acceptable (and why abortion isn't at least offered as a possibility, particularly if the pregnant character is say Hermione, who I am pretty sure would not want to drop out of Hogwarts in order to take care of a baby and I'd love to know why any fanfiction writer thinks that someone like Hermione (or other intelligent female character!) would forget about contraception in the first place?)

Then there's stupidity like male pregnancy (damned, that's not how it works, magic or not!)

The numbers in HP - why would money be that illogical for example (it makes no freaking sense!)

Ron being a prefect (Hermione was/is a given, but Ron? The lazy complainer who'd rather play chess and do nothing than learn something or do homework?)...Harry would be a much better candidate as he's a leader (the DA showed that brilliantly - after he got over his stupid hesitation and took charge!), he only breaks the rules "for the greater good" (sorry, I hate that quote, but in this case the rules are less important than what Harry accomplishes by breaking them!) and he's not that bad academically (it never says that Dean, Neville, Ron and (damned what's the other guy in their dorm's name?) are better than Harry is in grades!)
