I think Dumbledore explained - and apologized - to Harry about not making him prefect. Something about him having enough on his plate that year.Ron was probably a better candidate over Dean, Seamus and Neville. I also think Dumbledore knew Ron was insecure and wanted to show some faith and trust in him. It's also why he gave Ron the lighter. He knew Ron would leave but would want to come back.
