I think the system is setup so that there are 6 total prefects per house. One boy and girl each from 5th, 6th, and 7th years. We don't hear about the new prefects from the year below Harry's in the sixth book most likely because the only two 5th years we see at appreciable length are Luna and Ginny, who are not the most likely not to be good disciplinarians.
