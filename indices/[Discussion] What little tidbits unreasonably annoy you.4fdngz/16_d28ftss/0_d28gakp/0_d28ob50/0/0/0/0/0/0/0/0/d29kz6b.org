But then why let McGonagoll give him Quidditch captain? Why not give that to Ron as well? Or Katie as she was a 7th year? Harry, Seamus or Dean all could have gotten prefect and it wouldn't have changed the story. Well maybe Harry getting it would have set off Ron's jealousy, and then he wouldn't have been on the Quidditch team, but let's face it, 5th year anyone could have been named keeper and they may have done the same or better or worse then Ron. Ron getting the badge was simply JKR, giving him a bone. He shows no leadership or good habits outside of Quidditch. He would have been better off getting the Captaincy and Harry should have been named prefect. But canon is what JKR wrote and that's all. We can debate why X should have gotten Y or how Z would have been different if W happened. In the end nothing changes.
