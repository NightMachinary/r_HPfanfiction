Dumbledore explained to Harry why he didn't make him prefect though. He said he felt Harry would have enough on his plate that year. So Harry would have been the natural choice but Dumbledore purposely did not to give it to him. So that leaves the other four and for whatever reason Ron was given it. We have no evidence to say Dean and Seamus would have been a better or worse choice. They just didn't get it so we can assume that Ron was the better choice or had something they didn't.
