I get that, but you also have to take into account extenuating circumstances. Neville was raised by a strict grandmother who wanted him to be just like his father, Ron had a supportive family, and slacked off, neither had the ideal chance at being a brilliant student, but I believe if Harry and Neville had been raised by there parents they would have probably been in the top 5 of their year. Granted we have no proof of that. But with James being brilliant at transfiguration, and Lily being the top student of her year, Harry would have turned out to be quite a bit smarter and less of a slacker. As for Neville, his parents were both aurors which is no easy feat according to the books, so he too would have been quite smart. But based on what we know Ron got 6(or 7 been a while since I read the books.) we can assume Neville probably had about the same as they're both somewhat smart. So I think how they were raised and their attitudes played a big part in how why they got the grades they did. I feel Ron would have been the same were as Neville and Harry would have been smarter if they had their parents. But we'll never know!
