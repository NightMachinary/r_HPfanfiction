I didnt say he's not as smart as Ron, I said in terms of being a prefect he didn't have the grades or the confidence to be prefect as of the beginning of OotP when the decision was made. Take the professors perspective on it. Ron has an award for services to school from second year (both he Harry had one from CoS) his grades are probably okay (they don't know if Hermione's been helping or not they just have the grades) and he's fairly sociable (not only friends with Harry and Hermione, but he hung out with Seamus and Dean whenever he was at odds with Harry). He's a fair choice assuming Dean and Seamus are not good ones (we don't have enough to go on for them).

I said Neville was a late bloomer. He came into himself during OotP, but that was too late as far a prefectship was concerned. As of the end of GoF he was still a bit of a joke. And having confidence issues was not a point in his favour in terms of a leadership position where he has to approach students who are misbehaving and dock points or hand out detentions. Also Hermione did help Neville... she hissed instructions at him in potions. For all we know we might have helped him revise too.

EDIT: As for OWLs I still stand by that. Ron may have had Hermione's help for studying but he still took them on his own. So when he puts the effort and studies he does well.
