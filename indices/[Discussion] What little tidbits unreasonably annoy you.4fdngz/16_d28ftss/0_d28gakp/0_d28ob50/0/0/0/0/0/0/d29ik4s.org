No I get what your saying, but also Harry should have been in consideration, as well as Dean and Seamus as for all we know they could have had plenty of other friends outside of Gryffindor, and why would Ron be superior to to any of them? Harry had every thing Ron did, above average grades, a school award, a few friends, we know he was at least friendly with Dean and Seamus. But more importantly Harry had leadership. Quidditch captain, he got Ron to believe in himself. In the DA he led a group of students to learn magic, including students older then him. He led a group of students against a group of Death Eaters. Granted this happened throughout 5th and 6th year, but based on what they knew of Harry, saving Hermione from the troll, fighting a Basilisk, chasing off dozens of dementors, they should have realized "Shit, Harry might be a pretty good leader! He's brave but reckless, and magically powerful but untrained." Yes he broke rules but for the most part Ron was right there with him. And for all we know Neville may have been the 7th year prefect since Harry and Ron were gone, but then again the prefects may not have "existed" that year. So yes as readers we have a bit more insight then Dumbledore and McGonagoll, but there's no valid reason to pick Ron when any of the boys that year could have been the prefect and it probably wouldn't have affected the outcome of the story.
