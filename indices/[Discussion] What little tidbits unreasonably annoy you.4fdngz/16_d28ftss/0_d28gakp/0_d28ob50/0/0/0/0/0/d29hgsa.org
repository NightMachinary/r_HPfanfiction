I'm not talking about intelligence or "potential" though. I'm talking about cold hard facts of why Ron was chosen over Neville at that point in time for being the male prefect. I'm talking about what Minerva and Albus would have looked at when deciding who was the male prefect based on the material THEY had available to them. Not what we as readers know. There's a difference. If you did poorly in school, always forgot your password to the common room, had your family mail permission slips to your Head of House because they knew you'd loose them, do you think your teachers would have given you leadership positions from an objective point of view? Mine sure wouldn't. It doesn't matter what extenuating circumstances were. Neville did not show he was a good choice /at that point in time/.

We don't know who Neville would have been if he was raised by Alice and Frank. We know who he was with the life he was given. All the potential in the world doesn't matter if you don't live up to it in the moment. Do you really think Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore, when choosing prefects, thought "oh, in another life Neville could have been top student. He might have been Head Boy if Frank raised him. Let's make him the prefect". No. They looked at his performance and personality at that point in time and made a judgement call. Same as any teacher would do at a school. I was not talking about what if scenarios or if things had been different. I was talking about what happened. There is a major difference.
