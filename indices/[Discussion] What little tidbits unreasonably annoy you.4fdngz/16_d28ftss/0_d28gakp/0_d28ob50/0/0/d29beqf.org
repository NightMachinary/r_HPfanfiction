But Neville also didn't have Hermione to revise or copy of off. Ron did. Neville had a lot of confidence issues as a student, and having strict professors like Snape and McGonagoll wouldn't have helped. We know he managed a OWL in charms and herbology, two subjects taught by what seemed more approachable teachers. So saying he's not as smart as Ron also isn't necessarily true.
