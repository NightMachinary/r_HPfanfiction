If you're basing this partly on academics, Neville was worst than Ron. Ron got into NEWT potions and transfiguration and would have needed at least an exceeds expectations. Neville didn't. He only had an acceptable in transfiguration and McGonagall wouldn't take him. In the first four books he showed no leadership qualities. It was only after fifth year he started growing into himself with the help of the DA. I love Neville but he was a late bloomer.
