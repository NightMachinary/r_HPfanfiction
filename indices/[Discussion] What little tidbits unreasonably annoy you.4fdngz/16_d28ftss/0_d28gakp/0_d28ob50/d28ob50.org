RIIIIIGHT! - Neither is RON (he's not a great role model after all and he's not good academically either!)...come on Neville would be a better candidate (or even Dean and (damned forgot the name of the other guy in their dorm)) if you wanted to exclude Harry (who IMHO should have been the prefect because he's got a lot of the traits and only breaks the rules for a good cause (He's not into pranks for example and he's not bullying people or staying out after curfew just because he can and wants to etc.))
