I think that's how it works though. You have the prefects for your house and class in fifth year, and they remain a prefect until graduation. Once you become a sixth year, your prefects don't go anywhere, they're still there, but new fifth year prefects are chosen from the new fifth year class. It's not like something you'd see in, for example, the US where students run for a class rep position each year.
