The irrevocably broken Prefect/Head Boy system.

Guys, think about it, In Canon (and Fanon), prefects are chosen every time ANYONE reaches their fifth year, along with new head boys/head girls. By Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, new Prefects should have been chosen.

But no, they weren't, Ron and Hermione are still prefects in Half-Blood Prince.
