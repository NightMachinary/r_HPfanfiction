Idk why but ive always loved the idea of Harry with a beard. Particularly a still young/adult but not old man harry. I cant remember which fic it was that had a still school aged Harry growing mutton chops and surprising everyone. It's not inconceivable, i knew a bunch of guys with full blown beards in high school.
