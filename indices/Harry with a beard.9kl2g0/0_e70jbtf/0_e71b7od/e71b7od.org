Propably, because James. You cannot be a look alike m, when half your face is covered.

Aside from that, most fanfictions have him at an age where he cannot grow one. They only time we also hear his facial hairgrowth mentioned is in a context, where he is actually proud to be able to shave.

Last, but not least, most fabulous beards (well kept) are a time consuming matter. That would be very new territory for person whose hair is frequently described as unruly.\\
It is kinda odd, but deciding on a beard is unusual for a man in this day and time and at first feels really unlike you.

Though, Hagrid, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore had beards. While definitely in some part they are role models; I never felt it in the books that he would imitate them.

Fuck; I think the most reasonable kickstart for him growing a beard might just be, when he gets told that you should have tried it once as a man.
