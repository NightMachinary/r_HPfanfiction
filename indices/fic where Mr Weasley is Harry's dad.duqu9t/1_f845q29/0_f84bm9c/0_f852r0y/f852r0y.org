Sorry I don't know how to link. I couldn't find the story I was talking about, but these are similar if you wanna check them. I know how frustrating it is looking for an old fic and not being able to find it.

The One Appointment We All Must Keep by mandymid on FFN is with a betrothal contract between Harry and Ginny. Arthur finds out and gets an annulment from Molly then she is betrothed to Dumbledore.

True Snakes by LeahBates2 on Wattpad is where Harry is actually a Malfoy named Hadrian who had been stolen. A bunch of people go on trial for hiding the knowledge of Harry's abuse by the Dursleys and stealing money from his vault.

The Marriage Contract by phoenixgirl26 on FFN is where Harry finds Ginny's original birth certificate and she is actually Dumbledore's daughter, not Arthur's.
