Don't worry it's cool. stories sadly sometimes fall into the abyss, if I'm really up to looking for it i can just pull up my 2016-2017 browsing history, and narrow it down to hp fanfic. I've been known to do that when nobody can bring results. I dont often resort to it because of how messy my search history gets because i have way to many google accounts.

and Wattpad is actually a platform i haven't used for hp fanfic in a while, i just find it hard to sort, so it will be cool to go back there.
