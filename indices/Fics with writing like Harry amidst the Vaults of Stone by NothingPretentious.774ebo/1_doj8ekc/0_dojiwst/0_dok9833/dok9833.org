I'm nowhere near caught up with VoS, but it's SO different from Harry Crow at the point I'm at that I doubt there's much to that. I enjoyed both, but I'm liking VoS much better - the goblin culture is quite impressive.

Well, perhaps the author got the urge to write his own "Harry raised by Goblins" from VoS, but if so, that seems to be all he took. Since this is all fanfic anyways, a (possible, and if so unattributed) fanfic of a fanfic isn't too outrageous.

This doesn't reach the levels of fanfic recursion of Intern/Deputy/Emissary in the Worm-verse :)
