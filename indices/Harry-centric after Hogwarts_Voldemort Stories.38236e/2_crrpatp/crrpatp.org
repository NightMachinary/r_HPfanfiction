Do you mind the Drarry pairing? If not:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations/Foundations]] (I always end at the end of Foundations though technically there is more, I just found this to be the most preferable length) - Harry is a Healer-in-training and his new assignment is the rehabilitation ward and guess who heads it? Deals with post-war subjects and magical drug addiction, quite fascinating and a lovely relationship build in my opinion.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/218544/chapters/328702][The Lodger]] - Harry is living alone after the war ended, he has PTSD and depression, he decides to take on a tenant. When Draco, who is on the run, applies, he lets him stay. A short one but one I enjoy nonetheless. It deals with mental illness and yeah, post-war situations.

[[http://www.hdhols.com/ms_mindfunk.html][Squib]] - Harry is a teacher at a school for magically challenged kids that he started with Hermione. Guess whose kid turns out to be magically challenged? Bit of a deus ex whatever in the ending but pleasant anyway. Nice to see different jobs/passions for these characters.

I have a few more post-war ones but from Draco's perspective, let me know if you want them.
