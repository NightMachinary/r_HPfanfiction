yeah I know, I've been looking at them but none of them seem to start with Ron killing Hermione and Harry... And that challenge is about Voldemort killing Harry during the Battle of Hogwarts if I'm not mistaken? That's not really what happened in this story but the concept of going back in time is pretty much the same. I'm not sure if this is correct or could even be of any help, but I believe in this fanfic Ron revealed he had a dark mark before he killed Hermione and Harry.
