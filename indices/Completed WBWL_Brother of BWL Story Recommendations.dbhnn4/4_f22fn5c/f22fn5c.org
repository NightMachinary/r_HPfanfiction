linkao3(brothers divided by jeleania) is a good one, slightly outside your timeframe because it was published in 2014. At 14K words, it's a quick read and complete. I really appreciated it because it has the brothers raised together and doesn't feature abusive/neglectful Potters; I don't remember any character bashing either.
