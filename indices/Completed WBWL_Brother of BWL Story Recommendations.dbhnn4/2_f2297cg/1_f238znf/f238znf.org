Worth noting that this isn't a typical WBWL fic - it's a deconstruction of most of the common tropes like James and Lily being assholes to Harry, Harry being a Slytherin who's distrusted, a political genius etc. It starts out by playing these straight, but piece by piece you realise that everything in The Sinister Man's world makes sense and fits together. No "why didn't character A just do X?" plotholes or inconsistent worldbuilding.

It also has a hell of a lot of exploration of magic and wizarding society, in a way that manages to be both consistent with JK's vision most of the time, and actually considered and detailed and logical.
