You might try 'Name Confused' Its not exactly what you're looking for, but it does feature Harry Potter as the bodyguard for Mycroft Holmes as the premise for the story, so sort of I guess.

Anyway, if anything like what you wanted does come out, imma definitely read it. (so awesome)

On the whole biological agent thing though it is far more likely that the wizards in question would just obliviate the bejeezus out of every muggle involved and destroy the research. Wizards tend to be enormously close minded and self centered like that. I was thinking more along the lines of disillusioned muggleborn ends up as a bodyguard and is trying not to break the statute but their client is an idiot and in so much danger...
