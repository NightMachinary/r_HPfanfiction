Anyone watch the British show 'Bodyguard'? Imagine something like that -- a PPO, assigned to a high-profile politician -- except it's not just a PPO, it's an Auror, and then there's this whole growing dramatic subplot of the muggle picking up on subtle things, inconsistencies in behavior, oddities and the like, which eventually culminates in a discovery of the wonders of the magical world.

Gahhhhhh, if I could upvote this thread 2, no, 5 times, I would.

I can think of several possible catalysts for this plot. A magical terrorist/aspiring dark lord, looking to gain access to either nuclear or biological weapons, for example. The biological angle is particularly plausible, I think. There's probably quite a number of governments working on weaponizing biological agents, as well as potential delivery methods. There's no reason why a sorcerer couldn't amplify that to create a potent magical plague, affecting muggles and wizards alike. Then, in this story, the aurors would receive a tip, regarding a potential attack on a facility developing that, and some would be assigned to guard the scientists working on it and/or the politicians/secret services that arranged the whole thing.

Man, I'd try to write this if I had time.
