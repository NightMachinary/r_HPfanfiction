I feel that having Harry as a main character could undermine the importance of the OC. I think first year would be really good to see up some later drama, after all a muggleborn witch in Slytherin is bound to create drama. Does she have Lycanthropy? If so how does that affect her getting into Hogwarts? If not, what kind of drama could their be if her heritage is uncovered?

Their is a lot you could do with this character and this story. How far do you intend to take it? If she is in the same year as Harry, will it span all seven years? I'm very intrigued by the idea and definetly look forward to reading it if/when it is published.
