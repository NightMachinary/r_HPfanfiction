Omg I wish my older sisters were as understanding as you. From the time I was a toddler until age 8, they relentlessly mocked me and called me overemotional since they liked to insult me until I ran away crying. It stopped at age 9 since they were in their early teens by then, so it was a bit embarrassing to keep making me break down. They still mocked me after that, but it was definitely toned down. Nowadays, they're actually not that bad anymore and only comment on my looks and intelligence.
