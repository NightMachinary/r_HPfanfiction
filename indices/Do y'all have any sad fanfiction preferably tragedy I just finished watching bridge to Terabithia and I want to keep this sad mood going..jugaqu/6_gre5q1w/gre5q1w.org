You deserve an invitation:

" Yes, indeed, the grief, the sorrow: they are all true. Leslie is gone. Let me guess, you feel it as a real loss, don't you? Well, be no afraid to admit it: you are not alone. I've met many people who had the same reaction. Firstly you feel a void inside your lungs, then it's like you're about to throw up. I feel you, brother or sister; we feel you. It may look absurd, it is like we lived this story in the first person: as if it could have been ours, many and many a life ago.\\
But of course, there's light at the end of the tunnel, and your grief, if it hasn't already, will open to you new paths of exploration. Soon or later you'll find yourself looking for more about Terabithia, without knowing why.

And for this, I've come to thee, for offering you a very merry proposal. A new subreddit has born from a small group of people from all around the world, and we are waiting for anything else but new members to make the Terabithian community a thing. Hence, sorry if this is just a copy-pasted message; but you'll enjoy this more if you'll consider it an actual invitation.

"We Terabithiers are are such lonely critters,, and like anyone, we have to stick together to carry on through these woods"

I'm [[/u/Bacoilieu][u/Bacoilieu]] and I'll await thee at this port [[/r/BridgeToTerabithia][r/BridgeToTerabithia]]

Mind Wide Open!"
