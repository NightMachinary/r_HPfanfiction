*GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)*

The General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level, or A Level, is a secondary school leaving qualification in the United Kingdom, offered as a main qualification in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, as an alternative qualification in Scotland, and as an international school qualification worldwide.

A Levels require studying an offered A level subject over a two-year period and sitting for an examination at the end of each year (A1/S and A2, respectively), proctored by an official assessment body. Most students study three or four A level subjects simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16--18) in a secondary school, in a sixth form college, in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their further education. A levels are regarded as better in level to the BTEC Level 3 qualifications.
