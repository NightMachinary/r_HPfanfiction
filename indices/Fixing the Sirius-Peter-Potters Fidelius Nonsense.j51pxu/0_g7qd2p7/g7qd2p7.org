I've seen your first point (Sirius' "confession") explained away as an overpowered jinx Pettigrew placed on him, to make him laugh hysterically and babble incoherently. That explanation appeals to me.

One way you could run with this is to give Sirius a wartime tribunal rather than a criminal trial. Enemy soldiers do not have the same rights as citizens. Plus, their justice system must have been overwhelmed at the time between officers of the court being killed and having too many cases.

So, Sirius is arrested under wartime circumstances. Simply having him in front of the tribunal implies that he is an enemy soldier and could easily lead overworked and grieving judges to, unintentionally, skip over the bit where they figure out whether he was a Death Eater at all. That means, from the judges' POV, all they're really trying to figure out is whether this specific Death Easter slaughtered these specific civilians. A couple of people say yup, the Potters told me he was their Secret Keeper, a couple of Obliviators say yup, here's what the Muggles heard Pettigrew yell before he died... everyone was so overworked they couldn't even give their testimonies in person, the tribunal had to make due with written statements and follow up questions would be more hassle than they're worth... suddenly this "trial" is just rubber stamping some paperwork.

Dumbledore and the Order investigate later and see that respected people testified and there was lots of paperwork (surely that's the same as lots of evidence). They see that Sirius received the same tribunal as all the other Death Eaters and think "the tribunals were so lenient Malfoy and others were able to slither out, surely they wouldn't have convicted Sirius if there was the faintest possibility of his innocence!" Without realizing how subconsciously prejudicial it is to see Lucius Malfoy who turned himself in, wearing an expensive outfit, with impeccable hygiene, speaking eloquently versus Sirius Black who had to be arrested, wearing torn and blasted robes, with three days worth of stubble and sweat, babbling incoherently about "it's my fault".

TLDR claim that wartime trials weren't as thorough as peacetime trials
