Maybe Veritaserum is expensive and time consuming to produce. The Ministry used up their supply during the war and hasn't been able to get more yet. Lucius generously donated the cost of the Veritaserum used in his trial ("see how committed to the truth he is") and since he's paying for his own trial it's only fair to let his attorney preview the list of questions he'll be asked under it. Or maybe Lucius bribed someone to use low quality Veritaserum, where you can't lie directly but you can still tell partial and misleading truths.

Or maybe it's illegal to use Veritaserum on someone without their consent. The tribunal never offered and Sirus wasn't coherent enough to ask for it.

Maybe they only asked him basic questions, trying to rush through and get it over with. "Are you the reason You Know Who found the Potters? Are you responsible for the deaths of Pettigrew and the Muggles? Next!"

Maybe they never asked about his Animagus form. Why would it come up? There's only seven registered. And yeah, the reader knows that of the five Animagi that appear on page, four are unregistered, but a) the Ministry doesn't know that and b) even assuming the number of unregistered Animagi is ten times that of registered, that's still a really rare ability that's beyond most people. I mean, I don't think they'd have time to go down the list with every suspected Death Eater. "Are you an Animagus? Are you a Metamorphmagus? Are you a Parselmouth? Are you a Seer?"
