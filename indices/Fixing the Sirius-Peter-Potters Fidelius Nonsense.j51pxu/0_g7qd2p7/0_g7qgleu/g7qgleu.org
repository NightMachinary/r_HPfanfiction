Thanks a lot. This is really helpful. I think laughing curse can work but will only go to a certain length. I actually had forgotten about Lucius, he might be the key. Maybe I can hit 2 birds with one Rock here and manage a convincing explanation for Lucius being believed without Veritaserum at the same time that Sirius is framed.

Maybe putting Sirius trial after the begging Barry Crouch Jr? The attitude of Sirius could make people think he can't look more innocent than Barry Crouch.

Will need a lot of attention for Sirius to not reveal he was an animagus though...
