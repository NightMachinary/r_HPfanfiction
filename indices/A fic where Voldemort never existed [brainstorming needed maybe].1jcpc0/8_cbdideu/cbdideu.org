Find some reason that CANNONHP can get into this universe. What if James and Lilly wited longer to get married so there is no Harry in this verse. Maybe instead of Voldemort being the penultimate bad guy a OC in his 6th year gives Harry a feeling that he is going to be a next dark lord but no one believes him.

Don't give James an Lilly a kid but give them harry which strains their relationship as James always wanted a kid but for some reason Lilly couldn't have children (uterine cancer maybe) so she neglects Harry and he has to win her affections.
