you are right about Alt!Harry's pre hogwarts childhood, Imagine if Harry And draco where playmates and now on better terms, how could cannon harry react to that. (What? Draco and me are friends!?)

And what you say about Snape, yeah. he probably didn't fell with seedy people but still if Lily married James something must have happened between them even if they still where friends after graduating (You are marrying the guy who tormented me during seven years!)

About the plot I'm not sure harry would want to go back to his original universe or stay in the new one, Also i think there could be some other dark wizards out there but not as bad as voldemort

it could also be about harry trying to connect with Ron and Hermione and Ginny who really don't like him very much

Or how Dumbledore reacts when he finds outs (maybe he reads harry's mind)
