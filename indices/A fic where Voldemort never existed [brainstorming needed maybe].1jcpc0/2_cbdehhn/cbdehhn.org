The first thing that came to my mind was that if there was no Voldemort, then Snape never fell in with the Death Eater crowd and never estranged himself from Lily. So did Snape and Lily remain friends? Or did Snape just fall in with a seedy-but-non-Death Eater crowd and estrange Lily just the same?

There are also many, many things that would have changed, but which wouldn't really have much of an effect on Harry or his life unless you choose to make it so. Some examples of this: the Riddles weren't murdered; Regulus Black wouldn't have died; Barty Crouch Jr. wouldn't be a baddie; Moody wouldn't have made as much of a name for himself fighting Death Eaters and may have never received the injury that led to his getting a magical eye; the Chamber of Secrets would never have been opened and Myrtle wouldn't have been murdered...

Also, really consider Alt!Harry's pre-Hogwarts childhood. Lily and James would have made sure he had magical playmates. Who might they have been? The Weasley kids? Neville? Or perhaps Lupin had kids? How is Lupin, anyway? Does he face less prejudice?

Finally, if you decide to pursue this, keep in mind that it isn't really a plot. What you have here is not enough to make a story; it's just a starting point. You'll still need to come up with a plot yourself.
