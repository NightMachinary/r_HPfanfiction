I think though that, since Voldemort never existed, Pureblood domination over the magical world would actually be MORE rampant, because there will never have been a real physical threat/war presented like with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and therefore Pureblood supreme-ism will, instead of being viewed as blatant oppression, be woven into wizarding society and therefore harder to eradicate. Instead of being a group of war radicals, the Order of the Phoenix might be established as a protest/activist group or even a political party. Maybe James, Remus or another order member could run for minister of magic against Lucius Malfoy or another person who would have been a Death Eater (Yaxley, or Rudolphus? Rudolphus would be interesting since Bellatrix could be his "Lady Macbeth" if you get the reference.) That will create a conflict within the context of the new world.

Also maybe Lily could cheat on James with Severus!! (Sorry, couldn't resist. I know cheating doesn't exactly fit Lily's profile but under certain circumstances it could work. Like maybe James cheated on her first.)

Or, given the fact that JKR said that the only reason Lily didn't marry Sev was because he was interested in the dark arts, and that in this world there are no Death Eaters, Lily might actually have married Severus. But that kind of kills your story since Harry wouldn't exist. Just another interesting idea though.
