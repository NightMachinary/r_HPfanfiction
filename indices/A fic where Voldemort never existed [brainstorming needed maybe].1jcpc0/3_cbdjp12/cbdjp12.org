I think your head cannon is off. This sounds like I'm bashing James potter, but that's not my intention.

To me James would have made a terrible Auror, he was fundamentally a coaster, and not too fond of rules. He was comfortable with not working and he could have lived off his family money if he wanted to, and I believe he probably did. If anything he would be a chaser in one of the international Quidditch teams, that's the impression I get from James pre-war.

Following that, I dont think Lilly would be with James, I think she would probably be with Snape because Snape would not have been as pressured and groomed into becoming the boy who called her a mudblood. And I think (someone might be able to correct me) that JK herself said that had that incident not happened they would have gotten together. In this case Snape would not be a teacher he would be or might be Harry's dad...or not if you think that your Harry is James son. In either case he would probably not be childhood friends with the Weaselys (because as a family they don't appear to have many friends outside of the circle they have as a result of the war, the majority of which are adults). Neville is a possible friend in a Harry Snape or Harry Potter scenario, but in a HS case you get the Malfoys. Whereas HP you might get Harry with Blacks kids (if he has any) or even Peters kids.

You could have James be an Auror in an attempt to still try and get Lilly and that could genrate some real drama in the Snape household which would be quite interesting to read. Everything else you've laid out seems very 'rose tinted' to me, not in a bad way but in a 'that wouldnt happen because people are nosy arseholes' sorta way. Hope that makes sense.
