What if, you have a war but its not headed by Voldemort and thus not as organised/as successful as the first war. You could have mad-eye/Dumbledore defeating this new Dark Lord, allowing for the our guys to be born, James and Lilly getting together etc. Because in reality I think a 'war' (big or small) probably would have happen with or without Tom. That would allow for the changes to the timeline, but also allowing you to keep somethings 'safe'. What do you think?
