Well if i went full butterfly effect with this there would be no harry and the weasleys and Longbottoms would have married latter in time making me create a full set of OCs (wich i'm not too fond of)

I think I will do something with Snape and Lily but i'm not sure what

and i want to keep it James/Lily so it can be one of the reasons that makes Harry desicion to go back harder.

Yeah i have an idea for Sirius son/daughter I can't imagine peter marring but this being and AU I could work it out someway
