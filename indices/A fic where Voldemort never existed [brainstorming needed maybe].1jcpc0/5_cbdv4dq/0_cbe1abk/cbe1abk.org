We know that James got his shit together and matured after his fifth year (Can't imagine Lily Marrying Jerkass!James), I read on some fic that maybe the fact that Lily and Snape broke their friend ship somehow provoked James to realize he was a jerk and lily would never like him that way.

I Like James as a Pro-Quiditch Player that could work Thanks :D

I see Lily like a more academic person, she could become a researcher or an unspeakable working at the Department of mysteries
