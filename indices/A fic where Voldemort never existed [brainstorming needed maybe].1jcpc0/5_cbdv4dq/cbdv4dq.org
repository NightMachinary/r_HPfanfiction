Really, there isn't a lot to go on for James. All we know of him is how he acted as a teenager. And he died at 21, which is when a lot of people are still young and partying. Maybe he would mature and become an auror in the canon universe after fighting so many Death Eaters. With no Voldemort though, what would draw him to that? Maybe he would do something completely different if there was no Voldemort. Maybe him and Sirius would open a joke shop, in the thread of their past deeds at Hogwarts. He could have done a stint as a Pro Quidditch player, and moved on to make his own business.

What would Lily do? Since there would possibly be no Snape at Hogwarts in this universe, what if she took the post as Potions Master? Or maybe even Muggle Studies? On the thread of using her Muggleborn status to further her career, what about in the Ministry in Muggle Relations? She could work with Arthur!
