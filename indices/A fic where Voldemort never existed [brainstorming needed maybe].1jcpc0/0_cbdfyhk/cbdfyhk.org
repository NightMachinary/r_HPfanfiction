You need to have some kind of turmoil occur as a result of Harry entering this alternate universe if there wasn't pre-existing problems with the universe. Otherwise, the reader will get bored. Furthermore, I believe James and lily would have had more children and I really like the idea of Harry's sibling(s) noticing his change when our harry takes alt Harry's place in the alt universe. Finally, I do not think cannon harry would ever just leave behind all his friends from the original universe as they were pretty much family to him. Perhaps you could change the DH ending to Harry being the last one alive or something and finally facing voldemort because be ha nothing to lose? Or the story could go a different route that you'd have to come up with that causes staying or leaving the new universe to make sense based on who is left in the old and new universe and the ties harry has to those people. Also I believe you should really think about an explanation of the magic behind Harry being sent to this new universe.
