Yeah I guess It need some kind of conflict but i don't want to remove Voldemort to just replace it with another character

I like the idea of Harry having a little brother or little sister

And about harry not leaving his friends, what about leaving the Lily, James, Sirius and Lupin of this universe how could harry chose between his friends and the family he never had

the explanation about harry ending up in this universe is MAGIC, no but really i was something about harry wishing that Volemort never existed so the universe ansered his call or something
