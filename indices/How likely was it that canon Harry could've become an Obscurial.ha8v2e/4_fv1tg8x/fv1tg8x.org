I think it very much depends on the character of person: I think you need right combination of submission and inability to fight. I guess some magical children are just beaten up, and some fight subconsciously with their accidental magic (e.g., linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)). Only when you get the right combination of very brutal suppression of the magic in a child and very weak resistance, you get internalization of the hatred towards their own magic, and thus Obscurial.

Talking about Harry, we can see that even after many years with Dursleys he resisted to the abuse quite strongly (he still insisted on the flying motorcycle, even though he did have to know his uncle will hate it), so either he was much stronger personality or the abuse was not so bad. Pick your choice. Credence Barebone was obviously much more beaten down and went much further down the path of self-hatred.
