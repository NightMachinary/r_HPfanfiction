It begs the question of if becoming an obscurial is also kind of like creating a separate personality? as the obscurial is seemingly a parasitic and highly destructive force it begs the question of if Harry could even develop one seeing as he already contains the horcrux which is essentially the same thing.

an interesting fic concept is if Harry were to form an obscurial it would be supplanted by Tom, or contained by the presence of the horcrux insuring its own survival.
