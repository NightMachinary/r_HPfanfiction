#+begin_quote
  When a magical child is forced to repress their talent through physical or psychological abuse, they develop a parasitical magical force inside of them called Obscurus, resulting from their strong emotions of distress. An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus.

Many people believe Ariana Dumbledore to have been an obscurial after being beat up by those muggles. It's an child that hates or fears their own magic so much that they suppress it, they lose control of their magic. This magic destroys everything when the kid loses emotional control. They don't often grow very old.
