It's what happens when a child tries to "suppress" their magic(normally because people beat or persecute them due to it), it creates a parasitic entity that consumes the child's magic(often killing them) and then leaves.

It looks like a mass of darkness and seems to be extremely destructive.

In the Fantastic Beasts movie, you see one, but the child is so strong magically they survive it(and keep being powerful).

Newt has one in the suitcase, it was from a girl in Africa(who probably suffered due to religion)
