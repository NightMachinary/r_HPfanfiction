I very much agree. If repressed magic essentially weakened their “magical immune system”, making them vulnerable to common, normally harmless, malicious spirits or something, that would be different. But the malicious entity literally being a creation of the child's repression doesn't sit well with me. It doesn't mesh with how I saw magic from the original canon, and it also feels a bit weirdly victim blaming, like it's the child's fault for the negative consequences of their abuse.
