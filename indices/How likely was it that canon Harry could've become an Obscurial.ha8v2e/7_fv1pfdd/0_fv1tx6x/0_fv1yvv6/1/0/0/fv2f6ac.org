You misunderstand, these kids /knew/ they were magical and were mistreated heavily because of it(the movie implies physical abuse and abandonment, Newt says the girl was banished from her village and family for being a witch)

So they try to suppress their magic, desperately, until it's so bad it lashes out and starts destroying stuff.

In the movie the person who had it was constantly beaten and told how it was bad while they knew they were magical.

Harry is just too defiant to for this to happen, and as you said, he didn't know he was a wizard.
