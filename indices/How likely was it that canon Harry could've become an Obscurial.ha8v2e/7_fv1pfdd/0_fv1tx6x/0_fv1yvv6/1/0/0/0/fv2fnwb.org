Oh, I see. Hmm. I still don't like it being the creation of a parasitic entity. Canon is pretty clear that magic is innate and creatures are innate. The idea of a person's magic creating a creature doesn't sit well with me as a canon-immigrating concept.

I agree that canon Harry is defiant. It's a defining trait especially considering that he is abused and has no natural allies until age 11.
