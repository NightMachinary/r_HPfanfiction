I don't love that being part of canon. It comes across a bit like retrofitting midichlorians. I don't see how that can gel with accidental magic. Harry had no idea he was a wizard until /after/ the family had gone to an island in the middle of nowhere and a giant man bust down the door, but that didn't stop him from exhibiting the ability to teleport without actively willing to.
