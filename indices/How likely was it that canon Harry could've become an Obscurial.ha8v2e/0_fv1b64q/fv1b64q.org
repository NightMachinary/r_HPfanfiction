I find the argument that he cannot become an Obscurial because he doesn't reject his freakishness(he can't, really, since he lacks context) quite persuasive. The idea is that he doesn't actually reject the weird things that happen around him, he accepts that they have happened and moves on.

It would be different if, say, the Dursleys told him he was possessed by a demon, and made out exactly how terrible that is, or promised they would love him like a son if he would just stop being such a freak.

Since they don't, he doesn't repress his magic, and so is overall at negligible risk of becoming an obscurial.
