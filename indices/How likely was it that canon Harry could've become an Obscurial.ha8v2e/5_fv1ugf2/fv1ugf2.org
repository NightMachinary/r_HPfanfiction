Besides the Word of God (JKR) saying he is not, there is a fundamental element missing for him to become one: obscurials deliberately try to suppress their magic, until it turns inward and festers before escaping, usually in a bloody mess. Until he was 11, Harry didn't know that the "freakishness" his family hated was magic. After he found out, he was going to Hogwarts and suppressing it was the last thing he wanted.

ETA: That said, I recently read a lovely one-shot wherein young Harry learns about obscurials. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22964278][An Obscure Occupation]] by Triscribe. linkao3(22964278) plus the direct link because the bot has been lazy lately.
