Probably no chance.

1. The Dursleys are thankfully too cowardly to abuse Harry so much that he feared ever using magic.
2. Harry doesn't know magic to hold it back.
3. Once Harry knows about magic he's far too stubborn and rebellious to let the Dursleys make him feel bad about it. Any increased abuse to "beat the freak out of him" is just gonna make him more stubborn and rebellious about it.

In general Harry's lack of respect for the Dursleys' "normalcy" and desire to be special are too important to him to ever become an Obscurial.
