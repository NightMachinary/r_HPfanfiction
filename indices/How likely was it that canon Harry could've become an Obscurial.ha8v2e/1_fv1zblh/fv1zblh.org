Personally I doubt that Harry was ever close to becoming an Obscurial.

(Terminology point: Obscurials are the host to a magical parasite. The parasite is the Obscurus.)

Remember, an Obscurial develops when a young witch or wizard /rejects or suppresses their own magic/. That rejection somehow creates a magical entity, the Obscurus, which is parasitical upon them. Obscurials are not created by abuse generally speaking, or unhappiness. You only become an Obscurial if you internalise the abuse - in Harry's case, if he had believed the Dursleys that magic was bad and being normal was good.

But canon Harry never adopts the Dursley world view. He never admires normalcy or desires to be "just Harry". That's something fanon created somehow. But canon is almost completely the opposite: the opening of PS explicitly notes that Harry's favourite thing about himself is his scar, specifically because it is different and not normal.

Further, I just don't think it's in Harry's canonical nature to internalise the Dursley's abuse.

Harry has many defining traits. Amongst them are loyalty, wit, curiosity, stubbornness, a cool head, and the ability make almost prescient leaps of insight. But probably his most prominent characteristics are his exceedingly resilient spirit and moral certainty.

Basically, Harry's spirit is just too defiant to ever just accept the Dursley's treatment of him. After 9 years of living under the Dursleys' roof, before he even knew about magic, he remained defiant.

  They stuff people's heads down the toilet first day at Stonewall,' he told Harry. ‘Want to come upstairs and practise?'

  ‘No thanks,' said Harry. ‘The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.' Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.

  The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in grey water.

  ‘What's this?' he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.

  ‘Your new school uniform,' she said.

  Harry looked in the bowl again.

  ‘Oh,' he said. ‘I didn't realise it had to be so wet.'

  ‘Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

  ‘Make Harry get it.'

  ‘Get the post, Harry.'

  ‘Make Dudley get it.'

  ‘Poke him with your Smeltings stick, Dudley.'

And:

#+begin_quote
  Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smeltings stick.

  ‘I want to read that letter,' he said loudly.

  ‘I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, ‘as it's mine.'

  ‘Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.

  Harry didn't move.

  ‘I WANT MY LETTER!' he shouted.

In short: it's in Harry's nature to be a snarky little shit who backchats anyone who he disagrees with. His will is simply too strong for him to ever have become an Obscurial.
