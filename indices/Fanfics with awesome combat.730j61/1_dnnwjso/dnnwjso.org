linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has some of the best battle scenes you'll find anywhere, as does his next story linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died). Divided and Entwined has some good ones too, but they're often more about muggle weapons so may not appeal.

I'm working slowly through the current Book Club subject, linkffn(6256154) The Unforgiving Minute, which also has some great battle scenes but I'm finding the story a bit hard going so won't recommend that quite as highly.
