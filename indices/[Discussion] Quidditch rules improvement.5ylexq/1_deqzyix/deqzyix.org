Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game by Concept101) has a scene where Harry steals the snitch from the middle of a game and keeps it, just to see how long the game would go on without it. It goes on for 5 days without break before Harry decides to return the snitch onto the pitch just out of pity.

That seems like a pretty big hole in the rules. A time limit would probably really help the game.
