But if you play worse the other team will win the game should their seeker catch the Snitch first.

Those 50 points are so the seeker has an encouragement to catch the snitch even if catching it would not result in your team winning.

Teams would be play as best as they can, so that no matter who catches the snitch they dont loose immediately and Seekers would be encouraged to catch the snitch so they either win the game or make up for the difference in points.
