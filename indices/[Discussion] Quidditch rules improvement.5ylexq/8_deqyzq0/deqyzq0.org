I like your idea, but would it be better if it was the other way around? So, say Magpies 400-500 Harpies, Magpies get the snitch and they get 25% of their own score, rather than the opponent's score added on. The Magpies would get 100 points added on, making it a draw. It just seems a little more fair to me because if the team that caught the Snitch got 25% of the opponent's score, the higher the opponent's score, the more points the Snitch team would get. So the team that catches the Snitch is actually gaining points based on the opponent being a better team, which I think is kind of weird. Does this make sense? I'm sorry if it doesn't, I'm pretty tired right now.
