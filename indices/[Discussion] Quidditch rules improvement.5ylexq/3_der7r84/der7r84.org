I think Quidditch is probably fine but the school level is likely very different to the pro scene. A snitch is the equivalent to a 15 goal difference, this seems huge but if matches last hours then how big is this gap? If IRE vs BUL was a quick match then we could see regular high scoring. I don't know how long they last or how easy it is to score but given enough time the snitch matters less. We watch sports because their exciting but also unpredictable. In a game where it can last from minutes to days then a team getting a big early lead can seem very boring. Having the snitch in there as a wild card means games aren't over and are still worth watching.

Seekers are probably the single most important role in the game, definitely for amateur games but at high levels I would prioritise good beaters. Imagine the difference between being tackled by a pro rugby blindside flanker vs a school kid. Now remember the bludgers are iron wrapped in leather. Its quite probable that the beaters play tennis amongst themselves until they get an openning onto another player which could potentially injure them and put them out of the game.
