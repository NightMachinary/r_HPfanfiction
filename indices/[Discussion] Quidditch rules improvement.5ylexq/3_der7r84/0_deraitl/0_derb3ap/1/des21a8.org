If you view it as impromptu and uncoordinated flying tricks that happens to have a score system behind it, then sure, it can be exciting. It's not at all optimized for that -- you'd be better off with a scoring system inspired by figure skating instead.

As a game, the rules are fighting to make it unexciting. The people who are doing interesting tactical things don't matter. The people who are moving in interesting ways don't matter. The only two people who matter are circling around the field slowly and squinting.
