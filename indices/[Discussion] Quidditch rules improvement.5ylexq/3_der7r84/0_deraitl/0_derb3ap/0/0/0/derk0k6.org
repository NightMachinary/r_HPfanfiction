The quaffle doesn't matter, unless it's a trouncing game. In any close game that is exciting to watch, the impact of that scoring is lost in the hands of the seeker deciding the game. Unless there is a significant difference in skill, or the game is extremely long, all that matters is the seeker who decides the game single handedly.

This doesn't make the game more exciting, it makes the game boring. Yes, there may be outliers like the world cup we see in the book, but realistically every game is going to simply be watching the seekers fly around looking for the snitch, since that is all that matters.
