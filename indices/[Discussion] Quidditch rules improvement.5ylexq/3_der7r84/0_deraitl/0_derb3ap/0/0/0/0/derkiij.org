We don't know how much of an outlier the world cup was. If scoring happens much faster with pro beaters possibly putting players out of the game then we don't know how often it happens. Nothing would be more boring than just watching seekers, a big issue I have with 'seeker duels' I often seek in fanfics. It is also boring watching a one sided stomp. Its not boring having a seeker wining the game, its exciting, it can feel *cheap* and there is a difference. If you genuinely think that its boring then we just can't agree. I don't mind cheap most of the time. People in rugby have called drop goals in rugby cheap and wanted the score lowered but to me the 2003 rugby world cup drop goal will forever be one of the most exciting moments in sporting history.
