The fact that it was odd for Krum to catch the snitch and lose tells us how odd it is for a game to have chasers that unmatched.

Andd yes, I would find it unfulfilling to watch a game where points are exchanged evenly between two teams when those points stop mattering. Remove the seeker position entirely from the game and you have an incredibly fulfilling sport. The presence of the seeker negates the need for the rest of the team as a sport.
