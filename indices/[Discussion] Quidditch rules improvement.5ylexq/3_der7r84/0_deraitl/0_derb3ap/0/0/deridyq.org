You have potentially close, swinging scoring with the quaffle. If one team is better than the other then it gets boring as they rack up a lead. It might feel cheap but the snitch means the game isn't over, a lead is good but you have a race to get over that 150 point margin before the snitch is found. You take the best team in the league and put them against the bottom. In regular sports its often not worth watching unless you're a fan of one of those teams since, ITA vs ENG in the six nations for example. ITA have never won against England, now a snitch is a chance, a gamble. It could just appear next to the worse team's seeker and suddenly that team has a chance. There is a chance aspect to spotting the snitch even if catching it is skill based. That chance might be too big for some but it means that every team goes in with a chance. Any game could be worth watching.
