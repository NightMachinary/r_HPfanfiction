  Seekers don't end the game

I've been playing with the idea of doing the opposite: Seekers *only* end the game. Yeah, that's right, catching the snitch earns you 0 points. Oh and also the game ends after 2 hours at the latest.

There may be problems with this too, but it could give the Seeker a more complex tactical value instead of this one-off big-point scorer. There's also a kind of hunter/defender dynamic that would develop between the two seekers depending on which team is in the lead.
