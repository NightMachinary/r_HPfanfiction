  - Strategic Position only

  This option takes away all earnable points from the seeker. His position becomes an entirely strategic one as he ends the game, which in itself is a huge impact on a game. That also means that the normal game of a seeker would entail as much prevention of a catch as catching it themselves, depending on the current status of the game. Are you in a lead? Catch it! Are you behind? Prevent a catch. Are you steamrolling over the other team? Don't catch it and let the Chasers up the points for a greater lead in the league.
