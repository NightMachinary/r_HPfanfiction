I want to see a Dumbledore who goes through abandoned classrooms and other chambers in Hogwarts randomly playing music. Of course, he'd be ecstatic when Harry finds the Chamber of Secrets so he can play music there too!

Yes, I know that's not what "chamber music" means, but it's a wonderful image.
