I wonder what year his scar is based on? The London Underground has changed over the years as new stations are added and the odd old one removed. For instance, does his Jubilee Line scar end at Charing Cross or does it have the extension to Stratford (changed in 1999)? Strand Station (closed 1994) etc etc. Or does his scar update in real-time?
