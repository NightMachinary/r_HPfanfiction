I actually do remember seeing that scar mentioned in a fanfic. I can't remember its name, but I read it in the last year.

The story had a scene where Dumbledore reminisced about the scar -- I don't think he actually used it as a map. But the story added the detail that the scar was originally not a perfect match for the London Underground -- it was missing one or two lines. So Dumbledore had later gotten a tattoo that filled in the missing lines with ink.
