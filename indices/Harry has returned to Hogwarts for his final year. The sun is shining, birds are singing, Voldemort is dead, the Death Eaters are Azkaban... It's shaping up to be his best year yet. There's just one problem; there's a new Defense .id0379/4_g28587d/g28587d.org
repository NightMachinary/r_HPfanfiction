I feel like this would be the perfect thing for Voldemort to come back to life after getting 1000 years if therapy in the afterlife, with full Soul and his wish fullfilled because dead things don't die twice, and /finally/ get to be the DADA teacher he always aspired to be, except he doesn't want to also overtake the world.
