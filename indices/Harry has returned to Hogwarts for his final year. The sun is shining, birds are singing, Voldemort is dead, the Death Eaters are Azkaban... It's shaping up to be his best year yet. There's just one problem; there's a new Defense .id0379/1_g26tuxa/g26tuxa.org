Imagine that she is this little old lady who is defs older than McGonagall and walks around with a cane and calls everyone “my dear” or “dearie”, but in class she seems to cast defense spells with alarming dexterity.

Harry finds this extremely disturbing, because how can some rickety old lady be so spritely? Is she possessed? Is she using Polyjuice potion? And why is she so sweet ugh he's getting Umbridge vibes even though she's actually nice.

Harry starts tracking her on the Marauders map, but everywhere she goes makes perfect sense. However, soon he realizes she disappears on Saturday mornings, and he has MAJOR 6th Year Draco flashbacks and is determined to catch her in the act of doing something dark.

Sure that she's cooking up something in the Room of Requirement, he hides out there every Saturday morning, until one day he's there just in time to see her arrive!

She makes a door appear, and Harry manages to slip inside after her. However, as soon as he looks up, he realizes he has made a grave, grave mistake.

Because the Room of Requirement has simply turned into a cozy-looking cottage.

And the old lady professor is now snogging professor Slughorn.
