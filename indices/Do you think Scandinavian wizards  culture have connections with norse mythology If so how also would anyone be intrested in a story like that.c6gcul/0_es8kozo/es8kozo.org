I have always wanted a wizard story based more on Norse Culture and Mythology. Sacrifices, divination and potions would probably be exceptionally popular. Curses and Blessings and afterlife will also be featured extensively.

In fact, I have tried many times to write such a story. The thing is I always lose confidence in myself as ignorance of Scandinavian culture smacks me in the face hard.

Also I am reasonably sure that runes were more used for divination than for casting any spells. Magic also wasn't really the tool of war for them. It was more an expression of the will of the gods.
