Same & I always want to go back to the idea but my problem is I like ancient magic bieng op but then I think we'll the only people we know who could match that kind of stuff in Canon are voldemort Dumbledore & the flamels. Arrgh I wish harry & co didn't only use Hogwarts lvl stuff against someone who is a dark arts master dammit jk Rowling. & anytime I think itle be fine then i think we'll its not even really harry anymore & might as well be an OC
