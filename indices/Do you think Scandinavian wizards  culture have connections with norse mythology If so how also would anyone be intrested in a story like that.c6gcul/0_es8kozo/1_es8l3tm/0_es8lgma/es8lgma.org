I always try to balance any ancient OPness with moral and statistical qualms. Like how we can still build bigger pyramids than even the biggest ones that our ancestors made but either no one is willing to do so much manual labor, sacrifice that many people or resources or they just don't see a point to it.

Are you planning on starting a story anytime soon? I will be happy to help. It will probably help me out in writing my own story. Just gave my college exams so am kinda free too.
