A couple things regarding ancient magic you may want to think about for your story is a lot of ancient magic is not as efficient as magic is now. Something like you CAN do this but it requires hundreds of lives sacrificed to do it. Or I remember reading a story where the old magic had more words and slightly different effects. Or simply ancient magic is dangerous because fewer people recognize it right away/defend against it because it.
