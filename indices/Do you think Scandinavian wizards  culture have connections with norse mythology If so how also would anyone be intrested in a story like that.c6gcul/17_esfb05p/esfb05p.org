The issue with some of these suggestions (like more powerful Runes, etc.), is the risk of unbalancing and upsetting Rowling's world here.

It'd be best for her to keep all nations varied but also fairly balanced. We can't have some other Magical community of another country suddenly be super OP compared to the rest.

It also makes me wonder how many mean ghosts are floating around the world, unable to move on due to their Horcrux items staying behind after their deaths.

There's a lot that we don't know about the rest of the Magical world on Earth.
