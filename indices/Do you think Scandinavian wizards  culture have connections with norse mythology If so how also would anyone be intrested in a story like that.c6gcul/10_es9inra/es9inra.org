So yeah, I'd be super into reading a Scandinavian-based fic. Anything to get out of the old stuff in Britain which we've retreaded for years lol

I think fics featuring magical studies from different perspectives around the world are sorely needed in general. I'm from Mexico and I sometimes daydream about our own hypothetical magical community. We come from deeply religious, superstitious cultures which I think are full of untapped potential for fascinating settings, magical theory, etc. A magical community in the heart of the Lacandon Jungle, a secret magical school deep in the Sonoran desert; Mayan descendants and their studies of astronomy and the cosmos (which could lend itself to Lovecraftian tales of contact between wizards and deep-space entities--maybe that's where their ideas of deities came from?), northern shamans and their study of Soul magics, so on and so forth. I've been meaning to write something on this, hopefully one day I will.

I also have this idea of different versions of spells in different languages, like maybe there's a form of the Killing Curse that's in Japanese, and it was actually preferred to the standard version back when dueling with it was legal, because it had one less syllable and thus had a faster casting time. Dumb stuff like that.
