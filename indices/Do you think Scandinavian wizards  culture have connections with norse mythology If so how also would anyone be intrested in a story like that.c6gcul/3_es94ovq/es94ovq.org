I really like the idea of non-English wizarding cultures. It is sad that we all are trying to be English and write into the culture which is alien to us. However, it has to be done by somebody who is native to the culture, otherwise we get the Hollywood Vikings with axes stuck in the thirteenth (tenth?) century.

For example, I am a Czech, and so I am excited by the community of fanfiction writers around [[http://budec.net/]] (everything in Czech, sorry) which is centred around the Czech magical school at Budeč (according to Muggles, that's a old Slavic hillfort which was abandoned rather suddenly in the early tenth century after the death of the Czech patron saint Saint Wenceslaus; we know that in fact wizards decided to hide the school seated there from the Muggle world).

Concerning Ancient Runes, “Чары” in Russian (and in other Slavic languages, in Czech it is “čáry”) means both charms (like a class in Hogwarts) and lines (like what you draw on paper). There are very rare archaeological excavation of proto-Slavic never undeciphered writings (I believe on birch bark) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Christian_Slavic_writing#Evidence_from_early_historiography][чръты и рѣзы]] (which means roughly “sketches and cuts”), which can very well be just last few remainders of the old Slavic magic roughly comparable to the Norse Runes.
