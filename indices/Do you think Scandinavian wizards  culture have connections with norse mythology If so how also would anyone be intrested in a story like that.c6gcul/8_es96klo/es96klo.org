I love the idea and have been speculating on the history and culture of a wizarding Scandinavia for a while, considering writing a fic set there either as an SI (seeing as i'm scandinavian myself i would be reborn there) or as a story of harry being taken in by distant relatives at some early point.

I have a (shittyly edited) collection of my thoughts on the structure, history and culture, including the interplay with norse mythology and the various creature and species. these are just my notes on the history of magical scandinavia

#+begin_example
  • Once divided in Aesir and Vanir tribes, with many conflicts

  • Aesir being martial wizards with focus on enchanting, runes and biomancy, society dominated by battles with various beings such as jotuns (ice giants), mountain giants, werewolf tribes and occasionally dwarves and elves

  • Vanir being pastoral and fishing, focus on rituals, elementalism and spirit magic, more closely integrated with muggles, seen as wisemen and Völva

  • Peace first established in 106 to support German tribes in repelling Roman invasion, first contact with modern wands (ceasefire negotiated on Fredsøy, named hereafter)

  • Unity first started in 356 with establishment of first Scandinavian wizarding ting on Fredsøy

  • First Ting led by Law speaker Odin Borson, Chieftain of Asgard, largest city of the Aesir

  • Ting restructured and expanded in 573 (giving long time wizarding allies the dwarves representation and expanding to more magical communities), 782 (Iceland included, nisser given citizenship, though not representation), 946 (British and Irish territories acknowledged but not included, Faroe Islands and Greenland gain representation) and 1130 (Finnish wizards join, Ice giants given representation after nearly four centuries of peace)

  • Fredsøy and magical territories in Scandinavia begins separation from mundane politics in 1397 in reaction to Kalmar union (single royal family being able to pressure magicals to much for their comfort), seceding completely in 1523 under cover of Swedish rebellion.
