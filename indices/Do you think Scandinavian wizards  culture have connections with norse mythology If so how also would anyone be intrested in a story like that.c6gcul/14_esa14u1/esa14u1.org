Personally I'd see more of Europe in general, be it Durmstrang or Beauxbatons or somewhere in Scandinavia, but without any Marvel/Hollywood influences or Grindelwald-did-WW2 stuff.

I think I stumbled over a French Beauxbatons fic a few years ago, but it was a bit too zany for my French at the time...
