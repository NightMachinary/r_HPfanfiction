There's Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir. That story is all about vikings and such. It's... not good though.

The author of the Percy Jackson series (Rick Riordan) has written a trilogy of books dealing with the Norse Gods. Could possibly be a crossover with them? Either way, I'd love to read about that. The most I usually get are crossovers with Thor.
