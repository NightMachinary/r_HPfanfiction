  The Tales of Beedle the Bard was written in runes in the 1400s, centuries after they fell out of use in the Muggle world.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but Norse Runes were actually used up until thereabout. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_runes][Medieval Runes]], though what I've learned but do not have a source available to double check right now. In Norway the nobles and of course priests would be the only one to truly make the shift over to Latin. Which left the rest of the population to still write in runes, which lasted until the Reformation arrived in Norway.
