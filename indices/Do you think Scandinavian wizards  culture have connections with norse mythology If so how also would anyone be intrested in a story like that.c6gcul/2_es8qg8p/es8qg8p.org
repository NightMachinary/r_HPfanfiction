Three observations:

- Hogwarts teaches Ancient Runes like Muggle schools teach Latin.

- The Tales of Beedle the Bard was written in runes in the 1400s, centuries after they fell out of use in the Muggle world.

- Curse-breakers are anticipated to encounter Ancient Runes frequently enough that they are a NEWT requirement.

From these observations, I think it's heavily implied that Ancient Runes were the written lingua franca of magical Europe (or at the very least, northern Europe) until at least the Renaissance era. So I certainly think there's a lot of scope for a significant Scandinavian presence in European magic.

Stuff like the Norse gods being real - that I think pushes things out of the realm of a canonical magical tone. The running theme of canonical magic is demythologisation - pegasi aren't the offspring of Poseidon, they're just winged horses and they drink single malt; Cerberus doesn't guard the underworld, but rather is Hagrid's pet and is called Fluffy, etc. So introducing literal deities etc. rather clashes with the established HP system, I think.
