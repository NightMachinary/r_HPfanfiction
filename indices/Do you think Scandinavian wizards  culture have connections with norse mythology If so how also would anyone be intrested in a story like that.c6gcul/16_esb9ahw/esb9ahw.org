As a swedish person, I never really felt like JKR's statement about Durmstrang being in Norway fit, I always felt it was more likely to be in Russia, or thereabouts, basically a school of magic in Norway likely wouldn't be called Durmstrang. I'd love to delve deeper into a how a Scandinavian school would work, and what a magical society here would look like.
