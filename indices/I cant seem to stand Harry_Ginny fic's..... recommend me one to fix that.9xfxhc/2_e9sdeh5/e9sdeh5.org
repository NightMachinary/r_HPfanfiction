Up for something humorous? If so, go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]].

Now what you have to know about this fic is that roughly 50% of all dialogue in it this fic is snark, and it's awesome. No, that's not a hyperbole, it's actually 50%.

Basically Harry and Ginny develop a soul bond in the Chamber of Secrets and then spend their entire time throwing snark at each other going from genuinely annoyed and mean-spirited at first to more and more tongue-in-cheek and romantic the further the story progresses.

If you enjoy snark I'd go as far as saying you cannot not enjoy this story. If you don't enjoy snark you'll probably enjoy it a lot less though it might still be worth a try.
