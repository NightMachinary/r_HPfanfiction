I'd like to see one where we see more terrible interactions between Harry and his classmates or random strangers in hogsmeade during fifth year. In canon we get a bit of Seamus at the beginning of the year and then it's just Umbridge and Malfoy the rest of the book. Let's see Harry get emotionally beat down his entire fifth year by people calling him a murderer (Cedric) or an insane liar to the point where when everyone flips the script once they find out about the prophecy he tells everyone to go to hell.
