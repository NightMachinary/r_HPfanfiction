I'm a sucker for steamrolling the universe, like the Game of Thrones industrialisation SI fics. That being said, if you are writing that sort of fic, don't come up with artificial difficulties or limitations to have tension when it is entirely obvious that any confrontation would be incredibly one sided. If I drop Shepard, Tali and Wrex or the Master Chief in the Battle of Hogwarts, it should not be a close fight. The expectation is that Voldemort gets a good paddlin, not the ability to block projectiles at 0.2 c or a 2000 pound alien charging with his alien magic.

Having OP characters dropped into a world is supposed to be the ultimate "feel good" fic where the "bad guys" get fucked harder than an "18 year old" in her "first" gangbang movie. When Darth Vader becomes Harry's drinking buddy because his TIE Advanced was thrown through time and space, it is expected that he slaughters his way through the Death Eater ranks and the only question should be the order of deaths and who dies fighting and who tries to run.

Tl;dr: If you want tension, don't make crossovers with overpowered characters. Those are supposed to be a turkey shoot. It's like playing Civilization on easy and using nukes to wipe out medieval societies. You are not in it because it is challenging.
