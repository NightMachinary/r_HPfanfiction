Thank you for the detailed advice! First, with the description, I think I'll see what kind of stories pull me in, and take note of what they include and why it pulled me in, or how it help up with the story, which is something I hadn't thought of prior to your advice. Second, for your note on magical cores, I plan to take it in a different direction that won't necessarily need to alter anything previously established in the wizarding world, but I will try to remember not to contradict myself or what familiar characters come to expect of their own world. Third, as for the version of scarlet witch, I want to make her my own version, diverging from most storylines where she would have been in-story age, but I'll make sure to establish her origins so that fans of her can get a general idea of what her limitations might be. Lastly, as for the trope, I have thought extensively on what kind of alterations would/should change character personality, so I won't take a character OoC without a large amount of premeditation. Thank you again, as your post was super helpful in getting me to think over my outline a bit!
