Be careful when doing this. Because you are starting Year 6, there has already been significant feats of magic. I'd recommend against alteration of power through the introduction of magical cores being a power indicator. That trope can be done well, but personally, I think a AU Year 6 would be way too late to introduce it because of how Year 4 played out.

The summary is really short and doesn't say much. That can affect what type of crowd you're trying to draw in, so give that some thought.

If you're bringing in Scarlet Witch from Marvel, I'd make it clear within the first chapter which version she is. Reason is from what I know of her, it just seems like she doesn't need to influence the world at all, she can literally re-write reality in the comics. So instead of influencing the world, she can just straight up changes it outright and no one can stop her.

In-Name-Only trope, should be careful that you don't alter the characters so much that you reach that imo. For me personally, I don't mind some changes to the character, but there is a point in which it becomes an In-Name-Only trope and at that point is it even in the Harry Potter world or is it more or less a fanfiction for Scarlet Witch.
