But that's the thing, giving one side a jump on the other (and the motivation to kill) makes most fights boringly one-sided. If a Krogan happens upon Voldemort, Voldemort wins because he always wants to kill and has an unblockable means of doing so (unclear if this is fair anyway since he's immortal). Weight and mass don't really matter to transfiguration since it alters molecular structure (needles have several times the mass of a matchstick, after all), and from canon Shield Charms stop physical attacks in general (obviously this isn't going to stop star destroyers, I was really talking about ME and Halo).

Don't get me wrong, it's not a stomp if both sides are out to kill. But certain abilities even the playing field in a fight, more so if we give one side the initiative. Oh a sniper? Well maybe Voldemort keeps up a Supersensory Charm so they'll never hit. Force Choke? Apparate to a blindspot and Avada. Like anyone can make a fight easier in their head. :P
