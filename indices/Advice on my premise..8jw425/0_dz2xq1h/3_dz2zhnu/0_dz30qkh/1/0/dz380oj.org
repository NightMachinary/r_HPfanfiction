The Killing curse is blockable by physical objects and I would argue that armour which can withstand missile hits and mass accelerators (which operate at low relativistic speeds) will make it possible for the wearer to continue fighting despite being hit by the killing curse (and that is discounting energy shields). Also, Krogans have a lot of redundant organs so they might need more than one killing curse to kill, similar to giants.

As for the mass, that was more about the psychological effects than the kinetic energy. None of the Death Eaters have seen a Krogan before and suddenly this Hagrid-sized lizard wearing five-inch thick armour is charging them with a very toothy grin... Their ranks will break and their underwear will need a change as well.
