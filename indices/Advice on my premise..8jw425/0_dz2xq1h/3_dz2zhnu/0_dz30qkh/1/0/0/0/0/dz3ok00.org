Note: I have played the ME series, lol. But I don't see what non-magical defenses are really going to do against magical attacks. The difference with the statues is that they were magically animated, probably created magically as well since, well, why would wizards bother doing it the muggle way. The physical material is irrelevant, otherwise anyone could stop the curse, which Crouch Jr. made clear was not possible (with the obvious exception). Speed isnt really a factor, the curse kills magically not through physical trauma.

But my original question: If any of these were trouble, couldn't Voldemort just transfigure them into something harmless and defenseless? Armor is great unless it's turned into rubber, and redundant organs are a good fallback unless your transformed into a chicken. :(
