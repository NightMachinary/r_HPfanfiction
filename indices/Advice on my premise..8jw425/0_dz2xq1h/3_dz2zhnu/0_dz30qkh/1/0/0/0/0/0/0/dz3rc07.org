Magic isn't really an "energy" in HP though (in the generic sci-fi sense of a plasma-looking something), so I'm skeptical the armors and energy shields in ME would be any better than other physical material.

I don't recall that being said about Transfiguration. The closest I can recall is that for Vanishing living things (which I doubt works on anything humanoid anyway) the more complex that they are makes Vanishing harder. Gamp's Law of Transfiguration is (from what we can gather from DH) something like "Anything can be transfigured into anything else" (with the exceptions). I mean, it's not like first years have a physics level understanding of the difference between a needle and a matchstick, they just know "one is metal, the other is wood" yet they can work it. As far as i can tell (again, unless Ive forgotten something) is that you only need to know what you're changing the thing into. And going against other wizards, transfiguration is less useful since they can actively block and deflect it, something a Krogan couldn't.
