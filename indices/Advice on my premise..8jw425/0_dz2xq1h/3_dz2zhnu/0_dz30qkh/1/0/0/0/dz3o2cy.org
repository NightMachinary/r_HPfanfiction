Krogan armour (or any armour in Mass Effect) is designed to stop projectiles moving with tens of thousands of miles per SECOND. And they have energy shielding around that. Which makes that armour way more resistent than a golden statue. And even if the armour should splinter, Krogans have most of their organs in redundant pairs, so even shredding a heart will not immediately stop one since they have another heart. They were uplifted for the purpose of waging intergalactic war, which should tell you a lot about their resilience. Hell, their home planet makes Tschernobyl look like a holiday resort (it is a nuclear wasteland).

And Wrex has been fighting since gunpowder made it to Europe, and having access to Space Magic (Biotics) himself, he would be a formidable foe, even for Voldemort. And that is not even taking his shotgun (larger than a two pounder cannon) into account.
