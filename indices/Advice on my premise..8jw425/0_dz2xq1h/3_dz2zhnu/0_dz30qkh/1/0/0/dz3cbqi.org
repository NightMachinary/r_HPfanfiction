I think the fact that only Dumbledore blocked the Killing Curse is evidence that you need to have powerful magic, as whatever it hits is still destroyed (it may even have to do with those statues being animated to life). If that's armor well there's a bunch of shrapnel in your body, assuming it stops the curse at all. Otherwise everyone would just conjure some metal in front of them to stop it. I don't think giants were ever indicated to resist the killing curse. They just have high magical resistance so things like stunners are less effective or not at all.

That seems unlikely. Wouldn't the curse it out of fear, if anything? Large, powerful magical creatures exist, so the idea of a giant lizard-man, while odd and scary, probably wouldn't make death Eaters shut themselves before attacking.
