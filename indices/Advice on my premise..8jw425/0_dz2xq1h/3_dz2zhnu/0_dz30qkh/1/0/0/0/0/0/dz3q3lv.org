Yes, and no. Biotic barriers are a thing and it is arguable that they would stop magic, as could energy shields. And no, just turning people into animals or straight up vanishing them should not work. According to Mc Gonagall, you need to know what you are transfiguring, and I doubt that Voldemort knows enough about Krogans to transfigure one. Transfiguring others is not once used in combat in the series (the closest we get is the animagus reversal). Also, the more complex, the higher the difficulty. Sapient being ls should not be easily alterable with magic.

Don't get me wrong, someone of the Dark Lord's caliber would not be a pushover. If Voldemort wants to kill a Krogan, Fiendfyre would be his best bet, despite the collateral damage. And transfiguration can be used defensively to great effect. Mass Effect vs Harry Potter is decided by who gets the drop on the other one. I'm just not sold on offensive transfiguration in general.
