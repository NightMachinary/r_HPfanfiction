At least Mass Effect would still kick Voldemort's arse due to Biotics and the stuff you can do with them, like creating singularities or ripping something apart on a molecular level. Voldemort might be able to counter most spells in existence, but I doubt he even knows what a molecule is, much less how to defend against. Most Death Eaters would also shit themselves when a Krogan charges them (imagine a large, heavily armoured lizard carrying a machine gun with a sword-sized bayonet, a fantasy-sized Warhammer and a 2-inch shotgun.

Halo would also be a challenge since you can use advanced AI to aim a sniper rifle at ranges exceeding a mile and Voldemort won't even know that there is someone hunting him. Or just jump in the middle of the Death Eater camp, spray and prey with two homing explosive projectile launchers (Needlers) and then charge with your ton of power armour.

As for Star Wars, can magic counter a force choke? Can you shield against an Executor-class star destroyer raining plasma from the sky?

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of universes where having Harry Potter magic would enable you to steamroll everything (Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings), but also plenty where it would be a fair fight (Halo) or where the outcome depends entirely on the author (Mass Effect). Although I very much doubt that Voldemort could do much about the Reapers tbh.
