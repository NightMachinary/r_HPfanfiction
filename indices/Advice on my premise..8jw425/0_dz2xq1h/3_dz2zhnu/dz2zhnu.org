My only thing is... wouldn't Voldemort just Transfigure those obstacles and win pretty handily? I find this almost as annoying as OP characters not steamrolling those they should. So many HP crossovers forget (or the author didn't know) that you can pretty much transfigure anything into anything else (with 5 exceptions) which makes most non-magical foes considerably more killable.
