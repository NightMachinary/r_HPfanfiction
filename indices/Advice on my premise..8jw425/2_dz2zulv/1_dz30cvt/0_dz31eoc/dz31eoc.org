And from what I remember of House of M (it's been a while), Wanda was dealing with some pretty serious shit when she did that. What's your plan to keep her from wrecking the school as an uncontrolled 16-year-old? Mechanical intervention via some sort of device? A potion that only Snape can brew (and does so only grudgingly)? This could be an opportunity to highlight Occlumency in some capacity. If this is Half-Blood Prince time, she could be competition for Harry WRT Dumbledore's time. Lots of possibilities here.
