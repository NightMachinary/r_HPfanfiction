What's your plan for limiting her? Whatever you choose, make sure it's grounded in whatever magical theory you're using. One of the more disappointing aspects of HP fanfic is when authors explain things by simply saying "a wizard did it". Maybe Fawkes could play a role here? A talisman crafted from one of his feathers or a potion that incorporates phoenix tears. Enchanted jewelry could also be an option since instances of that have already been shown in the HP universe with the cursed necklace and the Horcrux ring.
