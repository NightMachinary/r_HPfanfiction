Well I've got a few ideas that I myself don't scoff at upon rereading, but a lot of the finer details are up in the air. I did feel that HBP time period gave me the most believable opportunities what with Occ. Training and the story becoming much more with the introduction of Horcruxes. As far as Wanda not taking down the school in an outburst, which would be entirely possible, I plan on her being limited, at first, to the point where she does need a wand to concentrate her powers. The eventual regaining of her powers might initially present itself in much smaller outbursts caused by emotion, not unlike Harry before learning he's a wizard, but on a more appropriate to book 6 scale, if that makes sense.
