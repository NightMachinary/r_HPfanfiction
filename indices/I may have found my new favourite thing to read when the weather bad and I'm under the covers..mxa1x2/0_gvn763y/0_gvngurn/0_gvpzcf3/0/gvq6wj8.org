I'm fairly sure that the author doesn't actually know how to cook.

I don't really like crab or lobster, so I just shrugged at the lobster decapitation prior to cooking it as I've only done it once. (And really, all I did was boil water and then drop them in... isn't that all you do? I will, however, forever treasure the memory of pulling a lobster out of a garbage bag and hearing my mom screech "is that /alive?!?!?/")

The timing for some of the stuff was also atrocious - who the fuck lets poached eggs sit around for 30 minutes before serving? Here, have some overcooked rubber.
