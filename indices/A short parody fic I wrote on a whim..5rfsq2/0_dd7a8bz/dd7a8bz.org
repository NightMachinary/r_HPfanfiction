Damn you, now I want to read the actual parody this guide would produce. Except for the goblin orgasms, that kinda made me uncomfortable. And the name thing is played out even for parody by now. Maybe instead Harry is just incredibly good at rapping. So much so that high-ranking snoopdog immediately becomes his account manager and works with the goblin king fiftyknuts to amass new fortunes for him. And of course they help him overcome the dark lord, the tall thin one, the slim shady.
