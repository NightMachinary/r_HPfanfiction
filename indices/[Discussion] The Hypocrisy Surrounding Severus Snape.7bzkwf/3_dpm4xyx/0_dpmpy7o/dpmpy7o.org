  I don't think that people think the Snape is a better person than James is (after they grown up). He is just more interesting.

Think again. I mean, yes, there's a lot of people like you and me who like Snape for being flawed. But there's a surprising amount of fics obviously pushing a Snape/Lily pairing where James always remained a jerk who just married Lily because she was pretty, and, had he lived, /would/ have spoiled Harry into a more athletic, wizardly verison of Dudley.
