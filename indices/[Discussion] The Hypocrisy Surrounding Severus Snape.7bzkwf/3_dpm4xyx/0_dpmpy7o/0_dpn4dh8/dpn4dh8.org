Imo there is a difference between your real opinion and what you put into your fic. I think many times people simply don't care about James. To reach Snape/Lily, you need to deal with him and bash is the simplest solution.

For example WBWL stories often have Lily/James portrayed as a terrible parents to Harry. Do people who write it think Lily would be a terrible mother? No, they just want to get Harry into specific situation and bashing James/Lily is the easiest way.
