i mean, to be sure, i also push a snape/lily pairing. the same things that make snape more interesting than james are what also make snape/lily more interesting than james/lily. this is sort of the thing that's amusing with these types of discussions: i don't care about james. he's a non-entity. it wouldn't bother me if he died of dragon pox a week into 5th year, so that we can focus more on other dynamics. his rivalry with snape isn't as compelling as snape's with sirius, or lupin.
