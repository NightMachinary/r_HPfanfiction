I think there is a difference between liking the character and well, how to say it.. 'wanting to spend the life with the character'.

I like Snape because of the problems mentioned by you. He is complicated, flawed, there is mystery about him, it is not easy around him.. I like to read about this character..

I think it is normal. Everybody loves Dr.House, but would you want to work/live with him?

I don't think that people think the Snape is a better person than James is (after they grown up). He is just more interesting.
