I've never understood this, either. What I've come to recognize with James is that he changed, for the better. The James we saw in the flashbacks is definitely not the same man Lily married. Just because the full depth of character development wasn't shown in the books doesn't mean it wasn't there.

Yeah, he was an arrogant ass in his earlier years, but he grew up. He had to in order for Lily to pay him any attention. I believe James Potter had the capacity to become a good man, and made the effort to become one.

Snape, however, did not grow up to become someone Lily wanted anything to do with. He got increasingly deep into the dark arts, and tied himself in the same group of people who would've like to see Lily dead and then expected her to be okay with that.

I get that Snape is a complex character, and I will advocate for how great THAT fact is, but being complex does not make him admirable, or even good. The man had one redeeming quality, if you can call it that, and that singularly drove him. He cared about no one else but Lily. Snape would've been happy to see James Potter and his son dead if Lily were alive. That's part of where we see a huge difference. Snape would never have gone out of his way to save James Potter's life, but James risked a whole lot to save both Snape and a friend. Snape loved Lily, and no one else.

He emotionally abused a LOT of children, and that, to me, has no excuse. This is also where he and James separate. I can't believe he would've ever gone to the lengths Snape did in order to make life miserable for a select group of kids. His behavior towards most Gryffindor kids makes it impossible for me to respect him much. I can't believe that he's truly a good man. I think he's a complicated person with one obsession that drove most of his actions: Lily. But if he truly loved her, would he not have stopped trying to make her son's life hell, or at least tried to get to know him before automatically assuming that he's just like his father? Because if he stopped and truly looked, I think Snape would've found that there is a lot more of Lily in Harry than James.
