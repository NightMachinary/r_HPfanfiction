linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro) - the early chapters are the best ones, in my opinion. The teacher-era chapters tend to be more Snape-apologist in tone, though still plausible if you assume that Snape's POV is as biased as Harry's was in canon. Very recommended, regardless.
