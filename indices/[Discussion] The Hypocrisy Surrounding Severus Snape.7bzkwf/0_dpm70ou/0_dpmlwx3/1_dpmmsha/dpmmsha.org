I've never read it and I'm not really interested in reading canon rehashes, particularly one's about Snape but in my opinion, as far as fanfic goes, people can write whatever they want. I've read and enjoyed fics where James is Literally The Worst Person Ever, No Really and Snape is the Bestest Guy Ever but that doesn't make it canon.

It says it's canon-compatible in the description but without having read it, I can't really comment. By 'dark mirror' do you mean it's there to make Snape more sympathetic and everyone else worse, or is it there to show Snape as the bad guy? Either way (and if that is even what it does), Snape is more complex than that, he's not evil and while he did good things, he's not a good person. But without having read it, it's hard to say anything on it.
