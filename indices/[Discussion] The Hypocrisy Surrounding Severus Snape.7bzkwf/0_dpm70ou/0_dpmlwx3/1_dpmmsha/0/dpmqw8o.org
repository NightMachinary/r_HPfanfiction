It shows things from Snape's point of view and keeps him extremely complex. It compliments canon rather than rehashing it. You get to see the thoughts in Snape's head in pivotal scenes, and it does change your perception.

He isn't noble. He's awfully broken. Bitter, petty, brave. This story makes him human and believable and fleshes out a plausible backstory for everything we observe in the books. It isn't good!Snape or evil!Snape it's more 'what was Snape thinking when...?' or 'why would Snape...?'
