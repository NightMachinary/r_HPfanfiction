What do you think of A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles? Fanfic that rehashes canon from Snape's POV, with some backstory in the early chapters. It offers a dark mirror to just about every scene that Snape is in.

linkffn (A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro) for those who haven't read it and like reading Snape. You can skip ahead from the childhood stuff and still follow it.
