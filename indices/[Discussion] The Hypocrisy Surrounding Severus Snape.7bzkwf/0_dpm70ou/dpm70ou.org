As someone who prefers James over Snape, I think the reasons mainly boil down to substance and fanon. James basically doesn't exist in the books, he appears in a couple scenes where his character is wildly different but we don't get any explanation for how or why that happened. Whereas with Snape it's the complete opposite, he's right up there with Dumbledore and Voldemort as main characters after Harry, Ron and Hermione, and his motivations for why he is the way he is is probably one of the most compelling storylines in the books. He's just a more compelling character, which was always going to be the case because he's actually alive, is in all the books and can actually have an active storyline. You can like Snape for the character and prefer him over James without actually liking the person he is solely because he's far more compelling and interesting.

As for people actively liking Snape as a person more than James, well it's easy to pin the blame on James for Snape's life turning out the way it is (which I think is complete horseshit but whatever), especially when you have the result right in front of you and James got the girl so clearly he got the happy ending (despite y'know being murdered when he was 21). This is especially the case when really the only scenes we have of James that aren't to do with Harry, he's usually being a jackass to Snape. Someone mentioned in a different comment about Hagrid being a unreliable narrator but you have to admit Snape is one too when it comes to James. I'm not saying those things didn't happen, because they obviously did, but we're only ever going to see one side of James from Snape.

Fanon does have a large role to play too though, lots of people like to write redemptive Snape fics and even more like to read them. Hell, I've read a fair few myself and I'm barely interested in Snape as a character. And when the fandom has been around and still active for as long as this one has, it does become really difficult to separate canon from fanon, there's a reason there's basically a weekly thread on here about things you didn't realise were fanon. The entire reason I even have any opinions on James past the very bare bones that the books give us is because I spend a lot of time reading character introspection pieces. I have ideas and thoughts built up in my head about James that I think the books support about why he did the things he did as a teenager and how he changed afterwards, so people who think Snape is a paragon of virtue probably have the same and when it's so ingrained, and you can see support for it in some way in the books, it's difficult to let go of the ideas as not actually being canon.
