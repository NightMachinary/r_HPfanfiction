Completely glossing over the abuse we actively see Harry go through in the first chapters of each book, he lost his parents at an incredibly young age, watched his godfather die, and had to deal with the death of another father figure, Remus. That's tragic. Neville's parents were tortured and he was mistreated by family just because he might not have magic. That's tragic. Draco, whether he would have on his own or not, was told he would take the Mark and kill Dumbledore or his mother would die. That's tragic.

Those are just examples i can think of off the top of my head. There are probably more. There are plenty of tragic characters.
