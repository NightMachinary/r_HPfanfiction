That's basically what I said. "James outgrew it, Snape not really." Right there in the post you responded to. However, Snape was always good at heart, for all the despicable things that he did out of spite, pettiness and depression. He betrayed Voldemort, risking his life every day (except for the 1981-1994 respite) to help the side of good win in the end. And "completely destroying any confidence they might be building up" might be going a bit too far, too --- the only one in this situation, I believe, was Neville, who was already very insecure. It doesn't excuse Snape's behavior, but, especially considering the general weirdness of the wizarding world (and Hogwarts in particular), I don't think he reached new heights of cruelty --- he was just a mean teacher.
