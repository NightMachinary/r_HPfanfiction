Both views of his character are viable, in my opinion. Mine is that he was a spy because it was the Right Thing, not just because of Lily. That doesn't mean he gave a /personal/ damn about James and Harry, because of his aforementioned issue with grudges and letting his emotions get the best of him. But he considered Voldemort and the Death Eaters to be in the wrong and sincerely wanted to restore peace. This is what I'm talking about --- the whole spying for the Light thing --- when I say his heart was in the right place.
