It literally takes Dumbledore pointing out that he doesn't give a shit about James and Harry for him to go, "Them too, I suppose."

I don't consider him evil either, but he's still cruel, and yes, sadistic to a degree. He's smiled more than once in the book after he does something cruel.

There is really no evidence for this whatsoever if you exclude what he did for Lily. He saved Harry from Quirrell's curse, and I think that's really it. And even that can be attributed to his love for Lily, which didn't even extend far enough to not treat Harry terribly.
