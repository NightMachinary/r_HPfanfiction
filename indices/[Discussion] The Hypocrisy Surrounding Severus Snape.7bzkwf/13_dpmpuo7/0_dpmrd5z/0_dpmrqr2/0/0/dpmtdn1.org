  No, he wasn't. He betrayed Voldemort purely because he loved Lily. That was it. He didn't give a shit about James or baby Harry dying.

Well, that's a debatable point. That he betrayed Voldemort only for Lily's memory and nothing else is /possible/, but I and many people rather think it was more of a traumatic /catalyzer/ for him to finally stop ignoring what his conscience had been screaming at him all along. Unlike someone like Riddle or Bellatrix, I see Snape not as an innately sadistic maniac with no conscience, but as a flawed but ultimately not evil man --- a pitiable, weary man whose heart was in the right place, but who much, much too often let his negative emotions get the better of him, occasionally silencing his moral side to frightening extents.

  He didn't say cruel things to Hermione out of spite --- he didn't even know her father

I didn't mean spite against the people he bullied in particular. More of a "hates the world and everyone in it because of how terrible his life has been" type of thing.
