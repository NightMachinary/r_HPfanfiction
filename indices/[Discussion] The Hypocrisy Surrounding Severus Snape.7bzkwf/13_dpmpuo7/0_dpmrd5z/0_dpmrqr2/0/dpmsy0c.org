No you didn't. You said the exact opposite, that they started off as good people but had the potential to become assholes:

  Snape and Potter were good people with the potential to be incredibly obnoxious and bullylike if given the chance.

  Snape was always good at heart
#+end_quote

No, he wasn't. He betrayed Voldemort purely because he loved Lily. That was it. He didn't give a shit about James or baby Harry dying. He was completely fine with everyone else dying, but when it came to Lily, he decided it was bad. He's a piece of shit who bullies /children./ You can not tell me a 30+ year old man who bullies 11 year old children is good at heart. He was willing to kill Neville's toad. He was willing to give two innocent people to the dementors, when he knew there was more to the story, as he was listening in to the conversation in the Shrieking Shack. He thought Harry would have been well-served if he was killed.

  "completely destroying any confidence they might be building up" might be going a bit too far, too --- the only one in this situation, I believe, was Neville, who was already very insecure.
#+end_quote

I said confidence he was building up, meaning that he was just crushing any chance Neville had of gaining confidence. You're can't tell me I'm going overboard when Neville's worst fear was literally Snape.

  I don't think he reached new heights of cruelty
#+end_quote

New heights? Perhaps not, but he was still incredibly cruel. If Hermione hadn't been able to shrink her teeth to normal size, her self-esteem would have been seriously fucked because of him. He didn't say cruel things to Hermione out of spite --- he didn't even know her father --- he did it just because he felt like it.
