Snape, a good person?

They were both incredibly obnoxious and bully-like from the beginning, both with the potential to become good people. James did become a good person. Snape became a complete piece of shit. You can compare the two during their school times, but after, they're completely different people. I really don't see James bullying a bunch of children to the point of tears, to the point of completely destroying any confidence they might be building up.
