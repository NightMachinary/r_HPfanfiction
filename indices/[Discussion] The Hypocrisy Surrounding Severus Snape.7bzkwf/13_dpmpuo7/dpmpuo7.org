Honestly, I think both Snape and Potter were good people with the potential to be incredibly obnoxious and bullylike if given the chance. James outgrew it, Snape not really (though he redeemed himself in other way). I suppose I'd feel more affinity with Snape as a person in real life, but on paper I don't find one "better" or "worse" than the other.
