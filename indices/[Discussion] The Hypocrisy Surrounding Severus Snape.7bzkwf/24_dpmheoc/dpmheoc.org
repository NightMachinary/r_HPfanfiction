What I would like to know, since we're here talking about Snape, is why he's portrayed as being an unpopular teacher.

I mean I can see that Harry would hate him and Neville is scared of him but none of the other students seem to like him either and in my experience that's really weird.

In my high school the most popular teacher was categorically awful to every student in his class. He called us reprobates and monkeys and wastes of oxygen. He gave enormous amounts of homework and never let us have any fun and once threw his lunch at a student. And we /adored/ him. We used to have like this little weird competition regarding who got the best insult every week.

And from what I've read that's not at all uncommon.

So I just find the fact that it seems that he's universally disliked very odd.

Also the fact that nobody in canon ever picks up on how fucking funny the man is just breaks my heart.
