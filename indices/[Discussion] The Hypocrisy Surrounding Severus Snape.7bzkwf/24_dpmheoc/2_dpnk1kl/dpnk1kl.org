See I have a feeling your favourite teacher didn't try to poison your dog to "encourage" you to work harder.

Or, while watching other students beating you up so you have bruises, said he saw no difference from your normal appearance.

Or loudly told a new teacher that YOU specifically out of the entire class are stupid and to watch out for you.

Or went on a rant about how awful and arrogant your dead father was and how you resemble him.
