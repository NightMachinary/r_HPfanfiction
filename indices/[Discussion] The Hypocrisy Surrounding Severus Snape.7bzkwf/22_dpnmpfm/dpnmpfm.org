  So what I want to end with it is, how do people hold Severus Snape to be a misunderstood paragon of virtue while seeing James Potter as the devil incarnate?

I see book-Snape as a rabid dog. James Potter was merely abusive toward him. Neither hold any interest to me.

Movie-Snape was much more compelling. I could write a lot about him.
