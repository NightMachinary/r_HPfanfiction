Yeah, as a big ol' Snape stan, I find that people who like him tend to break down into two parties (or two ends of a spectrum): people who want to forgive and excuse and handwave all his fuckery, and people who are interested in him /precisely because/ of all his fuckery. I fall very solidly in the latter. I tend to like Bad Dudes who Do The Right Thing (On Occassion) across most media and that breakdown occurs there, too. (See also: Spike from Buffy.)
