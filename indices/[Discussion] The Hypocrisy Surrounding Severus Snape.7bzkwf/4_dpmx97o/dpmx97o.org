Snape is my favorite forever, and I am 100% not here to make excuses for him. As an adult he is a bully, an abusive asshole who can't let go of a grudge for /literal decades/, and a conniving secretive piece of shit who won't tell an unpleasant truth to save his soul. As a child he was selfish, vengeful, careless with the feelings of others and uncaring for the worldview of others even while demanding that level of understanding from them. His (complex, imho) feelings for Lily excuse nothing; in fact, they damn him more. He was shown a deep and personal caring and still fell for the Dark Arts thinking he could maintain a friendship with her while surrounding himself with people who wanted her dead.

He's not misunderstood in the least. He doesn't have a "good heart." He has a complicated one. He's a mirror for many deeply human darker impulses.

By comparison, James is simple; he is a pampered pureblood prince who was brought up confident and loved and became a bully in school but straightened out later on in life. Some of which is conjecture, which is half the problem. James is just as much of a cipher as Lily is; when you say that Snape only loved the "idea" of Lily, I have to think it's because all we really have is his idea of her. There's just so little to go on: the letter Harry finds in Grimmauld place, Snape's memories, and her final words to Voldemort. That's it. And there's even less of James.

At the end of the day, people love rooting for an underdog and I'm no exception. Snape grew up treated poorly at home and at school, made messy mistakes that cost him and others much, but grew into a powerful wizard who could go toe to toe with Voldemort, whom Dumbledore trusted above all else. Rooting for him, wanting to dig into his personality and his desires and his neuroses is entirely understandable.

As a character in a novel, Snape is fully realized, complex, and robust; James is a flimsy slip of memory and little else. There's just no competition in my mind who I'm more interested in.
