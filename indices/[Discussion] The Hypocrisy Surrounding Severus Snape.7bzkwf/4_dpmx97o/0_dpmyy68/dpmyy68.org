Actually, one of the things I love about The Prince's Tale is that we get glimpses of young Lily being angry or impatient with Snape. I'm glad he doesn't (or doesn't have time to) pick and choose which memories to show Harry, because we get to see Lily being sharp with him and taking him down a peg. It makes their friendship more interesting and adds a small fierce detail to her otherwise saintly character. It also leads me to wonder about her attraction to assholes, which is a fair description of both James and Severus as students, although James is obviously much more the husband/father type. (Frankly, the idea of Snape as a father breaks my brain a little.)
