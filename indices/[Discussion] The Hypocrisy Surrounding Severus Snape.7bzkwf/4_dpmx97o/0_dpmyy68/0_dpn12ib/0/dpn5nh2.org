Yeah, Lily is not a pushover. In fact, every glimpse we have of Severus and Lily together inclines me to think she's the dominant personality in that friendship. Severus knows more about the wizarding world, sure, but he's also besotted, and desperate not to lose her goodwill. He's always upset or bewildered when she gets mad at him (which adds to my sense that he doesn't understand what's wrong with his behavior, not because he's a sociopath but because he really was that deprived as a child). After several years at Hogwarts, he ought to know better, but of course by then he's surrounded himself with Slytherins who reinforce his childhood bigotry.

Lily should be written with some fire and definite confidence. During SWM, the way she stands up to the Marauders makes it clear she's quite comfortable in her social standing. She's not rich or a bully, but otherwise she's far more like James than Severus: popular, good-looking, comparatively affluent, much loved by her parents, and the teachers' favorite. She's also supposed to be kind, although we don't get to see that in action. She's far more secure in herself than Severus, and the world rewards her accordingly until fate (and Severus' self-absorbed awfulness) intervene.
