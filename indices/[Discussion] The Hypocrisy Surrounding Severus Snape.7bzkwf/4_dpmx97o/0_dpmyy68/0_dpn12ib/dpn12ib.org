Totally! It's a real relationship. I hate hate hate hate hate when fic makes Lily stupid or weak or unwilling to challenge Snape on things. It's /straight up canon/ that she was more than willing to tell him he was wrong to his face on multiple occasions. There are so many versions of Lily out there who are just weak milquetoast vessels for a struggle!Snape to put his Sad Boy(tm) longing into. It's gross gross gross.
