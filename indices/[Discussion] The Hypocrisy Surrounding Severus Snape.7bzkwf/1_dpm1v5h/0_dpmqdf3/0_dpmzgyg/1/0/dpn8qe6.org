Uh...I didn't say anything about Snape being at Godric's Hollow? In any case, I don't think that's how shock and memory work. He didn't have to be there. His worst nightmare had come true.

Years ago, a friend of mine died in hospital. I knew he was gravely ill. I knew he was probably dying. I arrived for my visit, and the nurse told me he'd passed away that morning. I stood there for a moment, trying to accept it, and the next thing I knew the nurse was dragging me to a chair because I'd fainted. I wasn't in love with my friend. I even knew his death was inevitable. My friend wasn't murdered, the way Lily was. But having the news broken to me secondhand made no difference to the impact. Believe me, gravitas has nothing to do with it. In canon, we see Snape howling with grief in Dumbledore's office, wanting to die.

I'm pretty sure Lily's death was the worst moment of Severus Snape's life.
