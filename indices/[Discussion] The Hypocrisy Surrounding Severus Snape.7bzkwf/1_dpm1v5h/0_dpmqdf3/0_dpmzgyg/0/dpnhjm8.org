  (Small gripe here, but somehow I can't believe that's actually Snape's Worst Memory when compared to the night Lily was killed. I don't see how anything could top that in terms of personal devastation and remorse.)

Maybe he saw the act of calling her a Mudblood as cementing his other bad choices? He probably thinks that if he hadn't called her that, he'd never have lost her and it wouldn't have led to everything that happened afterwards. This is obviously not the case since Lily was becoming tired of his behaviour for a long time, but Snape's not very high on emotional intelligence. And he possibly saw that as the time he lost Lily forever, as opposed to her death.

But in terms of which event utterly destroyed him, I agree. The night in Dumbledore's office should be his worst memory.
