Yeah, they made him comic relief. They also made him noble at the end. Total failure to understand the character, even with JKR sitting right there providing feedback.

Interestingly, Snape in the books never physically threatens or harms a child that I can recall. The one exception I can think of is when he finds Harry with his head down the Pensieve, throws him against the wall, hurls a jar of cockroaches at him, and nearly has an aneurysm.

(Small gripe here, but somehow I can't believe that's actually Snape's Worst Memory when compared to the night Lily was killed. I don't see how anything could top that in terms of personal devastation and remorse.)
