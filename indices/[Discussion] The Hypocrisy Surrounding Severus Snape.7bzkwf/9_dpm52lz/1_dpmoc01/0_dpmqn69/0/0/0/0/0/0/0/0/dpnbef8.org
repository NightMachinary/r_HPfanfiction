  In the Prince's Tale, Snape already theorizes that Lupin's a werewolf.

Ah, that's disappointing, because it makes Snape listening to Sirius even stupider. And it may mean I'm coldhearted, but I still don't blame Snape for searching for ammunition. It wasn't the greatest idea (but then Snape's a teenage boy and socially backwards to boot), since if he'd succeeded, it would only have fueled James and Sirius's hatred even more, and they would have made him suffer for it. (Also, frankly, I think Dumbledore would have done damage control and shut Snape up, which is what he did after the Shrieking Shack.)

And, yeah, I'm pretty sure SWM happens after the "prank." Which is one of the reasons I think James and Sirius are repellent dicks. Sirius almost sent Snape to his death. If James hadn't caught up with him in time, a fifteen-year-old boy would have died horribly, and Lupin would, at the very least, have been sent to Azkaban. Snape was traumatized by his brush with death and then forbidden to speak about what happened to him. And yet James and Sirius are still swanning around, attacking Snape as if it's just a laddish bit of sport. Whatever reason they have to be bitter (detentions? oh horrors!), Sirius brought down on their heads, not Snape. And the way they behave very much implies to me that this is just their MO. They don't need a reason to attack Snape. It's just the way they have fun together.

It's possible Snape's friends joined the feud, but who knows? He's a penniless half-blood swot in Slytherin, and he certainly gives off loner vibes. It's not portrayed as "Gryffindor gang vs. Slytherin gang." It's Marauders vs. Snape. He's the target. After the Shrieking Shack, the fact that they're still tormenting him makes it harder for me to care about James and Sirius later. /shrug
