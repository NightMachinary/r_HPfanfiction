No, that's not true. In the Prince's Tale, Snape already theorizes that Lupin's a werewolf. He specifically references the full moon when talking to Lily. He want's to find proof to out him. If Lupin is outed as a werewolf, he's forced to leave school, any (already nonexistent) career prospects he had are just about gone. It's a life-changing impact.

Also, I've been thinking a lot on what happens in that scene in OoTP. A couple of things, first the whole Shrieking Shack deal happens before. I'm assuming there's a whole deal of bitterness on both sides. Could be why James and Sirius decide to attack him out of the blue. Last, it's 2 on 1 here, but I find it hard to believe that Snape never got together with Mulciber and Avery got back at the two of them. The three of them are somewhat close.
