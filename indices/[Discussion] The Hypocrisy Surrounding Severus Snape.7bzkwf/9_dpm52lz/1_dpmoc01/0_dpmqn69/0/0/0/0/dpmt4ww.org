  snape gave as good as he got

  The only unfair part was that it was 2 on 1

the fact that it was 2 on 1 means snape didn't give as good as he got, unless he's capable of making himself plural. they both hated each other, but we only have it being said that james and sirius 'relentlessly bullied' him, not the other way around. it isn't difficult to believe at all that they initiated the majority of instances, and snape got fed up after a while and tried to get them expelled to leave him alone
