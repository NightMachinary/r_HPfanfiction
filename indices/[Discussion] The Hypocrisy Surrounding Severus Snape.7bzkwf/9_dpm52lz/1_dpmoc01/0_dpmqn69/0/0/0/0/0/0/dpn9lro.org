  That's a minor that you're trying to expose and make his life hell.

Yes? Snape was also a minor, and he didn't know that Lupin was a werewolf, otherwise why would he have crawled into a tunnel to spy on him? Granted, Snape had spotted Lupin as the weak link in the Gryffindor chain and was trying to find out something about him he could use as leverage against the whole gang (which makes it weirdly OOC to me that he'd follow Sirius' - Sirius', ffs! - instructions).

Lupin may not have bullied Snape himself, but as prefect he sat right there and did absolutely nothing to stop his friends from tormenting Snape. Of course, he didn't want to lose Sirius and James's friendship, but that's not a virtuous or harmless kind of passivity. There's a reason people call Lupin spineless.

Re: Snape the vindictive SOB. Yeah, he is. He's like an animal with his back to the wall. From the way he behaves, he's probably a constant target. He's sitting there trying to read, but the moment the Marauders show up, he clearly expects to be attacked. He's sitting under a tree with a book, and they go after him. I'd say the Marauders are vindictive SOBs as well.
