We don't have that either. In that single scene in OoTP, Snape also hexed James when his back was turned. Snapes a vindictive son of a bitch. From what we know about him, it's not out of the realm to suggest that he initiated other encounters.

He's also trying to "out" Lupin. Which horrible because A)Lupin isn't the guy to bully anyone and B) That's a minor that you're trying to expose and make his life hell.
