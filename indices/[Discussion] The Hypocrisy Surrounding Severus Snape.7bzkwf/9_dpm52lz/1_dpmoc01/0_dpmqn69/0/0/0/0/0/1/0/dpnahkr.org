We don't have it being said that James and Sirius relentlessly bully him. To me, the authoritative work on the relationship between Lily, the Marauders, and Snape, is the Prince's Tale.

They have an antagonistic relationship, but Snape complains about everything under the sun to Lily. They talk about Snape's unsavory friends, Lupin the werewolf, and how Snape doesn't like how everyone else likes the Marauders. Not once is it mentioned about how James and Sirius relentlessly bully him.

The only scene we have is in OoTP. One thing to keep in mind. This occurs after James saves Snape's life in the Shrieking Shack scene. There's a whole deal of bitterness on both sides, so I think there's more to the action then, "it just that he exists."
