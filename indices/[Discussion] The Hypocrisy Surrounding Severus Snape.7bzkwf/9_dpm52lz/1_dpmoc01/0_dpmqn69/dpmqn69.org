right. so saying there's no proof that james was obsessed with lily for years doesn't mean that he wasn't. it just means that we don't know anything about him. we know sirius says he ~always made a fool of himself around lily, and that *jkr says it was a part of the reason he harassed snape in general*. meaning it's entirely possible it was for years. your claim that he thought girls were icky is...baseless.

lily explicitly called him a bully, not just arrogant.

also, you're ignoring the first part of the conversation where james insults slytherin after hearing lily and snape talking about it. snape insulted gryffindor back- i don't see why james throwing in the bit about his father should change snape's response
