Right. So James actually doesn't obsess with Lily immediately. For him at 11, girls are icky. We're not sure when James starts asking Lily out, but it's between fourth and fifth year. We also know that Lily never sees James as bad or evil. Her exact words, are "Arrogant toerag"

James starts hating Snape because Snape makes fun of James's dad. James remarks that he wants to go into Gryffindor, like his father. Snape insults him for that. It starts there and spirals off into what it is in fifth year. I imagine that the entire incident really shook James up and he started maturing around then.
