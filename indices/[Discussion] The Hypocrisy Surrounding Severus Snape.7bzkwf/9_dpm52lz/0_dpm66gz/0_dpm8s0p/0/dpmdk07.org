I think the scene you're thinking of there is the scene where Harry talks to Remus and Sirius through Umbridge's fireplace and I'm pretty certain all they really say is that Lily didn't actually hate James and that they got together in seventh year.

Also, I'm really not sure what point you're trying to make with your second paragraph because James literally never does any of that stuff in canon. He never hurts his friends, the only child we ever see him interact with us Harry and he definitely doesn't hurt him and we never see him interact with an animal so I don't know where you've got any of that from. The only threatening behaviour is towards Snape and potentially him saying he'd leave Snape alone if Lily goes out with him, which reads more like a stupid teenage boys saying stupid things in a stupid attempt to get the girl he likes to go out with him. As for the behaviour towards Snape, I'm not trying to defend it, he was a massive asshole but does bullying one kid who is involved with all the stuff he hates make him an abuser? I don't think it does. He was a massive ass to kid he didn't like. Every teenager is like that. That doesn't make it right but it isn't precursor to becoming an abuser.

A character who was hurtful to friends, children and pets though was Snape, which we clearly saw multiple times throughout the books so.
