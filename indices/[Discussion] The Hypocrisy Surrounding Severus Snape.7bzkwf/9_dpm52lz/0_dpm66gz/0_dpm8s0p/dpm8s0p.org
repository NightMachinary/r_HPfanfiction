Crud, I'll look through the books a little more when I get home, but I could have sworn someone like Remus or Sirius had said something to that effect. Even the Wiki says that "James spent much of his academic career chasing after Lily Evans".

Even if it only was the last couple years of school, threatening to hurt, or actually hurting, your friends, kids, or pets is a pretty classic creepy move of abusers. It's for sure not healthy behavior.
