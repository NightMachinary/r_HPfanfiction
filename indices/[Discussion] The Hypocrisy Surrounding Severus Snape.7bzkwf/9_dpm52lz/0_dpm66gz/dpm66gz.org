Unless I'm misremembering I think the idea of James being obsessed with Lily from the get go and liking her for their entire time at Hogwarts is largely a fanon thing. From what we see of their interactions during their Hogwarts years, we only have two scenes, the one where they first meet on the train and James is a brat to both Lily and Snape and then the Snape's Worst Memory scene where he asks her out and while he's annoyed/embarrassed over her rejection, he doesn't act like a stalker.

We do have another scene in Deathly Hallows from Snape's memories where Snape tells Lily that James fancies her, which happens just after Sirius sends him down the tunnel which I think would also put that scene in fifth year. So we have pretty much no proof that James fancied Lily before fifth year, and we don't have a scene of him asking her out other than the one. This idea of James basically hounding her for their entire time at Hogwarts is completely fanon.
