IRL, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't want to be friends with either of them. As a youngster I wasn't that cute and I have a sneaking suspicion that James would have bullied /me/ had I been around Hogwarts during those years. Mean, handsome, popular guys just kind of set off alarm bells in my brain like that.

I could write pages and pages about the why of Snape and the why of James, but ultimately I don't think they're mutually exclusive. You can hate both or like both. I like them both as characters that I read about, but I like Snape more because he has a redemption arc. He obviously feels really really bad about the shit that he's done, and that's just more interesting to me.

James is just kind of a flatline as far as his story arc. He supposedly gets better as he gets older, but all we really see is that he gets better at relating to people (Lily) that he's liked all along. And does exchanging bullying Hogwarts kids for fighting Death Eaters in the war mean he's changed as a person? Does he ever actually regret being a bully, or does he just move on to more acceptable and deserving targets?

Also you talk about seriously unhealthy obsession. James latched onto the idea of dating Lily and for SIX YEARS, despite her constantly saying no and telling him to leave her alone, he continues to make unwanted advances. He even tries to blackmail her into dating him by saying he'll leave Snape alone if she does. Didn't he pretty much start bullying Snape in the first place because Snape was friends with Lily? Seriously, that's one hell of a lot more stalker-ish than anything Snape does. It just really kinda rubs me the wrong way. I'd never go out with someone who acted like that, red flags all over the place, and I don't really understand Lily's choice to do so.
