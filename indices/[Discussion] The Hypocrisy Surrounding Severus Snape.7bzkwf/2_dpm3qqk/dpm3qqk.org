Yeah I mean, Snape is a huge scumback right? But he's a great character that we know a lot about... Lily or James are barely characters and we know so very little about them that they might just as well be giant dicks and poor Snivellous is a much better person. I don't think it's a very compelling argument, but for people who are barely more than names you can make up any shit you want.
