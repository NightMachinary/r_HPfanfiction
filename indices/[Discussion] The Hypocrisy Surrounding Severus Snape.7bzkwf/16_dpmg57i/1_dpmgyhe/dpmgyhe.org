Ok! I'm going go give my rebuttals from the bottom up.

-Snape grows up with a wizarding mother. He knows about the world and it's prejudices. He and Lily have a conversation about it in the flashback.

-I'm not so sure his obsession with Lily is love. At least not in the end. Thirty years later, that love has probably warped. Also let's say Voldie kills Harry and James, and spares Lily, the way Snape wanted. We can safely say Lily wouldn't have been happy. People who love someone else generally wamt the best foe them. Snape has a possessive, selfish, obsession.

-Lupin's a stupid man who makes stupid decisions to be sure. But snape doesn't out him because he's thinking about the kids. No, he outs him because he lost his Order of Merlin 2nd class. In the shack, Harry&co are begging him to look past his prejudices and listen. But, he doesn't. Imagine how things could have changed if he took a second to just listen. He would have tied up Pettigrew, saved Sirius, and made Lupin stay in the shack.

-But what gets me, is how even when Snape turns spy, he tells Voldy to go ahead, kill James and Harry, but leave Lily. In a similar situation James risks his life to save Snape's.

I get that he's a deeper and far more interesting character. I even think so myself. But I don't think he was a better person.
