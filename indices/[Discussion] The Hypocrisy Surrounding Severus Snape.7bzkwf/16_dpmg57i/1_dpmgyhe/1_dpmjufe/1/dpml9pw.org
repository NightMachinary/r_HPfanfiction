You're basing a lot of your argument on what you believe to be true, but what we don't actually have any evidence for at all.

Why would you think Snape knows about those things but not everything else?? Yeah, sure as an 11 year old he's probably not going to be reading the paper every day but he's not completely cut off from the wizarding world and everything that's happening in it. He shows disdain for people who aren't magical before they even go to Hogwarts through his interactions with Petunia, and while this is probably from a negative association through his father, it doesn't take long to figure this shit out once you're in school. I don't think Snape wanting Lily to be in Slytherin is a bad thing, he wanted to be with his friend, but I find it doubtful he would have been completely ignorant of all the things you're saying he is.

I'm not going to get into the love stuff or the Remus stuff because you can read the love stuff how you want and if you don't like Remus then that is completely your opinion, but just because in your opinion Remus is a bad person doesn't mean Snape wasn't spiteful in his actions. He wasn't acting out of some protective instinct, it was spite because of his history with Remus, his anger that Sirius had gotten away and that he'd lost his Order of Merlin and made to look a fool. Just because you think Remus deserved it, doesn't mean Snape wasn't acting from a negative place. Just because one character is 'bad' doesn't mean the other is 'good'.

Before Lily is killed, we have nothing from Snape that even implies that he was vaguely interested in saving Harry. His conversation with Dumbledore on the hill when he first goes to him directly implies the opposite, since when Dumbledore straight up asks about Harry and James, Snape doesn't say a single thing. And then after Lily is dead, it's again all about her to Snape, he says to Dumbledore 'I thought you were going to keep her safe', not 'them' not 'her and her son'. He doesn't give a shit. He never has the realisation that Lily would rather die than lose Harry, he only makes the decision to protect him after Dumbledore suggests it to him once Lily is dead.

And what you're saying about James only saving Snape because of Remus and Sirius has no basis. I mean, yeah I definitely believe that he was also worried about what would have happened to his friends but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that he did not give a single shit about whether or not Snape would have died. James was a dick, but he wasn't evil.
