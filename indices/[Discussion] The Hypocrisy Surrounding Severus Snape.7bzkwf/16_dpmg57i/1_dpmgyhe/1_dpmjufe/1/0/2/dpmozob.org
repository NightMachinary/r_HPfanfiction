You're seriously underestimating kids if you think they have little to no grasp of these kind of things at that age. I'm not saying he's going to have a deeply nuanced and thoroughly researched opinion on the topic, but children are aware of these things and the quotes OP provided in their reply to you demonstrates that he knew this stuff too.

In my opinion, it is that he wanted the assurance by going to them both. I looked up what actually happens and here's the exact quote when he goes to Dumbledore to ask for his help:

'"If she means so much to you,' said Dumbledore, "surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?" "I have - I have asked him-"' Snape admits to bartering Harry's life for Lily's. That does not sound like someone who has realised that Lily would rather die. Dumbledore then calls him disgusting and says 'You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?', and Snape replies with 'Hide them all, then. Keep her - them - safe. Please.' It is literally only in this moment that Snape gives a damn about saving anyone other than Lily and it is already after he has decided to go to Dumbledore. Saving Harry because Lily would rather die than lose her son had nothing to do with his decision.
