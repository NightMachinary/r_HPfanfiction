This is conjecture, but Snape's mother comes from an old, and possibly wealthy family. She's a pureblood that married a muggle. Considering the state of his clothes as a kid, it's clear he's not well off. It may be because his mother was dis-owned for marrying a muggle. May be part of the reason he resents muggles the way he does. It's not the people he's dismissive of, but in the Prince's tale, we see he holds a very negative opinion of muggles. An opinion, that is probably popular in the Slytherin common room, and stoked and grown. The fandom loves to use the idea that he was "bullied" into being a death eater, and I just don't think that's true. He wanted to be one.
