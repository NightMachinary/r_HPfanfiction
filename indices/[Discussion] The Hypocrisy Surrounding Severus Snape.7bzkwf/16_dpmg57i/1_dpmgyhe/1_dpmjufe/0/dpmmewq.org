Ok, rebuttal time again! From the top this time,

Some quotes:

1) "Does it make a difference, being Muggle-Born?" Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair. "No," he said, "it doesn't matter."

2)"Haven't been spying," said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. "Wouldn't spy on /you/ anyway," he added spitefully, " *you're" a muggle."

3)"I don't want to talk to you," she said in a constricted voice. "Why not?" "Tuny h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore." "So what?" "So she's my sister!" "She's only a-," he caught himself quickly

4)"My whole family have been in Slytherin," he said. "Bliimey," James said, "and I thought you seemed alright!" Sirius grinned. "Maybe I'll break the tradition. Where are you heading if you've got the choice?" "/Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!/ Like my dad" Snape made a small disparaging noise. James turned on him. "Got a problem with that?" "No," said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise, "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy.."

5)"Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice, "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can even understand why I talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's all your aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who can you?"

6)"We /are/ Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging around with! I'm sorry Sev, but I detest Mulciber! /Mulciber/! What do you see in him Sev? He's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary McDonald the other day?" "That was nothing," said Snape, "It was a laugh, that's all-"

7)"You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. "You do not care, then, the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?" Snape said nothing, merely looked at Dumbledore.

First point. Snape does know about prejudice. Using quotes 1, 2, and 3, he seems to be pretty anti-muggle. Somewhat understandable considering his mother and his father. But he knows about the prejudice and misleads Lily otherwise in 1. Also from 6, the argument can be made, that Snape doesn't much care for muggle-borns unless they're Lily, seeing his rather blase reaction to Mary McDonald.

The reason I'm presenting it as "Snape at 34, etc." is because of this. It's pretty clear Snape is upset about Sirius leaving. It's also reasonable that Dumbledore takes him aside and tells him the full truth. At this point, knowing that Sirius is innocent, Snape gets his revenge the only way he can. "Outing" Remus as a werewolf. Remus was likely to resign anyways. Letting the world know he was a werewolf /was/ petty. Lupin didn't deserve that.

The whole tell Voldemort "spare only Lily" point isn't about what he logically tells Voldemort. It's about the motivation. Quote 7 shows that he genuinely doesn't care that James and Harry die. In my opinion, loving someone, truly, means also wanting the best for them. He has a selfish obsession.

I want to reference quote 4. Actual evidence that Snape started the grudge match. Did James escalate beyond a reasonable level? Yes. But it's clear that Snape didn't much like him to begin with, and ran his mouth when he didn't need to. It's also clear that James doesn't /hate/ Slytherin. He's not a fan, is all. Anything done to Snape after probably results from the fact that James feels Snape is insulting his father, a man James might idolize. There's also reasonable chance that Snape is insulting James precisely for that reason. He's bitter that James has a father he can look up to and strive to be like, while he has an abusive, drunk, layabout.

Lastly, quotes 5 and 6. Snape knew his way around a wand, and held some pretty nasty grudges against the Muggle world. It's clear that he /wanted/ to be a Death Eater, until they targeted Lily. He's hanging around some nasty people while still being friends with Lily.

I understand the dynamic. James, rich, only child, and adored, feels closer to Draco Malfoy then he does, Harry. Snape, the ratty clothes, and the horribly family, feels much like Harry does in Book 1. It makes it easier to empathize with him. But, for me, I see James as a better person than Snape, when he died. I do think that Snape matures as well growing up, and lets go of many grudges around the end of Goblet of Fire. I think that's about it for me when it comes to debating this.
