I never said any of those things, you were replying to OP and I added in my two cents. You said that it was one conversation between them and that he could have told her another time, that doesn't sound like you're trying to make a point that you can't say something didn't happen because we didn't see it, it sounds like you're saying it did so sorry if I misinterpreted what you said.

The context there is different though. Homosexuality is never once brought up in the books or talked about in anyway. Should I assume every character is homophobic because of that? No because that would be ridiculous. Lily and Snape directly talk about these things though, she even directly asks him. Even if you do interpret it the same way you do (which I don't think everyone does), he doesn't make any suggestion that some people might think so.I'm not trying to argue that he misled her by not telling her anything, I was just pointing out that just saying this could have happened isn't reasoning that stands up.
