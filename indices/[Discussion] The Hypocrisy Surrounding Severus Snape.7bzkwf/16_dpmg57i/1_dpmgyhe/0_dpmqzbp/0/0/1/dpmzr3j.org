What does having turned spy have to do with anything?? His motivations still stand, he would trade James's and Harry's life for Lily's without any thought to Lily's opinion on that.

Lily's question wasn't, "does it make a difference to /you/ Sev," it was "does it make a difference" He didn't tell her then, and he wanted her in Slytherin later, which would be absolutely horrible for her. Even if Muggleborn students exist in Slytherin, I doubt their life is very easy. His desire to have her in a house, that he knows would be awful for her is possessive and selfish.

I'm not going to lie, your counter arguments are all conjecture without a single actual fact to back it up. Feel free to rebut my arguments point by point, I'll listen and respond.
