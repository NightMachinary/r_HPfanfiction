  Oh, and the running off from his pregnant girlfriend.

I've seen a couple people mention that and I haven't read the books in a long time so maybe I'm missing something obvious, but:

If he believed Harry's mission was critical to winning the war, it makes sense to go with them. As smart as Hermione is, Harry is brave? and Ron is... something (I don't recall what he brought to the table), Lupin is a fully trained and experienced wizard and fighter which would be very useful.

Plus, if what they are doing is so inportant, I don't see why he should entrust his, his girlfriend's, his future child's and the magical wolrd's in general future to three barely-adult not-fully-trained (and maybe excluding Hermione I'm not sure how competent) wizards.

Tonks would've had support from other members of the Order, or her mother and, in the end, is not as important as winning the war.
