He... what? What do you think happened? Harry was alone with Hermione and Ron. Remus was busy with Potterwatch. Oh and I was wrong, he married before the pregnancy, not because of it. He's actually worse than I thought.

In the books, his wife Tonks got pregnant and, he got scared and ashamed and fled. Then crawled back shame-faced, and asked Harry to be the godfather. There was no mission, he just refused to have anything to do with the woman.

Quote from wiki: '"I --- I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgement and have regretted it very much ever since... Don't you understand what I've done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I've made her an outcast!"'
