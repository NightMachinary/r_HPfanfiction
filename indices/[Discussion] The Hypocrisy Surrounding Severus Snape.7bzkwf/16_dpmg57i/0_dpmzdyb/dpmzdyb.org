  Okay, so this is my favorite part. At the beginning of the year we find out that Snape distrusts Lupin, duh, and thinks that Lupin is either protecting or is working together with Black. He is fucking right. Only with one correction that Lupin was protecting not Sirius but himself. Ok, so mass murdering psychopath just broke out of prison to kill Harry Potter. You know, the son of his closest friends. So what does our hero do? Maybe he warns Dumbledore or literally anybody else that Sirius is an unregistered animagus and thus is able to get into the castle undetected? Maybe he warns anybody about 100 secret passages that he and Sirius and few else are privy to? Maybe he at least gives the confiscated Marauders map to Dumbledore? He doesn't. He does neither of those things even after the castle-wide security alert during which Black personally got into the Gryffindor common room. To presumably kill Harry Potter. Remember, 13-year-old boy and son of his closest friends? Seriously what the fuck? And that's not even the end of it. At the end of the year Lupin, the werewolf, who lived his whole life with the curse, who was entrusted with the life of schoolchildren, who was offered a job Dumbledore, in all honesty, should not have offered him doesn't take his potion. He doesn't take his potion while in a school full of children. For this alone he should be put to prison, not just sacked from his position in a school. A position that obligates him to protect the lives of children in his care. I despise Lupin more than most other characters in the book and there's probably a reason why non of Harry's children were named Remus. It baffles my mind that you use this as an argument of Snape's pettiness.

Preach it! I dislike Lupin so very much for that and for basically ignoring Harry and treating him like a stranger until he has to be best buds because Sirius is there. Oh, and the running off from his pregnant girlfriend. Remus is just so... avoidant.
