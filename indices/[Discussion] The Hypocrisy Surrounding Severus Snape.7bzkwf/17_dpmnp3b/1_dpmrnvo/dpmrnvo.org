I can't think of any either, but I think it's because he is often just not mentioned or shows up in Snape fics where he is obviously not shown in good light. I believe the main reason is that we don't know very much about him so it's much harder to write the details or praise him when we don't really have much evidence of it other than a few mentions here and there. Its even more difficult when half the information on James comes from a very biased source showing him at his worst.
