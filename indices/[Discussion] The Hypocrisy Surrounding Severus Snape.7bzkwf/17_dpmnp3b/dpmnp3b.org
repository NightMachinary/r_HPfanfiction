Can we just have a bit of James Potter appreciation for a bit too? I can count on the fingers of literally one hand, with spares, the number of fics I've seen where James (while not still alive due to timeline fuckery) is praised as being a good person.

For crissakes the man laid down his life literally so that his wife and child could live for another minute or two.
