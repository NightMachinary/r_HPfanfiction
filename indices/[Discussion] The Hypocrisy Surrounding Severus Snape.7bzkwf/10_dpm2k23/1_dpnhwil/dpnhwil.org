Snape also basically asked Voldemort to kill a baby (by telling him the prophecy) though and was completely unrepentant about it. Like... I think being a brat is much more easy to empathize with than evil murderous intent towards small children.

Also Snape's unrelenting cruelty to his students especially Neville makes it extremely hard to empathize with him. Like being a bully to your classmates is one thing -- being a bully to children a third of your age, whose families you helped murder, is completely different. To me it indicates a fundamentally vile person.

Like I've met people like James. I have almost certainly never met anyone who got into the depths of evil Snape has plowed through.
