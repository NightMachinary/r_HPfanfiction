I am well aware of everything Snape did. In this respect, it doesn't matter if Snape got one baby killed or a dozen. I understand his motivations, his ambitions, his fears, his struggles, his reason for being the way he is. /That's/ what makes him a humanised character, rather than a character simply filling an assigned role like James Potter. I am not going to like James more simply because he is/was a less vile person. This isn't limited to Snape/James in the least -- I empathise with rapist Merope Gaunt more than I empathise with caricatured mean girl Pansy Parkinson, for the same reason.
