That last thing is so true! Movie Snape is so reserved and calm and I'm like... What ? Who is this character and what has he done with the shouty, cursing, spitting Severus Snape I enjoy?

I mean when you really read the books, Snape tries very very hard to project the /image/ of being all cool and calm, but really the man has zero chill. He has negative chill. He's a twitching, screaming nervous wreck held together with spit and nerve who probably spends about 90% of the time we knowing dancing on the raggedy edge of a complete nervous breakdown.
