That's not how I see him, actually. Yes, I think he's usually got a lot of anger seething just below the surface, and he's clearly a high-strung character. But he is, by nature, mostly a quiet, cold, intense, hostile, defensive presence who's learned how to cow a roomful of students by radiating spite and menace. He's also, after book 4, a spy who has to maintain nerves of steel and mental self-control. He loses his shit about, hm, four times in the books? Which is an expression of the explosive emotion his past stirs up in him, because almost every occasion that we see him foam at the mouth with rage, it has to do with the ghosts of his childhood rising up: Sirius escaping and Dumbledore mocking him, Harry snooping in his Pensieve and seeing his worst memory, Harry calling him a coward after he's just killed Dumbledore. I know I'm forgetting something else.

So I read Snape as a very repressed character, very tightly contained, but one who has a volcanic reaction to certain people and certain triggers. He's serpentine and spidery; he glides and whispers. He doesn't twitch. But when provoked, he basically loses his mind. It's the contrast I love, and the movies cut out all of his dramatic, emotional scenes, which was - well, on par with all the other disappointing things in the movies.
