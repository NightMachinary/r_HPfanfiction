...well, it's pretty easy to summarise why i prefer snape over james. it's the same reason i prefer grindelwald over neville. he's a more compelling character.

(i'm going to edit this periodically/when i feel like it to document my thoughts on why i find him interesting)

...also, i don't like alan rickman's portrayal. it's aggressively boring and dry. canon!snape is passionate and eccentric, distinctly weird and Other.
