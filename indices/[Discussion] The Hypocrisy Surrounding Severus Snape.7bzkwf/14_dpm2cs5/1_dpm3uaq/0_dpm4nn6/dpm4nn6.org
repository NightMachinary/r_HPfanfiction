...reductively summarising his motivations doesn't make him any less compelling? being immoral doesn't make him an uninteresting character. but let's see. he's interesting, and more so to me than james, because of his character, roles in the narrative, and the tropes and possible tropes he fits/you can use with him in canon and fanfiction

he's a tragic character- he's shown to be a victim of both familial and peer abuse, with zero supportive or positive adult figures throughout his childhood and adolescence. the only other character i can think of who had a similar fate was merope- and she raped someone and then died. he's contrasted and compared with harry and riddle- two of the most legendary figures in wizardkind. his reasons for doing bad things and his idiosyncrasies in general are interesting to parse. contrast, james was a dick because he was privileged and entitled. snape is a dick because of his dysfunctional relationships with his father and mother, and to power in general. he's talented and creative. he's dramatic and pretentious, and i find his personality entertaining. he's clannish. i find redemption arcs, specifically /difficult/ redemption arcs, where the character still does damage on their way to redemption, interesting. lily was his catalyst for defection, and his self imposed terms of atonement involved him overhauling his entire general moral framework. i like that his morality is sincere, myopic, and contradictory/hypocritical. i like that he's committed to saving lives while not caring about his own emotional mistreatment of his students. i like the hbp plot, about harry being endeared to and enamored by the prince and his genius only to slowly be disenchanted as he gets gradually more malicious. i like that the narrative involves using the same tools he used to acquire power as a teenager to help others as an adult, and how that's shown when he has to heal draco from an unknowingly cast sectumsempra. his relationships are intense and dysfunctional with consequences on both a personal level and to the world. i'm a goth ally

i'll edit this/add more things as i feel like it
