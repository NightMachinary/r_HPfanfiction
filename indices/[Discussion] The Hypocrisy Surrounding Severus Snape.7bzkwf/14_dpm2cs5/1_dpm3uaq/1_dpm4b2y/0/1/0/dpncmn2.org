Lolita is a famous book about an adult, Humbert, who is sexually obsessed with a small girl and ends up having sex with her. Very few people argue that the main character is a good person, but there is still a ton of analysis and study done on him. Some people here seem to be arguing that Snape shouldn't be considered interesting because he's not a good person, and I wonder if they would make the same argument about Humbert.
