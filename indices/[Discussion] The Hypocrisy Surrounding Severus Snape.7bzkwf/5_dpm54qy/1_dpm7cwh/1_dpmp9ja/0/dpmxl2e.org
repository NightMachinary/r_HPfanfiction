I agree with this so much. I really wish more fics would show him as not knowing how to be good or normal. Its so rare to find fics that actually explore that part of him that is completely emotionally damaged and really messed up. Its annoying how often he just suddenly turns into a caring, romantic or nice person without some serious struggle on his part. This is especially way too common in most of popular time travel, Harry mentor and Snape/Lily fics that he is featured in.
