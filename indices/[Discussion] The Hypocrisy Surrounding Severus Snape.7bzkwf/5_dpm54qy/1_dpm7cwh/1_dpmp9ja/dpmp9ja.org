I don't agree with you that Snape's viewpoint is the only evidence for James's behavior - JKR does a pretty good job of scattering clues about his casual cruelty using Sirius and Remus as mouthpieces - but I do agree that Snape is often written by fandom in ways that strip him of his complexity and turn him into either a woobie or a brave, sardonic, rather ordinary character with a sharp tongue. Snape is irreparably damaged by his past; he may be brave and sardonic, but he's not ordinary. It took him 37 years to finally figure out that other people's lives matter. His own life in canon, to the bitter end, gives him very little reason to stop hating the world (although get him away from Hogwarts and assign him magically interesting work with a chance to shine, and he might have had a fighting chance). He's not moderate, he's not mature, his mistakes will always haunt him, and he really doesn't know how to be a good person. In fanfic, Snape's personality gets cleaned up on the regular much as his appearance does, and it makes him /less/ interesting, IMO.
