I totally forgot about that.

Actually in that conversation with Sirius and Remus (OotP, near the end of chapter 29) they do not in fact straight-up say that. Whether Lily /hated/ him before was never addressed, nor was the bullying called out. They say she started going out with him after he "had deflated his head a bit" and "stopped hexing people just for the fun of it" and for the rest of their activities she remained fairly ignorant of them. So they dance around the topic quite a lot, clearly embarrassed about it.

And yes, it can be read as James being the worst person ever if you approach it with that pre-conceived notion. But it can also be read as him being a minor asshole on a limited scope who grew up and his relation with Snape on a wholly tit-for-tat basis.

The other examples of Lily's reactions to Snape and James, her calling it bullying, stem from the pensieve memory. And that is just not trustworthy enough a source.
