I think what they meant about the memory not being a trustworthy source is less to do with tampering, and more to do with the fact that we are only seeing one incident that frames James in the worst light, with no context to what any of James and Snape's other interactions were like. We're told in other places that Snape gave as good as he got but it isn't reflected in that memory, so it's only showing one piece of their relationship. I mean, I'm pretty sure Lily even says in that memory that they're just as bad as each other.
