  We're told in other places that Snape gave as good as he got but it isn't reflected in that memory

but we're not. sorry, but this is really annoying to me. never, in the entire series, is it stated that snape gave as good as he got. that's pure fanon. remus thought james and sirius were bullies, but was too cowardly to stand up to them

she says james is just as bad as proto-DE snape, not that they were as bad to each other. she straight up says james is bullying him when he did nothing to him
