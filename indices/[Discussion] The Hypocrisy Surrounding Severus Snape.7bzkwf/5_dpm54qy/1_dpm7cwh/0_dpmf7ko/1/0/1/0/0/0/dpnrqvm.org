Dumbledore is one hell of a lot more than just the Hogwarts Headmaster. He's the head of the Wizengamot AND the head of the International Confederation of Wizards AND the defeater of Grindlewald. He definitely has connections that Voldemort doesn't have. Hell, he has the gratitude of several /nations/. And he's a genius in his own right and probably even has some money (given that he has three jobs, has invented and discovered things, and hasn't needed to worry about food, housing or medical care for at least the past fifty years.)

It's not so unbelievable that he could have something that Voldemort doesn't have, or know something that Voldemort doesn't know. Hell, for all it looked ancient, he could have invented it himself. Or it could be a one-of-a-kind family invention, passed down for ages, bequeathed to him from someone who was grateful he defeated Grindlewald or something.
