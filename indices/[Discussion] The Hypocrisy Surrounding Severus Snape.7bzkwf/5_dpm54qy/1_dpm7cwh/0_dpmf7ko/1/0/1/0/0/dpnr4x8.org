I cannot accept that that rare thing is so rare that it was not written about, not spoken about, not referenced anywhere, so rare that the man who obsessed about accumulating rare magical knowledge, who even managed to gather hidden one-of-a-kind items didn't know about it. Yet the Hogwarts headmaster somehow has one and is fairly free with providing access to it.
