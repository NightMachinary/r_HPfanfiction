Oh, cool! I didn't realize there had been a Pottermore on the Pensieve. So are there definitely more pensieves out there, or is the Hogwarts one the only one? If it's the only one and a lost knowledge as far as making more, that would certainly explain how Voldemort found it difficult to get his hands on one.
