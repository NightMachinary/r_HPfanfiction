While I would argue that there is a difference between attempted falsification and faulty memory or skewed understanding, lets keep that to the side. But that means Voldemort is an even greater idiot that we've already known. Snape's Pensieve memory shows already that it contains data it could hot have got from his actual memory, that he could not have observed. Not only things that were behind him but also the interaction between the marauders he could not have overheard.

Because that means that to get the full prophecy all Voldemort would have had to do was get a Pensieve memory of the night Trelawney made her prophecy, go into the room and listen in.
