Still doesn't mean Voldemort is an idiot (I mean he is, but.) for not getting one, the other might be in a hard-to-get-to place, or it still might not be common knowledge exactly how they work ( that you can see and hear things the person donating the memory could not have). Also it's not known how far away you can go, what with Snape being dragged away with Aberforth and all, or if you can actually open doors or go through solid objects. Maybe it's impossible to enter a room that is closed in a memory if the person who gave the memory isn't in there.
