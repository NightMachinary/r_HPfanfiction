We don't know how common Pensieves are. Maybe Dumbledore got his from some incredibly obscure place. Maybe people besides those Dumbledore entrusts with the information don't even know about them. Maybe the spell for extracting memories is not a normal one, and Voldemort doesn't even know it exists. We see Snape and Slughorn do it, but they both work for Dumbledore. We see the memories from the house elf and Ministry worker, but it seems Dumbledore extracted both of those.
