Aberforth did not drag Snape away quickly enough for distance to be an issue. That prophecy did not go on for half an hour or so. It takes about thirty seconds and the Hog's Head is not some sprawling edifice to the glory of beer. It is some dingy cheap little pub and Snape was thrown out of it, not run out of town. So combining the time frame, the possible distances and the unlikeliness that physical obstacles matter a great deal when watching a memory I think we have to agree to differ on what is possible.

Interestingly, Dumbledore demonstrates an alternative mode of operation for the Pensieve in that scene. Not allowing a full immersion but projecting one particular edited elements for public viewing.
