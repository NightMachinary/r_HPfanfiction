Q. Do the memories stored in a Pensieve reflect reality or the views of the person they belong to?‚Äù

J.K Rowling: It's reality. It's important that I have got that across, because Slughorn gave Dumbledore this pathetic cut-and-paste memory. He didn't want to give the real thing, and he very obviously patched it up and cobbled it together. /So, what you remember is accurate in the Pensieve./
