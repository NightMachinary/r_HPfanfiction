It should be mentioned that Snape's hatred of James doesn't just come from having been bullied by him or from having "lost" Lily to him. Sirius was just as bad as James when it came to bullying, if not worse. Another big reason that Snape carried his hate for James with him through life is because James saved his life at Hogwarts. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this yet. Sirius tricked Snape into thinking he would catch the Marauders up to something if he went to the whomping willow on the night of the full moon and went through the secret passage. What really would have happened is that Snape would have been torn to shreds by Remus as a werewolf but, thankfully, James found out and rescued Snape before he could be harmed. Dumbledore tells Harry this.
