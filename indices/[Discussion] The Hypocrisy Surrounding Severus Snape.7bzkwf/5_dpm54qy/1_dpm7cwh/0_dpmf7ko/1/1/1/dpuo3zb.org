Which is doubling infuriating because just last night I got into an argument with someone who arrogantly, erroneously claimed that James was in on the set-up from the start, and only got cold feet at the last minute.

Despite canon stating that James was not present at the time, and immediately took action to prevent Snape from getting killed, that Snape-worshipper ignored everything and said that James only did it to save Sirius and Remus.
