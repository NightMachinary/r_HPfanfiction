That's definitely not the case. Remus absolutely wasn't in on it and never would have supported it. Remus was always against their bullying, he just didn't have the guts to stand up to Sirius and James about it. From what I gather, and this is mostly inference given that there isn't much actually written about them, it seems to me that James loved attention. He liked to be the popular kid. It's quite easy to end up becoming a bully when you do things just to get the adulation of your friends and classmates. Sirius seems like he was always looking for trouble. Always looking for the next rule to break or prank to pull on someone else, not always seeing the consequences. Together they were a scary combination if it weren't for the reservations of Remus and the fact that, at the core, they weren't people who wanted to cause damage to the world. They were just stupid kids that weren't mature enough to make good decisions.

EDIT: Forgot to agree with you that James wasn't in on trying to get Snape killed. Also, I sometimes wonder if Sirius really had intended for Snape to be killed or if he just wanted to scare him. He doesn't seem like an evil person, even knowing his despise of Snape is still prevalent into his adulthood.
