  That's definitely not the case. Remus absolutely wasn't in on it and never would have supported it. Remus was always against their bullying, he just didn't have the guts to stand up to Sirius and James about it.

I cannot tell you just how happy that makes me to read--the way the redditor I argued with went on, you'd think the Marauders were even worse than the bullies in /Carrie./ And that Snape was just a poor little boy who had no-one, completely ignoring that Snape was dark from the start--singing the praises of Slytherin when he is well-aware of the blood purity biases.

  From what I gather, and this is mostly inference given that there isn't much actually written about them, it seems to me that James loved attention. He liked to be the popular kid. It's quite easy to end up becoming a bully when you do things just to get the adulation of your friends and classmates.

That's fairly reasonable. And it fits with what we see--Lily calls James an "arrogant toerag" but we also see her acknowledge that there's a line into genuinely harmful Dark Magic that James and Sirius do not cross.

  Sirius seems like he was always looking for trouble. Always looking for the next rule to break or prank to pull on someone else, not always seeing the consequences.

Part of it may have been the negative reinforcement that Sirius got at home. He broke every single rule the Noble House of Black set up, and it's a relatively easy transition for him to become a rule-breaker in general.

  Forgot to agree with you that James wasn't in on trying to get Snape killed. Also, I sometimes wonder if Sirius really had intended for Snape to be killed or if he just wanted to scare him. He doesn't seem like an evil person, even knowing his despise of Snape is still prevalent into his adulthood.

To be fair to Sirius, he was stuck in Azkaban for twelve years. And he was innocent. While Snape, a guilty-as-sin Death Eater walked free. I think it's safe to say that Sirius thought Snape was dead in battle, since he never wound up in Azkaban. And then when they finally meet again, Snape is trying to put Sirius back in Azkaban.

As for the...incident, I'm not sure. The wording's vague. It's certainly plausible that Sirius lost his temper and half-taunted Snape--"You think you're so smart? Why don't you go down the tunnel and see for yourself?"
