That showcases just how /mental/ Sirius was at that age. I mean, fine, get Snape killed, just regular-type sociopathy. But having your friend unwittingly do it? That's just fucked up beyond belief.

I mean what would the end game have been there, if James hadn't interfered or hadn't learned about it? At the very least Remus would have been sent to Azkaban for life, if not Kissed. Dumbledore for sure would have been tossed out of Hogwarts. Ironically, Sirius might have been fine, despite the whole house of cards collapsing, if he had kept his mouth shut.
