And several times when Harry is struggling with the idea of his father being a mean person, the people he talks to (Remus, Sirius, and even Dumbledore) explain in almost a defensive way to downplay his bullying to explain he did become a much better person. Sirius on several occasions simply refuses to give up his hatred of Snape. The whole dynamic is intriguing to me.
