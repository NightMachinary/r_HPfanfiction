Thing is, I like Snape too /as a character/, as a complex and difficult character. I still hate the way he's handled in fanfiction particularly by Snape-fen. Because in those fanfics the authors take away everything that makes Snape-the-character interesting to create Snape-the-person they like.

As for James as an egotistical bully - we ONLY have the extremely biased Snape's viewpoint to affirm that. Every other viewpoint we know of tells a very different tale. The problem there is of course is that Snape is the main source of what we are told about James. Excuse me if I do not subscribe to his extremist interpretation of James' character.
