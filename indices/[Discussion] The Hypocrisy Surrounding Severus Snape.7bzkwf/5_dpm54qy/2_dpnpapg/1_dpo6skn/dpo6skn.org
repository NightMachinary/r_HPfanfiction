I spent some time looking through Whitehound's stuff, and she is a bit liberal in her character analysis, ignoring parts of the character she doesn't like. She seems to be a bit of an apologist, especially with the Dursleys and Snape. I like how thorough she seems to be, and has a nice grasp on films vs novels.

Overall, very good author, I just don't agree with all of her analysis. She also did have some interesting points regarding setting and uk-centric details (stuff like the cupboard under the stairs).
