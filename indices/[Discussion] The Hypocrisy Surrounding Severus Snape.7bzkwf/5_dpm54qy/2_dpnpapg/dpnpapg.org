I have a simple solution for you. Every time you feel the urge, point the other person in the direction of Whitehound's Snape meta.

For me, reading their meta was a wonderful experience. They articulate so well everything I've always thought about Snape and the HP verse but never really took the time to put into words.

The two I'd really like to recommend is 'But Snape is Just Nasty, right?' and the super long Canon vs Fanon. Both can be found on whitehound.co.uk if you care to look.
