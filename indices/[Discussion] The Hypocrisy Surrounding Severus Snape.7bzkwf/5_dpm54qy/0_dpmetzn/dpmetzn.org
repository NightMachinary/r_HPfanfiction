I think you've found part of the issue. James becomes a better person off stage. We don't see it. Like with Ginny, we don't see her grow into the supposedly super awesome and perfect and powerful and pretty and popular girl she is at the end of the books. We're told these characters transformed from how they used to be, but it's unearned because it's not seen. So it's much more easy to dismiss and write off as fake. Combine that with how interesting Snape is and some people will run with it to mean Snape is the best. They don't take the lesson from reading Snape that people can be complex and contradictory. Instead, they turn it into a simple good and evil situation.
