I've been staring at the comment box trying to muster up, for the 8723458708275 time, all my reasons for liking Snape as a character: the distinction between narrative purpose and real life consequences, the entertainment value of unvarnished arseholes, the intriguing potential of Snape's complicated backstory and conflicting desires vs. James's bland origins as a swell-headed rich boy, the bittersweet appeal of imperfect or actually unattainable redemption, the self-sacrifice on the part of someone who theoretically shouldn't have been capable of it... and so on.

And then I think, ugh, I just don't have the energy to do this one more time. I've been in fandom for years, and if you're a Snape fan, this question comes up over and over and over. Sorry, but Snape is interesting. He's an ugly character who lights up the page. He makes things happen. He makes /horrible/ things happen - and he makes it possible for Harry to save the wizarding world. He bristles with contradictions. He even gets to have a moment in which he's morally superior to Dumbledore. Meanwhile, James is an egotistical bully and favored son who turns into a good guy off-page. His heroism feels abstract.

You will notice that at no point did I mention Alan Rickman. Book!Snape fascinates me in all his cruel, self-loathing, emotionally deformed glory. Movie!Snape - well, movie!anything really isn't what I'm here for.
