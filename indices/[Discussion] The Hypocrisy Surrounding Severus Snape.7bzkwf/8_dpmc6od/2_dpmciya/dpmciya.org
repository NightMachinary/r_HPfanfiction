Snape, however, is a person we, as readers, can judge through Harrys interactions with him.

- We know Snape is an 'evil' person. Because harry has seen it.

- We know Snape was casting magic on Harrys broom in first year, because Hermione told us.

- We know Snape killed Dumbledore, because we were there watching Snape cast the unforgivable curse.

- We know Snape liked Lily, because he told/showed us through his memories.

This all leads to Snape being a known character with flaws and characteristics and James being a lie meant to make us feel better for Harrys sake.
