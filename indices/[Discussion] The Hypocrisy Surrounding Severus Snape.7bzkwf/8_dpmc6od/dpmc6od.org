It's easier to have James be the 'evil' of the two, because:

- We get to know Snapes character, what he wants and what he has done. We see him perform these actions first hand, through Harrys eyes throughout the entire series.

- James has one scene that is not told by one of his friends, the flashback during the occlumens class with Snape. In this scene James is 'only' a tormentor of Snape and nothing else. None of his (supposedly) good points are shown.

- Everything else we know about James is told by one of his friends, whom themselves are not really trustworthy about this, because, this is a person talking to an orphan about his parents. They are almost bound to exaggerate the facts to make James seem like a better person.
