Yes? This is a schoolyard bully that is only a schoolyard bully, nothing else. Oh, he is good at sports to and has stalked a girl for a couple of years.

.

The terrorist is a person brought up with an abusive father and neglectful mother, finding someone he can relate to in a park,

He goes to the same school as his newly(?) made crush only to be bullied by a group of four kids that stand above the rules because of a choice to become 'brave' and not 'ambitious'.

After some time he snaps and calls his only friend a racial slur and loses her.

There is a war going on.

He overhears some information from the leader of the 'light' side and uses this to bargain for his friend life, unknowing that the information will lead to her death.

.

It is much easier to relate to the second person here. Right? The reason being: Snape has a backstory, James is just there to be a bully to Snape.

Everything about James can be fabrications to please Harry. He is a 'nice' person that bullies a kid for seven years, because the kid is in Slytherin and his friend is a girl James likes.

And the evil part, It is easier to add pieces to things that are undefined. We know what Snape would do in a certain situation. Or at least we can guess.

James has no determined personality, so nothing he does is out of character.

.

People has also sided with terrorists before. Like the Rebels from Star wars.
