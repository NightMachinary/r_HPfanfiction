  Yes? This is a schoolyard bully that is only a schoolyard bully, nothing else. Oh, he is good at sports to and has stalked a girl for a couple of years.

James has done plenty of good things though:

- befriended Sirius and helped him escape his terrible homelife, had no prejudices against him for his family
- befriended Lupin and made his condition tolerable, had no prejudices against him
- risked his life to saved Snape's life and probably Lupin's just because it was the right thing to do
- actually recognized he was a dick and changed to win Lily's affection
- actively fought against evil even though being a pureblood he didn't really have to
- died defending his family

James doesn't have problems in his life, true. But he's also not a hateful, murderous, racist terrorist. I find it easier to understand a rich kid with a nice family who's kind of a brat but has some good in him, than a person who joined the equivalent of the Nazis.

  He overhears some information from the leader of the 'light' side and uses this to bargain for his friend life, unknowing that the information will lead to her death.

That's a really cute way of saying he shared a story that he knew would lead to the murders of a family including a baby. That was possibly one of the most vile things Snape has done and he's done some pretty vile shit.

  It is much easier to relate to the second person here. Right?
#+end_quote

Personally I can more easily relate to a 16 year old bully (something most of us have seen IRL) than to a person who joined the Magic Nazis and helped them murder and torture people. Or a person who spent years bullying small children /whose parents he helped murder/, to the point where he became a 13 year old's worst fear. Just because the character is more fleshed out doesn't imply he has to be more relatable.

  James is just there to be a bully to Snape.
#+end_quote

Only if your entire reading of the books is focused on Snape and how other characters relate to him...

  People has also sided with terrorists before. Like the Rebels from Star wars.

As far as I remember the rebels from star wars weren't into murdering children.
