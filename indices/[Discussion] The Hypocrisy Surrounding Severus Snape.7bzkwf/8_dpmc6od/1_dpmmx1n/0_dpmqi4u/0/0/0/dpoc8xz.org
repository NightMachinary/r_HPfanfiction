Yeah, this is what really gets me, the way he doesn't just leave Neville alone, isn't just unhelpful or callous, he purposefully singles Neville out to hurt him because he enjoys it. And he is the reason Neville's parents are insane, an action that he seemingly regrets?! Yeah, right.

And unlike Harry. Snape has zero reason to hate Neville. Neville has never done anything to him, I don't think he's ever even said anything smarmy to him.

So it's not that he sees James in Harry and can't get over that, it's just that he enjoys being cruel to children. It's so much fun that even whatever regret he feels isn't enough to stop it.

The way he treats Neville and Harry (and the others) makes all his noble actions look like selfish obsession-driven revenge bullshit. He clearly doesn't feel real regret or empathy. I mean he does feel empathy -- for Lily, and maybe Draco?

To me Snape is a little worse than Voldemorte. Voldy is a true psychopath who has seemingly never felt most human emotions. Other people mean nothing to him so it's understandable that he will torture and murder to achieve his goals, why not?

Snape is simultaneously "in love" and seems to regret his actions as a death eater and have empathy... and at the same time relentlessly and unnecessarily cruel to exactly the people he hurt the worst, when they have done nothing to him. He is so duplicitous both internally and externally, it's deeply disgusting to me.
