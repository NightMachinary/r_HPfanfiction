I'm a huge James and Sirius hater. I loved Sirius in the books when growing up but now that I think about it they both were jackasses and snapes comments about James were absolutely right.

James really did hex people just for the fun of it. James became headboy ( hagrid is unreliable though) even though he was a big bully. James got the girl in the end.

Sirius nearly got Snape killed. Sirius hated Snape with a passion for the crime of being sorted into Slytherin. This didn't even stop when they both were in the order.

Snape wasn't the paragon of light or whatever that some people in the fandom make him out to be. But Snape did endanger his life on a daily basis by being a spy for Dumbledore. He was alone, isolated and hated almost from day one. How can anyone be mad at him for turning to the one group of people who showed him kindness and friendship? He grew up in a broken home, his only friend Lily was in another house, he was relentlessly bullied by the Marauder's from get go.

James had everything and still acted like the biggest jerk on Earth.

Sirius had a nasty family but he had friends and was like the bully who had abusive parents at home and thus directed his abuse and feelings at others. At least he had friends though.

Snape had less than nothing and clung to friendship like a drowning man
