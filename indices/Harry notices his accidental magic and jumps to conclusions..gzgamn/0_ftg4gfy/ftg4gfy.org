All three of these are unfinished, but well worth the read.

Harry Potter and the Consequences of a Trip to the Library in Primary School (series) by TheWizzard: Harry figures out that what he's doing is magic. linkao3(12915570) /[ETA: Self-Study is the first story in this series. Sorry that the link didn't match the title I gave.]/

Fairy Tale by Araceil: Harry figures out he has magic powers and models his self-training on what he found in the manga series. linkffn(9596404)

Storybook Hero by DogbertCarroll doesn't start until Hagrid's visit, but is wonderfully entertaining (quote below) and definitely slips over the line into crack. linkffn(7597067)

  "If I catch you do I get anything?"

  "That's leprechauns, all you'll get from me is a thump round the ears."

  "Solve your riddle?"

  "That's the sphinx for passage past what they're guarding or a date." Griphook rolled his eyes.

  "Bribe you with something?"

  "Now that's goblins!" Griphook said proudly while Harry took out a note pad.

  "Excellent! Do you have a list of prices and services?"
