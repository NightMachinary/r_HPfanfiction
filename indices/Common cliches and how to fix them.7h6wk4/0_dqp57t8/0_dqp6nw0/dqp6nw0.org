Why is a direct relation to house Black a bad thing? It's not like the relation alone gives Harry a ton of gold and five mansions. Given the size of the magical community Harry is bound to have some distant magical relatives. The Malfoys and Tonks would be third or fourth cousins/aunts/uncles, not a second mother/father/sibling.
