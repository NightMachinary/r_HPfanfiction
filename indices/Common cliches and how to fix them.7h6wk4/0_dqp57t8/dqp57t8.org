Here are a couple:

#+begin_quote
  The "trunk" (you all know which one I'm talking about!!)
#+end_quote

Solution: The trunk Bartemius Crouch Jr used in GoF was a one-of-a-kind family heirloom of the Crouch family. It was created by a Crouch years ago and isn't for sale in the open market. Other people don't even know this exists at all. The wizarding world is filled with rare one-off heirlooms like this that aren't widespread.

#+begin_quote
  The Potter "mansion" with a vault containing a billion galleons.
#+end_quote

Solution: The potters were well off, but not anywhere near millionaires. Their only house was in Godrics Hollow and James' father's (more on James' father later) house was destroyed by Voldemort in 1980.

#+begin_quote
  Charlus Potter and Dorea Black
#+end_quote

This is 100% JKR's fault for making these people canon.

Solution: Charlus Potter did exist in the 1970s but he isn't related to Fleamont Potter. The two families just randomly had the same last name independently from each other. Charlus Potter and Dorea Black are dead now due to old age.

#+begin_quote
  Irrational fear of werewolves.
#+end_quote

Solution: Remus is actually an exceptional calm werewolf who is in control outside the full moon. Other werewolves are far more like Fenrir Greyback and have wild and murderous tendencies even in human form. Werewolves genuinely are a threat even when not in wolf-form. Remus is simply an exception because he was turned before puberty.
