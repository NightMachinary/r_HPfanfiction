Or, alternatively, the trunks take a long time to make but it just so happens that Harry does have a trunk he inherited, with self-shrinking and all. He tries to move it but it's no dice, too heavy, so he tells it to shrink and it actually unshrinks, becoming huge, because it was already shrunk and looked the normal size then. Now what are you going to do with an 8x8x16 feet trunk, Sir Potter?
