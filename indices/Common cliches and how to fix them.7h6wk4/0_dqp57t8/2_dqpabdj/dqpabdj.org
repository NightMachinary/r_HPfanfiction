Charlus and Dorea were conveniently dead quite some time before Harry was orphaned, though, so it doesn't matter how closely related they were. (The ministry probably wouldn't dare to be openly anti-muggle just after Voldemort's fall anyway, so the Dursley's "claim" was probably more valid anyway than those of the Malfoys.)

Also, Rowling stated that magical Potters, Smiths, Blacks, etc. were related, despite the names being very common muggle last names.

Although personally I don't care much whether Harry's descended from Charlus or Fleamont (or both, since Fleamont Potter is old enough to be well known in the 20's for Sleakeasy) as long as it doesn't spawn too many cliches.
