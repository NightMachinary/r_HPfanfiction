Generally a deconstruction is what you want for an overly chiched trope, but that isn't fixing it really.

If you are asking how to deconstruct them, that is easy: (Plot Armor a problem? Make it so your characters explicitly seek to do important/risky stuff because they know it reduces their mortality. Harems? Have it fall apart for all the reasons multi-marriage is normally banned)

Unsure how you fix them while playing them entirely straight...
