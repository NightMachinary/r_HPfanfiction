Pssh you have magic, we can come up with better ways to play with it than that. You can go all Wrasse on them, spell them so the strongest of the group becomes male while all the rest become female, and if the male is away too long the next strongest female becomes male, and if you have two males in the group the weaker becomes female. The drama basically writes itself

Or you could reverse it and go all cownfish, the largest and strongest becomes female and the rest are male until the leader dies or is removed.

Plop it into your standard 'we discovered coven ritual that will maximize all our powers but didn't do the research on what it actual does' and you have a story.

Or, you could go with "The three girls proposed a relationship, and after the guy agrees, they spell him to split into three copies of himself. The copies don't get along"

Or you could take the whole 'only one wizarding school in all of britain' thing to its extreme: If one male is taking up 80% of the eligible females in their age group, there is bound to be repercussions with the rest of the male population. Either fighting back, leaving the country, or whatnot.

But I was more practically saying those who write it should read up on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny]] and try to actually make some social commentary, instead of using it as a way to get characters together. But since most of the fics written just want to get characters together...

Alternatively, you could, you know, set up a world similar to real-life conditions that Polygamy shows up: eg: the persistent and significant imbalance in the male/female ratio.
