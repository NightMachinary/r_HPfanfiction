Lord Potter cliche

Oh, Heir Potter, you also have thousands of Galleons of debt that you owe to several Houses, including Smith, Bones, and Longbottom. Your holdings as de facto Heir Black will be enough to cover that debt, but you will not have any money to throw around until you are of age.

Also, you ave other responsibilities, including a welfare check on everyone in your family. Here is a list of all of your family members and how to contact them. Please contact them at your earliest convenience.

Finally, you do indeedhave a marriage contract... it seems you have to marry the next heiress to House Finnegan... which means your betrothed won't be born for another 10 years at least (according to our estimations)
