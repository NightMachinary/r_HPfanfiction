Lord Potter --

Harry inherits the Potter lordship, which includes a seat on the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, he can't claim the seat until he is 17, and once he does turn 17, the Ministry has been overrun by Voldemort and friends so it's useless for Harry to try to politic his way around. Besides, who is going to take a 17 year old seriously in government, even if he is a celebrity?

edit: my least favorite cliche when done poorly, one of my favorites when done well
