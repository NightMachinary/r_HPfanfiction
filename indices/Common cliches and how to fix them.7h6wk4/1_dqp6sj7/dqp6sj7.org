A magical core is but the word used for a concentration of magical energies within the world - in a magical being, a wand, a magical house,...

A "powerful" magical core merely describes the ability of the described object or subject to channel and form magic into effects, other than weak magical cores found for example in squibs, or objects and subjects devoid of a magical core, like muggles.

Magical cores cannot be trained, made bigger or smaller. They just are a binary measure of the magical capabilities of a subject or object. Also a wizard or witch does not /have/ a magical core, they /are/ a magical core.

Or just don't even mention them.
