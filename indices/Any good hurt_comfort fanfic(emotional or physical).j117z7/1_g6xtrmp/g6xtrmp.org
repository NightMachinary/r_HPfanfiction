Well, it's not focus on those characters, but Draco is someone who will matters to the MC of the story (not the romantic way) from the second part of the story.

It's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4294544/1/Always-In-Your-Shadow-Calista-Snape-Volume-I]]

There is two others volumes, Draco will appear in the second tome, though he will not be a protagonist, but what is do with him have far more weight on the MC than any of the others characters you ideally want.

But anyway, this story is great (and i want to talk of it with someone).
