I stumbled upon a blog with an analysis of Madoka Magica, can't even remember how. There I saw an article about HPMOR. I don't think I read either of them.

I have to confess... I don't actually care about Harry Potter all that much. I liked the books when I was a kid and the movies are ok, I guess. I just like reading fanfiction for some reason and HP has a very large fandom. Even if a small percentage of fanfiction is quality, that's a lot of good works for something HP size. Spent quite a bit of time reading NGE fanfiction too. "Shinji and Warhammer40k" and "Nobody Dies" are the HPMOR of NGE, just with more lasers.
