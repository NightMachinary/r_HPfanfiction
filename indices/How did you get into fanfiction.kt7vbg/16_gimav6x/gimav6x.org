I- Well I was looking up stuff about HP, as I do, and apparently somehow came across a Harry/Draco/Daphne.

I was 11.

I was confused, cause I didn't know wtf fanfiction even was, and I was all, “What the hell? What is this? Why don't I remember this?”

I also learnt a bit more about sex that day. /shudders/
