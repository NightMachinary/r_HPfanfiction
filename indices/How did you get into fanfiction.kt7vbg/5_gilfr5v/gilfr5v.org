Felt completely lost after finishing the series in 4th grade, and also wanted to see more romance in it, so I went online to see if JKR had released any secret add-ons that included Harry/Ginny details and found [[https://siye.co.uk][siye.co.uk]] (H/G fanfic website). Read that obsessively before switching to [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] towards the end of 5th grade, and read through a particularly good wbwl story with a Draco/Harry friendship that made me considering Drarry, and have been reading Drarry now for almost 10 years. I started waaaay too early and was exposed to waaaay too much (didn't really learn to check ratings until it was too late), but I don't know who I'd be without it!
