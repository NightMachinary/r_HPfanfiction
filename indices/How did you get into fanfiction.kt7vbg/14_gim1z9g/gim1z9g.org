It was mostly by accident for me. I started following [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]] without realising that the subreddit was mostly about fanfiction. Well, on one post, a fic was recommanded and I thought /'Sure, why not.'/ and started reading. At first I was quite uncomfortable (mostly because I was still in the mind that fanfiction was cringe (yes, I know, it's stupid, I know that now)) but after a few chapters it became fun to read and that's when it spiraled out of control and now I read fanfiction every fucking day lmao.

For those curious, my first ever fanfic was /Harry Loves Ginny and Ginny Loves Harry/ by Epeefencer. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7055185/1/Harry-Loves-Ginny-and-Ginny-Loves-Harry]]) which is a compilation of one-shots where Harry and Ginny start dating earlier than in canon.
