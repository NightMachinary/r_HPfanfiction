In the long gap between the publishing of the fifth and sixth books, I had already reread books 1-5 innumerable times and was looking for more. I stumbled on Mugglenet, found their fanfiction section, and kept following trails from there.

I read lots of stuff on The Petulant Poetess and the various Sycophant Hex communities, and I followed links from Know It Alls to read on LiveJournal and other places. Much was terribly written; some was pretty disturbing; however, plenty of it was fine, and a few gems were good or even great, so I kept reading (if not always with the fervor I had in the early discovery days.)

I hadn't actually read much on FF or AO3 until just a few years ago but now read from those sites almost exclusively, mostly because there are easy ways to save/download fics for offline reading.
