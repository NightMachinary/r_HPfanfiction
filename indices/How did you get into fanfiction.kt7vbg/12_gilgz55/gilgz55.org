Back in 2012, I was a huge one direction fan and on tumblr I stumbled across a girl writing a harry styles fanfic to practise for her english gcse(?) I didnt know fanfiction existed so it was the best day of my life when I realized I could read stories about a fandom I already liked, because I loved reading. I got obsessed with one direction fanfiction and didn't branch out for a while.

A few months later I was back in my Harry Potter phase (I was an HP fan for longer) and I thought to myself “hey, I wonder if there's anything like fanfiction for Harry Potter?? Probably not because we already have books...” like I actually felt stupid thinking I could find anything as I googled “harry potter fanfiction”. Imagine my face when I realized just HOW MUCH there was out there...

I got sucked immediately. I didnt know what to read and I found it so bizarre that anyone would ship Draco/Hermione so I clicked on a fanfic and it was so cute, dramione became my otp. And then I found FFN and the rest is history!
