I was 12 years old and was watching a gravity falls clip on youtube and was reading the comment section and somebody at the very bottom of the comments was self promoting thier fanfiction so I clicked it and read it and got into reading all this cool fanfiction.

I then relized that their was fanfiction for other fandoms including one of the biggest fandoms in the world: Harry potter. Now I had just finished reading the series so I read everything I could find. Looking back some of them were really badly written but i didn't care.

When I was in 7th grade I thought I could try my own hand and made it on wattpad (I mostly read on ffn but I didn't have word document and I didn't know abut ao3) I wanted to self promote my fanfiction, and I had just found reddit so I looked for a subreddit for fanfiction and found this lovely place. Everyone here tried to tell me that It was terrible but I didn't take it well. I deleted it the very next year.

I've been reading fanfiction for about 5 years now and have been on the subreddit for 3 1/2, and I havn't left since.
