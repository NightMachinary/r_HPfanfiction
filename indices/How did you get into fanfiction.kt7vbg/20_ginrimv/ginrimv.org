I started reading fics while waiting for Book 5 to arrive, mainly on Sugarquill. I also tried to write my own fics around that time, but never published them. One was about a Harry who disappears after the final battle with Voldemort only to be rediscovered by an OC after he saves her from something. OC finds out that Harry had not killed Voldemort but merely 'trapped' the Dark Lord into himself. This prompted the decision to distance himself from his friends and the rest of the world. Another was a Snape x OC which had the OC being the adopted daughter of the Flamels and Snape being friends with her and Lily. Beyond those details, I can't remember what the plot was about anymore.

After that time, I didn't read HP fanfics because my focus shifted to Naruto. I did read a few fanfics again after Book 7 was released and once more tried to write my own story.

However, the time that I really got hooked on reading HP fanfics was in 2012, while going through a tough time in my life. I found 'solace' in going through everything in Rorschach Blot's Top of the Mark C2 on FFN. I was addicted to fanfics at that point coz I would just read, read and read until I didn't know what time I fell asleep and when I woke up, I would see that I had reached a chapter but couldn't remember how I got there. Things got better later on but I now know that whenever I start reading HP fanfics indiscriminately, I'm probably in an emotional crisis.
