There is an Icelandic site that has a bunch of different communities. You could say it was reddit, before reddit became a thing.

Anyway, I stumbled onto the site, found the HP community, and discovered fanfiction. These stories were written by Icelanders, some in our native language, and some in English. From there, I found harrypotterfanfiction.net. Eventually, I discovered ffn.net. This was in 2003.

I feel ancient now...
