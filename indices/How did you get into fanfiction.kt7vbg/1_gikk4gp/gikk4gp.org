I used to read original works on wattpad. Then i read ONE (1) fanfic about 1Direction and i was hooked. Then i lost my taste for it and branched out to my favorite movies like HP, Marvel, and then books and anime.

HP is what made me make an FFN account while marvel is the reason I have an Ao3.

LoL. I'm not ashamed to admit that i enjoyed wattpad very much.
