I used to spend a lot of time on TV tropes. Eventually noticed that some shows have fanfic recommendation pages. Took a while to find one with an interesting enough summary for me to actually try one. It was for some anime that I'm not sure I even finished, but I remember that I was not very impressed by it. Can't even remember the name. I think it was about a school with a lot of monsters? I went to the TV tropes to decide if I should continue watching it.

The fanfic recc page had some kind of grittier, darker rewrite of the anime and I got curious enough to try it out. It blew me away. I've liked it so much better than the original that I never considered actually finishing the show (I can't actually vouch for the quality of the fic though, its been a while, and I it didn't take a lot to impress me back then).

From there I would just read fanfics if I was losing interest in a show but still liked the characters world it introduced. I've liked Naruto when I was younger, but lost interest in show towards its end due to some questionable writing decisions, so I began reading fanfics. Eventually read enough Naruto fanfic that it was difficult to find fics that were both decently written and interesting, but discovered that Harry Potter was the biggest fanfiction fandom.

I'm not actually a very big Harry Potter fan. I couldn't get into the books and while I like the movies just fine I doubt I'd read HP fanfics if the fandom wasn't so big. While I'm not the biggest fan of canon, there are enough works out there to keep me interested, and their overall quality seems to be better than Naruto fanfics.
