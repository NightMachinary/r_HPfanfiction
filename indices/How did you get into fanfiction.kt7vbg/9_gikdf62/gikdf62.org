I'm a kpop fan and my habit of reading fanfictions started thereðŸ˜‚ a lot of fanfiction writers don't really care about the quality of their story. Bad grammar and so many plotholes that if they were galleons I'd be richer than the malfoys. Especially the ones on YouTube, where they're all videos so obviously they put text and then some pictures to describe the background. But since the ones you watch are in the wizarding world, basically all backgrounds needed are provided by the movies but some really dumb creators will really say "y/n doesn't know who's outside her door" and then the picture is of a door, with WINDOWS NEXT TO IT LIKE fjfjdksksk BOI make it make sense
