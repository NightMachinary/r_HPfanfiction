Way back in the day (early 2000s) I was using Yahoo search to look up more about Harry Potter and stumbled on fanfiction.net. I was in heaven - all of these Harry Potter stories that I could read for free! It didn't take me long to try my own hand at writing (a story angsting everyone I could think of in the most unrealistic ways possible, now deleted from the internet, thank goodness). I took some time off from fic in college, but then started writing and reading fic again in 2010. I mainly did Stargate, followed by Criminal Minds, and then Teen Wolf. Then I got sick and took a seven year break while I dealt with my life. I started reading and writing again in 2017, but didn't post anything again until 2020, when I got back into the Harry Potter fandom which is where I started all those years ago.
