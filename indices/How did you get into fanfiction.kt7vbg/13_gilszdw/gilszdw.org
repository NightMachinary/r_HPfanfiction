Somewhere between 2008-2010 I was watching Merlin, like most people and was using Den of Geek to look at theorems ok what was going to happen in the next episode. One of the comments linked a fanfiction and I feel into a hole of mostly Merlin.

I left that and for 10 years lived a fanfiction free life.

Until the pandemic hit... And I was left alone... And I got back into Harry Potter and was ranting to a friend about Remus Lupin. And my friend said "Sure people probably write fanfiction about this?"

And low and behold. Here I return. A decade older but still as obsessed as ever ðŸ‘Œ
