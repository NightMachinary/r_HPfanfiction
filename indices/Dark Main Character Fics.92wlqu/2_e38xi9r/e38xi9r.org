linkffn(12021325) is the best of the following. Ignore the cringe summary, this has done some truly incredible things. Harry is still Harry even though some of the things he does are not good. But he struggles with them, in a very well done way.

linkffn(10267302) has a pretty great first half, although once the politics stuff starts towards the second half it goes off the rails.

linkffn(7359933) is alright. It struggles in some aspects but I love the ending and find it rather fitting.

linkffn(9057950) is a classic. A lot of people will hate on this fic, and deservedly so but it does such a good job of making Harry truly ruthless. Rather well done and a fic I always go back to.

None of these are slash.
