Linkffn(Hermione Granger: Demonologist): I wouldn't say she is /bad/ per say, but she is definitely dark. Hell, she learns from Voldemort.

Linkffn(Too Young To Die): Harry will do anything to get his sister back. Anything. No regrets either.

Linkffn(Paid in Blood): this one is hard to call, but Harry was no good guy.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): this is the most crazy!Harry I can remember without being crack, he is terrifying a lot of the time.

Linkffn(Broken Chains; The Stars Alone): Harry, Luna and Hermione are on a universal rampage.
