I've read that before and its basically worthless. It, just like everyone's view is a single persons opinion. While it may attempt to "back up" its position with evidence, in reality, it simply utilizes quotes out of context, and from questionable locations and periods in canon time to infer opinions that are often flat-out guesswork at best.

It is literally of no more value in proving whether Hermione works or not than my opinion that it would work.

The best part about it is the exact same process the author uses as their basis, could be used for Ron with identical conclusions, and even as it pertains to Harry and Ginny with similar conclusions. Aka, none of their relationships would work according to the author.
