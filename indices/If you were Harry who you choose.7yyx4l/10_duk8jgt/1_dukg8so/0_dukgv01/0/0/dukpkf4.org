I actually agree with that. Let's be honest here, JK did some terrible work in terms of relationship development. Its very clear from the start she lacked forsight when it came to pairings as the kids aged up and had to do some quick work to "try" and figure it out without screwing up the Golden Trio if you will.

In my view, the best way to look at pairing potential from canon is to look less at silly things kids say and not at JK's "romantic" plot aspects, but rather instead dive into the more subtle behavior aspects of each character. Paring by psychology if you will.
