I agree. They also need to remember that Ginny was a bit of a piecemeal character thrown in by JK without enough significant development to really know for sure if she would be a good fit. Hermione on the other hand is more of a known entity, spending significantly more time around Harry and with significantly more canon character development.

You can like Ginny or Hermione more, but its quite hard to compare the 2 directly via canon.
