Difficult to pick, I actually want both, if they agree.

If not, I prefer Hermione myself, but Ginny is a much better fit for canon Harry.

Then there is the relationship with Ron to consider. If picking Hermione meant a break of the Trio, then I would settle for Ginny. Relationship drama is the last thing I need in fighting Voldemort and his minions.
