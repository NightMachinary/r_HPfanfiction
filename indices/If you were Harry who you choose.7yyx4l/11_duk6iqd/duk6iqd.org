Without a question Hermione. Ginny holds very little appeal to me (maybe if I knew her better).

But if I were Harry I'd put romance on the back-burner and solve my Dark Lord problem first. Not to mention that Harry - after the terrible upbringing with the Dursleys - still has a lot of growing up to do in regards to emotional intimacy.
