  Ginny always felt forced.

I think one of the main reasons for that is the epilogue.

I have no problem with them getting together and being attracted to each other... I can even say that for Ron/Hermione, even though that's even more nonsensical, but teenagers are kinda beginners in finding good partners and make bad choices.

re: epilogue: That everyone marries their first serious girlfriend/boyfriend is just dumb though.

  However, as much as I am a Hermione fan, my favorite pairing is often actually Harry/Luna and to some degree I think Harry would have been happiest with Luna down the road.

Harry/Luna is pretty great. Lunar Harmony is even better.
