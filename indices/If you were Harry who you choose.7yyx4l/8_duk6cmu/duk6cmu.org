Hermione all the way. Ginny always felt forced. Hermione always felt natural. I never got the "sibling" aspect people bring up. I dont think its like that at all personally from reading the books (at least before JK wrote in "Harry's Ginny" to pair with him).

However, as much as I am a Hermione fan, my favorite pairing is often actually Harry/Luna and to some degree I think Harry would have been happiest with Luna down the road.
