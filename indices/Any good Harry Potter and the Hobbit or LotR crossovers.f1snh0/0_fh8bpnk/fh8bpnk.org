I've got no clue about any crossovers with the Hobbit, but there are several good to excellent fics by the Steelbadger ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger]]) with the best being "The Shadow of Angmar" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]). A quick word of warning regarding it though, it is unfinished and updates very slowly.

The premise of the fic is that Harry is summoned to Middle-earth by the Witch-King of Angmar about a 1000 years before the end of the 3rd age ( LotR). It actually manages to capture the tone of LotR very well.

Another fic I can recommend is "The Archmage of Ardra" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407891/1/The-Archmage-of-Arda]]) which is basically a super Harry at the beginning of the third age. It is a more light-hearted story but still a fun read. The author said he was working on a sequel at some point, but the ending works quite well as it is.
