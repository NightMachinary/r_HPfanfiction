While I do prefer past tense, it's perfectly OK to use present tense. As far as I know, it's a little bit jarring at the start--mostly for the people accustomed to past tense--but it doesn't make much of a difference after a while. In fact, quite a lot of books in YA use it.

That said, the writing has a lot of problems even if it's not to be taken seriously. Several people speaking in the same paragraph and dialogue attribution are the worst of the lot.
