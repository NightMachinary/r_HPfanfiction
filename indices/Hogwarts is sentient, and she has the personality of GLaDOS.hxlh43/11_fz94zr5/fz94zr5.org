Reminds me of an idea I had some time ago. Hogwarts is sentinent, caused by picking up by stray magic and whatnot over the years. After the Quirrel debacle, Hogwarts picks up Tom's soul and inherits his malevolence. Basically GLaDOS-level malevolence. Can't directly hurt people but can do it indirectly by manipulating things like doors, stairs, etc. Locks everyone inside the building as Voldemort!Hogwarts comes up with increasingly convulted ways to make the lives of its inhabitants miserable.
