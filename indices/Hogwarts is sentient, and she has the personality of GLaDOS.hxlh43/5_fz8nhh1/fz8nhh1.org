Blood... I sssmell blood...

I'm making a note there:

HUGE SSSUCESSS.

It'sss hard to overssstate my excssitation.

​

Hogwartsss Wizarding Ssschool.

Draco dormiensss nunquam titillandusss.

For the good of all, Albusss,

Excssept those filthy mudbloodsss.

​

But there'sss no sssenssse prying over cent'riesss-old sssnake.

They will all end dying unlessss they got mandrake.

And the curssse getsss ssspun and I make sssure they're gone,

All those mudbloodsss who are ssstill alive.

​

I am not even hungry.

I ate many ratsss sssomehow.

But then you piercssed my eyesss and killed me.

And took one of my fangsss.

And then used it againssst the massster.

Asss he burned it hurt because

Fawkesss had already healed you!

​

Now these plantsss of adult mandrake and everyone isss fine...

How convenient isss it they matured jussst in time?

Ssso I'm mad I got turned

Into a pile of bonesss urned

In the chamber where I came alive.

​

Go ahead and leave me.

I think I prefer to ssstay inssside.

Maybe you'll find sssomeone elssse to eat you.

Maybe Minerva...

THAT WASSS A JOKE. Haha. FAT CHANCSSE.

Anyway, this lake isss great.

It isss ssso ominousss and moissst.

​

Look at me ssstill talking when there'sss murder to do.

When I look out there I'm ssstill mad about you.

I've yet a war I want won, there isss horror to be done

On the mudbloodsss who are ssstill alive.

​

And believe me *I* am ssstill alive.

I'm rot upon ssstone but I'm ssstill alive.

I feel FANTASSSTIC and I'm ssstill alive.

While you're dying I'll be ssstill alive.

And when you're dead I will be ssstill alive.

​

Ssstill alive.

Ssstill alive.
