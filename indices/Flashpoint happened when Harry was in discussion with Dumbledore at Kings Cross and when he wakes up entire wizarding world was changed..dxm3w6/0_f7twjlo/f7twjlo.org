Rowena Ravenclaw was a sociopath who carried out horrific experiments on both wizards and muggles in order to understand the exact origins of magic

Ravenclaw is the dark house and Ariana Dumbledore became this universe's Voldemort when she was sorted into the house and began thirsting for a way to understand when she was a Squib until mere months before the start of first year

She begins to see cracks in global society and forms a radical group of Squibs,Muggleborns and halfbloods in order to tear both wizarding and Muggle worlds down in order to rebuild them in a new way that would eradicate the world's problems at the cost of Ariana having eternal facist control

They call themselves the Enlightened Ones and Ravenclaw and Hufflpuff become recruiting grounds . Members include Ollivander,Luna(dangerously insane in this universe),all of Harry's canonical yearmates in those houses,Cedric (reluctantly continuing a family tradition) and even Hermione and Tonks

After an Enlightened Ones attack leaves his wife and infant son dead,Lucius Malfoy reluctantly ends his family's feud with the Weasleys and becomes a hero in the fight against Ariana resulting in him ironically becoming an advocate for peaceful magical cooperation

This universe's Lily Evans committed suicide after Ariana forced her to kill the newborn Draco

James Potter is a drunken lord who lost his love (Mary McDonald) to the Enlightened Ones and has stopped caring about anything and hopes he eventually drinks himself to death

Harry learns that this universe's Ron is in fact a spy for Ariana (who had given him the attention he always wanted) who provided information that resulted in the assassination of Minister Dolores Umbridge

When Harry arrives,Ariana has almost taken control of the Muggle world having already conquered the Wizarding one. Harry finds himself fighting his friends despite finding himself to be agreeing with their cause more and more as time goes on

Pretty rough but I think there are some good ideas here
