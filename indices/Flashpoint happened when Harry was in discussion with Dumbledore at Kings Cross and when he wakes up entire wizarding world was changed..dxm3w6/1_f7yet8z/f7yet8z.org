The Weasley's and Prewetts join Voldemort after Fabian and Gideon are accidentally killed by another member of the Order(perhap Sirius or Peter). Neville is captured by death eaters at a young age and trained as Voldemort's successor. Alice and Frank are still alive and have been trying to rescue Neville since he was taken. James and Lily are still alive, but are depressed as Rose, Harry's younger sister, was killed during a raid on the cottage.

Dumbledore is unmotivated after the war dragged on for nearly 20 years, he acts his age and can barely function most days. Voldemort turned his attention to the rest of Europe and has been steadily making ground in his conquest over the last ten years, amassing an army close to 30,000 wizards, werewolves, giants, and other dark creatures. He looks like and old Tom Riddle and not a weird snake man thing, and has charmed the French minister for magic, the Russian minister, and various other European Leaders.

The statute of secrecy is hanging on by a thread, sighting of wizards are almost common, and various muggle governments have even tried to capture young wizards and witches for experimentation but have been unsuccessful.

Voldemort spread his horcruxes around his territory, meaning if Harry had any knowledge about they're location, it is now useless. Because he never attacked the Potter's his soul is still split into seven pieces, giving his magical abilities a slight boost, which is why he was able to combat Dumbledore's attempts to stop him.
