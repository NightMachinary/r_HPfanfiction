I know. But, well, looking at all the other recommendations in the thread, as well as the OP, there seems to be this weird assumption that "selfish" implies "ambitious, hard-working badass".

When you consider that magic lets you get away with doing much /less/ work to get pretty much everything short of immortality, that seems to me like an odd jump to make. It's only if you want some sort of a legacy, or to change the world (for good or for ill), or to be respected and admired, that you have to roll up your sleeves.

It's telling that in many of the fics mentioned so far, Harry isn't, actually, selfish. In /HP and the Boy Who Lived/, his very Animagus form exemplifies loyalty and protectiveness, and he accepts a sanity-destroying punishment on behalf of his girlfriend; in /On the Way to Greatness/, he reveals his mastery of Dark Arts in order to save a random pair of classmates from cursed objects; and in /Hogwarts Battle School/, he risks his life to rescue others at least once or twice.
