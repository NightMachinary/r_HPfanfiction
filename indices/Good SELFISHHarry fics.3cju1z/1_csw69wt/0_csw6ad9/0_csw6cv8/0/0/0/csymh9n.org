Glad you like the fic!

I was hoping to release an update by the end of June and then the rest of the Year 4 chapters by the end of July, but that estimate was very optimistic. I just recently completed a cross-country move which has taken up a lot of time. It's unfortunately slowed my writing down and that's why you the projection has been missed and you haven't seen an update in a while.

Fingers crossed - I hope to have an update out in a week or two and the rest of Year 4 completed by the end of August.

Moving is the worst.
