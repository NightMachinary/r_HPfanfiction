That was my problem with Pureblood Princess exactly. The first chapter is just Daphne thinking about classes. The second takes us through her day in excruciating detail: how she wakes up, contemplates her life, showers, dresses, greets her parents, eats, all the way to putting the dishes into the dishwasher. It bored me to tears.
