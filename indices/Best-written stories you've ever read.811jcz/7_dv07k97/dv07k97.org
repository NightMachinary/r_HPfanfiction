linkao3(Third Time's the Charm by steph7of7) is amazing on multiple levels. Post-War Snape Lives fic with impeccable characterization.

linkao3(Snape, Head of Hufflepuff by sheankelor) is funny and heartwarming and not as cracky as it sounds.

linkao3(Power by Jaxon) has chilling and brutal Death Eater Politics, which I love.

linkao3(Picketing For Peace by Chuksha) has the Muggle world actually affecting the Wizarding world realistically, plus some interesting character development for the minor characters.

Finally, With Nothing On My Tongue by ms_anthrop ([[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html]]) is an amazing music-based fic that made me cry and forever associate Hallelujah with Snape (tho me reading it shortly after the 1-year anniversary of Alan Rickman's death didn't help that association).
