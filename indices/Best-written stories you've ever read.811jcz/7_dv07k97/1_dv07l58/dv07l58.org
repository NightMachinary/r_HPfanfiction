  Snape is saved by McGonagall, then he's saved by everyone else. He may even do a little saving of his own along the way, but that's hardly his fault.

  New Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle suspects that Snape is loyal only to those whom he is sleeping with.Unfortunately for Rowle, Snape grew up in a tough 70s working class Muggle community, where being accused of being anything other than heterosexual was an insult of the highest order. Surely Malfoy and Yaxley won't permit Rowle to make such an accusation?Set during OotP.

  Severus Snape never expected to go back to Spinner's End. But when news of the 1984 Miner's Strike, and subsequent sympathy picket in Cokeworth, hit the Daily Prophet front pages he couldn't help himself, even if that meant facing his estranged father.This story was a submission for Age range category 3 (20-30 years old) in the 2018 Snape Showcase over on LJ which has been publishing Snape!centric fics to coincide with Sev's birthday and #SnapeWeek. Beta'd by the fantastic Snarry5evr. snapecase: Celebrating Severus Snape throughout his ages!

  Why would Albus ask Severus to be the Head of Hufflepuff? Why should Severus accept? How would a Severus succeed in working with this house?
