Yep. First person POV fleshes out and acquaints you with the main character like no other. If done right that is. There are fics that just tells a 1st person story like a 3rd person narration. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]. It's a good story but it could have been so much better if some of the MC's personality colored the narration. As it is, the MC just tells the story like a robot programmed to tell whatever's happening and nothing else.

There are fics though that really uses the strength of first person POV to the fullest. For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7217938/1/Etc-Etc-and-Life-Goes-On][Etc Etc --- and Life Goes On]] the main character has this really active mind but has a rather quiet personality. I'm not really into how wacky it is(it's satire) but the story-telling, told by the very eloquent and verbose MC, just makes this so much more enjoyable for me. It would've been bland as hell if it was written in 3rd person.
