  Sirius is sick of his family. James wants him to do something about it. And all the while, invisible in the background, Regulus is slowly losing himself. /No longer a three-shot. My take on the Black brothers, starting with the night Sirius ran away. Warning: abuse in the first chapter. Rated T for a reason. /Previously titled Black Blood.
