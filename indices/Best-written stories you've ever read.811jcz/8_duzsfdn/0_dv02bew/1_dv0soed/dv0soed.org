It only happens in the first two stories, IIRC, but by year one it does begin to feel repetitive to the point that in year 3 he's working together with Harry at the climax of the story and it feels weird as fuck.

And personally I think this story is close to me because I read it after the awkward clusterfuck that was "A Marauder's Plan" (because I was looking specifically for "Harry raised by Sirius" stories) and this is wonderfully written and well plotted in comparison. Besides, semi regular updates FTW!
