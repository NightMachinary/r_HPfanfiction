To add on to this, there are only a very small amount of HP FanFic writers (which I consider you a part of, TE7), that actually know what they are doing.

This is because most people use fan-fiction as a jumping off point, and it shows. This isn't to say that /The Pureblood Pretense/ is bad, (it's not) but it definitely follows a different standard and there definitely is a different demographic that consumes it. Fan-fiction is just a hobby for nearly everyone, while for a select few it's a passion that is nearly possible to quench. For myself, I'm a huge lover of /What-If?/ scenarios, so fan-fiction is something that continually fascinates me.

Basically, fan-fiction is a whole different breed from regular fiction as a whole. It allows for amazing ideas to properly explored (like identity politics in /TPP/ or the idea of a more focused, saner, and /female/ Voldemort in /Limpieza de Sangre/) but for most fics the extra breathing room encourages bad habits (like the 50,000 word chapters).

TLDR: fan-fiction is fun, but let's not kid ourselves about the quality of it. Almost all of it is terrible save for a select few, and even for the select few most fics need ruthless editing.
