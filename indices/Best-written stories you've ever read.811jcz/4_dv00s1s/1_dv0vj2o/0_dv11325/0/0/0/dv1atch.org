Fanfiction has vastly distorted many readers concepts of word counts in actual books. Publishers won't touch something over 400k usually as it becomes almost impossible to bind. A Dance with Dragons was released as it was because they literally wouldn't have been able to physically publish it with any more content.

Most actual novels are somewhere between 80,000 and 150,000 words. Yet people on fanfiction often want things to be almost comically longer than that.

The longest Harry Potter book is Order of the Phoenix at 257,000 words. It is SIXTY THOUSAND words longer than the next longest one. Deathly Hallows at 198k.

Most general readers of fanfiction that I've encountered have absolutely no idea about word counts. Most publishers will flat out reject anything longer than 250k. And most of the time that's just a sign that the author can't get to the point.
