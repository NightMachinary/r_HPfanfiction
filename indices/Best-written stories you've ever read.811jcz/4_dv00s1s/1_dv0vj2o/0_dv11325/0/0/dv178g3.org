Sure, but you have to remember that children's books are 110,000 words max. Going by that logic, we have over ten books of content already, with the first four chapters at 132,000 words. This length is impressively ridiculous from a publisher's standpoint, and things would have to get changed for the deal to go through.

This would lead to a ton of things getting cut, to the point where Violet would have to rewrite the story and dumb it down. This would probably be a good thing for some of it (it /is/ too long, but I have never minded it), but you would definitely lose /something/ in the translation from fan-fic to a published novel.

I could go on, but you probably get what I'm driving at. Making the chapters smaller would be a band-aid - not a solution which would be remotely acceptable for the average book publisher.
