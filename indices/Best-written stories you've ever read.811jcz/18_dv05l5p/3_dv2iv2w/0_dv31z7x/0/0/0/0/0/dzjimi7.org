I know this is rather late to comment on (2 months later) but there's a review that I believe is a rather decent one despite it being rather anti-HPMOR as it describes all whats good and bad about the fanfic. I guess it kinda gives perspective on what exactly about the story irks many readers on here. [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]]
