Ill jump in and say your analysis is really well done. However, prettier sentences and an adverb count based on one dude (albeit a phenomenal writer) saying too many adverbs make poor writing does not make a story badly written. In fact I would say that too much dramatic rephrasing and flowery descriptions can, sometimes, take away from the story. This is ESPECIALLY true when you have a story like MOR. The whole thing is so pretentious and "look how smart I am" that the very descriptive writing helps that idea along. A good writer not only has to make a good plot (which MOR doesnt) but know when to write straight forward and when to be descriptive..

In conclusion the writer of HPMOR can write, but the story is so shitty that it doesnt matter.
