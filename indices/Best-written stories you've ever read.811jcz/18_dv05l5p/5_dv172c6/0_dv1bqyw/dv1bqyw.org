No. It isn't.

The first paragraph of the damn thing is riddled with sentence structure errors. As is pretty much every single paragraph of prose in the thing.

It may well be brimming with interesting and fascinating ideas and executed, from a 'story' perspective, well. But, from a technical writing perspective it is very poor. It would not pass a high school level grammar test. It is not clear from reading it if the author is even aware of such things as fragments or run-ons or has any real understanding of tense and agreement.
