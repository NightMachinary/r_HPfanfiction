Ironically, a lot of the dialogue is much better, technically speaking, than the prose. There's odd word choice here or there but nothing overly grating. The longer dialogue starts to suffer from the same problems as the prose.

But the prose is horrible. Literally chapter 5 starts with: "The Moke Shop was a quaint little shop (some might even say cute) ensconced behind a vegetable stall that was behind a magical glove shop that was on an alleyway off of a side street of Diagon alley."

That's it. Verbatium. Not only is that a terrible sentence as a whole because from a plot standpoint it tells you nothing of importance. But, it's also a run-on of epic proportions. And the entire fic is like that.

As [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] says above. It's more the author being able to sell it than anything technically good. I mean he uses "ensconced" correctly in the sentence I cite. Which is a good word that can certainly be a 'look how big my vocabulary' is even if he didn't just get it from the synonym tab of Word. But at the same time, the sentence itsself is horrible.

I'm not usually one to nitpick. And I've never read more than exerpts from the fic itsself. But, when I can open up any chapter, go to nearly any paragraph, and find multiple issues in sentence structure, it's not well written. At least, from a grammar standpoint.
