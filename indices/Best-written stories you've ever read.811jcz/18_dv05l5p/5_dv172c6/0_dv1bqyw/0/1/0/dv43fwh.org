1) No one in their right mind would publish HPMOR anywhere other than Kindle for 99 cents.

2) TE7s writing is amazing. It isnt Tolkien or Shakespeare. But what it is is telling you the story very clearly, cleanly, and in the best way possible. His true strength however is in his perspective based storytelling. You havent read the story so you dont know just how well he uses the writing as a way to tell the characters perspective and use this to create his plot. And thats just my biggest compliment for it. Writing is more than using big words and showing off your vocabulary and knowledge.
