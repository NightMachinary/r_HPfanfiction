Was he? I dont remember that but it's been a while so you are probably right.

My take on non-canon stuff is if it isn't so far fetched or doesn't take away from the basic events of the books, I'm ok with it. In this case, I found that Greyback could have been replaced with any other Death Eater and the purpose of the plotline would have still worked. So the fact that canonically, Greyback probably died wasn't really an issue for me.
