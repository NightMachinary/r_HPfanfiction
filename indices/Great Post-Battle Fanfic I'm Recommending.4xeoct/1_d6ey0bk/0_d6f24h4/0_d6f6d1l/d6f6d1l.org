Another thing: Neville lost his wand when he charged Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing.

In the melee that followed, I highly doubt Neville could get his wand back.
