Greyback was most likely KIA at Battle of Hogwarts. He was brought down by Ron and Neville with the Sword of Gryffindor. If I remember correctly, the Sword of Gryffindor was imbued with basilisk venom, and any cut by that sword would be fatal to its victim.

How then could Greyback rise from the dead and attack Ginny in 'Starting Over'? If you want to write canon stories, then at least pay attention to source materials. Don't cherry pick stuffs just to introduce unnecessary drama or suspense!
