  PLEASE NOTE: The warnings on this story are strictly precautionary in case of triggers. The violence is not exceedingly graphic and the rape/non-con is attempted only; both occur in later chapters.Harry and Ginny lived happily ever after...eventually. After the war, things didn't go as easily as they should have.
