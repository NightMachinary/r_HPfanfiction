I appreciate the recommendation, but honestly I'm having a hard time getting into this one. The story is just an endless stream of cliches:

- Harry the impossibly stubborn idiot with no impulse control and the emotional awareness of a stump

- Ginny the irrationally angry girl who can't get over herself long enough to figure out what she wants

- Hermione, who knows an incantation for every situation but can't manage to convince two of her closest friends to get over themselves and talk to each other

- Ron the socially tone-deaf buffoon

- George the PTSD-afflicted zombie who serves up the occasional flash of brilliant life advice

- Molly, the family matriarch who serves no purpose other than cooking and weeping

- An endless stream of implausible events and contrived misunderstandings that drive Harry and Ginny apart even as true love tries to bring them together

It just goes on and on and ON...
