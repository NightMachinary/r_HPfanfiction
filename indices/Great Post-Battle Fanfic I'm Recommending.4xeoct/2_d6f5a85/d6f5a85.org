My favorite postwar fic no longer has canon pairing or Harry becoming a Ministry worker, but a Dark Lord: *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167).

*Aurors and Schoolgirls* by Northumbrian, linkffn(5521420), is really good, but hasn't been updated since 2011!

Speaking of Northumbrian, he seems to be really upset at TCC, too, and will no longer include its time-travel elements in his stories.
