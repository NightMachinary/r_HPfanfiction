I'd say nay to Three to Backstep. Not a good recommendation, you can see already it has Weasley bashing. And when Sinyk does Weasley bashing he really bashes them. Extremely poor writer, and though I can't recall anything from this particular fic since it's been ages, I recall some of his other fics and they're just as awful. Also has OOC!Characters in the summary which is almost always a bad sign, along with Reptilia28's challenge which spawned a number of bad fics along with some similar challenges (I think. It's possible they predate the challenge), all of which created a number of fics which are generally bad, though some of the ones are decent, but those aren't very serious.
