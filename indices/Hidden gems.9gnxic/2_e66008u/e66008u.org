What Wicked Warthings]([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader]]) which is a HP/RWBY crossover. It follows a much different Harry competing in the Triwizard Tournament under the guidance of his mentor Tom Riddle. The fic only uses setting details from RWBY such as the Grim, the use of trick wepoans and the White Fang. No RWBY characters have made an appearance so far. Knowledge of RWBY while helpful isn't required.

Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle
