linkffn(8741536)

Abandoned, but basically, in its current state, it is a complete "summer before first-year" fic where Septima Vector is the one who shows Harry around the magical world and does something about the Dursleys. There are some fluffy Harry & Luna friendship moments there as well.

And since we are talking about the start of the first year, there's linkffn(7594482), where Harry meets Tonks at Kings Cross.
