I am a fan of the oneshot fic linkffn(The Children of Set by What-Ansketil-Did-Next). Listed as a Harry Potter/Conan crossover, it is more accurately a HP/Lovecraft Mythos crossover.

It's Voldemort-centric, about part of his travels post-Borgin & Burkes and pre-hiding Ravenclaw's Diadem. Definitely AU with a different reason regarding Voldemort's immortality.
