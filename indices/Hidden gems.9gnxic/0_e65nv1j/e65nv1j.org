linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): one of the best Harry adventure stories I know, and with some of the most original plotlines I have found (it was started before OotP came out, so yeah).

linkffn(The Awakening Power): has some issues, but in a lot of ways it ways the story felt very canon-like with a powerful Harry (but flawed).
