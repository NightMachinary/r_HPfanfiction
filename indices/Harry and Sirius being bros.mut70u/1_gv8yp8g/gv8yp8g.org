Linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Ok) is a good example of this I think. Due to various butterfly effects, Sirius is properly released from Azkaban without any issues and he's able to live openly. Since the threat of Voldemort/the Death Eaters isn't really present in this fic, Sirius gets to play the fun uncle to Harry and since Harry is well-adjusted rather than angsty, he actually plays along. Lots of them just comfortably hanging out together, Sirius acting like a man-child but actually teaching Harry things at the same time, etc
