Yeah, I've always felt the Dursleys were a lot more passive and neglectful in their actions towards Harry rather than actively malicious? Like, they'd antagonize him definitely but not like beat him or that stuff - not that verbal abuse isn't as bad as physical, but some fics have him whipped half-to-death daily and I don't really see the Dursleys putting that much effort into it.
