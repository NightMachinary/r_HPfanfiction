I don't think it was constant physical abuse, but there's definitely an undertone. Part of it is that PS is a children's book, and what I think is a larger part is that we meet Harry at 11 and only get a couple glimpses at him as a younger boy. Through the early books, Harry certainly seems to fear Vernon in a way that isn't quite explained by verbal abuse only. In addition, we know Dudley and his gang are physically violent towards Harry, and the Dursleys tacitly condone this violence.
