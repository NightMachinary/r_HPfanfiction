You really have to think beyond the Dursleys: it's not just about the cupboard and the endless chores and complete lack of affection. As a kid, Harry was forced to go to school wearing terrible, baggy clothes (often shrunken hand-me-downs from Dudley). He was not popular, he had zero friends (I believe befriending him would have caught the ire of Dudley and his gang?), and for the first eleven years of his life, his best recollections are eating crappy choclate cake at Mrs. Figgs. I mean, that's just...miserable. For years.

Such isolation and discontent can really only breed resentment and a host of other negative qualities. Honestly, people criticize the series for plot holes and time paradoxes, but the really unbelievable part is that, given his childhood, Harry grew up to be a decent kid.

Of course, it's something I am more than willing to overlook, because, otherwise, what sort of story would it be?
