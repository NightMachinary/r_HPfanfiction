You also have to think beyond the Dursleys to all the adults Harry met as a child.

How many teachers saw that he was wearing broken taped together glasses and old, ill-fitting clothes, while they did nothing to help. How many times did he have to explain away malnourishment and "Harry hunting" bruises to the school nurse. How did not one single adult ever step in and help a clearly neglected child.
