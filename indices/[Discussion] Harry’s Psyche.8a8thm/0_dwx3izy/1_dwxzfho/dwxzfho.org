  the endless chores
#+end_quote

There's actually evidence in canon that implies that the Dursleys /didn't/ have Harry do endless chores. The big one is the beginning of CoS, in which he is told to stay outside while Petunia cleans. There is no instance of him being told to do gardening, clean the dishes or cook all the food. The closest it comes is him being told to mind the bacon briefly on Dudley's birthday in PS.
