[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12948481/1/Blackpool][Blackpool]] is my favorite telling of Regulus Black's story (though it is an AU). I never would've thought that Regulus would be a more interesting character to follow than Sirius, but in this story, I wouldn't have it any other way.

I also really love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]] . I first got into it because I wanted to read more stories about Snape's year as headmaster, but then I became far more interested in Theophany Knapp. She's such a compelling character with a really in-depth backstory. She's one of my favorite OCs.

Same goes for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] and Theia Higglesworth, who is also one of my favorite OCs. Her dynamic working as a trainee Auror with an exasperated Harry is really fun, and I like how that dynamic evolves over the course of the story.
