I've written several stories where guns as well as wands are used. The Muggleborn Resistance uses them in "Divided and Entwined". Hermione uses guns in "Harry Potter and the Spygirl". Petunia uses them in "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider". Naval guns and other heavy weapons are used in "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water". And the British soldiers use them in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution".
