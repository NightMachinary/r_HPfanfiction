I have a few others besides The Man Who Lived to recommend!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16062536/chapters/37503065][A Sword Laid Aside]] - I just finished this one today! I hadn't read a fic where Draco works undercover before, and enjoyed the mystery intertwined with the slow burn romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5403371/chapters/12482513][Any Instrument]] - Draco is a doctor, and is asked to help Harry because his magic is unstable.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16775134/chapters/39363706][Borrowing Courage]] - I really loved exploring magical portraits in this fic. Draco is a magical artist, and needs Harry's help with a portrait.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14108061/chapters/32506347][Everything That Happens is From Now On]] - I warn you, this fic is very very emotional. It follows Draco's healing after his sexual assault. Brillant writing and characterization, and while it feels wrong to say that I enjoyed this one, I certainly was taken for a roller coaster ride.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4779144/1/Charmed_Wool][Charmed Wool]] - Draco works for the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department and is given a case of illegal charmed jumpers to track down. He finds more than he'd expected.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/hd_erised_2017/works/12823128][Adventures in Solitude]] - As a Hogwarts student, Draco would confide in Sirius' portrait. Twenty years later, he pulls the portrait out of storage and the secrets he once kept start coming out.
