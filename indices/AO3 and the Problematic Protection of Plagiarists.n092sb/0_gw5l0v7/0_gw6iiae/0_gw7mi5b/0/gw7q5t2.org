But if, as in this case, the person who wrote it and originally posted it is still identified as the author when it's reposted and the original posting made it available to the world free of charge, how does "steal their stories" even apply as a description of reposting it? The author's still getting credit and there's no lost income/unjust enrichment issues. How does it affect me at all if I post a story to FFN, that all the world can read without paying me a cent, and someone copies it to AO3 as "Story From FFN by RealLifeH_sapiens"?

Hell, what difference would it have made if you'd written your stories based around around Story X without the Author of Story X's permission? I can't think of any compelling or valid reason for you to have refrained from writing and posting your stories even if Author of Story X had specifically said, "No, I don't want you writing derivative works based on my work", so I can't think of a reason.to ask for unneccessary permission. Or to post the link to Story X except as a courtesy (as much to your readers as to that author).
