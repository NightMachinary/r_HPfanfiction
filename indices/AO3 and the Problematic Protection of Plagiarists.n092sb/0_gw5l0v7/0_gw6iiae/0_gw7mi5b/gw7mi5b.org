If the author is no longer active and have moved on, it's still plagiarism to steal their stories and repost them under your account. Now, there were a few stories that I was inspired to write that are based off of orphaned works, but I always made it a point to link to the source material. However, these stories were only based on some events that took place in that orphaned work... and if I can find the original authors to that fic, if say it is a story that gained a lot of traction in the fandom, then I ask around to see if I could find the name of the author and ask them if I can base my fic around x story.

In most cases, the authors of the orphaned fic have removed themselves entirely from the fandom and deleted their accounts, so I just link to the orphaned fic and let it be. If I do get into contact with the original author and they tell me that I can do whatever I want as it is no longer their fic, then I still link to the source, and take great care to not name the author.

Also, if we are dealing with authors that published their books, their works are protected by copyright as well. I've seen people lift entire books from now deceased writers and post them to sites like Wattpad and AO3. If it's a fanfic writer that has died, and their work is still posted to the archive, then I feel that the copyright of that fic is still to the original writer and stealing it verbatim and reposting it to your account is incredibly offensive.
