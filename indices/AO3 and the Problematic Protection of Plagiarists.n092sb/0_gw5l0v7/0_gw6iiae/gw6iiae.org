If the author's dead or no longer active, I think it shoukd be open season on their works. Orphan works should automatically pass into the public domain, but as protection against accidentally scooping in non-orphan works the cooyright remains but the author has to actively defend their copyright. That way orphan works are still de jure cooyrighted (which is unfortunate) but with nobody actively claiming and enforcing cooyright on them, de facto they're public domain.
