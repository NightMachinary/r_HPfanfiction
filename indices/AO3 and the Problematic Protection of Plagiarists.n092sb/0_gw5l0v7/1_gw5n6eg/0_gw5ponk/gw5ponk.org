I'm honestly struggling to see your point here. In fact, I'm kinda struggling to see the point of most of your comments on this post.

My first question is where exactly did I complain? I merely pointed out the legal reality of how things worked. Am I suggesting that something is left to be desired about reality? Yes, of course. What I did not do, however is:

#+begin_quote
  [complain] that you have to prove that you have the authorisation to act in someone's name
#+end_quote

What I was in fact suggesting is that it is kind of... weird (to borrow a turn of phrase) that a thing can be both /illegal/ and /explicitly against the terms of service/, but that no-one bothers trying to enforce these things unless they're about to get in trouble for /not/ enforcing them.

Why does representation matter at all when something has been posted on a site which clearly falls afoul of the rules of that site? Why does the site drag its feet so much on enforcing their own rules that it is only the possibility of legal liability that makes them do so?

Further, your arguments in other comments about the nature of plagiarism just seem to be pointless noise. They don't further the discussion at hand. You could have made the point (which I did above) that it is not technically plagiarism, but just straight up copyright infringement without needing to enter into more than one lengthy argument which was completely irrelevant to the real question of /why AO3 doesn't feel the need to enforce its own rules/.

The answer, as I have said above is that they don't feel the need, because the way they enforce their own rules in this case is identical to the way the law is applied. Whether you believe that that is a fair way of treating intellectual property or not is a further conversation, and one which I think is entirely more valuable to have than trying to pick at irrelevant details of the original complaint just so you can look smart.
