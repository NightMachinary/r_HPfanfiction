You didn't complain about it - but the whole thread is about complaining that in order to act on someone's behalf, you have to prove that you are allowed to act on their behalf. Which is a basic legal requirement.

I don't like that people treat plagiarism the same as reposting.

/Ao3 doesn't protect plagiarists/. Claiming they do, and citing the rules for reposting, is dishonest.
