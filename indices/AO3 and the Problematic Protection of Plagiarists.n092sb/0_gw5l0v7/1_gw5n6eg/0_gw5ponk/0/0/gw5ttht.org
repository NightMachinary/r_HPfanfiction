So, firstly, if you accept that I did not in fact complain about it, why did you address it as a reply to something I'd said? Have you not made top-level comments to this effect already?

Of course, what you actually said in reply to my earlier comment didn't really have anything to do with the plagiarism/reposting confusion at all and was instead commenting on the legal reality of copyright ownership and enforcement. If you were trying to make a point referencing my own comment, perhaps it would have been better to actually make the point, rather than settling for making vague implications.

In fact, this seems a fairly strange hill on which to die because copyright infringement and plagiarism are two concepts which overlap significantly.

Copyright states that the creator has the sole right to:

- reproduce a work.
- create derivative works based upon it.
- distribute copies of the work to the public.
- publicly display or perform the work.

Here's the thing, copying, with or without attribution, is copyright infringement if the copyright holder did not give permission for their work to be copied.

The primary difference is that with plagiarism there's an additional 'victim' at play: the mislead 'consumers' of the plagiarised work. There are cases where one may plagiarise someone without infringing their copyrights, but these really aren't especially applicable in this context.

I guess that raises an interesting point. If AO3 is more strict in its actions against plagiarism (considering that their interpretation of fair use probably makes it extremely difficult to plagiarise a work without infringing copyright) than it is when dealing with copyright issues, it says something about how they value authors and readers.

It is almost as if AO3 holds the position that readers are worthy of protection, but authors must fend for themselves.
