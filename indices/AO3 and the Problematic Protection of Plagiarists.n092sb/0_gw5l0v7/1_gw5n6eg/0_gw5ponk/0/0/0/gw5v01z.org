No, it's a matter of the burden of proof. If Ao3 would just let anyone claim something is an unauthorised repost, that would be valuing the readers - or third parties - more than the authors, who might have to defend their work being theirs from anyone harassing them with the report button. It just makes sense that the burden of proof is different in the case of reposting.
