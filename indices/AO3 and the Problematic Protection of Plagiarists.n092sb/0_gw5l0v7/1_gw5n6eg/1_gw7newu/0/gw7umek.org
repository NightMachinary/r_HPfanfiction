No, I'm talking about someone, without asking the original author, demands that a repost of their work is taken down. Like, imagine you have a house with a lawn, and your neighbours kids are playing there one day, and someone else comes and, without asking you whether or not you mind them playing there, tells them to get off /your/ lawn or else.

If someone reposts a story and credits the original author, then one should check with the original author if they mind that before demanding that a story is taken down. Because no matter what people say about moral and not, only the original author has the right to demand that the work is taken down. Anyone who, without asking, steps in and demands that in their name is usurping a right they don't have.
