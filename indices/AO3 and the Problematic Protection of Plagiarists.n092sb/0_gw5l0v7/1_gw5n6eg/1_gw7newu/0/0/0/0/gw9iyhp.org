It's plagiarism. It's literally copy and paste, but to a different site and is under somebody else's account. As somebody who had somebody plagiarise my stories and 'repost them' to different sites, it's still considered plagiarism. It's still considered wrong. It is still considered an insult. And it still makes me angry to think about.
