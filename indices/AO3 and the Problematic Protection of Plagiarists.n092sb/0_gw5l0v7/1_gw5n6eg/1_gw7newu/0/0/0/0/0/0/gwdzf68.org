It's still theft. It's still plagiarism. I am not going to continue arguing with you about this subject. I've tried my best in educating you on the harm that 'reposting' fic does to the original author, but you're daft and continuously sweep everything that I say under the rug like it doesn't matter.

You go to any site that writers participate on, and their definition of plagiarism is very similar to mine.
