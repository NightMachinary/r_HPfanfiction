Most authors who give away their fics to another writer would make a note of it so that their fans could go to the other author in question. Most of the time, if the author doesn't have that acknowledgement on their profile or on the fic in question, it was plagiarised and posted under another account without the original author's knowledge or consent.

Also, many reposts of fic come from plagiarists that for whatever reason want to give the fic attention or to 'finish the fic' for the author who is no longer active. That is still plagiarism.
