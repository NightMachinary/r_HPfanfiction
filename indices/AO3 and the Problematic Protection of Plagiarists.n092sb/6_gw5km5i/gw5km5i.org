I think you are misrepresenting what has happened. While I am not involved of the forum in question and no nothing about the individuals, looking at the stories in question this is reposting not plagerism. Firstly BadWolfe placed a clear disclaimer on the front owning up to this not being their own work and crediting the actual author. Secondly, the original story seemed to be on fanfiction.net only and not on AO3, so it is not directly competing with the author's account, but making it available on a different site in addition. Finally, going by the update date, the original seems to be dead, unless you happen to know if The Santi is active behind the scenes. This is more morally dubious, but I feel that there is a general principle on the internet as a whole that if you have clearly abandoned a project then it is fine for someone else to volunteer to maintain it in your place. Also I feel that proactively getting permission from the original owner can be an unreasonable requirement if it may be impossible to actually contact them if they are no longer involved in the community.
