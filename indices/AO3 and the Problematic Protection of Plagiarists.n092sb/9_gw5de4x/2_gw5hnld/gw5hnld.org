Plagiarism is the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas /and passing them off as one's own/. Reposting a work and clearly crediting the author isn't plagiarism.

So, this isn't about plagiarism, but reposting. And the policy for reposting is absolutely fine - it would be far worse if anyone could have a reposted work taken down without having the author's leave to do so since only the author should have a say about where his work is being posted.
