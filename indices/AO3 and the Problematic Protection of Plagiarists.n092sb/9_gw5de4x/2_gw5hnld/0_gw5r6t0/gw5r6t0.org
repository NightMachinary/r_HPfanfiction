Within the fanfiction community, posting another person's work on your own account has historically been called plagiarism. I acknowledge that AO3 does not define it that way. But quibbling over definitions is pure semantics.

The point of substance is that posting another person's work /with credit/ and posting another person's work /without credit/ share the common core characteristic of /taking another person's work/, a characteristic which makes both morally wrong, and of a similar enough nature that the rules for how they are dealt with should be the same. Doing it without credit just adds an additional aggravating factor.

If you want to cling to a semantic point that they should be called something different, then I'm not going to die on that hill.
