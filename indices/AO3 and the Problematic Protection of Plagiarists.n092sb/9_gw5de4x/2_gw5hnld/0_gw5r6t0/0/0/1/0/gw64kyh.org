Incorrect.

Plagiarism is indeed copyright infringement. An aspect of copyright is what is called the author's "moral rights". That is the author's right to be recognised as the author. If you look inside any book you will see a statement that the author's moral rights are reserved. When an author sells a work to a publisher, what they are doing is splitting out the copyright so that the publisher gets the commercial rights and the author keeps the moral rights.

Both commercial rights and moral rights can be enforced by civil suit.

There are two reasons you can plagiarise Shakespeare to your heart's content. Firstly, the work has entered the public domain so there is no commercial rights remaining to be enforced. Secondly, the author is no longer alive to enforce their moral rights.
