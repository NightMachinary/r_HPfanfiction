  As a matter of fact, plagiarism and piracy are treated the same at law. Which is to say, both are infringements of the author's copyright.

Nope. Piracy is copyright infringement. Plagiarism is not inherently. The law does not care about plagiarism. The fact that much plagiarism is /also/ copyright infringement doesn't change that in the slightest. You can plagiarize Shakespeare to your heart's content without ever having to worry about legal consequences.
