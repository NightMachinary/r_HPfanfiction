Eh, if the moral rights were still enforceable Shakespeare's estate (assuming that you could trace it) would be able to enforce it. But they are not, because moral rights (at least in some jurisdictions) expire. So in the UK, Shakespeare's hypothetical estate has neither economic nor moral rights over Shakespeare's expired copyright, and yet copying his work without proper attribution is /still plagiarism/. I'm not based in the US, but as I understand it American law cares even less about moral rights than British law.
