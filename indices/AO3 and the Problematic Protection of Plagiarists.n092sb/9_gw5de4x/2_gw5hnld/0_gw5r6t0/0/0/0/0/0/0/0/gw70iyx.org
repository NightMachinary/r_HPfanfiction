Ao3 is perfectly fine to treat two different things differently. As I posted, there is a difference between plagiarism and copyright violation. No matter how long you ignore that, it doesn't change that there is a difference.

One of them can be handled without proving that you're speaking for the original author. Because, as I keep saying, you need the authorisation of the original author to go against reposting because only they can decide that something should be taken down. That's their decision, not anyone else's.

That you don't want to accept that, that you want Ao3 to let anyone enforce copyright, without proving that they are speaking for the author in question, doesn't make that stance OK, right or sensible.

Could Ao3 allow anyone to take down a repsoted work? They could. Would it be a good idea? Absolutely not.

I don't exactly understand why you are so obsessed with taking down a reposted work without the consent of the author of the work. If an author cannot be bothered to act, then why should someone else have the power to act for them without any authorisation given? That's nonsensical.

And yes, "by the way, this isn't mine, it's X's work" is the only difference - and it makes all the difference. That you don't seem to understand that is very, very weird.

Now, why do you think you should be able to speak for an author without having proof that you are authorised to do so? Why do you feel you should have the right to represent someone without them authorising you to do so? When you can't even contact the author?

That's not how things work. Why should that be how things work here? As long as credit is given, it's not plagiarism, and if it's just reposting, it's none of your business at all, but just the author's.
