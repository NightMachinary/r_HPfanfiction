The only mix up here is your mixing up your arguments. Let's set out how the argument has progressed:

1. Me: Taking someone else's work with credit and without credit are both still taking someone else's work and should be dealt with accordingly: neither should be tolerated.

2. You: Taking someone else's work with credit and without credit should be treated differently because the law treats them differently.

3. Me: Actually the law treats them the same.

4. You: They should be treated differently because they are enforced differently.

5. Me: They are enforced the same at law.

6. You: They are enforced differently by AO3.

So it now seems like you have completely abandoned your argument that taking someone's work with and without credit should be treated differently because they are legally different.

Instead, your position now appears to be that they should be treated differently because AO3 treats them differently.

In short, you are justifying AO3's policy with the argument "it's AO3's policy".

Responding to a "should" with an "is" fails as an argument, however. The question is: what /should/ AO3's policy be? And it seems you've run out of arguments for why AO3 should treat two forms of taking someone else's work differently, with one requiring the author to complain but the other AO3 enforcing of its own volition.

The very fact that AO3 (and universities) are perfectly capable of practically enforcing a self-policing policy against taking other people's work /without credit/ shows that it's perfectly possible to enact a self-policing policy against taking other people's work /with credit/. The only difference between the two in practical terms is if the work contains an extra sentence "By the way this isn't mine."

Indeed, arguably it's significantly easier to practically enforce a rule against taking other people's work with credit, because by giving credit, the work will always flag up that the person posting it doesn't have the right to do so, by their own admission.
