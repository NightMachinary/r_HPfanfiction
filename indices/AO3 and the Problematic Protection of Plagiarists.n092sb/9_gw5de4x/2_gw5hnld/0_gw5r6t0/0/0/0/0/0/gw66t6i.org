Actually, no - plagiarism is acted upon, such as in the case of say a Master's thesis, if it's reported by anyone. You don't need to be the original author to report plagiarism. That's how a number of German politicians lost their PhD.

Ao3 does self-policing. And where /plagiarism/ is concerned, the original author's input isn't required at all. Please stop mixing that up.
