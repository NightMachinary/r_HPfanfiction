You really don't get the difference between plagiarism and reposting without authorisation. There is a difference, and it's why those things are treated differently.

Morally, it's not OK to claim you're representing someone without their authorisation. If someone's playing on your neighbour's lawn, you don't get to send them away unless the neighbour told you you could do it. Whether you assume they want their lawn free of others or not doesn't matter: You don't get to assume that you speak for someone. That should be very, very clear. Outside very rare cases, you aren't protecting anyone's right by assuming to speak for them without their authorisation - you are violating their rights.

Also, the idea that reposting a fanfiction story is in any way, shape or form equal to stealing is ridiculous. You can't make money off fanfiction, so there's no monetary interest. That means, it's not obvious, nor can you assume so, that an author is opposed to their work being spread as long as they are credited.

Really, your case is a very, very rare situation. The arrogance to assume everyone has to follow your views is striking - as if you speak for every author, and as if every author would be fine with people speaking for them without being asked. Not everyone minds a repost as long as they are being credited.

So, no, the idea that Ao3 should change their rules and allow everyone to take down reposts without checking with the original author is wrong and stupid. Ao3 shouldn't cater to a very small group and screw over everyone else.

And, again: the idea that you can just act in someone's name without authorisation is not moral nor common sense. It's actually barely better than taking someone's work without asking and reposting it.
