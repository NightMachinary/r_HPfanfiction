This is a completely unnatural and wrong-headed position.

The starting point is that no author consents to unauthorised copies of their works being posted - with or without credit. This is a simple extension of two basic, general moral principles:

1. People are assumed not to consent to wrongdoing against them.

2. Consent must be given and cannot be assumed.

The simple truth of these basic principles can be demonstrated by considering other forms of wrongdoing. Should you assume that people consent to assault, or should you intervene to protect them on the assumption they don't consent? Should you assume that people consent to being defrauded, or should you intervene to prevent dishonest business practices?

As a general moral rule, you assume that people do not consent to having their rights encroached upon, and you are justified in intervening without explicit authorisation.

It is completely arbitrary to say, as you do, that:

1. We assume authors do not consent to people taking their works without credit;

2. We assume authors do consent to people taking their works with credit.

What possible basis is there for treating the two as complete opposites? There is none - neither rational, nor moral.

Your arguments fail to disclose any real basis for this distinction.

You rely on the idea that only copyright holders can enforce copyright. This is a bad argument on many levels.

- Firstly, we're not talking about enforcement of copyright, we're talking about the AO3 terms of service, the rules of the community that AO3 choose to implement. As stated elsewhere, those rules can be anything they want, but to be good rules they should reflect good moral standards.

- Secondly, even if it was a good argument, it would equally apply to the takedown of copied works which do not give credit. At law, to oblige someone to take down a work which is copied without credit, the action would have to be brought in the name of the copyright holder. The only reason why universities and websites take down copied works without credit is because they voluntarily self police. And they are perfectly capable of equally self-policing the copying of works with credit.

Then you rely on the idea that people must not act to protect an author's rights unless that author has explicitly given them permission to do so or commenced the process themselves.

But again, this displays an inconsistency in your position. Because if people protecting the rights of authors could only do so with the author's explicit authorisation, then websites also could not take down copied works without credit unless the author kicked up a fuss. And yet by your own admission they rightly do not require an author's explicit permission to do so. There is in fact no general moral or rational principle that sites must not act to protect people's rights unless the victim themselves initiates a complaint.

Finally, you state that an author's absence justifies the idea that no one should protect them. This is clearly a morally bankrupt principle. If I had something in a deposit box and someone took it, but because I didn't check the deposit box I didn't realise it was taken so didn't kick up a fuss, would that render the theft morally acceptable? Of course not.

"Someone has to kick up a fuss first before immoral act becomes immoral" is an indefensible moral standpoint. The fact that the author isn't around to complain doesn't mean it's okay to take their work.

Finally, you query why I care so much. This should be obvious:

1. I am an author so I care about other authors having their work taken, and I care doubly when no one seems to give a shit about the casual wrongdoing playing out in front of them.

2. I am a member of the private community from which the work in question was taken.

3. There are very good reasons for society to create the social construct of protecting the works of creative individuals, because most creators would not create if they could not control the distribution of their creation.

4. Beyond that, there are additional good reasons for insular, close knit, collaborative communities like the fanfic community, of which I am a member, to have common standards of solidarity which hold people to a higher standard than their bare legal obligations. And one of those standards is don't nick other people's shit.

5. As a moral individual, I have an interest in preventing immorality.
