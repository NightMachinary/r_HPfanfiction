As a matter of fact, plagiarism and piracy *are* treated the same at law. Which is to say, both are infringements of the author's copyright.

Piracy is an infringement of the author's right to commercially exploit their work. Plagiarism is an infringement of that right, plus the right to be recognised as the author of the work. Both rights are aspects of the author holding copyright in the work, though it is possible to separate the two out if the author sells one but not the other.

But I say this merely as a point of interest, as I don't think copyright law has much to do with what AO3's terms of service should be.
