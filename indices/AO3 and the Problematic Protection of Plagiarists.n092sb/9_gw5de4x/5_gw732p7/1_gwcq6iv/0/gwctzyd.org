But they don't know what the author has stated. If I wanted to repost a fic, I'd do it as follows: I'd PM or email the author for permission, and if I got it, I'd go ahead and repost. But the permission would most likely be made in private.

The presumption of innocence then dictates that it should be assumed that I did contact the author and got permission before reposting, unless there's some evidence to the contrary.
