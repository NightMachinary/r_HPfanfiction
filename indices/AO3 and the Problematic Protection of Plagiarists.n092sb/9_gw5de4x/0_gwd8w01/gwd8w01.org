I agree. This isn't 2012, and fanfiction, particularly more prominent fanfic like this, is real property. DLP is one thing because though its member-locked anyone can sign up for an account so its still in another sense 'public,' but that's only the smallest of problems that can result from this sort of policy.

Imagine for a moment you are an author who is literally paying the bills by offering early access to chapters that will later be publicly posted. This is a classic way to build revenue for yourself by leveraging your fanfiction writing.

By stealing that work ahead of time, such a poster is devaluing the product offered by the writer, and potentially depriving them of revenue. And that's /if/ they credit the original author, which they may not actually do, Ao3's policy doesn't seem to preclude it.

And sure, you might say that this is (ethically) no different from pirating an anime, but I think that loses sight of the fact that:

- the 'victim' here would an independent author who's making very little (or potentially no) money here, not some mega-corp that will actually benefit from 'the exposure.'
- The IP is only being gated for a week or two at most
- Ao3 isn't a piracy site.

and I'm sure this is where tons of people will jump in to tell me that transformative writers don't deserve to get paid because they're stealing IP themselves which.... gosh, I really just don't have time for that argument. Writing transformative fanfiction of someone else's IP is not the same thing as literally conducting espionage to steal and redistribute someone's work /without their consent/ .

But if I've lost you because I'm talking about piracy and copyright and all that shit, consider this alternate thought: What if the author decided that they /never wanted/ that beta chapter to be published? Not now, not ever. What if they included a thoughtless line that promoted rape culture, or had a character make a comment that came across as racist or sexist in a way they didn't like? What if they used a word without realizing it was a slur? (See: any american trying to write about european traveling communities) In a private beta forum like DLP, people understand that its beta work and will be gentle about offering correction. It's entirely conceivable that an author might decide to scrap a project entirely, realizing that the premise itself is unworkable.

But if someone circumvents that process, steals the work, posts it without permission and then credits that author /without their consent/ that author will forever have their tag associated with things that they did not want to be associated with. Authors should have a right to publish their works when they want, and to have their works /not be published when they do not want./ This is super basic stuff.

Gosh, I could list examples, but I fear that would just get me too much in the weeds. Suffice to say that 'giving credit' does not allow you to steal someone's work. Good Grief.
