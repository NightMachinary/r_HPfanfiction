/Reproducing the content of the post here as the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] mods are apparently very protective of AO3.../

There is a story in the Harry Potter fandom called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], written by The Santi. With 12,000 favourites, it's pretty well known.

The Santi was also a member of the DarkLordPotter forums (DLP). Those forums have a private subforum called "Work by Author" (or "WBA") where authors can share their draft works with beta readers for comments and revisions prior to public publication.

In addition to the 12 chapters which The Santi published publicly on FF.Net, there were an additional [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/harry-potter-and-the-boy-who-lived.17021/][6 chapters]] posted in draft, incomplete form in the private WBA subforum on DLP.

An unscrupulous individual going by the nick "BadWolfe" has [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21393430/chapters/50965216][reposted]] The Santi's fic on AO3. Worse, they have taken the private, draft chapters from DLP and published them publicly, even though The Santi intended to make further revisions to them before posting and had deliberately not added them to the publicly-accessible FF.Net version of the story.

A number of people reported this plagiarism to AO3. This is their response:

The key section:

#+begin_quote
  In order to investigate a claim of unauthorized reposting, we require at least two of the following: proof that the user did not ask for or receive permission, proof that the original creator has previously stated that they do not give permission for anyone to reproduce or redistribute their work, and an accessible link to, or copy of, the original source.
#+end_quote

This is a horrible and frankly immoral policy which cannot possibly be justified. AO3 apparently operates on an assumption that all authors /consent/ to the plagiarism of their work unless they have explicitly said "no".

That's not how consent works.

Where someone has posted another person's work, the obvious assumption must be that (i) it is not their work, so they have no right to post it, and (ii) they do not have permission unless they can show that permission was obtained. In cases of apparent plagiarism, deletion must be the default, with the plagiarist only getting a reprieve if they can show that the original author consented.

The idea that it is the responsibility of the reporting party to prove a negative - prove that permission was not given - is absurd. Lack of permission for other people to take your work is implied. It is especially implied when you have only ever posted that work to a private, members-only forum inaccessible to the public.

AO3's policy in this area is completely shameful.
