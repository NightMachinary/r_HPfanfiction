Er, no. I'm very much sympathetic to your concerns, and I'm a moderator at [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] . The post wasn't removed because we're protective of AO3 at that subreddit. I for one don't condone this policy over at AO3. The reasons were:

#+begin_quote
  It's not allowed to post links to fictions on the main of the sub. We also don't allow pointing out fingers to concrete fictions, attacking them.
#+end_quote

My guess is that if the links were removed and the example were made more general over there, it would be reinstated. IOW, it's a subreddit policy issue.

BTW, I did not make this decision specifically, nor was I involved with it. I just woke up and saw it in the deleted queue.

There's also an [[/r/AO3][r/AO3]] subreddit where this could perhaps be reposted in some form.
