  In order to investigate a claim of unauthorized reposting, we require at least two of the following: proof that the user did not ask for or receive permission, proof that the original creator has previously stated that they do not give permission for anyone to reproduce or redistribute their work, and an accessible link to, or copy of, the original source.
