I reported a repost and gave links and info to AO3. It took like 3 months but they took the reposted work down.

I was also not the author. The author had only posted their work on ff.net and then deleted it. It was part of a small fandom so it felt weird no one else had reported it! I think they just take time to make sure they're doing the right thing.
