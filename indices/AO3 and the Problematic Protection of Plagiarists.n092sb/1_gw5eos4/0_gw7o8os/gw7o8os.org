I think this is to make sure that somebody isn't revenge reporting plagiarism. A lot of people crosspost their fic to other platforms, and there are some people that for whatever reason don't like the author, so a lot of the time they will report the fic to the mods.

This sort of rule is also on Wattpad and I think FFN implemented this policy as well.

The original author is able to do the takedown order and is able to then present further evidence that they are victims of plagiarism when the mods reach out to them. However, this is bad news for fanfic authors that are no longer active on their platforms. On Wattpad there is a plagiarist that uses this fact to their advantage and will post fanfic from these inactive writers because they know that the site won't do anything.

Mind you, Wattpad is notoriously bad for even doing anything when the writers themselves reach out to get the plagiarised copies of their work removed. One writer found out her story was plagiarised back in 2018 and the story is still posted there under the plagiarist's account who bailed the moment they found out that the original author was on the warpath.
