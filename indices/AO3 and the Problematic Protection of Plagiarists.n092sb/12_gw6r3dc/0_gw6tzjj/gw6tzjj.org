Varies by author. In the case of Harry Potter, JKR has given blanket permission for people to write fanfic, with the exception of sexual content, which she asked people not to write (and actually commenced legal action to shut down RestrictedSection.org to get rid of it). But most people seem to ignore that caveat and JKR hasn't sued anyone over HP since she sued HP Lexicon.
