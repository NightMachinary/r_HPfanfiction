It's not plagiarism, but it is ethically wrong.

That said, many sites will not remove uploaded works that are posted without the creator's permission unless the creator themselves complains. Ao3 is not the only site that has this policy.

It's disrespectful to the original creator, but it isn't illegal and Ao3 has no legal requirement to do anything unless contacted by the creator or someone designated by the creator to speak for them (such as a lawyer).
