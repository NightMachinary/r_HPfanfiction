Sorry, but wholesale copying and pasting of someone else's work without claiming to be the author isn't plagiarism. That's pretty basic stuff here, champ.

Or do you think music piracy is plagiarism? That someone posting a copy of a Tayor Swift album is a plagiarist? Certainly not.

It's the same with reposting. Unauthorised reposting isn't plagiarism unless the poster claims to be the author.

Please check the definition of plagiarism.
