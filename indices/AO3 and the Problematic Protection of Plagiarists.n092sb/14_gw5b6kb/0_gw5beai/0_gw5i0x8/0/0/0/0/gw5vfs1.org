The point is that just giving anyone leave to have a work taken down as an unauthorised repost is incredibly open to abuse. Plagiarism you can prove with links to the original work. Unauthorised reposting? If you don't require proof that the author is behind the demand, you force authors to defend their work from every jerk that reports them - or, worse, have to contact Ao3 to get their work restored. That's especially bothersome if, which isn't uncommon, authors use different nicknames on different sites.

And I said before: In this case, the fact that they were posted on a semi-private forum might be enough to get the stuff taken down. But blanket permission without any, much less solid, evidence that the author wants something taken down? That's how plagiarism is handled, correctly, but would be incredibly dangerous to extend to reposting.
