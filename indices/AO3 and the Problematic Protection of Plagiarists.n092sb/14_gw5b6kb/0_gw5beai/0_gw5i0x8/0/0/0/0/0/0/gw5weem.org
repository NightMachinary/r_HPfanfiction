No, I am saying scrutiny and standards /should/ be applied. Just going by "oh, yeah, you claim this is an unauthorised repost, let's take it down without checking if you're representing the author" would be sloppy and wrong.

Because ultimately, whether or not something is an unauthorised repost and should be taken down is the author's decision - not anyone else's. Certainly not the decision of someone who can't even be bothered to prove that they are representing the author.

Whether or not that's the case in this case depends on details I'm not privy to and would be up to debate in any case.
