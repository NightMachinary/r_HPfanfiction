I think the worst part of it is just how impractical the policy is.

E.g. the demand for a publicly accessible link to the original work. The whole point is that the original work was posted to a private, members-only forum which is not publicly accessible. Or the demand to prove that the plagiarist didn't ask for permission. How is the reporting party supposed to have access to the plagiarist's messages?

It's basically the creation of criteria with the deliberate aim of making plagiarism complaints impossible to sustain.
