I don't know what was said as the post has been removed, but I feel that the mods on AO3 take plagiarism more seriously than the mods on Wattpad. Speaking as somebody who had to deal with plagiarism on both these platforms, the mods on AO3 looked at my evidence and removed my stories while Wattpad allowed my stories to be under somebody else's name for months until they finally deleted them.

And I know so many other authors that have complained years ago that their fics have been reposted without their permission, and they are still up on the site where commenters on the plagiarised story go on witch hunts against those that accuse the plagiarist and the actual authors of the fic.
