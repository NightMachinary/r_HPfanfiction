Lots of authors cross-post. You're basically asking AO3 to have a policy again cross-posting except by special exemption. There's no reason for that.

Edited to add: and you're forgetting that one of the reasons ffn sucks is that people do make baseless accusations against fics there, and ffn takes them down without giving the authors a chance to defend them, just like you're asking AO3 to do. There are organized mobs making baseless accusations against stories just because they're a ship they don't like or whatever.
