The vast vast majority of cross-posted fics would never be reported because it would be apparent that they are cross-posted by the original author. This is how the fandom worked for years without any problems at all before AO3 came along.

Edit: just realised this entire discussion (including all the exchanges below) was a pointless tangent. We're talking about removal of copied works that give credit to the original author. The very act of giving credit unambiguously signals that the poster is not the author and therefore doesn't have the right to post it. So there is no practical problem with identifying which fics to remove.

The practical issues you are talking about only really come up with people taking other people's fics /without/ giving credit. But even the posters in this thread who support taking other people's works without permission seem to hold the view that sites should remove those works that do not give credit.
