The common sense approach is: If an author is bothered by a repost, they can inform the site. That's easy and quick.

The "a third party wants a repost gone, but doesn't want to or can't contact the original author" is a really rare case. To alter the rules merely to accommodate a few people who want to act in someone's name feels rather against common sense. If you can dismiss the possibility of abuse of your proposed rule so easily, then dismissing your case here as one of a kind is even easier.

Normally, someone tells the author about this, and they decide how to react, case closed.
