I'm not going to accuse you of deliberate stupidity, since it's probably not deliberate, but “the same name” as proof it's the same person? Seriously? You probably think every handbag labeled “Gucci” is genuine Gucci.

And as I said, it's really common to cross-post, and there's no reason the stories would be posted at the same time. Lots of people posted on ffn first and AO3 later.

And sheesh, you're requiring writers to interact with commenters as “proof” that they are who they say they are? First, that's not proof, and second, why should writers have to do that? They don't owe commenters replies.
