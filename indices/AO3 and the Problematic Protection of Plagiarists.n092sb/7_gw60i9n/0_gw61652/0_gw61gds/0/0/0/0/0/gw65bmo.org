These are all very easy problems to resolve by the exercise of sensible judgement - the "common sense" I referred to. I am not setting out an algorithm or strict requirements of proof and have repeatedly said as much.

My position is not "authors must interact with readers to prove who they are". That was simply an example of one possible factor amidst the host of factors within the factual matrix that a decision maker would take into account when making their decision.

There is no need to set out a kind of recipe for how to prove you are an author when a human will be making a judgement with a view to all the circumstances in accordance with their common sense. Particularly where those circumstances include messages exchanged with the user in question, who (in the rare event that the account is in fact genuine and not a plagiarist) can respond to concerns with perfectly reasonable, common sense explanations such as "yes, that account is mine, here, look, I just edited the profile to say that the two accounts are the same person".
