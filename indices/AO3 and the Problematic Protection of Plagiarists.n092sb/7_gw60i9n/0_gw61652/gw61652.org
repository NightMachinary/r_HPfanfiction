Your predictions of chaos are not borne out by the fact that every other site operates that policy without chaos. All it takes is a bit of basic common sense.

1. Send report: "This fic on your site is a copy of this fic posted on another site."

2. Admin reads the report, looks at the two fics, and if the one on their site is indeed a copy with a later posting date, removes it.

3. In the exceedingly rare case that it is the same author, that author can message the admins on being notified that their fic has been deleted to say "actually that was my fic" and the fic is reinstated.
