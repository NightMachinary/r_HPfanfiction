That is not remotely true.

Many, many sites, including reddit, FFnet, imgur, pinterest, etc have absolutely no rules against reposts. In fact, reddit and imgur would probably die off if people couldn't upload content they found elsewhere. It's considered good manners to credit the original creator, but that's not enforced by the administrators of those sites.

What you are referring to is not an act of plagiarism, but of reposting. The two things are not the same.
