I used to run a HP fanfiction site where I would repost stories by different authors, that were posted at other sites or private message boards. My own personal rule though, was that I would never post a story without permission. If I found stories I wanted to add to my site, I would attempt to reach out to the author as ask for permission. For the most part, as I was asking permission, they were more than willing to allow it. There was one instance of an author not responding to my request, so I did not repost that authors stories. To me, it is only courteous to obtain permission, and not do it without first getting that permission.
