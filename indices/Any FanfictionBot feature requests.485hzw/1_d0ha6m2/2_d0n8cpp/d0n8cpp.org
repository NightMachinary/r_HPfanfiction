More generally, perhaps branch out into fanfic sites in general?

In fact, since both the bot and FanFicFare use Python, and since FanFicFare knows how to fetch fic metadata from [[https://fanficfare.appspot.com/][a hundred or so sites]], I wonder how difficult would it be to write a shim that would allow FFBot to support any site that FanFicFare does...
