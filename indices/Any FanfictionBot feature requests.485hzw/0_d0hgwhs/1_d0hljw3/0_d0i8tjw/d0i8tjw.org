Which is why I specified "easily spotted", because the Complete notation is not in the same location every time - it's simply in the middle of several lines of text. An icon, a color, bold - something to make it /easily spotted/ would be an improvement.

Not to mention, if it could be standardized across several archives, it would be awesome for users.
