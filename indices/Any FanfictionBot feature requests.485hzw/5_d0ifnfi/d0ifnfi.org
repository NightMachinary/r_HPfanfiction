Sorting. Have the stories listed in the same order they are in the original story. Make a stard order of the info (chapters, words, publish date, update date, etc) that is used regardless of source (although still dropping fields that are not available).

Make completed or not clearer. Nicely format number of words for sources that dont (i.e i think ao3 has words: 123456, but would lke to see 123,456).
