I think this could be interesting, but what would it show from the author page? People have all sorts of crap on there in the profile section, and some authors have too many fics to list.

For what it's worth, I'd personally probably want a link to (up to) 5 stories, prioritized by length but with another weight given towards finished stories. If they didn't have any stories of their own it could show some of their favourites?
