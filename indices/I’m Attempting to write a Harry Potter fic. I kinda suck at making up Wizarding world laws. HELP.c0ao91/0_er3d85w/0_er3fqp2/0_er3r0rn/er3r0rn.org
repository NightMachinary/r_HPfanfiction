  But Is the mother really a Muggleborn if her father”grandpa” was a wizard and her mother”grandma”wasn't?

+In canon yes, the mother's grandparent's don't come into play until after determining the parent's status.+

Read that wrong. If the grandpa is a wizard and the grandma is a muggle, the mother would be a half-blood (aka Tom Riddle) so it wouldn't make sense to call the mother a Muggleborn in canon.However, you could have her called a Muggleborn if that is how it gets classified by your Wizarding law. In canon the daughter would be a half-blood regardless of the father because the mother would be half-blood.

For you're story, if the daughter is looking to find a way to be Sirius's heir apparent you might look into laws that define the legal status of what is considered "Muggleborn", "Half-Bloods", and "Pure-Bloods" and maybe attack that so she could be in the line of succession.

Why is she attacking criminal law if she wants to be the heir apparent to Sirius who, it sounds like is the heir apparent to Arcturus? Sounds like it should be inheritance laws.
