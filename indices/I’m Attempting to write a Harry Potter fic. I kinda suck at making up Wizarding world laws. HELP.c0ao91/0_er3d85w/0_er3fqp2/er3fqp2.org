The story is going to be Sirius Black has an illegitimate daughter with a Muggleborn. But Is the mother really a Muggleborn if her father”grandpa” was a wizard and her mother”grandma”wasn't?

The law that the daughter is going to be looking at more is the criminal law. She's going to be focusing on some of the old family laws.(example I kind of have it in my head that the mother has a sit down with Arcturus and somehow convinced him to allow his heirs heir to take the family after Sirius) I can only see the second year so far.
