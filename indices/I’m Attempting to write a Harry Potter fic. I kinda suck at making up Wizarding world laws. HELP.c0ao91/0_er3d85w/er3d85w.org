You probably want to start by thinking of the direction you want the story to go, plot points you want to have happen, and what your version of the HP universe is like.

If you want your story to go in a direction of tearing down pureblood prejudices that are enforced by legal systems then you can focus on those laws. If you want to go in a direction of handling creature laws you go that way.

While having some laws in for world building is important, you dont want or need to add a bunch that arent going to be relevant to your plot. Everything the main character and, by extension the reader, learns should have a purpose. The spells Harry learns in canon are either used later in the case of most charms, jinxes, curses, and hexes, or serve to highlight the difference in power and abilities between turning a hedgehog into a pincushion and fighting the way Dumbledore and Voldemort do in the ministry fight. The same should follow for most of the laws you introduce.

Finally, the world you are building colors the laws you want. Is this pure canon? Make up laws that explain the apparent incompetence of the Ministry. Are you bashing the ministry? Make up laws that highlight your reasons for the ministry's incompetence. Are you taking the pureblood/Victorian nobility equivalence route? Make up laws dealing with things like inheritance and marriage contracts.

All of these are important things to think about before writing laws for your fic, and important to have somewhat laid out before asking for help. I could tell you that there was a law created in 1754 that stated it was illegal for a relative of an individual defeated in a duel to challenge the person that defeated their loved one to a duel over the death of their relative, but that law might have nothing to do with your world building and not help at all.
