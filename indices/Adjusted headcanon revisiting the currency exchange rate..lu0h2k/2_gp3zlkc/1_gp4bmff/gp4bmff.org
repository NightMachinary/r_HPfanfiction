Keep in mind that until the 1970s, money in Britain was one pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence. It's one of these many things that are less nonsensical and more very British.

The (or one, anyway) historical reason, by the way, is buying things by the dozen: So if one egg is a pence, you know at once a dozen eggs are a shilling. You could easily imagine the same for HP: A chocolate frog costs a Sickle, and one box of chocolate frogs contains 17 pieces and costs a Galleon. 17 could be a magically relevant number, and wizards often be buying things in 17s. This would make 17 Sickles a Galleon quite practical.
