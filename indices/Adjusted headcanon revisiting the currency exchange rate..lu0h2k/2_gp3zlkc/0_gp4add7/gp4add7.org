It's definitely JKR not taking the time to make it work, she has the math and logistics skills of an intoxicated pigeon that was recently run over by a bus. Her bad math skills are too pervasive in the work for it to be otherwise --- the number of students and teachers in Hogwarts (and for that matter the relative size of the wizarding world) is another example of where she presents a ton of inconsistent and nonsensical information that makes no sense if you think about it for more than like 10 seconds.
