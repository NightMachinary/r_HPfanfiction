The money in HP is nonsensical. I like to think it's deliberately so, but it could just be JKR not taking the time to make it work. My mind canon is that wizards have trouble with muggle money specifically because it does make sense, and they can't wrap their minds around the idea of money (or probably any numbers) making sense.
