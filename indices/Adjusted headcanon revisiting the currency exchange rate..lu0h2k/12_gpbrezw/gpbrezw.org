From looking at the prices as the books go on a clear picture of how JK handled money occurs. When she needed to come up with the cost for something she did so based on only a few criteria.\\
Particularly Cheap\\
Particularly Expensive\\
Rather Average\\
Very Specific

When the books started it was clear that wizarding currency fell into a status of Knut -> Coinage, Sickle -> Daily use denomination, Galleon -> High denomination. Things that were particularly cheap cost knuts, things that were rather average cost sickles and knuts, and things that were particularly expensive cost galleons. As the series went on though, there was a shift, and Galleon became used for both rather average items as well as particularly expensive ones. Knuts and sickles were only used for particularly cheap or very specific values. This shift to the 5 pound conversion rate style of thinking, where Galleons are the everyday currency rather than the high denomination, throws off all concepts of a consistent economy.

It's also wise to remember that when JK was writing the first books she was poor, and that as the series gained popularity that changed dramatically. To a poor single mother, the idea of dropping ~800 pounds equivalent (given inflation) on a single piece of school equipment would be much different than the idea of dropping ~35 pound equivalent on a joke product would be for a newly minted millionaire.
