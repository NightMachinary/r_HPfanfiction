Hell yeah. I did something similar, and arrived at 30 pound/Galleon. I took the known prices of items Knight bus ride (Hot chocolate, water and toothbrush, butterbeer,1 yr bookset, newspaper, WWW candy, Dobby's salary, Apparation licence) and looked up the price for modern nonmagical equivalents (I was too lazy to search for prices in 1995). I then averaged out the ratio of Galleons/pound and arived to 30pound ~ $41 per Galleon.

I *should* have taken inflation into account, but I reasoned that while the same amount in $ in 1995 would be worth more now, manufacturing costs are lower now, and hoped that they would even out.

We should keep in mind that some items in the Wizarding world would be manufactured cheaper, and some would be a lot more expensive (I think that mass production would be cheaper for us, and individualized items would be cheaper for the Wizarding world), and I hope that by averaging the ratio, that it would even out a bit.
