> Whyever would the goblins care about Muggle gold prices though?

Well, whichever version of Goblins JKR presented us you prefer to use as your personal head-canon, the one thing they are not is stupid.

As a penalty for one of their 'Revolts' the Goblins were given complete and utter control of the Wizard's financial system... or at least as much of it as we were shown. The value of a Galleon is pegged, by the word of Gohd, to 5 Pounds Sterling. In a situation where the value of the metal in the coin is worth substantially more than the face value of the coin itself, only an idiot with complete control of a culture's monetary system would not take advantage of that fact.

Think about it, if you had utter control of a nation's financials, could take advantage of an outside market willing to pay you almost 40 times the value of your base metal, AND through the all-powerful magic, were able to create perfect counterfeits, wouldn't you do it?

> a pile of that?

Another example of JKR using comparison examples that mean nothing. How big is a 'glowing coal'? Much like the much Obliviated owner of the campground's 'coin the size of a hubcap' example from the World Cup, it tells you nothing. How big is a coal? Having lived in Britain while coal was a common heating source for houses, I can tell you that you loaded the fireplace with chunks of coal smaller than a softball and that once lit they glowed from about four inches across to the size of pebbles.

As an aside, the local Brits found teaching the ignorant Americans, the bulk of whom had never seen, much less handled actual coal, how to start a coal fire to be highly amusing.

Which pile of glowing coals was Harry comparing the rubies to?

> And before anyone comes with the IAmVerySmart plot of melting down Galleons and selling the Gold for higher prices in the Muggle world

And if the Goblins themselves are moving the gold into the Muggle world for a massive profit? All of the Goblin protections won't matter in the slightest.

As far as the Ministry's ability to prevent trade with the Muggles... The head of that office was unable to determine the purpose of a Rubber Duck. I'm not sure how you came up with competence at any level of the Ministry given what we are shown in the books.
