Whyever would the goblins care about Muggle gold prices though?

It's clear from the moment we read PS that things aren't the same in the wizarding world. Internet source:

  As of 2020, the 125West is the largest ruby in the world. It is a rough stone and has not yet been polished, measures 4.8 inches x 4.4 inches x 5.27 inches and weighs an astonishing 8.2 pounds, which would be 18,696 carats.

And the goblins randomly handle

  Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

a pile of that?

Clearly, supply is entirely different in the wizarding world. Maybe demand is, too, but either way, the price of gold and gems can be anything, actually the only thing we /can/ say is that Muggle notions of worth don't matter.

(And before anyone comes with the IAmVerySmart plot of melting down Galleons and selling the Gold for higher prices in the Muggle world, the only needed answer to that is /It's Magic/ and the goblins did any number of things to prevent that; and for that matter, if you just try selling them we /know/ what happens to people bringing magical items into the Muggle world: The Ministry catches them, because it breaks the Statute, whose protection is their raîson d'être.)
