I'd never heard about the earlier 50 Pounds to the galleon exchange rate, only the even more nonsensical 5 to 1, especially if one believes the 'coin the size of a hubcap' line from the proprietor of the campgrounds at the Quidditch World Cup. Granted a 'hubcap' can be substantially smaller than what most Americans think when they hear 'hubcap' but a 2-inch coin made of solid gold hasn't been worth 50 pounds much less 5 since the US went off the Gold Standard.

I've even addressed it in a fic or two.

Twenty minutes later Harry and Neville were sitting in the Three Broomsticks following a short and for Neville, fairly expensive, stop at a local jewelry store.

Neville had ordered a butterbeer while Harry had asked for, and gotten a glass of water.

"Neville Franklin Longbottom!" The use of all three of his names had Neville looking for the speaker. He found her via Harry pointing at the raging brunette who was stomping toward the table the young men shared.

"Something wrong Hermione?" He asked, wondering what he had done to earn the use of all three of his names.

"You were supposed to have words with your grandmother." She said hotly as she sat down. "She approached my father yesterday and tried to negotiate a marriage contract."

"Oh hell." He said. "I did tell Gran no and that you weren't interested. She just told me that we were too young to know what we wanted, but I thought she'd gone off the idea. Are your parents angry?"

"She offered Daddy Half a Million Pounds. Half a Million! He says he's thinking about it. When I get home I am going to give him something to think about I assure you!"

"Half a million pounds?" Neville asked. "How much is that in real money?"

"One hundred thousand Galleons," Harry said, earning himself an odd look from both of the 6th year Gryffindor prefects. "What? The exchange rate is pegged at 5 Pounds Sterling to the Galleon. It's been that way since the goblins quit making Galleons out of gold in the early 1830s."

"What do you mean they quit making Galleons out of gold?" Neville asked.

"Everyone knows that Galleons are gold." Hermione agreed.

"Then 'everyone' is idiots," Harry said dismissively, fishing a galleon coin from a pocket, and held it up. "This coin weighs exactly 31.1034768 grams, that's one troy ounce. Gold closed yesterday at 369 US Dollars to the troy ounce, or 198.38 Pounds Sterling. That means that if this Galleon is made of gold, its exchange rate Sterling should be just short of 200 Pounds. Since the exchange rate is pegged to 5 Pounds, that means that the most gold that this coin could contain is less than .78 of a gram. The Goblins are a mercantile race, business is in their blood. There is no way in hell they would bankrupt themselves to keep the Wizards on the gold standard. This coin is charmed to look and feel like gold, but it isn't gold."

"Not gold?" Neville asked, shocked at the revelation.
