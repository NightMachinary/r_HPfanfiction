  First, it's important to note that there is only one thing in the books that had both a specific price and a real-world equivalent: that morning in "Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea," Hagrid has Harry pay five knuts for the daily paper.

Eh. There are more. The fare of the Knightbus (11 Sickles), a Butterbeer (2 Sickles), an expensive textbook (9 Galleons). [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2016/07/06/what-is-the-value-of-the-galleon/][This]] has a full list of prices.

And yes, my rule of thumb always has been a pound (or dollar) a Sickle, so roughly three times the rate Rowling set. But two things are clear in any case:

- 1) The Weasleys /are/ flat-broke. No amount of moving the rate up or down can change this, because this is true relative to the prices /in the books/. As you note, they go shopping for a full set of school supplies with a Galleon and change. That doesn't get them one new textbook, and is what Dobby earns per week in Hogwarts. (As a side note, now consider how awfully, awfully the fine for the car must've hurt them -- /50 Galleons/. Wouldn't be surprised if they had to take out a loan for that.) I'd vaguely estimate Arthur earns some 1.5k Galleon/year pre-HBP -- which, funnily enough, means Malfoy is entirely correct when he says they have more children than they can afford. With just one or two children, they wouldn't be rich, but living a modest life, if they could manage their money well.

- 2), some prices don't fit in or at least aren't where you would expect them to be. I don't think it makes sense that a wand costs less than a textbook. It (the wand) should be more like towards a hundred Galleons or so at least. An expensive item a lot of families need to save up for, so their children can get it. And the TriWiz tournament winnings of 1k Galleons is too little, if it's supposed to be as attractive as described in the books. It needs another zero or two for that. But /that aside/, the prices we see in the books are quite coherent. They fit, relatively to one another.

But indeed, I agree with the other comment: If there's one thing to take away from all this, it's that FF authors should start to think in Sickles. Sickles are coins. Galleons are bills. It always irritates me when figures in Galleons are thrown around in stories. No, unless your restaurant is ridiculously upper class, the menu will have prices in Sickles, not Galleons. No one lists prices for every day items in fractions of 20 or 50 pound/dollar bills IRL either.
