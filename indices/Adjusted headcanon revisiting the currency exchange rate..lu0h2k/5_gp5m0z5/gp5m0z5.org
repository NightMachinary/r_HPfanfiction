I like the idea that no Magical really knows how their economy works either. The Goblins run it, after all, so they're the ones who set everything. So, years back, they set values for Sickles, Knuts, and Galleons and then just never told anyone. People keep trying to find out, but the amount of paperwork and processing it takes to get those answers discourages all but the most dedicated - and they just disappear into Gringotts, never to be seen again.

Turns out the big secret is that there is no exchange rate, or set value for any of it. Goblins are warriors and craftsmen by both culture and disposition, not bankers, what the shit do they know about financial management? Whenever a wizard wants to exchange one currency for another, or trade galleons for sickles or whatever, the Goblin they interact with just... picks a number at random and gives them that much in return. If the Magical complains, then the Goblin just tells them to put in a complaint and it gets buried in the paperwork mines beneath Gringotts.

Basically, imagine if we enslaved every wrestler and mixed-martial-artist on the planet and gave them control of the economy just because they like to get paid and collect shiny things. They'd hate us too, and probably have just as much idea of how to manage a large-scale economy. :D
