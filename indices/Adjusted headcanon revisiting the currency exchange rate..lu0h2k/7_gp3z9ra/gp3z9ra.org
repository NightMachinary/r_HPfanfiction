I think it works better if you just have the economies not be linked. Like Gringotts will exchange some muggle money for galleons for the benefit of muggleborns under a treatise with the Ministry (with a price potentially set in stone centuries ago, yes the golbins would be angry at this, but they seem to be angry at wizards in general), but not more than needed.

Like if you try to exchange large amounts of currency you will just get told to fuck off.
