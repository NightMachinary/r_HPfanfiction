I actually have no problem with any "solution" as long as it results in 1 Galleon being more than £5. But I will admit that I prefer the explanations that try to relate it to the real world.

The problem remains however JKR's self admitted problem with math. The prices of various items makes no sense. A wand from Ollivander's a tool you will most likely keep your entire life is only 7 Galleon's £35 according to JKR, £350 to folks who went with the £50 to 1 exchange rate and now £175 with your £25 to 1 exchange rate.

Either way that still sounds very cheap for such an important tool that will see a lifetime of use. But then you have the Weasley's selling fake/trick wands for 5 Galleon's. Why would anyone spend that much for a fake wand when a real one only costs slightly more? And if you use a higher exchange rate purchasing a fake wand makes less sense.

As much as we love JKR's world and reading works from fanfic writers who play in it, it is quite clear that JKR didn't really plan out a wizarding economy and choose an amount out of thin air when she needed a character to purchase an item without realizing how it compared to other purchases.

With that said, I like the £25 to 1 exchange rate, hopefully fanfic writers will then try to better figure out all the other prices in relationship to that such that the economy seems more consistent (or at least do a better job of explaining the discrepancies).
