Even using JKR'S numbers I can't see anyone spending £25 for a rubber chicken. £5-£7 sure but not £25.

Absurdly expensive, I can't see making them the same price as a small car (which I have seen in a fic or two), but the same price as a computer, or a basic set of tradesman's tools that I can see.
