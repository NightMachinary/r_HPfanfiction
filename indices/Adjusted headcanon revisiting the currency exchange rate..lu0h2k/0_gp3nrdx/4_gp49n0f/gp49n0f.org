Nah. I agree the price of wands makes no sense (see above, or below, wherever my comment appears for you), but that and the TriWiz winnings are the exception. By and large, there is a coherent pricing level in the books. Not that that is very hard to achieve -- all you have to keep in mind is Sickles for small items, Galleons for big items. Things like Knightbus fares or Butterbeer get low Sickle numbers. Joke items low Galleon numbers. The textbook is 9 Galleons. Magical items cost many hundred Galleons.

In terms of what makes sense, FF is a lot worse. Harry forking over a couple Galleons for a Butterbeer is wutlol but really common.
