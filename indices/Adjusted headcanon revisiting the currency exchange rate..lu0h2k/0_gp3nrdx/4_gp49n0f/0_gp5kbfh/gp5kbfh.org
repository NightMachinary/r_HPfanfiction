IMO the wand price does make sense. When you think about it, after so many generations of wizards, the wizarding world must be awash with an excess of wands. It's not like they go bad over time, after all. And we see that it's quite common for wands to be passed down the family.

Ollivander is the only wand maker we know of in Britain, but that does not mean he has no competition. In truth his competition is the pre-existing large supply of family wands each wizarding family likely has access to - the difficult sales pitch he must make is persuading wizards they need to buy a new wand at all, instead of just using one of the family ones.

Yes, "the wand chooses the wizard". But we also know that this idea is an Ollivander innovation and is not universally accepted. Conveniently for Ollivander, the more wizards who accept this model of wand selection, the more wands he will sell...
