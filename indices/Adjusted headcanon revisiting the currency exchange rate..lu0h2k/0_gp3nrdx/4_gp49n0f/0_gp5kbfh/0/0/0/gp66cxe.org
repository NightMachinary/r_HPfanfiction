Yep it's canon that he harvests the ingredients himself. But that doesn't make him immune to the laws of economics and arbitrage --- the production side of his business would still be running at a loss. (e.g. why can't an enterprising apothecary buy all the Ollivander phoenix wands and resell them for parts?)

The conclusion I've come to is that:

- Phoenix feathers simply aren't consumed much outside of wand-making. (Where they are used they can be reused.)

- Even in wandcraft, phoenix wands are considered niche and often an unreliable match. (This is backed by Pottermore, which calls them 'rare', 'picky' and 'disliked' by many.) Ollivander might be the only wandmaker who even bothers with them.

So Ollivander is basically the only guy interested in phoenix feather and he only has to procure a few each year (which he can do thanks to a few family contacts).
