I don't think he /buys/ any of his ingredients. He speaks of Fawkes "giving" a feather. Similarly, in the Pottermore articles on wand wood he notes that not just any wood works for a wand - you have to carefully select what tree to take it from, based on qualities known only to the wand maker.

I think he just wanders the wilds obtaining the ingredients for himself.
