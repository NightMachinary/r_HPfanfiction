Yes but he still needs to turn a profit. How is he getting phoenix feathers for <5 Gal each?

Dragon heartstring and unicorn hair are more plausible. We know there is dragon farming and a heart contains >20 heartstrings. Unicorns aren't farmed, but each unicorn has hundreds of hairs. Otoh, phoenixes are rare, immortal and impossible to farm --- each dropped feather must be very valuable and every tear is worth a fortune.
