We'll have to disagree on that one. A Pagani or a Noble cost what they cost. The used car market doesn't affect this. Rather, the other way round, if you want to buy a used version of them, if you get one, /that/ price is influenced by the price for a new one. They can set the price at whatever they want, because people don't buy those because they /need/ one, but because they /want/ one. The price is fictive. The car would sell at one million or at five. They calculate their investments, add a margin that suits them, and that's the price.

And additionally, if Ollivander can get 10 Galleons for the hair, but 7 Galleons for the wand with a fuckton of overhead in terms of working hours invested, he's actually off his rocker if he sells the wand and not the hair. Which he might be, to be fair, but in terms of FF, I'm always going to tweak the wand price to 100 Galleons and up.

Ollivander wands are exclusive and prestigious magical artefacts, and I'm sticking with that :P
