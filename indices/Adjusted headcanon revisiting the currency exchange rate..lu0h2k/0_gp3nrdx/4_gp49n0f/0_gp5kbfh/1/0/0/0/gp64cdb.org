The simplest 'backsplanation' (because lbr we all know JKR is just terrible at maths) is that the unicorn hair price moved. Hogwarts has the UK's largest unicorn herd but they stopped allowing harvesting after the events of Philosopher's Stone, which caused the price to increase. Ollivanders had to raise his prices to compensate.

Alternatively, Slughorn is getting ripped off by his supplier. Ollivander is buying direct from Hagrid.
