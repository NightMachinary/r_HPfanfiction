I think there's a few problems with this:

1. The analogy to the rusty MG shows the key disanalogy: old wands are not rusty. As far as we know, they are in fact just as good as new wands in terms of quality - wands do not deteriorate over time. The only difference is that Ollivander has a large stock of wands (many of which have been sitting on the shelves for decades) so if you go to him you are likely to find a better match. But a similar benefit could be achieved if you had a large stock of second hand wands and went through them to find your best match.

2. Furthermore, it is not clear that this benefit of a well-matched wand will even be recognised by most wizards. As stated, the idea that the wand chooses the wizard is an Ollivander innovation, apparently not followed in other countries, and the Pottermore articles about wandlore (written from Ollivander's perspective) demonstrate that many wizards prefer to identify for themselves what specification of wand they think suits them best, then they go out and seek to buy a wand of the specification they have identified.

3. Returning to the car analogy - the existence of a second-hand market /does/ in fact exert downward pressure on first-hand prices, even in the luxury car market. If there was no alternative to buying first-hand, you could expect first-hand luxury cars to be more expensive.

  . Remember that Slughorn prices one unicorn hair at 10 Galleons. So selling a wand with a unicorn hair for 7 Galleons ??? No profit.

It seems likely that Ollivander obtains his ingredients directly, through foraging expeditions, rather than by purchasing them on the market. So yes, Ollivander makes a loss if he "marks to market" his unicorn hair stock. But the "MTM" figure does not reflect his actual cash position, which is that he has obtained the unicorn hair for free and sold it for a price.
