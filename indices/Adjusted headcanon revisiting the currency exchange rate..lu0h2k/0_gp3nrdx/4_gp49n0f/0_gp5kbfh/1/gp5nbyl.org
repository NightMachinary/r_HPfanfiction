Well, we know wizards can get (sometimes? often? always?) buried with their wands.

But leaving aside that, yes. On the other hand, no. /Is/ his competition the second-hand market?

It would contend that it is not. His niche is selling new wands that are attuned to the user. It's an entirely different item. You don't sell a supercar cheap because any hobo can buy a rusty MG for spare change. It would make no sense. Either the supercar sells at the pricepoint or it doesn't, but you can't make it cheaper, because it costs a ton to make. And wands are the same. Remember that Slughorn prices one unicorn hair at 10 Galleons. So selling a wand /with/ a unicorn hair for 7 Galleons ??? No profit.

As a personal side note, I would go without dinner for weeks if it meant getting the best wand I could have. Maybe there is an exception for a wand of an ancestor, if it fits, but otherwise, I can't even image what people are thinking that are settling with slightly-below-average quality for the most important (and sloppy-second-state for the most intimate) tool that exists for wizards.
