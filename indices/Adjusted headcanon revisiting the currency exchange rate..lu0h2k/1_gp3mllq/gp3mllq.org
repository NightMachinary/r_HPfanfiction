Yes, I agree with you that £5 per galleon is nonsense, and that JKR is more or less a dyscalcul. Thank you for the history of the effort. The only problem I have is that it is based on so extremely cheap product as newspapers. I can imagine quite easily that in the small market of the Wizarding Britain newspapers could be relatively more expensive and then you can get easily to that 5Op price (moreover, how much owl delivery costs; isn't it significantly more expensive than Royal Mail? that could be another justification for the higher cost of the British Wizarding newspapers v the British Muggle ones). So, I would gladly accept either £25 or £50 per galleon.
