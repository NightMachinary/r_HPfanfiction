Don't let the slash hold you back because, at least though the 5th book, there isn't much of it in the story.

I've read through the first five stories of the series and I don't think Harry/Draco share their first kiss until the fourth story in the series and there are only chaste touches between them (arms, shoulders). By the end of the 5th book, there is still only kissing and minimal touching (the reason for this is in the plot). Most of their relationship in the early series is friend-like, with them being highly protective of one another.

Also, the relationship is not by any means the focus of the story as the author has so much (too much) going on in the stories plotwise.
