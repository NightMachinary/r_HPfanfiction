Any story that where the pairing isn't Harry/Ginny or Harry by himself. You could tell me it's the best story ever written but if it's slash or Harry with basically any other girl I'm not going to be that interested. I have my pairing and I like it, seeing Harry with someone else just feels wrong to me.
