It's definitely long as fuck, but it is rather unique. You don't have to worry about encountering any of the fandom's infamous tropes; there aren't any. The fic has other faults (I'm not fond of the ending of the second book in particular), but it is definitely worth a read, especially if you like mystery stories.

I'd say you should give it a go; you needn't read the entire trilogy if you don't like the first book.
