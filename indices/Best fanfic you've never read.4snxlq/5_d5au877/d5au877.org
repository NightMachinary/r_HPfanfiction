Sadly it isn't in the HP fandom. It is in the A:TLA fandom: linkffn(Embers by Vathara). However, in the HP fandom, I'm partial to linkffn(Knowledge is Useful, But Power is Power by DisobedienceWriter). It actually shows the consequences of messing with powerful and not thoroughly understood magics. There are some creative uses of the original magics used in canon in it too.
