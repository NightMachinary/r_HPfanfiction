Embers is fantastic, and I love the depth of history it adds to ATLA. I honestly really recommend reading it when you get the chance, because the author did amazing things with Zuko's character. It gave the world more realistic consequences and a more in-depth history, but it stays really true to the characters as they are in the show.
