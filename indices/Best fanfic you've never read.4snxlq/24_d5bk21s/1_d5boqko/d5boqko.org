I have copies of Telanu's collected Snarry I can send you. I have mixed feelings about The Tea Series, mostly because it turns into a different fic about halfway through (going by memory, because I read it 10 yeas ago). But Telanu is a very good writer. The shorter pieces are lovely little tidbits, although a couple are quite melancholy.

If you have an email address you're comfortable giving out, I'm happy to share.
