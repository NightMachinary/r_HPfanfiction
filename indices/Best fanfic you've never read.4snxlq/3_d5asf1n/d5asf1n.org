I want to say 'Methods of Rationality', but I made it about twelve chapters in before I gave up my interest. Had a similar experience with Wastelands of Time, Emperor, Prince of the Dark Kingdom, and Renegade Cause.

Ones I've never opened include the Denarian series, Sacrifices arc, Dangerverse, Shoebox project, and Grow Young With Me.

This appears to be another case of self-sabotage motivated by reactive defiance.
