I'd agree with most of these, I somehow made it halfway though Methods of Rationality before I dropped it, never really got into Prince of the Dark Kingdom and haven't even read Emperor. It took me three tries before I finished Wastelands, it had some great moments but the parts of the fic between those moments weren't that engaging for me.

The only reason I made it through Renegade Cause was because I was on a trip with no Internet and nothing else to do in the down time. It took me over 200k words to finally get into it, I ended up really liking the second half but because of the first part I have a hard time actually recommending it to people. Plus the sequel has been dead in the water for four years...
