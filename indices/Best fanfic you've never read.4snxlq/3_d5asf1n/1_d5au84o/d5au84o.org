Your list is very similar to mine. Those fics which are both really long and very au seem more like projects than books to read, to me. I've read HPMOR (don't waste your time if you got to the laughing juice and you didn't like it) and grow young with me. I quite like GYWM, but it probably isn't for everyone. It's kind of . .homey, and I really enjoy the fact that everyone is an adult.
