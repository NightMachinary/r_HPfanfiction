Honestly, I find it part of the charm of both of the fics. When the narrator of Strangers of Drakeshaugh says "Okay James, let's pick up our toys!" and little James replies "No, Mom'll pick 'em up wiff a wave ofa wand," and the narrator rolls her eyes, it's funny, and there's some of that nudge-nudge going on in both of those fics. Strangers has a CSI-esque subplots following Harry as an auror at his office which is pretty good.
