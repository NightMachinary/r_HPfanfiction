It's stupendously well written and very accurate for the muggle world of the time (as far as I know). That being said Snape is completely whitewashed, his every bad action is a mistake or a misunderstanding, and the Marauders are non-existent, showing up only when absolutely necessary based on canon and frankly none of them are ever /that/ mean to each other and IIRC even become somewhat friends at the end.
