The writing is superfluous(there are a lot of parts where you wonder why did the author bother writing this ?) and the author kind of has an inexplicable love for the word 'countenance'. Then there's the very awkward menage de troi development(which admittedly is how awkward i'd imagine it to realistically be; it's not very engaging to read), I read about 70 chapters and then just forgot about it; it was very run of the mill with nothing that really made it stand out.

But this is just my experience after having been reading hp fics for wayyyy too long now.
