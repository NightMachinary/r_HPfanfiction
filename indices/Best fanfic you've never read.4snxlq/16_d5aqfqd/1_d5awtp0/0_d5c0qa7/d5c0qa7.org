That's how I felt. I liked it up until they forced Hermione into it. Ive read lots of Harry/Hermione before but I hate how she's always forced into other relationships.

Just like how its almost impossible to find a Harry/Harem story without Hermione in the harem. I just can't see her in one as I think goes completely against her character (not that harem fics are that believable anyway).
