I found the first one to be extremely trying. I didn't like Alex, I didn't like any of her friends, and EVERY adukt was a useless asshole who spent effort to make Alex's life even more difficult. It drove me up a walI. I mostly finished it in a huff of righteous protest. "Fine, I'll read it so I can be absolutely certain how terrible this is and warn people to NEVER read this fic".

I love, love, love the others. Love them. They're perfect and tragic and heartwarming and clever. I mourn the fact that book five is stalled. Even given my struggles with the first book, I'd rank Alex quick as the second or third best fic I've ever read.

Just a (passionate) perspective.
