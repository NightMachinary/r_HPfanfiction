The only Sara's Girl fic I've read is /Turn/, which is one of my favorites. Yet to read the rest, but I'm looking forward to them!

I've yet to read linkffn(Wand and Shield), which is probably because I'm not all that interested in Avengers. Will make some time to read it in the future; I like the author's other crossover fic /The Wizard From Earth/.

linkffn(The Life and Times). Started it a couple of years back and couldn't get past the first chapter. I plan to give it a fair shake sometime in the future, but it is so fucking long.

/Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ is supposed to be well written and great, but evidently the author bashes Ron and Molly, which is a dealbreaker right off the bat. Fuck that.

I also haven't read linkffn(Vox Corporis by MissAnnThropic). I've taken it out like half a dozen times, but then I read the summary, which has to be the least interesting summary of all time. And then I read the author's note, which says that the story is based on movie "cannon" instead of book canon. And lastly, the thought of reading a 350k word H/Hr romance fic written in 2006 is like the least compelling thing ever.
