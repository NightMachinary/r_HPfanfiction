It's very long, an AU and a crossover with Kancolle, but I would recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And The Shipgirls]] where Harry is discovered and adopted by the Battleship Nagato (no not the crew, the /actual/ Battleship).

While the story starts off as snippets of Harry's early life in a Japanese Naval Base, it soon settles down into an actual approximately-linear story, albeit one with lots of side-stories.

And it has some of the cutest Abyssal Entities that you'll ever see...
