I personally enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11959184/1/Hadrian-Lannister-Lion-of-the-Rock][Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock]].\\

The other recommendations in this thread are all good as well. My personal favorite would probably be The Black Prince.\\
Edit: Whoops. Forgot to mention that Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock doesn't have romance YET. The author has stated that Hadrian will be remarrying but hasn't given anymore information than that.
