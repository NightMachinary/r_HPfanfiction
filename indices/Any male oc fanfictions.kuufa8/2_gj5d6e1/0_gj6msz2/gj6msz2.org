I really like this fic, read it on RRL and the Author reads the comments, the MC has his own adventurer's and friends, his own goals in life, its long with almost 100 chapters with several story arcs and the Cannon Characters is almost not mentioned, and the author updates every 1~2 weeks.

This is basically the Fic that removed my bias of Harry Potter fanfics and frankly i am still looking for similar fics with OC having their own life instead of either helping Harry or becoming some kind of God.
