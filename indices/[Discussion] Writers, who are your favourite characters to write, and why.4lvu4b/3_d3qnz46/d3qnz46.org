My favorite? I suppose it's Harry, because he's the central figure in all my fanfiction (so far), but there are other characters I've found I enjoy writing. Sirius is one, mainly due to my main fic, which features Sirius quite a bit. Also, and this is solely because of that fic, Mulciber. He's practically a non-entity in canon (he shows up in the DoM battle and only then it's Malfoy saying his name), a blank slate, really. I took the name and pretty much built an OC under that faux-canon banner and he's always fun to write. Whenever he shows up, a scene automatically becomes better.
