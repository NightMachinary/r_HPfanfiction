Sirius Black, because I write best in 1st person narrative and comedy is usually my main focus. I enjoy implying something happened and letting my readers imagine it further, which is a tactic I find works best when I'm writing from the perspective of a self-centered character. Lockhart is another favorite of mine, because I find it hilarious when he ignores the main plot entirely to focus on something only he thinks is important. Sometimes it turns out it matters, generally it's just jumping down another rabbit hole.
