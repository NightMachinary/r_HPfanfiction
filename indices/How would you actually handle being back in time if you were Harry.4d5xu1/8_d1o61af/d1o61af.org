I'll be potentially controversial here and say that there are two things that some people might happen to not notice that we should remember about:

1. Magic is intent-based, so it may not be possible for us to get protection from death by being /unwilling/ participants in Tom's resurrection ritual because the desire for the protection would make us /willing/ participants; remember, “forcibly taken” may refer to many things, and there's no guarantee.

2. The whole “wings of a butterfly” thing means that we can't guarantee everything going the same way, and in any situation where stuff depends on chance (meaning: every single “crisis” situation Harry was in) there's no guarantee of us being just as lucky, so again there's no guarantee that we'll succeed by following the same path.

*If* it so happens that we get lucky then sure, we could get through it the same way and just repeat Harry's path, for whatever bizarre reason we'd want to do that.

/I/ wouldn't count on luck, so instead I'd assume that getting this scenario would be unlikely enough to be counted as an impossibility.

And if we happen not to get that, then we will need some way to contain Tom until we die and we will need to avoid as many of those crisis situation as we can. To get him contained, we need for the ritual to happen (with someone who is guaranteed to fit the ritual's requirements that are a bit unclear) and for Tom to immediately be captured without having a chance to truly fight; for this we need a death eater guaranteed to be loyal to our cause, and at that point we'd only have access to three: Snape, Pettigrew, Malfoy. Obviously, Pettigrew's loyalty cannot be counted on, and without going through Narcissa Lucius might very well be beyond our reach, so Snape it is (though, optimally, I'd want to get Pettigrew doubting and thinking that Snape works for Tom so that he'd lose the hand instead of Snape, for as big of an arse Snape is I wouldn't want him maimed when it could be avoided); with Snape on our side we could get the ritual to go through, and have a supply of draught of living death to dose Tom with and then build some contraption to keep him dosed until I die and sink him in acid when I die or something (easier than it looks considering that any enchantment of mine would stop working when I die, so building a natural thing with the harmful stuff and relying on my magic to keep him not dying would work). And this means going to Dumbledore and telling him about everything is probably our best bet, as he's a way to get Snape on our side and with knowledge of the things past/future he'd be able to help us avoid many of those crisis situations.
