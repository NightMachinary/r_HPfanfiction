You can get Voldemort just as easily by making it rain nukes on the UK while you're sipping chianti on the deck of a heavy cruiser sitting in the middle of a task force half the planet away. Bonus points? You know where they are, so if worst comes to worst-or you're a little queasy about the whole 20 million+ death toll thing... ya wuss- you can just drop off a bunch of suitcase nukes & leg it before the fuzz turn up.

Hell, you've heard the words 'Albania' often enough, which means you can basically trap his spirit in a forest and rain down some good ole fashioned fiendfyre and/or napalm until nothing within the forest is left alive-or undead, whatever the case may be.

I would rather leg it at eleven and come back after a two-year 'get some PTSD counselling + mercenaries who don't care that you gutted the mexican version of Fort Knox to send them to England' vacation than screw around with insane people that are either bipolar when it comes to celebrities or completely & utterly devoted to destroying me.
