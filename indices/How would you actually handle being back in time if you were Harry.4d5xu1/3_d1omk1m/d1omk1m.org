Wait, wait, wait... How many of you guys would actually head back to Hogwarts if you became a 19-20 year old Harry Potter that got flung back in time to his eleven year old self? Because, quite honestly, if I were in the situation where I knew just how badly things would get, I wouldn't hang around any more than I needed to.

Hell, I would be on Buckbeak with Sirius flying off to enjoy the tropics without so much as a blink-and that's at the latest /if/ I didn't manage to transfer out in the mean time.

Seriously, Hogwarts is Bad For Your/Our Health if your name's Harry Potter. A million things can kill you while a million more can leave you begging for death. I, in that situation, would freak out and leg it asap.

Because seriously? Surviving first year alone would be an insane task.
