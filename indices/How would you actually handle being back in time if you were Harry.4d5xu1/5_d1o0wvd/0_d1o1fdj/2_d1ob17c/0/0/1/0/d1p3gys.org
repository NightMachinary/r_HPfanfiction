Are you honestly arguing that killing Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, preventing WW2 and the Holocaust, would be worse than letting genocidal scum in charge of an entire Country? That the casualties from whatever rioting happened before the Military took over would have been worse than the death toll of WW2? Do you honestly think Germany would have been worse off?

But you're also wrong anyway with your fear of the consequences of killing all the DEs. Canon shows that society would not collapse nor would the goblins rebel since the exact scenario, just worse, happened in Canon when Voldemort fell: All those named DEs were dead or captured, the country had been through a war, a big part of the population had been disenfranchised, murdered or imprisoned, and Dumbledore was dead. And yet, Britain survived, and even prospered. Why on Earth do you think things would be worse with no war, much less dead, no persection of muggleborn, Dumbledore and Bones and others alive, and a Ministry not disgraced by having been a tool of genocidal maniacs?
