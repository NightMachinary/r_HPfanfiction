Hitler had the charisma to lead, and had the personal loyalty of Germans. If he had been killed early on it's unlikely that his movement would have survived to dominate Germany.

If we're argung about realistic consequences, then killing Malfoy and co. early won't make things worse. As I pointed out: After Voldemort's fall you'd do that anyway, just with more dead people and a more torn up country as a result of a civil war and attempted genocide. You'd have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to come up with a ccenario where killing the death eaters early makes things worse than killing or imprisoning them after a civil war.
