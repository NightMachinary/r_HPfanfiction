I think you seem to be misunderstanding what “good” means, in this case. Morality-wise, one murder is worse than many deaths that are not guaranteed to happen, especially when you are trying to prevent them from happening in other ways.

Now, if Draco /already was at the point where he could make that decision/, then clearly he'd get to a point where he did already go the same way and thus putting him down is acceptable. Because at that point Draco would already be a malicious person, whereas in the past he merely had the potential to become one, and the difference between the two is crucial here. You seem to be missing the point of that and applying the malicious one to the question that is only supposed to take the potentially malicious one who has not yet become simply malicious and whose road is not yet set.

Because if Draco already was at the point where he's not only thinking “oh, muggleborns are bad” out of ignorance but actively trying to seriously harm them, then it's obviously not the version of Draco from the past that I am talking about.
