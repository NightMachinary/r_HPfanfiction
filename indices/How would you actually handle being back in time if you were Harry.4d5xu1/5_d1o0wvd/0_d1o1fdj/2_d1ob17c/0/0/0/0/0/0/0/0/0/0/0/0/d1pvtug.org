I simply do not consider a course of action that endangers countless innocents as "good". And then it's just a question of what's the lesser evil.

Draco wanted all muggleborns at Hogwarts to die in his second year. He was a malicious person back then already. The only question is: Will he actually go through with it? Will he go through with having them killed indirectly? By financing the murderers?

I do not think giving him the chance to redeem himself is worth the risk. If killing him is not acceptable, then offering him the choice between an Unbreakable Vow and death is the least one can do.
