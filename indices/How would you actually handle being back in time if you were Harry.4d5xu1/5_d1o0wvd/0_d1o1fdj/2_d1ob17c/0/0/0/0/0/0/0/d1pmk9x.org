“Good”, yes, because he can still potentially be redeemed.

Good, as in pragmatic, optimal, stuff like that, heck no.

And now I will note, because you might not have noticed it, that I am not objecting to the decision itself or the arguments behind it; I am simply noting that it is not a decision that the “good” side will look at kindly because it's not a “good” decision, but as far as pragmatism goes it's probably better than the alternative of not doing them in anyway if one can stomach it, so I do agree with you that it's not a bad choice per se.
