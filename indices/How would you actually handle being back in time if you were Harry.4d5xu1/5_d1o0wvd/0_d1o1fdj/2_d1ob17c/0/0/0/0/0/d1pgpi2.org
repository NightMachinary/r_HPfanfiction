That's a good question. But then comes back this: is it really impossible to neutralise Draco without killing him?

I mean, if you simply want him out of your way then dealing with Lucius and making a deal with Narcissa would be enough, assuming she's willing to listen which she might if given reason to think that staying in Great Britain is unsafe. Only if that were impossible could you justify just outright killing Draco with something that isn't your greed (because the Malfoy vault and stuff).

But yes, Draco's redemption isn't worth much as far as we know. I just think that outright deciding to kill him because of what he could become is ... not a “good” decision, maybe an effective one or even the optimal one but certainly not a “good” one. Though, of course, not everyone is actually trying to be good.
