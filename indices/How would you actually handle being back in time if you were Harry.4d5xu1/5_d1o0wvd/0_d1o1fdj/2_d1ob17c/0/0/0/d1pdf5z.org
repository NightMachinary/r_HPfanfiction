I think it's more about the fact that no matter what Draco had the potential to become in the future, in the past he had not become that yet, and all the atrocities he would commit have not been committed yet.

Of course, yes, for as long as Lucius stays alive and Tom isn't completely dead it's very likely that Draco will follow the same path because he'd been raised to do so and it's natural to assume it happening again. But if you change things, there's the question: with each and every thing you change that could have caused Draco to become the kind of person who'd do those bad things, would he still be likely enough to follow the same path that killing him preemptively would truly be justified?

I don't like Draco as a character, I really don't. But I think we are a bit too quick to mark him as irredeemable when most of what made him a bad person comes from the way he was (or will be) raised and there's no proof that he is would be like that had his upbringing been different.

I fully agree about Lucius, though.
