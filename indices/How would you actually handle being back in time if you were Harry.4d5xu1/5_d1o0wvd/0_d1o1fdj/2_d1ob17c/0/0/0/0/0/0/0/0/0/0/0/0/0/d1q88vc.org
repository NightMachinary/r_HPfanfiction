  I simply do not consider a course of action that endangers countless innocents as "good". And then it's just a question of what's the lesser evil.

Then we are not answering the same question, and it's better that we agree to disagree, as I had already agreed with you about which option was better but you are getting hung on the question of morality as if it was necessary for it to align how you want it.

I am not saying that “oh, he absolutely needs a chance to redeem himself, no matter what”. For fuck's sake, the moment he takes the dark mark he's a lost case anyway. My point was that from the viewpoint of morality killing him when he's a kid and did nothing worse than being a jerk is not justified and is not morally good, and he cannot be written off as “clearly irredeemable” when he's still just that jerk kid; if you decide to off him for whatever reason even then then that's your prerogative and even potentially the optimal thing to do, but we shouldn't pretend that the option would be caused by morality in such a case if you are already changing the environment.
