Malfoy tries to massacre all muggleborn children at Hogwars. He is instrumental in crippling the Ministry, and indirectly almost gets Harry killed by Dementors through Umbridge. Killing him (and his family as well, so their gold can't be used for the same goals) as soon as possible is worth it twice over.

Also, if a bunch of mass-murdering scumbags are that important for society, then I don't see the point of preserving that society. It's like arguing that killing Hitler and his supporters would be a bad thing because his racist genocidal regime would be in trouble.

Power struggle? What power struggle? Dumbledore will step in and take over, and with the DE's gone there's no way Fudge will make trouble. The sheep left in Britain will rally around their saviour.
