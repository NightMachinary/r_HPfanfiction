Actually, I think all Malfoys should be killed off straight away and their vaults emptied. The longer Lucy stayed around, the more corruption there would be in the Ministry. Same thing with Umbridge.

With those two scums gone, Fudge might be a lot more reasonable. Other free running Death Eaters such as Yaxley, Avery, MacNair, and the Carrows should also be targeted, but they didn't have the corrosive influences Malfoy and Umbridge wielded.

If the good guys could loot Malfoy's assets, that would mean a gigantic strategic win. I thinking it was also important to have all Lestranges killed off in Azkaban, with Bellatrix dying as the last. If Narcissa was gone too, then either Andromeda or Sirius could inherit the Lestrange vault. The Cup would be a piece of cake and Longbottoms would be compensated accordingly.

Before Voldemort's resurrection in the graveyard, most of the 22 Death Eaters who showed up had to be eliminated. Aurors, the Order, and Dumbledore needed to be on standby. Once Voldemort fired the killing curse, he would most likely be knocked out too. That would be the perfect opportunity to restrain him and Wormtail. When Harry woke up again, he could execute Voldemort in any fashion.
