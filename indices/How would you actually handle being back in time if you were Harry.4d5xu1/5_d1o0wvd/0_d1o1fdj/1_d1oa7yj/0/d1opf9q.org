Actually, if you wait until Christmas ... invisibility cloak, Slytherin dorms. Kill all future death eaters in their sleep. Although my imagination is failing me on how to do so without it being found by priori incantatum. No, I take it back, you do it with one of their wands and leave it there. Wizards don't seem to know about fingerprints.

That should distract the parents nicely while other things get accomplished. Without hindrances.
