You're right. My statement in the first part assumes a canon-like Dumbledore with overall good intentions. My protections against obliviation in that scenario are merely out of my own sense of general paranoia, not paranoia that's specific to Dumbledore. He's not the only one that knows the obliviation spell, and there are plenty of people in canon who already hate Harry.
