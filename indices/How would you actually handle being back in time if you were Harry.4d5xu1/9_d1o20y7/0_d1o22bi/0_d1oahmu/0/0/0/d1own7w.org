You seem to have worded it poorly, then, for to many readers it seems to be that you are doing it because you are afraid of Dumbledore obliviating you.

It's still a valid reply to the question asked, even if you were doing it because of Dumbledore, but this is why you got a reply at all. Oh well, business as usual in a fan-fiction--centred place.
