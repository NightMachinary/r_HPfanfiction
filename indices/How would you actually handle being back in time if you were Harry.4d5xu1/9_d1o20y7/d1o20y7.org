First, I evaluate the new Dumbledore I encounter. If he seems like a legitimately good guy, I:

- Make some sort of canary signal combined with written copies of all the important information I'm going to tell him, to protect against obliviation

- Approach him, and obliquely refer to future events he should know about

If he seems like the grossly incompetent, criminally negligent, overly manipulative, or outright evil figure he is frequently portrayed as in fan fiction, I make plans to work around him and do things myself without his knowledge.
