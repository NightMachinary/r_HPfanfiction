Go to Arthur Weasley. Pretend to be 'seeing' the future. (Put Trelawney's years of theatrical lessons into good use.) Get Pettigrew caught. Get Sirius released. Get the hell out of the Dursleys. Continue the seer charade as much as possible considering I"m changing the timeline. ('The Malfoys! Yes - yes, I'm seeing...a floor. In the drawing room. Open the floor in the drawing room and all will be answered!)

Dumbledore will figure out of course. He'll ask very pointed questions, but I'll keep up the charade while I give him the answers. (Sir, I had a dream Voldemort took out his soul and put it in a cup - and you drank it! ...Sir, do you have a diary? Huh, I don't know. I keep seeing a diary. Wait. Wait. I'm seeing engraving! There's a T...and M...)

One day, after Voldemort is destroyed and I've mysteriously lost my 'gift,' I'd be asked why I pretended for so long. My answer will be, "Cause I could." Only Dumbledore will appreciate my humor.
