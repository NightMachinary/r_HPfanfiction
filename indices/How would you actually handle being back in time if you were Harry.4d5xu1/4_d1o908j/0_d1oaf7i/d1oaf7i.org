I'd prefer him to be a wraith while I was hunting Horcruxes. And Death Eaters. And just about anyone else who might possibly support him enough to resurrect him.

With all his Horcruxes and supporters gone, he won't be resurrected. At best, he'll live as a wraith for eternity.

A tie. Vanquished, /and/ living forever.
