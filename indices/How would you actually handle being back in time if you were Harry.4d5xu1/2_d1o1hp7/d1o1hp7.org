I don't think that this corresponds to

Anyways, if I were back, I would tell Dumbledore everything.. and I mean everything. For whatever reasons, people think that an old man not telling an eleven year old that he is supposed to freakin kill the badassest wizard of all times -- who mother fudging beat death itself -- corresponds to manipulation.

Well, I don't share that belief. For me, Dumbledore is an awesomely powerful grandfatherly wizard whom I could depend on for everything. Had the prophecy not been in way, I am pretty sure that Dumbledore would have been a great mentor for our dearest teenage wizard.
