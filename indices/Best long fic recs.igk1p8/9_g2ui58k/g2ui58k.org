Gonna recommend you a lot of non-traditional stuff. Most of these are well-regarded by people here but aren't really that popular at-large. If you're fine with non-Harry-centric AU epics, you'll love these.

Also, I second *The Arithmancer,* really one of the better super-long fics out there.

*Alexandra Quick* - in progress but it's in individual installments, 5 are complete. OC fic in America. Incredible writing. 1,300,000 words.

*Stygian Trilogy* - complete next gen fic. Has decent romance. Again incredible writing. 900,000 words.

*Pureblood Pretense* - magical society completely reimagined. In progress but individual installments, 3 are complete. 1,300,000 words.

*Albus Potter* series - next gen AUs. both of them are great, both of them complete, they are polar opposites of each other. Both around 1,200,000 words.
