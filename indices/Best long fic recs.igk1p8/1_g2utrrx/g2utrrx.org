[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling by Annerb]] If you don't mind Harry/Ginny. Honestly the changeling has almost no romance whatsoever, it primarily focuses on Ginny's journey through Hogwarts and the war when she is sorted into Slytherin. The real romance comes in the sequels, it has three, but honestly even if I didn't like romance, I doubt I would've gotten enough of Annerb's Slytherin Ginny with just the Changeling and I would've read the other three anyway.
