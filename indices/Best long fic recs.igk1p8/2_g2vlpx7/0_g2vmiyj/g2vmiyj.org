i've looked at this before, but it has an unfinished sequel.

is the story a standalone, with a sequel that sort of extends it, or is the sequel continuing the major plotline(is the sequel important enough to read)?

if i have to read the sequel, i'll probably wait til the sequel is finished to read both of them
