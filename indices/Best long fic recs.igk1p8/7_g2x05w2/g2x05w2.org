So 30 Minutes That Changed Everything, has it's issues, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] did finish a few stories. It has an unfinished sequel to continue the plot, though you don't HAVE to know more(though you might want to). Sadly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] hasn't posted anything in 7 years, so...

Anyways, the only real problem i have with it is information repetition. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/Radaslab][Radaslab]] had a very annoying habit of presenting information as if it was new multiple times to the same people, or having characters who already knew the info acting as if it was news to them when it was necessary to disclose it to someone new. It doesn't treat Dumbles as a beacon of goodness, and it seems to bash Ron at first but it really isn't.

Of course it was one of the first HP fics i read, so its possibly just nostalgia talking... I'm actually going to go reread it now....
