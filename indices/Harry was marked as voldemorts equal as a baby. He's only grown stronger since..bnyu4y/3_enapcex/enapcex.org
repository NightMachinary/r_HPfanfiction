Every fic written between OotP and HBP. Back when everyone thought it was only common sense that this would be the case. The thinking was, "well, the power he knows not... must be some awesome magical ability" instead of some bull shit McGuffin like that Deathly Hallows.

It's sad that this is even a prompt. Like it's some crazy harebrained idea that Harry, the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord, would be an extraordinary, powerful wizard that could defeat Voldemort 1 on 1.
