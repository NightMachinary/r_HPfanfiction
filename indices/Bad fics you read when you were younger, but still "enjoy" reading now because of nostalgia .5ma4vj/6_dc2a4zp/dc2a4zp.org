I don't even want to say a specific story because I fear if I link and the author sees it, I'll hurt their feelings. Just because it might not be the best writing doesn't mean they didn't put a lot of effort into it.

I was obsessed with drug fics though, like the more messed up the best. And all the angst. I'm still partial to reading that stuff for nostalgia reasons but I don't see them out anymore.
