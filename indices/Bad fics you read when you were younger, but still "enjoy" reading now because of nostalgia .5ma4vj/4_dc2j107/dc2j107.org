I still reread "Make a Wish Harry" and it's sequel. It was the first fic that really expanded my views of the magical world in an international level. The original characters existed solely to give a shit about Harry and to make his life easier, which felt like such a refreshing change after the Order of the Phoenix. There were some really good moments too, some where the circumstances worked out for Harry's benefit and some where he just really was a sad kid who had enough of people's shit.

It's my go-to fic when I'm down.
