Definitely linkffn(1337064) and sequel(1525917). I read this back in 2003 and my mind was blown that Harry Potter could be made into something like this.

From the author's profile:

Looking back, the story seems like a wankfest over Snape - he's a kind of vampire that can shapeshift and basically almost as strong as Voldemort (and surprise! he's the Dark Prince, yes it's capitalized). And of course Harry also becomes a vampire.

But it's still a fun story. Although characterization is thrown out the window, the worldbuilding, pacing and general plot were done well enough to make the story stand out in my memory after fourteen years.
