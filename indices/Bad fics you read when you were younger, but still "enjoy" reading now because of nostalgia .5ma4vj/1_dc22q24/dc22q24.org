I started reading HP fanfiction when I was like 11, so I've read A LOT of bad fic in my time. And I enjoyed a lot of it at the time. It's always really disappointing going back to re-read a fic I remember enjoying and finding it is actually terribly written. I read a lot of Drinny fics and Indy Harry/Lord Potter fics.

One fic I do re-read every so often is linkffn(Aspirations) even though it's not great. I just remember thinking it was so, so good at the time.
