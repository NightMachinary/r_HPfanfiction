  but after that, it's just a slog with no credible conflict and over-the-top shipping.

Yep, that's robst. His mechanical skill is passable, and the beginnings and basic plot ideas always intrigue me.

Harry raised by goblins, and already has some fighting skill? Yes, let him defy a few expectations, that's what fanfiction is for! Count me in! Damn, give him a few more powers, no problem. It's always fun to see two gods fighting...

Wait, why is no one even close to Harry's skill? He's eleven? Okay, what happend the last 100'000 words? Why did I read them? Why should I read on? Is there any conflict left?

That was basically my thought process when reading Harry Crow, and his other works. After a while I always began to wonder why I should read on. Every story needs an incentive to read on. Each Harry Potter book has it - well, actually any good book has it.\\
First it's the magic, then it's the whole philosophers stone, afterwards it's "who petrified people", next up "how and why will sirius black attack?", afterwards "Who put Harry's name in the goblet, and why did he do it?" - and so on.

But I always miss those with the stories of robst.
