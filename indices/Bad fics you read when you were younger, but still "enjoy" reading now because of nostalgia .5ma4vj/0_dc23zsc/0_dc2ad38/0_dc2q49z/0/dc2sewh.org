Passable meaning that it isn't outright annoying. You could write a great fanfiction with his technical skill, but there had to be exceptional storyline for the story to be considered that.

For me a passable is like an "Accaptable" in Hogwarts grades, whereas most good fanfiction is at least EE, and most books are O.
