I'm embarrassed to say I read almost everything robst ever wrote when I first got into fanfic. It took me more than halfway through linkffn(Harry Crow) to realize that he's not that good a writer, either down at the mechanics level or up at the plot level.

I think this was a combination being new to the genre so I didn't have much to compare it to at the time, and something [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] wrote a while back, which was (paraphrasing) that robst is /really/ good at writing the first 20% of a story, but after that, it's just a slog with no credible conflict and over-the-top shipping.

Edit: I still skim linkffn(A Different Halloween) once in a while.
