Yeah . . . Back when I used to be a depressed 17 year old (well . . . I say 'back when', but that was only 7 months ago) I really enjoyed the concept of a protagonist that had immense power and managed to take on anything the world threw at him. Then I started writing, which helped my depression, which in turn took away the charm from those fics for me. Rarely read those anymore.
