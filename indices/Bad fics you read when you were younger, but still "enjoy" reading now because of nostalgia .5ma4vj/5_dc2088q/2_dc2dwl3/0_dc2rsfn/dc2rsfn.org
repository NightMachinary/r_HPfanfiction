I more enjoy the vein of Harry doing what he wants to with his life for a change, standing up for himself and calling people out on their shit when he has to, but not so much into the 'Dumbledore is secretly EVIL' 'Ron is a complete moron' and 'Supermodel Pureblood Hermione' stuff, etc. now that takes it too far.

If it is like that, I can look it over in some cases, but it's rare that I do so. Usually if there is little actual interaction with the basher and the bashee, so to speak, it's better, since they're not talking about the 'Old Manipulative Goat Dumbles', 'Ron the Insanely Jealous Psycho' and 'Ginny the Gold Digging Bitch' every other line.
