I still have a soft spot for /some/ bashing fics, as long as they're not too over the top, like bashing Dumbledore, the Weasleys, etc. every other line.

But in the older days, /anything/ went in terms of it. Ron could be a serial rapist, Harry could literally be God and Hermione could be a secret Pureblood that actually looks like a supermodel, but I would have liked it. Now, I actually have limits.
