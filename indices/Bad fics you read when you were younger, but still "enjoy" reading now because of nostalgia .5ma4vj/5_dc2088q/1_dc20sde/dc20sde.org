Ha yes, I'm guilty of enjoying a bit of bashing too. I think it's mostly because I don't really care about the characters. I read almost exclusively Hermione pared with older guys (Snape, Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, etc.). I'm aware that it seems weird, especially Voldemort, but when I read fics I search for things far away from canon. I love fics where they are older too, student-teacher relationships mostly creep me out. My favorite fics have Hermione being 25 at least, working a job, and then stuff happens. She's more comfortable with her bossiness, which I love since she's dealing with characters with strong personalities. I hate doormat Hermione. So, anyway, in most of those fics, the author tends to keep a canon beginning and Hermione is, or has been until recently, in a relationship with Ron. Some of these fics then bash him/the Weasleys, and I kinda don't care. But yeah, never too extreme !

And I'd have loved secretly pureblood topmodel Hermione. Oh my, the possibilities... My 14 y.o self would be so jealous of the stuff I sometimes stumble upon ! Especially when searching for HG/older guys stories, IDK why but there are either very good stories, or very, very bad ones. And I would have loved the bad ones.

Recently I found one where Hermione is actually Snape's little sister, adopted at birth and under a glamour, so she's in fact taller, black straight hair, etc. Snape immediately calls her by a nickname/calls her "little sis", she lives with him and Lord Voldemort falls in love with her and they go on picnics together. I'm not kidding. WTF !
