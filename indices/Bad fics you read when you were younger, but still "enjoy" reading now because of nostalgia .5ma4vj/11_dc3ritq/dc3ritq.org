Based on the idea of "Make a Wish" but less Harry falling assbackwards into helping/saving people, it's more Harry Falls Assbackwards into a new adventure/learning experience.

Bad parts, the Author puts to much "Aww wouldn't thus be cool or funny" into the plot. Then later on shoves to much plot into the last few chapters. Also plays the "Super Harry has to have Super Friends" Card which sucks
