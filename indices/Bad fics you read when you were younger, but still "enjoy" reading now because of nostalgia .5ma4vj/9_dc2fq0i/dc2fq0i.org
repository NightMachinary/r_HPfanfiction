I'll probably get some flak for this, but I'm super nostalgic over /Harry Crow/ as it was the first departure I ever made from canon compliance. When I first started I exclusively looked for fics about Harry and Ginny immediately after book 7.

I /might/ have been in denial about the series being over ;)
