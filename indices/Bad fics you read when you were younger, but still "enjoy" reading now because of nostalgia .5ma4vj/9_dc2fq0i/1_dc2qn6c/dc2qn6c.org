I'm also very nostalgic over Harry Crow. Mostly because of the fact that it was the first fanfic I ever read, and was what introduced me to fanfiction as a whole. 4 years later now I realize that Robst isn't exactly that great of a writer, but nevertheless his works still bring me a hint of nostalgic satisfaction whenever I read them.
