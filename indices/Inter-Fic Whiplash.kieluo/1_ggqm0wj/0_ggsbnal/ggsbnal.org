ikr. i have read a lot of weasley/Dumbledore bashing because i love reading independent!Harry and sometimes i really hate weasleys like while watching the movies etc.

tbh, i do feel like Dumbledore had planned everything when i read the books, including meeting with Weasleys. why the fuck they were yelling about muggles and asking the platform number..? they were coming there for years!
