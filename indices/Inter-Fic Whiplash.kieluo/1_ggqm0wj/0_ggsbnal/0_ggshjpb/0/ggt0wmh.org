you honestly believe that? i just think it's a book, author needed to introduce the characters, and she did. BUT i like to make things more realistic, i like to think that there a deeper story. and no i don't think Dumbledore being manipulative is a bad thing. if in the end we had learnt that it was all Dumbledore's plan, i wouldn't have hated Dumbledore still. the man literally sacrificed himself so that his spy would be more trusted (even though he was dying, i think it is still a sacrifice cuz they would find a way to get rid of the curse, maybe pay a visit to his pal flamel)

it is a book. maybe Rowling didn't think the fans would think this deep, she didn't think people would question why Dumbledore did that, why Dumbledore did those, why didn't he check on Harry, he was being abused bla bla. it was children's book in the beginning
