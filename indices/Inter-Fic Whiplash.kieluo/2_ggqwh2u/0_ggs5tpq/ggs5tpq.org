lmao ohmygod same. I have so many tabs with different fics open, I just jump on one and I'm like, "okay it's got so-and-so tropes, these characters are alive, these characters are focused on, and magic's more complicated in this way."

But then I click off, come back, and start reading a fic that looks similar only to realize that it's a completely different ones. There's so many fics I just haven't finished and try to come back to, only to realize I'm completely misremembering the whole story and I have to start over because I just can't quite remember what the fic was even about.
