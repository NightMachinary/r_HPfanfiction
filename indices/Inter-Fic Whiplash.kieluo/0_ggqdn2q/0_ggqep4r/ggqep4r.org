Yes!!! The side characters in Marauder fics really get me because we don't see them in canon so it really is open to interpretation.

One minute Mary McDonald is this strong, badass tiny blonde lesbian who is snarky and plays quidditch and the next she's a shy pudgy girl who hides behind Lily and is just there for emotional support..

Frank Longbottom has been promoted to and demoted from head boy, perfect, auror, quidditch captain more times than I can count.

Alice has no consistency to what year she's in at all...

Remus Lupins parents vary in their 'aliveness' fic to fic...
