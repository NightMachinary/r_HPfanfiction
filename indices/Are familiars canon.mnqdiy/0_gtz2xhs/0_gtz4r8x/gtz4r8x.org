Can confirm. Just used [[https://www.potter-search.com][this search site]] to check every single time the word “familiar” shows up and not once is it used as a noun. “Familiars” doesn't show up at all.

I'm guessing that it's similar to wards, which show up a lot in fanon, but “protective enchantments” are the closest we get in canon.
