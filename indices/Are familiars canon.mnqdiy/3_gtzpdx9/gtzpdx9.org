For some reason I remember the original Pottermore blurb from back in 2011 mentioning that familiars were a thing, whether or not you'd consider that canon, but I guess I was wrong. Checking the archive shows that JK specifically said they weren't a thing, even though Mrs. Norris was the closest thing in canon to being a familiar.
