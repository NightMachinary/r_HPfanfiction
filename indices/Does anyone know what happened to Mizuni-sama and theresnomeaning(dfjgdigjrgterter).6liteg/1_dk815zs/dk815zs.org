Mizuni-sama was unique in the fact that they have no other contact information whatsoever. Outside of fanfiction.net, we have no idea who this person is. Unless someone hacks into their fanfic account and manages to get their email address and perhaps be able to track that (and i'm not saying they should), we will have no idea what happened to them and why they stopped writing. For all we know, they could have passed away.

Prince of a Dark Kingdom was one of my favorite fics. I always expected it to finish too as how much work was already in it. I did notice that the author had longer and longer posting breaks. I wonder if they just got bored of it.
