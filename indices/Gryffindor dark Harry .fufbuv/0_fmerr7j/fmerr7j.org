I dont know any from the top of my head, but your post did make me think how would a Dark Lord operate based on their house. Let me know what everyone thinks.

Slytherin Dark Lord - blend between Sith, Nietzche and a heavy dose of Machiavellism. Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle would be best examples. Voldemort, not so much imo. They seek power and they revel in it.

Hufflepuff Dark Lord - probably the misunderstood revolutionary or tragic anti-hero fighting for their family. Their soul is tortured by the decision they have to make, but they fully believe themselves the good guy. They might even be.

Ravenclaw Dark Lord - absolutely terrifying. Probably will rely more on arcane magics and various tricks to outwit their enemies. Most likely very few even know this person even /is/ the Dark Lord. Might as well give up, there is little chance of defeating this warlord.

Gryffindor Dark Lord - absolutely unfiltered rage. Will probably hop on a broom and rain down Fiyendifire from the sky. They're the Dark Lord, and they wand the world to know this. Grandeur and martial prowess plays a large role in their campaign. The only thing that matters is the next battle. Ironically, I'd say Voldie fits this quite well.
