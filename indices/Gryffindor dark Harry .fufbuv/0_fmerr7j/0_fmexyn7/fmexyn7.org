I totally agre with you !\\
Voldie in the end, i don't know if it was because of the Horcruxes or other things, but he became very impulsive, nothing like Tom Riddle was in his early years.

I think that a Ravenclaw Dark Lord would be something like a mad scientist kidnapping people for experiments, and creating dark creatures out of nothing, releasing magical plagues upon the world just for curiosity.

I would love to see some fics with these types of Dark Lords, and maybe with Harry being one of them, im really tired of him just being a cunning and manipulative in those dark harry fics, most of them are just the same. :/
