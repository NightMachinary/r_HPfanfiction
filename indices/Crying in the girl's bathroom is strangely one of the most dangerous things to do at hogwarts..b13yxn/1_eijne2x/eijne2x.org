"Okay, so, not only is Voldemort alive and restored to a body, he's cloned himself about 6 times, converted or charmed or Imperiused about 90% of the Ministry, used some tricky time turner shenanigans to obtain an army of basilisks and trolls and dementors, and last I heard Fenrir got some Wolfsbane Potion and is off to infect as many muggles as he can. I like your scheme, but there's no way we can induce them to all charge in to attack you at once!"\\
Harry Potter's eyes glinted dangerously, "Oh, no?"\\

A few minutes later, elsewhere, the seven Voldemorts (and their respective allocated Death Eaters) all simultaneously twitched as a strange sensation came over them.\\
"Our slasher-movie senses are tingling...someone, somewhere is alone and vulnerable."\\
A random Slytherin burst into the room, "My lord! I've just witnessed Harry Potter, /Harry Potter!/, ducking into the third-floor girl's bathroom at Hogwarts in a mess of tears!"\\
There was silence for a moment as various random Death Eaters contemplated the oddity of the male Harry Potter going into a women's bathroom, before the head Voldemort cleared his throat and glared at them all, "What are you waiting for?! *CHARGE!!*"
