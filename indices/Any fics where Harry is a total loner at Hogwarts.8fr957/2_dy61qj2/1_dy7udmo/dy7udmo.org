I've never read it before... [[/spoiler][It was definitely unique. As a story it sucked (too many unfinished threads and the fact that Harry is a monster shouldn't be reiterated in every chapter).... As a truly unique experience it was pretty much okay. I just feel sad that the author spent a lot of effort and time in developing this truly unique story and most of what had happened has become irrelevant by the end. Great ideas, poor execution. Still, when it comes to fanfics, it is definitely in my top 20 or 30.]]
