  If you don't mind reading Hermione's point of view for a change, the fanfic Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire fits your description quite well - no smut, the HHr moments are quite subdued throughout. The caveats are that in this story the author focuses much more on Hermione, and that the fanfiction is not completed. Still, I think you may want to try it.

Good news! The fanfic in question [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][is, in fact, finished, on Portkey]]. Me, I think that it's a unique contribution to the fandom, the only fic I know of that explores how someone like canon Hermione --- lacking Harry's fearlessness and athleticism, but being more diligent, disciplined, and better at magic --- would handle the Tasks. The technicals and characterization and character development are generally good, and the romance works. The downsides are that the fic could probably be edited down by about a quarter of its length to remove plot threads that don't lead anywhere, and I found the ending to be generally too neat, a bit clunky in places, and a bit contrived.
