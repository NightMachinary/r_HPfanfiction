If you don't mind reading Hermione's point of view for a change, the fanfic [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=805][/Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire/]] fits your description quite well - no smut, the HHr moments are quite subdued throughout. The caveats are that in this story the author focuses much more on Hermione, and that the fanfiction is *not completed*. Still, I think you may want to try it.

Note: /Vox Corporis/ is quite unique in that it manages to showcase a young Harry and Hermione without making them overly powerful or too obsessed with sex. (Not that it is perfect, as it has its weak moments like any other story). Most of the HHr fanfics I have saved on my rec list are post-DH or post-War for this reason. If you manage to find something similar to /Vox Corporis/ I think many people would appreciate your posting a link here. Finally, let me just dump a number of general HHr fanfictions here:

- Shadow Walks

- Notebooks and Letters

- Love Lost, Love Found

- Unlike a Sister

- Biding My Time

- Eighth

- The Cardinal Curses

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cheering_charm/BBAB01a.html][Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]

- Teacher's Pet

- All Nights

- Living Past the End

- Blood Bound: a Vampire story

- Forever Knight

- Come Undone

- Welcome to Hogwarts

General rating for the above: *M*

EDIT: [[http://www.harryloveshermione.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=8]] is a good list of recommended fics as well
