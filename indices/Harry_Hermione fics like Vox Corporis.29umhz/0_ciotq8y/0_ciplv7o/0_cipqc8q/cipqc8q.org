These two fit the bill with a "more dominant Hermione", though neither has updated in a while:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/Rule-of-two-dreams-come-true][Rule of Two, Dreams come True]] by Darklooshkin
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/Labyrinth][Labyrinth]] by Kroontjespen
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons][Remedial Lessons]] by SymphonySamurai: this one's finished, but it's a bit of a hodgepodge.

Actually, here are two more for my list upthread:

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldson Eagle
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]] by Material Blade: The only Soul Bond fic that I've found to be worth reading. (unfortunately, abandoned, but what's written so far is very good)

I am deliberately focusing on within-Hogwarts fics, since that's what was asked. Also, again, I don't read many pure-romance fics, so I am probably missing a lot.

For Harry being dominant, that would be 90%+ of the "unequal" fics, and I don't know of any that I liked (perhaps because, starting with their canon characters, it's /very/ difficult to make Harry "dominant" without degrading Hermione), but it's different strokes for different folks, so [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/][here's a thread]], nominally about HP/HG pairings where they meet some time after their first year at Hogwarts, but basically every fic linked there fits the bill, which makes me very, very sad.
