To avoid repeating myself, here's a link to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cij8m0d][my rant]] on that thread and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cijzwk5][the follow-up]]. [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] also has [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29vns8/anybody_else_find_themselves_unable_to_read/cipe4zt][a good recent post on the topic]].

*TL;DR:* In almost all late-meeting HP/HG fics, Hermione is portrayed as having no real goals, ambitions, relationships, or agency of her own, basically useless and is not allowed to be happy or to achieve anything interesting until Harry enters her life (and after he does enter her life, Harry usually does all the achieving anyway). Meanwhile, Harry spends his pre-Hermione period becoming Very Powerful and having amazing adventures and achievements (often in secret). Once they do become acquainted, Hermione mostly serves as a damsel in distress for Harry to rescue. If she is lucky, she gets to contribute her prodigious research skills to helping Harry become a more powerful wizard.

Unfortunately, even [[/u/KwanLi][Kwan Li's]] /Hogwarts Battle School/ --- which I had listed as an exception to the rule --- seems to be going in that direction.
