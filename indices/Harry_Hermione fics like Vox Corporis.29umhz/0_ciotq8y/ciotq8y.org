  Maybe even with Harry and Hermione being equal in the relationship as they were quite close in that regard in VC (not a major deal to me either way),

Well, that excludes at least 80% of them... Most authors seem to be unable to write the romance without degrading one character or the other in some way.

I don't, generally, read pure romance fics, but here are some of my favorite HP/HG fics (unfortunately, most not complete):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] by TimeLoopedPowerGamer

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19 (not 100% sure there will be romance, but it focuses on their relationship/rivalry)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li (again 100% sure it's HP/HG pairing, but it's highly likely)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late]] by alchymie (post-Hogwarts)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and a Temporal Beacon]] by willyolioleo
