Really? I've found robst's stories to mostly be awful. He seems to portray the characters as either immaculate perfections with no flaws or demonic monsters with no desire to do anything else but evil. Also, there is never any buildup to the H/Hr romance in his stories, which is the complete opposite of amazing fics like Vox Corporis. I often think that he is the worst offender of the assumption that Harry and Hermione would be a boring couple with nothing interesting to do whatsoever, which is something that I think is completely false. I can see how that assumption is made though, if a person's only exposure to the paring is through his stories. His characterizations are just so...boring! Anyway, excuse me for my rant, I just don't think that stories by robst should be seen as the standard for H/Hr stories. An author whom is much truer to the characters and makes the best of their dynamic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/636397/][lorien829]].Every one of her stories that I have read have been amazing and much closer to what OP was looking for when asking for stories like Vox Corporis.
