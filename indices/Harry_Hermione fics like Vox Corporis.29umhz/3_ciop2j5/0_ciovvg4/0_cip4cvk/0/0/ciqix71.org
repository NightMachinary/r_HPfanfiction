I used to be in this camp. I followed /Harry Crow/, robst's most popular fic, for a while, initially as a guilty pleasure, later to satisfy my morbid curiosity. But, ultimately, the sheer /banality/ of it got to me. I found myself skimming through the chapters on my e-reader when they came in, then skipping them altogether.

There is a number of trainwrecks that I follow for amusement, but /Harry Crow/ isn't a trainwreck. This train is in perfect repair, going, at an impressive speed, /absolutely nowhere/.
