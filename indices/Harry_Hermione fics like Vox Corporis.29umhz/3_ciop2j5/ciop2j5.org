I'll be honest and say that I haven't read the story (just added it to my backlog) but some of the best Harry/Hermione stories I've read are by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]], they all follow a similar storyline, but I'm sure at least one of them has Harry going to live with the Grangers.
