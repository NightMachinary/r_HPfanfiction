I probably wouldn't read it... Personally I try to find stories where Harry avoids Hogwarts all together. After reading >1k different fanfics it all somehow blends to one big blob of : we're on point X of canon, will Harry(ette?) do in Hogwarts today? A) do the canon stuff B) do the complete opposite just because C) do the remarkably well adjusted and we'll reasoned thing for a teenager that has been under an unreasonable amount of stress for an unreasonably long time, D) do something different that doesn't have major consequences for the plot otherwise E) do actually something unique that will actually surprise me, once every 50 fics I read?

I might be a bit cynical though.
