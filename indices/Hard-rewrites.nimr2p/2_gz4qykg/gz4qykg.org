It's not a hard rewrite, but I'm working on a series of works where the difference is Ginny participating much more actively than she does in the books.

As for OCs, I've fleshed out the other members of Cho Chang's friend group as I've made Marietta Edgecombe into a major character.

I'm still very far away from it being finished, so we'll see how this all turns out. (Admittedly, it does fall into the same features one other commenter said.)
