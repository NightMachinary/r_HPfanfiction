True true. Mine is near an original story, but I choose not to write it one cause I already have an original story I've been working on for years now.

Course that doesn't mean I'll set up a Patreon later on if I really do get a lot of readers for my fic. I might if my chapters decide to be longer than 10k words and decide to release once a month which would allow me to make some money and write about two chapters a month at around 10-20k words each. That is if I ever decide I want to try and do that. I might in the summer really, it'd help improve my writing, give me deadlines and schedules, as well as a small side-hustle income.

Though this would only be realistic if I really wanted to constantly write 10k+ worded chapters, I do don't get me wrong, but I literally have 3 part-time jobs and community college, so it'll have to wait till summer. Which sucks cause I love writing and telling stories.
