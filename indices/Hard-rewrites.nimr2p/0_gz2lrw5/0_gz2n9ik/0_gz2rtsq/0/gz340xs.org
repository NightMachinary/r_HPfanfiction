I mean, my story is a slow burn, so eh. That and I skipped first year, got halfway through it but only did it to introduce characters. I didn't want so contrivided plot like the Philosopher Stone and such, as that made no sense to me.

As for series bloat, I can see where you're coming from. I try to ideally go for 5-7k worded chapters but as the story progresses I'm pretty sure it'll be more.

For plot I have the ending in mind but I'm doing a George R R Martin style chaptering, creating interwoven storylines as well as perspectives. I like to give my audience multiple angles, especially when I get later into my story, I'll be jumping place to place at times.
