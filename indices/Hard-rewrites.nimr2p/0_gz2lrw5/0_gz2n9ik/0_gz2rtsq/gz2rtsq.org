Other people might disagree so don't take my word for it but I would suggest avoiding 10k+ chapters as they can be quite tedious to read. I personally prefer reading max 4-5k word chapters that focus on one particular event that's relevant to the plot and better read more of those than one that has so many events in it that it reads like a story on its own. However I would also suggest going the other way and writing a ton of chapters over the same event to the point that it drags on forever.

Edit: I think that PS is the perfect example of this

Chapter 1 - we're introduced to the story

Chapter 2 - we learn of Harry's shitty life with the Dursleys

Chapter 3 - we learn that someone really wants to get in touch with Harry and the Dursleys try to prevent it

Chapter 4 - we learn of Harry's magical origins

Chapter 5 - we get a glimpse of the magical world outside of Hogwarts and we're introduced to the main institutions of the world

Chapter 6 - Harry meets his future allies and enemies

Chapter 7 - we're introduced to Hogwarts

Chapter 8 - we see the typical life as a new student at Hogwarts

Chapter 9 - we learn the secret of the forbidden corridor

Chapter 10 - Harry becomes friends with Hermione, while discovering that someone is up to something

Chapter 11 - we're introduced to Quidditch and learn that someone wants to kill Harry

Chapter 12 - we get introduced to Dumbledore

Chapter 13 - Harry finds out about the Philosopher's Stone

Chapter 14 - the events for the final showdown get set in motion

Chapter 15 - we're introduced to the Forbidden Forest

Chapter 16 - the trio goes through the gauntlet protecting the stone... personally I think that the confrontation with Quirrell should have also been in this chapter but I think JK wanted to end it on a cliffhanger

Chapter 17 - we're introduced to Voldemort and conclusion
