I don't personally mind them but if the only resemblance to the original story are names, I can't help but wonder why the author is not writing their original story? If it's really good they could get financially compensated for it and could even start their own franchise. And there are some like that that are really good and if they decided to re-write it as an original story all they'd need would be an editor and they could produce some really beautiful original series.
