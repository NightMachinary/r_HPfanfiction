Molly was wrong in my opinion, Molly doesn't know what is best for Harry. Harry needed to know what was going on. just like in POA when Sirius was apparently out to kill him, keeping Harry in the dark was a mistake.

Sick of seeing people says Sirius mistakes Harry for James. Sirius never mistakes Harry for James in the book he always sees Harry as his Godson that's a movie only thing.

The line "Nice one James" ruined the order of the phoenix movie

Molly wanted to keep Harry safe but she was doing the opposite, not telling someone about dangers related to them doesn't just suddenly make the dangers disappear or non existent.
