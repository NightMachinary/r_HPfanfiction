Okay, it's been a while since I've read the books, so sorry if I remember this wrong, but wasn't Molly essentially right? I'm thinking about the scene where she said that Sirius doesn't really know what's best for Harry... which I somewhat agree with.

Don't get me wrong, Sirius did nothing wrong, he was thrown in prison unjustly and had a general shitty life. But that doesn't change the fact that he spent over a decade in "the worst place on Earth". He wasn't completely sane from the experience IMO. He had the tendency to mistake Harry for James. Like it or not, Sirius isn't exactly someone I'd trust to raise a child.
