I think it would break apart the trio. Harry doesn't particularly like Hermione, and Hermione spends most of her private time with Ron, so Ron is really their only link. If Ron ended up with Harry, Hermione would probably be more nasty, Harry would have less reason to talk to Hermione, and Ron would be angry at Hermione. It would turn into a duo, and since Hermione has no other friends besides Neville, Ginny, and Luna (she comforted Hermione in HBP, and Hermione was distressed when she thought she may have died), she would just become apart of that group.
