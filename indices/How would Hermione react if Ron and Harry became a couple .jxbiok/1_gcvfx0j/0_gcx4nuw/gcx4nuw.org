It could probably work alongside a Hermione/Viktor or Ginny scenario. But even without a love interest for her, I think she loves them both too much to do anything /but/ support them. I'd just really want her to have a friend to talk to about any conflicting feelings that gives her so she's not just shoving it all down.
