Can't say I was a fan of Six Pomegranate Seeds. It started well but seemed to be an excuse to shoehorn Hermione into one of those aristocratic, pure-blood, /arranged-marriages-and-wierd-archaic-customs-and-conventions/ type milieus. Though it's extremely well written so I can see why people might like it.

I'm sorry. That wasn't really a response to your request.
