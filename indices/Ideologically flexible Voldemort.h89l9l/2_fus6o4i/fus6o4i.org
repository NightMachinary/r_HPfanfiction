I've begun writing a fic which has a /very/ similar Tom Marvolo Riddle (no ideological connection), though the setting is a rather different AU, where Tom Riddle realizes that there is a different way he can satisfy his need for power (it may not seem obvious, but there is a plot - it's just a long setup before you come to know /what/ exactly it is). Here, Tom Riddle didn't go directly into the Dark Arts. He instead pursued research in magic and became a famous researcher - as a result of which Dumbledore was rather happy to give the post of the DADA professor to him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, Tom is Deputy Headmaster and still scheming as one Harry Potter begins his first year at Hogwarts.
