The only thing I can think of with this is an oneshot where the Sorting Hat goes back in time and resorts the Marauder gang (including others in that year). A muggleborn Slytherin ends up somewhat skilled with dueling and Voldemort doesn't let anything like a little ideological problem get in the way of recruiting useful minions.
