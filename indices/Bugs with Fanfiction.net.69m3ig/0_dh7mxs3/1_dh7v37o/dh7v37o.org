That error message is the current bane of my existence. Posted two chapters since this started happening, and that error message popped up twice. Not to toot my own horn, but for the story I updated, I usually get 3000 hits and 15-20 reviews in the first 24 hours of posting a chapter. I had less than 2000 hits, and less than ten reviews since I posted the chapters at the start of the month. All because the notifications aren't going into e-mails.
