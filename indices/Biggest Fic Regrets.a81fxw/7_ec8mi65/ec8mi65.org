For The Love of Magic by Noodlehammer. Made me so angry in the last three chapters I gave myself a migraine, can't believe I read 800k words for it to end in such a shitty and abrupt manner. That's not even touching on the numerous shitty questionable self insert powerwanking bullshit and racism and other implied -isms.
