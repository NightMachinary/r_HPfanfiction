I remember the time I was into Harry&Snape relationship, where Snape is Harry's father or mentor. There was popular theme, where Snape discovers Harry is abused, and helps him grow and mentors him, and they both getting better through their new relationship.

Now I can't remember the name of the fic, but it was quite on the top recs, and had huge amount of likes&comments.

Oh, it was horrible to read. Because Harry was a-b-u-s-e-d by Dursleys so. much. The author went for details of mental and physical torture Harry went through. Every single chapter, huge portion of it was about abuse. I tried to go to the 'good part', where the comfort and healing comes into the play, but I never made it. Too much of hell.

There were also similar fics, going through very detailed description of Harry's abuse. Some of them in sexual manor (remember, it was before Hogwarts, so the boy was like 11 or less). Just no. I learned my lesson, and just closed the tab asap.
