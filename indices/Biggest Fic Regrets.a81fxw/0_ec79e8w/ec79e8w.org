Most stories with super Harry and flagrant bashing. For Love Of Magic by Noodlehammer, The Green Girl by Colubrina. I was new to the fandom when I tried these, and would probably give up and read something else now.

One fic that I really regret reading for as long as I did was Looking Beyond, which failed to live up to it's title, and was basically canon with a female Harry. Another was Umei No Mai which was a really slow crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn, so slow that I barely remember anything but the name of the fic.
