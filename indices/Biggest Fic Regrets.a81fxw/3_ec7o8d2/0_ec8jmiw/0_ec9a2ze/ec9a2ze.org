It's another quality in DAYD. Dumbledore's Army is written like an actual guerrilla army, with Neville acting like some sort of commander. It's all very militaristic.

In the books, Harry usually ends up saving the day, but he is never treated like a soldier. Actually, Dumbledore tries (and fails) to shield him from Voldemort for as long as possible. Children/teens saving the world is a common trope in youth literature and doesn't equate glorifying child soldiers IMO.

But in DAYD, one member of the DA (who is like 13) is murdered by Death Eaters, and the DA hold some kind of ceremony praising his noble sacrifice or some bullshit like that.

As for Colin, him participating in the battle is very much not portrayed as a good thing. Instead of praising his heroism, it is depicted as an avoidable tragedy.
