I haven't read that story so I'm not opposing what you said but isn't child soldiers kinda what Harry Potter about? I mean Harry and his crew do all the fighting since year one. Colin coming back to fight in Battle of Hogwarts is another child soldier thing. I love Harry Potter but all of the book glorifies child soldiers. Of course, this is only my opinion and like I said I haven't read that story so I don't know how author portrays child soldiers.
