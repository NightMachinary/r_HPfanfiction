Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Great premise, terrible execution. I made it to the halfway point before abandoning that trainwreck of a story.

Characters completely OOC, rampant sexism, stereotypical portrayal of everyone non-English and ridiculous plot points are just a few of the things I hated about that fic, but I ultimately abandoned it because I couldn't stand its glorification of child soldiers. Several of my elderly relatives were child soldiers in the last days of WW2, and the way DAYD deals with the topic is absolutely tasteless and offensive.
