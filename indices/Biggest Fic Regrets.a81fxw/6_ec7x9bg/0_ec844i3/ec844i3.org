  I muscled through it my first time reading it and this will be one of the few stories I never re-read. I'm still not sure what made it so terrible to me, but I feel like I could've skipped all the chapters from 20-50 and not missed out on anything important. There is information pertinent to the main plot in those chapters, but the rate at which it's given is dreadful (in my opinion) so it just keeps dragging on and on. So, I guess pacing? is my main problem.

Have had that happen too many times now. Specially with highy rated fics. Now I just check the latest comments to see if it needs updates and thats that.
