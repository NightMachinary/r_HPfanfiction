Harry uses burn on Quirrel, it's super effective!

That was definitely planned. Hagrid dropped just the right hints to get the trio to figure out what they were supposed to do. The protections were custom made for them. Flying keys for the star seeker, chess for the chess master and a logic puzzle for the clever girl. Although the devil's snare indicates that Neville was supposed to be part of the team. It's all a really convoluted Dumbledore plan to get Harry to meet Voldemort while Voldemort is too weak to endanger Harry so that Harry will be better prepared for the prophecy.
