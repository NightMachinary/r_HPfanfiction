Maybe, but I like the idea of Harry and Co blundering in under the belief that they're the only ones who can protect the Stone and prevent Snape (who they suspected was after it at the time) from giving it to Voldemort. As they were wrong about Snape being after the Stone, who's to say they weren't wrong about needing to go after it at all?

Edit: And as to the ease of the defenses, that could've been a deception to lull Quirrel and Voldemort into thinking that the Stone was easier to get at than it really was.

Edit 2: But if I'm being honest, I just want Albus to verbally shit on Harry for being a reckless little busybody.
