It's unfortunate Dumbledore told a school full of hundreds of teenagers that the third floor was out of bounds. Because teenagers care about out of bounds.

It's unfortunate the door was only locked with a spell a first year could get through. Where was the age line?

Why give Hagrid the secret? Why have enough potion for multiple people to go through the fire, instead of it all being poison? Why have a plant that's afraid of light as the second trap, instead of just having full grown Mandrakes? Why put the actual key in the room with all the other keys, instead of just having a bunch of keys?

Because Dumbledore wanted Harry and co. to go through the traps, like he implied when talking to Harry in the infirmary.
