I mean, that could easily be worked into an AU too. Purebloods would get a 2 year head start! I mainly posted because I'd noticed a number of writers recently choosing to start at 13 so they can get into romance subplots sooner, but then feeling the need to defend themselves in their Author's Notes shortly afterwards. I thought such writers would like to know this if they didn't already :)
