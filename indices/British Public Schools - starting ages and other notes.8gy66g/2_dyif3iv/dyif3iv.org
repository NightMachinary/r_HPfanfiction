  One thing I did notice is that a lot of them actually start at 13 rather than 11

Stories where for some reason people start at 13 or even older at Hogwarts are one of my pet peeves. It seems to me that it is never completely thought out and should change quite a bit more than authors imagine.

Does Harry start Hogwarts in 1993? So did Voldemort try to steal the Stone in 1991? Was the school closed in 1992 because of a Basilisk? Or is just everyone born 2 years earlier? That wouldn't work, because then Voldemort is also born 2 years earlier relative to Harry.

Maybe it's only Harry who's born two years earlier? So no Hermione, Ron, etc for the first two years? But how would that work? James and Lily would have had him while in school, right? That's strange... so no Godrics Hollow. Did Voldemort try to murder Harry in Hogwarts? Or was he with his grandparents at the time? In actuality if James and Lily both had to stay in school until they were 19, they probably would have had a child later, which means Harry was maybe born in 1982 and starts Hogwarts at 13 in 1995? So is Harry a first year now when the tournament happens?

Not to mention that Hogwarts is pretty central to Magical Britain. Everyone being 2 years more mature at Hogwarts should have wide repercussions on history. What if Tom Riddle freaked out at the age of 12 and set the orphanage on fire and died in the process? I can't imagine the story of the Marauders, Lily and Snape to play out the same if they are all a bit more mature. James would probably start "getting his act together" much earlier in their school life. Would Snape still join the Death Eaters if he wasn't antagonized so much?
