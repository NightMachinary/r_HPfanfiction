Sooo much sex. Like, you have this enormous castle, hundreds of hormonal teenagers with nothing to do after hours and less than 15 adults. It would be surprising if even half of the upper years sleep alone in their beds. That is also the origin of the "the pumpkin juice is spiked with contraceptives" theory.
