Not headcanon, but I did learn about it from someone who is a Brit and is on this sub: the school that starts at 11/13 /can/ be called a “high school”, except most people don't call it that.

Headcanons ... yeah, contraceptives in the food and/or pumpkin juice. The wizards (and witches) may be bass-ackwards in some ways, but there's no doubt that they would have a way to address the unwanted pregnancy problem way earlier than Muggles and this is something that likely would shape their culture.
