I am honestly somewhat perplexed this thread is this dead. I knew it was asking a lot but are there literally ZERO fan fics of the sort (not accounting for smutfics)? I figured it would be a stretch to find a good one, but with how Tracy is usually written as Daphne's best friend in fan fiction, I figured there would be something, even if it wasn't what I was looking for outside the pairing.

Color me surprised.

And yea ive been reading a ton of Harry/Daphne lately... this one included.
