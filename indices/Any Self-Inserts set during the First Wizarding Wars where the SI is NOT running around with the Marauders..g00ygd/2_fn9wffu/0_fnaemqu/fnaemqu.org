That one's a toss-up in terms of quality, and i'm pretty sure it starts and happens before the first wizarding war.

Had a nice start, and then got bogged down doing stuff and being special in 5th year and summer afterwards - not unreadable, but a bit powerwanky (though, let's be honest - if any of us were to be SI'd into Hogwarts we'd want to powercreep the fuck out of the magic system, and propably succeed at that).

It does a good job on worldbuilding of magical US though
