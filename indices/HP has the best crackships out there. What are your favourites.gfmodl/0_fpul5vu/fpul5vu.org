Omg I found a Trevor/Umbridge that was well written and hysterical. Trevor thought Umbridge was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, used magic to turn into a human, but then decided to turn her into a toad. They lived happily ever after.

(Not sure how to link fics but it was called And Who But My Lady Greensleeves by Andante825 on ao3)

Edit: fixed typo in the fic name
