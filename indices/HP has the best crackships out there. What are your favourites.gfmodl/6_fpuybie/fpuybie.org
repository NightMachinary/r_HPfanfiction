Grawp/Whomping Willow.\\
Aragog/Flying Ford Anglia.\\
Basilisk/Sorting Hat.\\
Hagrid/Hedwig.\\
Lockhart/Trevor (yes, the toad.)\\
Harry/his broom. Both the Nimbus 2000 and the Firebolt.\\
I've seen one fanfic tagged Lockhart/Stupidity but I'm not sure whether I should take that literally.

I'm also reasonably sure I've seen fics where Fleur wasn't exactly /attacked/ by those Grindylow in the lake, if you know what I mean.
