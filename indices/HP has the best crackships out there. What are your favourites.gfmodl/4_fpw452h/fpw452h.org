I saw one of Harry/Whomping Willow. The grammar was atrocious and made me choke on nothing.

"Depressed after sirius escape, harry stroles the school grounds at night, when he is cought by the whomping willow, which decides to have its wicked way with him."

"Harry was once again falling into deprecion."

Also, strangely, the first time I read it it was in third person, but now it's first person.
