I hate gender neutral pronouns, because they all sound strange to me. So when I don't want to assume a gender for an author, I switch between male and female sometimes. I could have written "himself or herself" and "she or he", but I'm on mobile and that's a lot of typing. I assumed any gender confusion wouldn't bother people, because the gender of the author contributes nothing to my point, and doesn't matter in any way.
