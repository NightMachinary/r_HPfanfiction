Do you consider Harry Potter and the Natural 20 a gamer fic? It could be that table top games translate better into fics than computer games do; table top games have to keep the mechanics just a little simpler because they're intended not to be played on a computer. Plus, they usually have an SRD that you can link to in order to explain how the rules work. This has two advantages: first, the author doesn't have to invent every single thing himself. Second, she doesn't have to write giant walls of text to explain the rules and skills to the readers. People who want to know can check the SRD. Those who don't can just enjoy the story.
