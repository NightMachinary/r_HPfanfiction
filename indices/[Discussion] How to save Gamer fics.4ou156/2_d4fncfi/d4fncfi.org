Almost the only things you can be doing as the reader is to provide good feedback, to show your interest in the genre for encouraging more new authors to experiment with it, and to advertise stories you find to be well written.

The problem with gamer stories (IMO) is that they will inherently be difficult to write. The author of such a story will essentially have to do the work of several people at once: there's the requirement for the usual skills for writing novel-length stories, but then there's also the need for coming up with a thorough [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design#Design_elements][game design]] that will not clash with the plot you are trying to wrap it around.

This includes (but is not limited to) coming up with at least rough (but complete or at least nearly complete) sketches of the game interface, game formulas, game items, etc. In [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/,]] for instance, the author eventually didn't manage to keep up with the initial premise (promise) that [slaying a beast for the first time drops a unique item and spell] --- in the later chapters he started ignoring many dropped items and copying spell effects from video-games he'd played just to use them once (if even that) and move on. TGWP started off as a really well-written story, but its ending arcs were a mangled mess. I don't know if it could've been fixed if the author didn't hurry about finishing it so much, but even during the read-through one could see how some game rules would likely come later to bite the writer and make it harder for him to preserve the quality.

If it's a cross-fic with some already established game universe, then the author will also have to be knowledgeable about that game's universe and laws. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20][/HP & the Natural 20/]] demonstrated that using the D&D environment can yield a well-written story; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][/Dungeon Keeper Ami/]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheTabulaAvatarUniverse][/Tabula Avatar/]] showed the same thing (if maybe to a lesser extent) about the [[http://dungeon-keeper.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_Wiki][DK]] and [[http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki][BG]] respectively.
