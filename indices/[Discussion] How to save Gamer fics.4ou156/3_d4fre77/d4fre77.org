I feel that less is more in those cases. Too often, the stories seem to get lost in grinding - and grinding is boring. I think removing a lot of the game mechanics, especially exact levels and numbers for a lot of the time, would do wonders to let the plot progress. The author can mention levels and ratings when it's important - like "Oh, unlocked X", he doesn't have to write scene after scene where skills are bought and trained that we never see used in important ways afterwards.

Though that would mean there'd need to be a plot in the first place too.
