Organization. A game has a lot of logistics people forget about or maybe remember(which makes it worse). This causes Gamer! fics as you call them to become cluttered messes. When does Harry level? What's considered an accomplishment? Do you want to include a skill tree? An inventory? How do you continue to make a Gamer! fic without making Harry incredibly overpowered? Am I straying too far from the actual Story and just focusing on the gamer part? This is much better related in manga or just actual video games.

And so I guess in short the only real answer is that you can save them by not writing them. They poorly translate onto written word in comparison to other methods. There's just too much to account for that if you actually tried to write a competent gamer fic you'd have easily a 700k+ block wall and by then thats a little unenjoyable. Those are my thoughts on it anyways.
