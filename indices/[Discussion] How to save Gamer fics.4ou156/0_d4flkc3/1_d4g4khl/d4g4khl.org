What if I make it one of those "Illusion of choice games" (Except with actual choice) rather than, you know, An RPG or a MOBA or whatever the kids ar eplaying these days. Harry gets to choose Where he goes, certain actions, pieces of pre fabricated dialogue, but no shit like "You have leveled up! Now choose between these bullshit skills, of which one is clearly superior!" "Your charisma has one extra point now! You may fucking idk use imperius wanlessly because of it, yeah, that sounds balanced and logical"
