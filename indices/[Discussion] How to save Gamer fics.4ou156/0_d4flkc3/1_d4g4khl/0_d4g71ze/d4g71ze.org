Oh, I don't mean to detract you from writing one. I just find them incredibly difficult to write well.\\
That being said if you are. It would be best to list the attributes from said game that you want to model it after. That way you don't go all over the place with anything and everything from a video game you've ever seen. The first couple of chapters should explain(I believe) the extent of his gamer power and the advantages and disadvantages from there. Create a solid foundation of which to build on. Don't fall into a pit of walls of blocks of text where it's too much about the gamer aspect.

I believe what you mentioned however would be somewhat interesting. A lot of recent video games do a lot of story telling and allow the user to choose what to say,where to go, and what to do and the game develops as you go through making decisions. If you are looking for games to look at I would suggest games like Heavy Rain, Infamous, and Mass effect.

But in that case is it really even a "gamer" fic or Harry just intensely thinking about the decisions he makes.
