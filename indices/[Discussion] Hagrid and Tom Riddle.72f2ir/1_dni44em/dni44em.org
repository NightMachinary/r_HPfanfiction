This is an interesting question. It's easy to write Hagrid off as unintelligent and oafish, but you can't really tromp around in the Forbidden Forest without having a keen sense of observation. I don't know how many people other than DD in the Wizarding World had twigged that Voldemort began as Tom Riddle. Slughorn because of the Horcrux question, but I don't know about the other members of the Order. Did the Longbottoms and Harry's parents know that he used to be an orphan boy and that's what helped them defy him as the Dark Lord? Or is this another example of knowledge that DD kept to himself? Did Snape know?

With Hagrid, I can see it going both ways. I don't know that he would have figured it out for himself, but perhaps DD would have trusted him with the knowledge? He trusted him enough to collect baby Harry, so maybe he let it out to certain individuals that Riddle turned into Voldemort after the events of 10/31/81?

Regarding Riddle as the "perfect prefect", is there evidence that Hagrid actively disliked him? I haven't read the books in a while, so I may be forgetting a scene.

Good question!
