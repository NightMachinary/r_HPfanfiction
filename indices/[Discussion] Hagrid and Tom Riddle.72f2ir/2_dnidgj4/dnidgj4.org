It always made sense to me that a lot of the people of their generation knew the origins of Voldemort. He wasn't to subtle about it. He created the name in Hogwarts and Dumbledore alludes to the existence of the Death Eaters when Riddle applies for the Defence position. In my opinion part of the fear of Voldemort name might have come from the knowledge that he personally hunted down anyone who publicly tried to link Riddle and Voldemort.
