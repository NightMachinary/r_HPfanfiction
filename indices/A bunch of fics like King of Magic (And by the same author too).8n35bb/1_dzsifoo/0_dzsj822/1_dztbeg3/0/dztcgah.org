Almost painful? You aren't clearly aren't properly reading the masterpieces that I've provided you with if it's /almost/ painful. These stories are so good that they are physically painful to read until you reach an enlightened state of mind.

(Also, which one did you try reading? /King of Magic/? That literary masterpiece truly embodies the concept of excellent writing and has many delightfully original ideas. I admit that /Learning to Adjust/ doesn't quite live up to the same standard, but it is fairly close.)
