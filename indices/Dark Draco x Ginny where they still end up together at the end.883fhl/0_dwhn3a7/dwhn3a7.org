[[https://app.box.com/s/8uh7cy2213w9wav422d1][Rising From Ashes]] by Arabella and Jedi has a Death Eater Draco with more conviction in their ideology and methods than canon Draco. Arabella always writes excellent villains, and she writes an excellent Draco in particular. However, this is an old fic written pre-OotP, so you'll find the characters (especially Ginny) somewhat OOC.

There is also a prequel - [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=848&chapno=1][The More is My Unrest]] - with onesided Draco/Ginny. There's a fanlore page about it [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_More_is_My_Unrest][here]].
