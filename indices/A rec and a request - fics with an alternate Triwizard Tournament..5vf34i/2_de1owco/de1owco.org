I came to this subreddit because I was looking for a fanfic I read once. As it fits the topic of this post, I'll ask about it here.

In it, Harry asks Dobby to make sure no one enters him into the tournament. This results in Ron and Draco getting entered into the tournament. Does anyone remember this one?
