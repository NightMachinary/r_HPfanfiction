Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) by Jbern has HUGE issues and flaws, but also does tons of stuff right - and the new tournament scenes and revised tournament are very much a part of what it does right. Worth a try. Takes a few chapters to get going. Includes canonish tournanent stuff but also a lot of additional stuff and new material.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon) has pacing issues and is also unfinished and abandoned. That said, it also did some interesting experimentation with alternative tournament stuff eventually.
