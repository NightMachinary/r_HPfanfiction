There are kind of a lot of characters the author hated on in a way that annoyed me. The flanderization in the writer's portrayal of the Weasley twins is one - seriously not cool or interesting to my mind. The really random "Lily slept with Remus" part of the story was stupid and badly done and added basically nothing to the story. I had a similar reaction to the parts with Snape and the polyjuice potion stuff. It felt like the author wanted an excuse to hate on some characters that other people like, and rather than finding a legit reason to do it in their canon portrayal, instead decided to make some bullshit up to make the characters abhorrent.

There were a lot of times, basically, where the author took a dump all over canon portrayals and backstory of characters, but having not changed any elements of the plot prior to the third book's ending, the new portrayals did not actually make sense with how the characters involved had been portrayed in earlier books, and in general these new portrayals were all of the 'this person who was sort of cool-ish in Rowling's work is actually an asshole'. It's sort of like the absolute worst parts of the dreadful Deathly Hallows' Albus Dumbledore backstory stuff, and it was repeated like a half dozen times to no real gain.
