Oh you've definitely jogged my memory. Yeah, I agree that a lot of the characters were fleshed out a lot more than in canon and in directions that probably aren't accurate. But I liked how he didn't bash Ron for once. I think both Ron and Ginny were some of the most reasonable Weasley characters in that fic instead of being mindlessly bashed like in other Godlike!Harry fics.

I actually quite liked the twist about Lily and James though. It showed that they were more flawed than Harry ever knew instead of the saint like figures that they were described as. Lily wasn't cheating on James maliciously or through lust, but simply in desperation in the hope to do a ritual or something to save Harry (I forgot the exact details).

The snape part was pretty overboard though. Still gave a pretty interesting reason for Sirius' "attempted murder" thing instead of purely being Sirius' fault.
