[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Being in an extreme AU, the tasks were completely reworked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): 4 tasks, based on 4 elements - Air, Earth, Fire, Water. Spectators could follow all of them easily. Bad guys had a really good plan.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): All three tasks were original and easy to follow for spectators. Bad guys had a really good plan.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] wrote multiple versions of the TWT event. The most hilarious one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], linkffn(3793741), in which Harry gave minimal effort and intentionally lost the tournament. Dumbledore was not happy, Voldemort even less.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort organized an House-Elf paper airplane production line and got in as the sole Hogwarts champion. Needless to say, he wrecked the Tournament and [[/spoiler][later Voldemort's resurrection party]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]], linkffn(9818387): Ginny was entered into the TWT instead of Harry.
