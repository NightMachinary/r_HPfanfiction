linkffn(8233291), while being the first of four books, takes place during the Triwizard Tournament year. The first task is the same (dragons are always awesome), but the other four are broad strokes at best of the canon Tasks. The story itself is hit or miss with a lot of people, common complaints being that Jen (fem!Harry) is OP and/or a total bitch. That said, it is rather well written one of my favorite fics.
