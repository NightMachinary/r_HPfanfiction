Thank you.

Finally someone who understands that Grindelwald promoted magical communism and Voldemort magical fascism.

So you can say that like in the muggle world, fascism emerged as some sort of "knee-jerk" reaction to communism.

.

I find that linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King) is interesting because of this, and how Harry links various magical political figures to muggle ones.

If I recall correctly, the writer explain what he's aiming for in the 3rd chapter.
