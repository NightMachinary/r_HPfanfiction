In your story, what would be Muggleborns' position in a world ruled by Dumbledore and Grindelwald?

I've read several fics in which they were just portrayed championing the same ideology as Voldemort. I vehemently disagree.

Magical supremacy is NOT THE SAME as Pureblood supremacy.

Grindelwald might very well heavily promote EQUAL RIGHTS for all Magicals, and that would hold immense appeal to Muggleborns who were discriminated by the Pureblood establishment and disillusioned with the Muggle world (WW1, Great Depression, and continued religious persecution).

My head canon says that Muggleborns made up a huge portion of Grindelwald's followers, and atrocities committed by them were a major contributing factor to Voldemort's hate of them.

Dumbledore's own mother was Muggleborn, and it was not certain Grindelwald was a Pureblood. If they had treated Muggleborns like a slave caste, that would have been the equivalent of Dumbledore digging up his own mother's body and pissing on her remains.

Furthermore, both Dumbledore and Grindelwald spoke nothing of 'enslaving' Muggles, but more of ruling Muggles for their own good. Given how badly the Muggle world was messed up after WW1 and the Great Depression, I'm even of the opinion that millions of Muggles would find great appeals in benevolent tyrant with superpowers. After all, how many joined the likes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, KKK, Mao Zedong, and Japanese militarists during the 1930s?
