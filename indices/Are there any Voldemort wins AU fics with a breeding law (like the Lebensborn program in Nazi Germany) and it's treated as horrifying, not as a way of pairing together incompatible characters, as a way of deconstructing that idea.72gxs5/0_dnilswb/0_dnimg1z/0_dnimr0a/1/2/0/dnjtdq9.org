*Mary Sue*

A Mary Sue (if female) or Gary Stu (if male) is often identified as an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. However, with this definition, you rope in many common, good characters in mainstream media. More accurately, a Mary Sue is a character who warps the reality around them, making a Sue-centric story. Often, this character is recognized as an author insert or wish fulfillment.
