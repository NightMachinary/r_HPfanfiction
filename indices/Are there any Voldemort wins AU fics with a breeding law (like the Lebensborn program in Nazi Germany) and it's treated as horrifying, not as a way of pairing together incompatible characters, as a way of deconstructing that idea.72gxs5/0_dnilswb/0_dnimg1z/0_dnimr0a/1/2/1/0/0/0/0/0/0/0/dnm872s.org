I assume she was joking.

But honestly, I really don't take your opinion seriously since you're biased. I mean, in the exact quote you mention here, Word of God says Hermione is "borderline genius", yet you keep saying she's below the twins and the Marauders when it comes to skill.

So, yeah - not taking you seriously.
