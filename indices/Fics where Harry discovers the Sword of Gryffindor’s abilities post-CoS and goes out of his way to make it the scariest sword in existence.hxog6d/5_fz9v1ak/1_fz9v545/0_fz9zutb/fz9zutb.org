No, Vernon takes baby Harry to the alley, and effectively gives him to Gringotts. Goblin raised Harry.

Some of the culture created for the Goblins was excellent, and I use that for headcanon.

But... It's a RobSt fic. Lots of cliche wish-fulfillment and whatnot. He does have some great ideas from time to time. Bad implementation? Something along those lines.

Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hfrtyq/so_ive_seen_a_lot_of_hate_for_robst_on_this_sub/][reddit post]] with people discussing his work.

All around, if you have nothing else to read, I say read them. They aren't the worst you'll ever read, but his works are practically a HPFanfic staple. You will love some parts, hate others, and becomes neutral or bored with the rest of it.
