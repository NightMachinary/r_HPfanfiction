Man, has no one here ever heard of the concept of swords being used to throw blades of force/magic?

I don't want to insult anyone, but have some imagination!

Here are some examples of op sword powerups:

-You block with the sword and a magic shield springs up from it

-When you slash with it, you can choose to release build-up magic in an instant, creating a crescent moon of pure magic/elemental power/fabric-of-reality tearing force. You can slash and literally cut down a whole forest.

-Pointing the sword upwards releases a huge burst of magic that synergizes with your phoenix's song to make your troop's morale soar (while also boosting everyone's power a little bit).

-Stabbing the sword into the earth will effect a huge circle of land. The ground will become elementally deformed or a huge shield will spring up from that circle or a bunch of meteors will drop in the area or all three and more will happen all at once.

-Simply pulling out the sword from it's scabbard will don you with an infinitely light, yet infinitely tough and infinitely shock-absorbent armor that also looks cool.
