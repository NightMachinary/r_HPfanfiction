Unless you're writing a crossover where the other universe is just way too above in power scale compared to HP, there is no point in making the sword more deadly. It can already kill pretty much anything in HP.

Now, if you want to have a crossover with Marvel or DC and want to cut guys like Galactus and Lucifer, then sure, make the sword as deadly as you want.
