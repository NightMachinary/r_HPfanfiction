I'm imagining a fic where Harry and friends travel around the world looking for more and more dangeous substances to expose the sword to, and their antics in getting those substances onto the sword.

"Ok Harry, the snares are in place" Ron whispered.

"Ron, are you sure Bill said these vines are strong enough to hold a nundu?"

"Yes Harry, they are strong enough, you just need to find a way to get the Nundu to deepthroat the sword while breathing on it, i've done my part"

"Yeah thanks for the "help"" Harry replied.

"Chin up Harry" Hermione interjected "We've still got to find a way to get the gorgon to glare at the sword."
