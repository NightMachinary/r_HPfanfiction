I suppose you could find some BS excuse to make it become something like the flaming sword in Lucifer which can cut the fabric of the universe itself, erases the person cut by it from existence, is capable of destroying the gates of heaven and is an actual threat to both the god and goddess(who are supposedly omnipotent), besides it maybe giving it the power to cut at a distance by energy blasts (though why it would be used when Harry has a wand capable of doing just the same and much more is honestly beyond me), the fact is that there isn't much we can do to better its offensive powers that a wand won't do better.

The best power I have seen it have was actually supplementary with it serving as a battery to store magic so that Harry can use later.
