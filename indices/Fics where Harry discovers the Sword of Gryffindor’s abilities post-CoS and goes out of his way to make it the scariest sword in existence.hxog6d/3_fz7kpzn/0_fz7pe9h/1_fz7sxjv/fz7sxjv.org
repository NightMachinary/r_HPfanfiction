But what's the point of putting that stuff in the /sword/?

The Killing Curse will murder at "I can see you, therefore I can kill you" range. Fiendfyre will cover a room the size of the Great Hall.

The sword has a range of barely over arm's length and only destroys things one, maybe two at a time. You have basically nothing to gain from using a sword infused with either if you're willing and able to cast the spells in the first place.
