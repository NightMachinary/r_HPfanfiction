I mean if it's on your side... lol.

Although, we don't know the limits as to what will actually be absorbed by it. Basilisk venom, Fiendfyre, and the Killing Curse are all powerful enough to destroy Horcruxes (I believe the KC is able to but not sure if that's actually confirmed), and the sword can absorb Basilisk venom, then something equally destructive should also be able to be absorbed.

I wonder what would happen if you just made a Horcrux out of a goblin-smithed object. Do we know if the Locket, Cup, or Diadem were goblin made?
