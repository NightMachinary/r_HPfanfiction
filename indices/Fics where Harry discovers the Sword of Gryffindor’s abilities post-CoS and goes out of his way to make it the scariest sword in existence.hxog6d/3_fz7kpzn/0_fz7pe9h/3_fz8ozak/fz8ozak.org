There was a fic (don't remember the name, hope someone knows) in which Harry used the sword to block spells and it was absorbed and the next person cut would also get the spell back (though spells could be used once. It basically stored what was blocked). During one battle he blocked a killing curse and then killed either a Death Eater or a giant with it.
