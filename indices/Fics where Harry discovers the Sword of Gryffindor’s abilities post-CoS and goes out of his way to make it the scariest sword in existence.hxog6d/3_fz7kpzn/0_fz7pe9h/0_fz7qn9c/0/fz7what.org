Depends on how exhausting you consider magic to be, and how the sword works. If constantly casting high powered spells can exhaust someone, then having a sword with said magic imbued within it can be a great backup. For Fiendfyre, since it's difficult to control then having a sword enchanted with it will allow you to use it without having to keep control over it. Granted, in canon you can use normal fire against Inferi, but maybe you have a group of people with you and you're worried about collateral damage if you just start up an inferno. So you can use smaller fire spells, or the sword, which can again depend on how exhausting using powerful magic is.

As for the Killing Curse, this is a bit more interesting, I think. Since Basilisk venom seems to need to be injected into the body (via fangs), then it'd make sense for the sword to need to cut into the skin to get the venom into the body. But, since the Killing Curse only needs to touch someone/thing to kill them, then perhaps the sword would only need to touch a person to kill them, rather than cutting them. In this case, I think something like a Goblin-forged spoon would be more useful. It's smaller, would leave no wounds (while a sword or dagger could leave a cut even if you're being careful), there's no flash of green light, and it's far easier to touch someone with a spoon without anyone noticing compared to a sword or dagger. So it'd actually make a great, stealthy assassination weapon, so long as no one sees you or investigates the spoon too closely.

As for the sword, if we're sticking with that, well I think if someone can't cast the Killing Curse, but uses the sword to block the curse from hitting them, then the sword would be imbued and wielded by someone who can't cast the Killing Curse themselves. Even if they could cast other spells that could kill, not much is as efficient as the KC. I imagine even something like a dragon could be killed by the curse, even if other spells bounce off, so just tapping them with the sword should be able to kill it.

In short, how useful it would be depends greatly on the rules you set up as well as the situations you put your characters in. I actually think this makes the whole thing better, as it grants access to abilities and solutions to problems the main cast might not normally have (kind of like what JKR did with the sword in the actual series), without making it an overpowered battle weapon that can just kill everyone, whereas something like a gun that's enchanted to shoot out the Killing Curse would actually be completely overpowered.
