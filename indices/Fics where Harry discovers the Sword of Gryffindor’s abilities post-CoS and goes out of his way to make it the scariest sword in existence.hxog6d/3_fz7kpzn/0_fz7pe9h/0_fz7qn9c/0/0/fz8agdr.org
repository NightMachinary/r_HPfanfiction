Voldemort looked at the Death Eaters fallen before him. Slowly, almost carefully he tasted magic in the air, an ability he gained after his latest ritual, and noticed the slight tang of Death, metal and...soup?

The Death aftertaste was easily explainable, after all, he was intimate with it from his teenage years.

The Metal thought, he only tasted it the previous war, when goblins managed to fight back a squad of Death eaters. The magic lingering in the wounds that were caused by various enchanted swords and axes stang of it.

But...the last one. The...soup. It truly scared him.

He was reminded of his fights with Dumbledore, where magic swirled, changed and moulded to their casters wishes. And although they both were accomplished wizards, they only managed to change their magic to elements, and, although he never would admit it, only Dumbledore managed to give his magic the taste of Animals, his choice of transfiguration.

But this... This was something never seen. To change a sacred thing such as magic, a force that differentiated Him from those filthy muggles, into such a...mundane thing as...soup. Truly frightening.

Only wizards who surpass Dumbledore and Himself could change it so thoroughly.

And that means only one thing.

A new player has entered a game.

And Lord Voldemort shall no longer consider that bearded fool his greatest rival. No. Only a wizard who has such control and authority over magic is worthy of being His opponent.
