Sure, it doesn't seem like it in canon (it's not explicitly mentioned but any tiredness could be excused by the fight itself, or if we're talking about dementors it could be from their draining effects rather than exhaustion from the Patronus). However, plenty of people use it in their fics, whether it be from some "magical core" or simply that it can tire you out if you aren't used to the power of the spells you're using. Which is a good balancing factor. If magic takes no effort to cast other than knowledge and concentration then it's easy for your characters to become overpowered and have no negative effects from it. Whereas having magic be like a muscle that requires training and practice to not get tired while casting more powerful spells, it provides character training and growth that relies on more than just learning, they have to actually work towards becoming more powerful.

Like, imagine someone teaches you how to bench press. You learn the proper technique and body positioning, and after a bit of work you have it down. You're not suddenly an Olympic-level weightlifter. You have to start small and work your way up to it. Whereas if magic only takes knowledge and a bit of practice to actually learn a spell, you now have an unlimited supply of bombs to throw at your opponent, only limited by how fast you can wave your wand.
