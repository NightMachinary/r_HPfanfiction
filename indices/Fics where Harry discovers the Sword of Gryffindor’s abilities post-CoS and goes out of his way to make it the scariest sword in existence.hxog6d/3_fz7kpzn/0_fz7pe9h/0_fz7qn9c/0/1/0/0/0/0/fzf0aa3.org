I don't like that â€˜anything goes' thing. Just cause it's fanfic doesn't mean it shouldn't be quality work. I get that people who write it are generally inexperienced, but unless I'm mistaken their goal is to become better writers, no? If you just say anything goes and leave it at that then you don't get better.
