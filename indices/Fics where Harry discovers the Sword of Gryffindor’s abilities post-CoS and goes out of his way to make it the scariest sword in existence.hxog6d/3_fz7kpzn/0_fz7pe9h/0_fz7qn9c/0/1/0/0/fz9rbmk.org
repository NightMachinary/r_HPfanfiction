It's been said before so I won't give a whole speech but power level isn't the point of HP magic. There's a reason the final show down between Harry and Voldemort wasn't a battle of skill. It's about deeper themes than who knows more powerful magic. If an author can't stick to canon HP magic rules and still make the story interesting, that's on them.
