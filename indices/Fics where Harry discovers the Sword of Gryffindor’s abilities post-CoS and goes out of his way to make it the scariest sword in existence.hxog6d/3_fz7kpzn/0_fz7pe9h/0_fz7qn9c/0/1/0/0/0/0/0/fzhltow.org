Not necessarily. For most, it's a hobby. Some people are really dedicated to their hobby, and, as you point out, try to improve. Some have found a way to profit off of it. Others use it as stress relief, as entertainment, for personal wish fulfillment, as escapism, or as a coping method. I don't mean to sound harsh, but you're demanding that other people invest their time and effort into creating free stuff up to your standard of quality. They don't owe you anything. Maybe you got instant noodles when you were expecting a grilled steak but at the end of the day, free food is free food.

edit: Also when I said "anything goes" I meant it creatively. If someone's writing horror, I don't expect the same sense of whimsy as shown in canon. Crossovers especially are a fascinating place to see the intersection of genre clashing together and making something new. People make alternate universes all the time. The rules change. The world is a sandbox. Sometimes that means it becomes a more gimmicky power level focused fic. As an example, I think harem fics are generally sexist and demeaning, with incredibly one-dimensional characters and repetitive plotlines, but that just means I ignore them instead of trying to control what people write, read, and want.
