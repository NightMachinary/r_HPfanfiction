Basilisk venom is already considered the deadliest poison in existence in-canon. You can't get much more lethal than "fatal within seconds with a single cut, and destroys the best-protected magical artifacts".

Plus, you know, wands let you blow up 12 people with, at most, 2 words - so there's not much point to a sword for a Wizard.

There's a few fics that boil down to "Harry gets a super-sword that's better than the Sword of Gryffindor in every way for no adequately explained reason" but none of them are actually /good/ and he almost never ends up using it for anything.
