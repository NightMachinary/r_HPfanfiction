As noted by many others, the main problem is that the SoG is a melee weapon in a setting where the ranged options are just too good.

Possibilities to fix this:

1. Introduce some mechanic that makes melee better (for example, at range, magical combat becomes a contest of who chooses the best shield combination that blocks the enemy spells for the least effort, with the loser being the one who fails to block something deadly, or runs out of energy first. At close range, the opponent's shields interact with each other and short out, so Harry, lacking regular magical combat experience, just aims to get in close and cut through everything.)
2. Borrow from Dune, there are shields that have an obvious tell that do a MAD if hit by offensive spells, most wizards don't use them because they can't while holding them, either, but Harry can use them plus the SoG to great effect.
3. Some form of metal armour that grounds out most or all spells at the cost of limiting casting ability
4. Harry is a Squib, or has some other disability that greatly limits his ability to at least /cast/ magic (leaving open passive magics or things like rituals and runes).
5. Harry has a magic-immune Animagus form that also cannot cast, but can wield a sword.
6. Harry can extend the cutting range of the sword, and that extension carries all the properties of the SoG, either by some inherent ability of or addition to the SoG (like he can extend or retract the blade), or some inherent ability that lets him cut things he can't actually reach (if you've read Worm, Jack Slash's power).
