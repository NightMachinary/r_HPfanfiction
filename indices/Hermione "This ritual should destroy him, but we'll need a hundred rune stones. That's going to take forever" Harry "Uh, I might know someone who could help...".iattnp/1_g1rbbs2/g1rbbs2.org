"But Professor Potter, that's ridiculous! How could a MUGGLE device be so important in defeating Voldemort!"

Harry pinched the bridge of his nose as he audibly sighed. Ten years on from the battle, and four years into his time teaching History of Magic at Hogwarts, and he still managed to get this reaction from classes whenever he told this particular story.

"I assure you it's true" he sighed, "I was there after all. And Voldemort would never have been defeated without it. As the Minister so often reminds me, the PD-500 is an incredibly reliable tool with a proven track record in more than just the war against Voldemort."

The class notably perked up, and Harry internally groaned. Give it a few seconds and the usual question would come... Why couldn't he keep his mouth shut? Honestly, he preferred it back when HE was the centre of all Voldemort related attention, and that was saying something!

"You know the Minister, Professor? What's he like? My father says he's amazing! This country wouldn't be the same without him he says! We wouldn't have won the war without him he says, and without his strong leadership and business knowledge the country would never have recovered so quickly! Truly a wizard beyond all of us he says!"

"Yes, yes I'm acquainted with the Minister, Mister Donovan. Thank you. It's true that we were lucky to have him on our side in the war, and as much as we've never really gotten along that well..."

"Do you not like the Minister, Professor? Why? My dad says he's a hero and if he hadn't brought us all those PD-500s when he did we'd all be dead! He can't really be bad can he?! The papers say he's an orphan lover and everything! Raised one himself while running his drill company, but that was before he got into politics of course!"

Harry sighed once more. "My history with Minister Dursley is complicated, Mister Donovan, and that's all I have to say on the subject. We're here to study modern wizarding history. Now, let's get back to our discussion on the PD-500 thank you very much."
