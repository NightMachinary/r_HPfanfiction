Unfortunately however, fate tended to have a way of playing games with Harry sometimes. Before he could get any further, there was a knock at the classroom door and the Head Boy stuck his head inside.

"Excuse me Professor Potter, sorry to interrupt but the Headmistress is asking for you. She says it's urgent."

'What god did you upset this morning?' his internal monologue muttered as he quickly dismissed the class and hurriedly made his way to the Headmistress' office. Going up there always made him think of old times, when it had been Dumbledore sat behind the desk and it felt like magic oozed from every corner of the room. A long, long time ago now though...

He gave himself a moment to compose himself before entering the office, but as his gaze swept the room his heart sank at what he found even as his Aunt Petunia, now in her own fourth year as Headmistress of Hogwarts, spoke up first.

"There you are, you took your time." she snapped, "Don't you think we have better things to do than wait around for you all day? We raised you better than this, honestly..."

Turning her back on him and bustling over to a dresser which sat where he still remembered Fawkes' perch sitting, he mumbled out a quick "Sorry Aunt Petunia" before the great comfy chair which had once housed the greatest wizard to have ever lived swivelled round to face him.

"Don't you take that tone with your Aunt boy, and show her some respect! That's 'Headmistress' to you! We didn't spend all those years beating the freakishness out of you only to let poor manners take its place!"

"Why can't you be more like our Diddums?!" his Aunt snapped, whilst slipping on a pair of extremely ostentatious sapphire earrings whilst looking at a still picture of Dudley sat upon the dresser. "Always so polite, he understands what it's like to act with dignity!"

"Quite right Pet," Vernon agreed. "And I won't stand for any more of this disrespect, boy. You're not a child any more and we gave you this job to try and make something of you! You were a disgrace to the family name when we met and made that Grunnings deal all those years ago, and I'll be damned if we'll have you running around like that tarring our name after all the hard work we're putting in to fix this world of yours!"

"Of course Minister." he wearily replied, long experience telling him that arguing would not be the correct course of action here.

"That's better." Vernon bristled. "Now, we've got an important Ministry function to attend this evening - I'm looking to close a very lucrative deal for us - and the country of course. As soon as your Aunt's ready we're going to be leaving. And we're both ready for a break, so it'll be a few days before she returns. We expect you to look after the school whilst we're away."

Harry couldn't help himself - he'd planned to see Ron and Hermione that night. "But what about Dudley! Isn't he supposed to be the Deputy Headmaster?!"

"Don't you dare take that tone with me!" Vernon thundered, before a sly smile crept onto his face. "You listen to me and listen good, boy. You will do what you're told. I run this freakish society now and don't you forget it. Things could be very difficult for you if the conqueror of Voldewotsit turned Minister of Magic let slip about some of the things you got up to when you were younger. How you terrified poor Petunia and Dudders during your schooling and nearly poisoned us on this world and magic entirely."

"And where would all these freaks be without us, eh boy? Don't you forget that debt you owe to me for the help I gave you during that war all those years ago. Life debt was it? That bushy haired know-it-all of yours said it would be very painful if it were broken, didn't she?"

The room fell silent, a cold biting tension filling the air. Before either could break it though, Petunia sniffed and turned to face them.

"I'm ready Vernon, let's go. I can't bear to stay in this filthy castle a moment longer."

"Right you are, Pet." Vernon replied as he took her hand and led her to the office door, only pausing for a second to issue a final threat before slamming the door behind them. "You remember what I said boy. If Dudders tells us ANYTHING has been out of the ordinary whilst we're gone you'll be for it!"

With them gone, Harry slumped back against the desk as the tension slowly drained out of him. How in the hell had the world come to this?
