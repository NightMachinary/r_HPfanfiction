/The room was dark, but not silent. No, along the pillared walls, there was hissing, clanking, and other mechanical noises. The air was humid and thick with dust and ash. The only light provided by a line of flickering flourescent bars hanging from somewhere high above./

"And who is this, that dares enter my hewn halls?" came the booming voice, echoing through the room. The three wizards grasped their wands tighter and advanced, jumping at every loud CLACK or PLINK emanating from the dancing shadows.

"We are seekers! We beseech the mighty Vernon, to grant us a drill!" Shouted the leader defiantly. The lights bathed everything in monochrome light, but his eyes held a hint of color. The three planted themselves in a defensive formation before the machine throne, two keeping watch and one speaking.

The figure in the dark throne did not look impressed. He hefted his immense bulk forward in a lean, looming over their frightened forms. The shadows veiled his face, but a feral grin was visible underneath.

"And what might you need with one of my drills, /boy/?" he whispered, the noise almost lost in the rising steam.

The leader shrunk back as though struck, but his companions held fast and he gained strength from them.

"Our quest is survival! Not just our own, but the survival of us all... including you."

The mighty one shifted backwards, the springs and pistons creaking in his chair. He sunk into a shadow, in thought.

"Your reasoning is compelling, yet I wonder... will your enemy find me here, in my hewn halls?" The flickering light glinted in his mirrored sunglasses, and his moustache quivered in the shadow.

"He finds all." was the response.

"I am willing to consider it... yet first, you must prove yourselves worthy of my drills. Not merely any man is meant to wield one... only the strongest, most ruthless and cunning will do."

His chair elevated, the hydraulics protesting under the weight pressed upon them, as he loomed above.

"Survive my gauntlet, and you shall have your drill."

/Suddenly, the ambient noises grew faint, then stopped. The mist began thickening, and so did the dust in the air - with a start, all three cast a spell to allow breathing, and another to shield their eyes. Suddenly, the other man fell backwards, pointing at something behind the two. They turned around, and beheld the largest drill they'd ever seen, coming right at them./
