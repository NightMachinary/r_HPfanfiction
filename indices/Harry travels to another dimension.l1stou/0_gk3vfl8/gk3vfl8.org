I cannot believe no one has recommended The Second String.

â€‹

Its bloody brilliant. Harry ends up in stuck 1976, same year as his parents. He finds his own little family and niche in the world. Ends up fighting as a vigilante in the war. Has to do all this other stuff I don't want to spoil. Its exciting and scary and hillarious and sweet and all the things you want a fic to be. There's a twist and a resolution and eugh. 10/10. Brilliant. Y'all should read it it has gay pirates what else do you want?
