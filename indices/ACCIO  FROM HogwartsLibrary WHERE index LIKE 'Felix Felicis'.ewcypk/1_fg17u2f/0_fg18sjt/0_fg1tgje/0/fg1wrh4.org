Cool, thanks for the answer, really nice of you. Since HP is, kinda sorta generally, soft magic that should mean the intent is more important that anything else. In this case knowing how exactly that language works should help make it an easier to use magic, maybe?

So, free thinking here, that would mean that the more in depth and precise a programming language is the more precise your spells could become. I understand logic gates easily enough. So building a language up from n/and, xn/x/n/or would be possible to describe incredibly complex spells after building a language from the base level right?

I just play around with circuits and logic gates for fun with the kids. Not any real in depth knowledge here. Just thinking about the possibilities of building a magic computer. That would be cool since magic can affect the atomic level easily enough. I'm rambling now at this point, just think it's cool to be able to cast a spell and have a magic interface that is a computer whenever you want.

Like Tony Stark hologram tech cranked up to 10, multiplied a few magnitudes of order and made so any witch or wizard can use it. Seems really cool.

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to put it all down.
