I was thinking of using magic as a mutliphase system. If it can rearrange electrons, neutrons, and protons easily at the minimum it can control those forces as well. (Transfiguration is permanent according to what I can find from the books and JK's words on the subject.)

Since magic in Rowling's world let's you do cool things like play with fire (flame freezing spell) it should be easily able to make stable controls of states. So you could have 118 variables in 4 different states each as a single operator. (Ignoring states like Bose-Einstien Condensate and Time Crystals for now.)

Now pack all of that into a programming language and use it to cast spells. You could make a spell based hologram so easily. You're absolutely right, it would be easy cooler than an enchanted table.

That hardest part would be making the code streamlined enough to be workable. But that's the wonder of magic, it should just work anyways.

I figure the biggest obstacle, besides the insane mathematics needed to build it, would be sustaining the magic as you used the spells. But that's not something ever addressed either. Even magical exhaustion is an entirely fan creation. There is no magic fatigue or anything similar written in the books. We don't actually know how they access magic or where it comes from. Just that some are more powerful than others and that's it.
