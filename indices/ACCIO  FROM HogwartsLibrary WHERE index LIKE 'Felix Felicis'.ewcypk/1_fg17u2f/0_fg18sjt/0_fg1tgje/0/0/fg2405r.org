Fair warning: I'm not a computer engineer so my knowledge of circuitry is slightly incomplete.

Okay, so first off Canon Harry Potter magic isn't well defined which makes it infinitely more difficult to discuss because we don't know what we're working with.

The first difficulty is that electronics work by there being two states: high voltage and low voltage (or in cases of memory magnetized and unmagnetized). I don't know if Magic could be designed to work in such a way.

In my head, I've thought of using runes like a programming language. If each rune had its own meaning you could string them together to make a spell, give it a name like Wingardum Leviosa (so no one would ever accidentally use the spell), have some way of turning it into a spell (like by burning the paper with a different spell), which then creates the spell that everyone can use.

Or course magic just does whatever it wants so there a chance you could cause the apocalypse by casting a new spell. Or far more likely it does nothing because it got confused half way through and gave up (which computers do all. the. time.)

Of course there becomes the issue that what if two people name a spell the same thing, what would the magic do? Do you have a spell that performs two different ways depending on which spell creation you are closer too? If one spell is performed more often does it get precedence?

Back to the question at the end: at first I thought about creating a runic table that could act like a holographic interface (which is infinitely more easier to do since magic can manipulate light and thus create holograms), but I realized if you could inscribe runes on the table, you could make into a spell which is way cooler.
