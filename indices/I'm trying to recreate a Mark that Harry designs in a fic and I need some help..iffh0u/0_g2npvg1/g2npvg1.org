  Harry started with the stem of the rose, it wasn't a simple drawing of a line, no, inside the stem were interlaced runes that would be the start of the process. They would be so small though, that one could not see them if one didn't know where to look. This stem was the core of it and a deep emerald green matching his eyes perfectly.

  His blood had been required for this particular potion and it would ensure every one of his marked would be connected to him on a subtle level. Next he began the rose bud after cleansing his brush and moving the green aside. This rose would be in full bloom and a deep crimson red it would also have hidden symbols within it.

  After that he began his first snake, hissing in parseltongue under his breath as he went, the first one was a deep black that seemed endless. It coiled around the stem and reared up just over the blooming rose with an open hissing mouth. The body was very intricate with every scale detailed holding a different Parseltongue symbol and made the snake seemingly alive. Next he cleansed his brush and added his white accents to the snake.

  It got pearly white eyes and wide spread wings that had every feather in detail only possible with magic. He repeated the process on the opposite side of the rose this time with a white snake with black eyes and wings.
