Neville for Gryffindor, it helps ease his anxiety and noticeably makes his memory worse.

Luna for Ravenclaw, I mean obviously, some of her thoughts sound like it could have come from some college dude after taking a huge hit from the bong. "like, its the ministry covering this shit up man"

Tonks definitely did probably until her 6th or 7th year when she decided to try to be an Auror, then IDK Ernie or Leanne probably.

And Daphne as the head distributor, Probably taking over from some older cousin who graduates her first year.
