Daphne is pretty fun in this Luna/Hermione fic i've been reading, she did start as a bit ice queen-y but is a lot softer as the fic goes on and she pairs off with Pansy haha they both bond with Hermione Luna and form there own little weird friendship group its pretty cute haha linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]])
