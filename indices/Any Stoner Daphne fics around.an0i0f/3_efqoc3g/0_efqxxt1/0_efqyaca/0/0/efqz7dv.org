If I see anything, for sure! I'll admit though I don't usually read a lot of Daphne fics, but James is one of my fave authors so I read everything he writes and he likes Daphne! I do believe he's got something else with her in the works, but no idea as to when that might be out... maybe follow him on FFN and if he ever posts it you'll know!
