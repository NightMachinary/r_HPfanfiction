[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10654712/1/Lady-of-the-Lake][Lady of the Lake]] (wow, i seem to be recommending this one a lot lately.) post-canon, Hermione stages a political coup surrounded by the children of Death Eaters. Dramione, hints of ritual magic, quite a bit of Weasley bashing but it's well-written and OOC. kinda dark later on and might be potentially triggering to some.
