Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is a bit different than the others.

It's canon divergence after 4th year, so she's a Gryffindor and her Muggleborn Resistance effectively replaces the DA, with the difference that it's muggleborns that want to overthrow the pureblood-dominated government.

She's the effective leader, although she struggles to maintain control of her group later on when a boy two years above her has different opinions on acceptable targets.

After Umbridge effectively makes it impossible for muggleborns to stay at Hogwarts for their NEWT years, Hermione has to leave after 5th year and the group starts the war by bombing the summer ball at Malfoy Manor the summer before 6th year. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy as well as the parents of almost all Slytherins in Draco's year and many more unnamed Death Eater sympathizers dead in an instant.

Well, Dumbledore wanted a war against Voldemort, just not with the Ministry on Voldemort's side.
