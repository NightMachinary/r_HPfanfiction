The Life and Times, linkffn(5200789) is pretty popular. I liked the writing style, chapter length, and that each chapter has a mini story going on. The characters are well done, and the OCs are really good too. Personally I don't usually like when every once-mentioned adult from the series is lumped into the same year or two (Alice and Frank were probably much older than the Marauders tbh; plus I don't think they knew Marlene McKinnon outside the Order), but I loved this fic anyways.
