Teenagers have sex. Hell preteens are having sex with each other. Stories about teenagers and their serious relationships should eventually involve sex. They don't have to graphically describe it though. To pretend no wizard or witch has sex before they're an adult is idiotic in the extreme.

Straight up smut fics with no plot...Meh. That's a different kettle of fish and is up to the individual reader as to if it's ok.

I personally don't care one way or the other. Sword of Gryffindor was quite funny for something that had a lot of sex in it. There's also been plenty of stories that had no sex that I enjoyed too.
