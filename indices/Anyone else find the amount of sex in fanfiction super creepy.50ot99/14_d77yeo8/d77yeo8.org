When the entire canon for your fandom takes place when all your primary characters are minors (ok, 90%), most sex that takes place is going to be underaged. And yes, a lot of fanfiction is going to be about sex, no matter what. Fandoms with canon adult primary characters don't generally de-age them for stories, so it's primarily working with what canon gives you.
