Sketchy though it may be, it's really not that awful. There are far worse things depicted in fanfiction that people rarely take issue with.

And something like that I wouldn't consider problematic in the context of fiction. Fiction can always be the best case scenario. Best case scenario of romantic entanglements between teenagers and adults /can/ end well.

In real life the odds of that are extremely low. In fiction, not so much.
