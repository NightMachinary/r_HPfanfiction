Well... teenagers have sex in real life. They tend to want to have sex, or do sex related things, just as much if not more so than adults.

Underage as far as sex is concerned can mean very different things depending on where you are.

Thus, I find your question just a little confusing.

Unless of course you're talking about those stories where a 11 year old Harry is sleeping about in his 1st year. That's slightly concerning, but since it's all fiction in the end I turn a blind eye to it.
