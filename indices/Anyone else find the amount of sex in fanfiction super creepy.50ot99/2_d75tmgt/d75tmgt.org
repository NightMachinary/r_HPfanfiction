As someone who started reading fanfiction for the smut. I quickly realized that the really good fanfiction writers, For example Taure, Seriouscribble, and Shezza to name a couple don't write graphic sex scenes. They have a well thought out story already any any sex that is included is mostly background noise and the people are usually adults. Some sex fics I've read like " Harry Potter: Amoral and Amorous" or "Mad Snorckacks and Englishmen" and even "For Love of magic" by noodlehammer may have smut up the wazoo and Harry is only 14 in that fic, but the author writes well enough that I find I don't really even think of the age of the characters. More importantly though this is fanfiction the characters aren't real so there really is nothing wrong with whatever is written if that's your thing.
