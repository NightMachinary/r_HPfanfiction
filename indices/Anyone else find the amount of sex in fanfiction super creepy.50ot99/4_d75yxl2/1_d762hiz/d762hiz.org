1) bothers me more than anything. I can't read anything forced. It sends chills up my spine and to be honest makes me want to puke.

2) is why I stay away from a certain site that also has a lot of well a quite different Harry. I will admit I had my fangirl moments when I was younger... well okay I will do, but whole stories on how girls want to meet their crush are creepy. It's also why I generally stay away from OC characters which are often thinly disguised self inserts

3) I actually don't have a problem with if it's written well. Like if the story stands on its own and the smut is obviously for the author and the reader just happens to get to see it too.

My number 4 is that I can't stand if they are under 15/16 and going at it constantly. You can have a good romance without sex in a lot of stories. I understand that isn't the point of smut, but still under that age bothers me and I can't really explain why other than I think they are too young
