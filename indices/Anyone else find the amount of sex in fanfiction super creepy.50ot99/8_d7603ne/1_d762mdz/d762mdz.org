  I mean to be fair if you want to realistically write about teenagers you also need to write about sex or at least their sex drives. Personally I don't find it that weird to display a 15-16 year old thinking about sex a lot I mean do you remember being that age?

I do and that's why I don't mind it. I mean it's one thing to have them think about it and maybe even have some experimentation. We were all that age once if not still at that age.

  Though there is a difference between how an author like say noodlehammer writes it and someone who has 2-3 sex scenes every chapter, that probably isn't going to make for a good story.

I just think that 2-3 a chapter actually becomes boring after a while
