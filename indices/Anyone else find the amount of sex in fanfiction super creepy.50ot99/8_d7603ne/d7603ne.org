I mean to be fair if you want to realistically write about teenagers you also need to write about sex or at least their sex drives. Personally I don't find it that weird to display a 15-16 year old thinking about sex a lot I mean do you remember being that age? Though there is a difference between how an author like say noodlehammer writes it and someone who has 2-3 sex scenes every chapter, that probably isn't going to make for a good story.
