Teenagers will be teenagers, frankly I attribute the lack of sex in the series itself to the fact that it's for children/young-adults.

So yeah, there would be sex if you "lock up" a bunch of teens for most of the year in a castle somewhere isolated (Hogsmeade is near, but that's a smallish village and even the older students can't just go there whenever they want (kind of strange if you ask me...I was allowed to take the bus to the next city at 10 if I wanted to, so why aren't the students allowed to just go to Hosmeade once they are done with their work for the day or on weekends without it being a "Hogsmeade-Weekend"?)), it's inevitable!
