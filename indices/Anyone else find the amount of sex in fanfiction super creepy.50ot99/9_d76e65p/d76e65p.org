I think more like 5% takes place with underage children, unless I'm reading *way* different stories than you. i can't remember the last time I even ran into a story featuring someone under sixteen having sex. Although, I read mostly fests which tend to not allow underage characters to have sex in them. Still even on AO3 - I don't run into it much.

As for the title question, there is no more sex in fan fiction than in original fiction. It is just that in original fiction we have it all separated and fan fiction is gathered all in one place. If you filtered out romance and erotica as genres, I'm sure you wouldn't run into it as much just like with original fiction. (Although, it's still there.)

They were talking about incest and parent/child incest in the comments and that reminded me that my first reading of brother/sister incest was an original published book (a very popular one) when I was thirteen. The first time I read parent/child incest was an accident on an erotica fiction website. I had just got an account and was stumbling around and just read the top rated stuff instead of searching out genre I actually liked.

Not my thing, but it's not real.

Is it weird and creepy that people read about these things they'd never do in real life? Meh, I'm pretty sure that's why everyone reads. The dirty wrongness of a lot of this stuff /is/ the appeal. They'd still be disgusted with it in real life.
