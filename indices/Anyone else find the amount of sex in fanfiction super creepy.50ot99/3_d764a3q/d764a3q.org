Actually, I find the really strange thing is how canon and many fanfics tend to completely gloss over the normal teenage hormonal rampage. Teenage co-ed boarding school....?

That said, the really underage and graphic stuff is creepy. But the amount of it, by itself, suggests that it's there for a reason. People either (A) want to write it or (B) want to read it.
