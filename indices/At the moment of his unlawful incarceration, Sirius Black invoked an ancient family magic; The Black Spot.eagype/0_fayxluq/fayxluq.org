Wow!

Very detailed and actually original.

Personally I would add the idea of a countdown, the more time someone has a Black Spot, the more magic is taken from them slowly killing them. This would only apply to the one who asked for it (In this case Sirius) so he would have to work swiftly to get revenge or suffer consequences, so by the time he gets out in POA he doesn't use much magic.

Also Sirius should have a mark on his body to signal that he did it, and the antagonists could be guessing who put the Black spot on them. This could lead to more Black family members from outside the UK entering and Sirius having to play a double role, not knowing about the Spot but acting upon it like a Vigilante.

The main antagonist in this would be Pettigrew, I would make him more adept to make things more fair. Have him learn more darker magic and bc he spent a lot of time as a rat he has supernatural reflexes and is fast(?)

And Dirius cannot die until all the black Spots on those who wronged him are dead. So Sirius rushes to kill someone and gets his ass handed to him.

To me at least this would create character growth for Sirius, to learn from his previous life and have him switch to a more political and vigilante opponent.

I would also scrap the Heir bit, I like it but I dont think Harry should be involved much. He should be involved but Sirius doesn't tell him the revenge plot of the Spot and slowly as Sirius delves into more moral dilemmas Harry should leave Sirius and Sirius would re evaluate his choices.

Personally that's how I would structure a fic based of your prompt, and Sirius dying at the end but him leaving everything to Harry. The end would be Harry putting a Black Spot on Voldemort who kills Sirius...

Voilla!!!
