I lean towards yes.

They seem to spend months on blast ended screwts, something it's implied Hagrid created as a lark, and the kids will never run into again. It's a complete waste of time.

If Hagrid gets depressed, they spend weeks on flobberworms, again a complete waste of time.

That said, there is a scene in Timely Errors linkffn(4198643) that I rather like. Harry has time traveled to his parent's (5th or 6th) year. The Care Professor is very knowledgeable, but sounds like he's reciting out of a textbook he memorized. Hagrid gives better practical, real world information.
