  Snape (much as I hate him) are clearly aware of this and are generally pretty serious about it.

I disagree with this one. Look at his first lesson with Harry's class. After bullying Harry right at the start, he simply has them start brewing a potion. No discussion of what the principles are, what the class entails, the properties of the ingredients and their interactions, safety measures both general and specific to the potion being attempted. So no, he's not concerned about the safety of students unless maybe if they're Slytherins.
