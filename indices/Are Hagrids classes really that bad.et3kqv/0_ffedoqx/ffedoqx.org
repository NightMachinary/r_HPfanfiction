I think the issue is more that Hagrid is straight-up incapable of properly judging danger. He's used to being nigh-indestructible and can't grasp that others are not.

Classes like Transfiguration and Potions are indeed dangerous, but McGonagall and Snape (much as I hate him) are clearly aware of this and are generally pretty serious about it.

Hagrid's just like "lmao, help me feed my crimes against God, I don't know what they are capable of yet lol"
