Are you saying Hagrid's classes aren't bad because Snape is /worse/? Because that's not how this works. Snape being worse does not mean Hagrid is any good.

Because having all third years in his class interact with hippogriffs together rather than one by one where he could keep a close eye on them, or just having a viewing/demonstration as the first lesson shows just how irresponsible he is.

  Nobody seems to have a problem with the fact that potions seem to explode regularly in Snapes classes and send people to the hospital wing.

I think you're underestimating the number of people who agree that Snape is a terrible teacher.

  Also it wpuld be quite funny for Harry to correct Dumbledore about 'Professor Hagrid' when Dumbles just calls him Hagrid. A little pay back for all the Snape/Professor Snape's Dumbledore corrects.

I agree wholeheartedly with this one.
