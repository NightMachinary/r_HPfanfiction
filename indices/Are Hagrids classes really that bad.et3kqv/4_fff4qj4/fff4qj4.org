I do not think he is bad teacher per se, but woefully unprepared and inexperienced. To be honest his predecessor should have primed Hagrid for the job. He should have started as an assistant and then when he took over would know how to actually run a class, deal with teenagers and be able to better judge the dangers.

I think in time he'll mellow and become much better.
