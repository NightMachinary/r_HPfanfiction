Muggle-born is if you have magic and had two Muggles (non-magical) as parents. Squib is if you have no magic but were born from magical parents (even if one is Muggle and the other is magic). A pure-blood mustn't have any 'Mudbloods' as grandparents, meaning no Muggles or Muggle-borns, only half-bloods and pure-bloods. The rest is either half-blood or part non-human.
