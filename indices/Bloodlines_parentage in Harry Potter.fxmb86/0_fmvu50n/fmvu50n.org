A half-blood is still a magical parent, so even if they spawned with a Muggle, their sprogs would still be Half-bloods themselves. Pureblood and half-blood would probably also be Pureblood, but it's canonically a more socio-political delineation than a racial one - Sirius's whole line about families just crossing Muggles and Squibs out of the family tree and pretending they don't exist shows you can be Pureblood despite having Muggle (and likely even Half-blood) relatives so long as you deny it loud enough - meaning there's probably a lot of Purebloods with non-Pureblood relatives who just call themselves Purebloods still.

It's not scientific, peer-reviewed categorisation, it's just what the people in power use to say "We're the best, these other people suck!", despite the fact it's an unachieveable goal they could never live up to.
