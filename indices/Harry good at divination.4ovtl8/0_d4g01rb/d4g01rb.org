I love brainstorming! Feel free to use any:

*"Realistic" Idea* - You could always go the Observant Harry route. Where, since he was an outcast at the Dursleys, he learned the art of people watching. Which can evolve into being able to predict people and their actions. So not /really/ divination, but incredibly skillful all the same. Bonus: Harry accidentally starts a cult because people think he can truly see the future.

*Creature-fic Idea* - He gets abandoned by the Dursleys and raised by centaurs, who teach him the way of the stars.

*Crack Idea* - Harry is obsessed with tea. He starts practicing tasseography as an excuse to brew more tea and discovers he's actually talented at it.
