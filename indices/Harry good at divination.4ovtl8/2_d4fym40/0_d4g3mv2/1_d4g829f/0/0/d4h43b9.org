Fair use is supposed to be a defense for using someone's copyrighted work and doing something that alters the value of it in a way that is transformative.

Fanfiction typically falls in the non-transformative area, and it does impact the value of the original work.

The reason why fanfiction is tolerated so much by various publishers is because the writers do not directly profit off of it. By asking for money, braintheif is not only going against this, but putting fanfiction as a whole at risk.
