If handled correctly I don't mind it at all, Coeur Al'Aran does it well, where he will keep writing no matter what, but has his patron set up that if people donate enough he can devote more time to writing. Right now he has five stories, and every single one of them gets a decent update every two weeks. Professor Arc and Not this Time Fate on alternating Fridays, Stress Relief and One Turn for Another on alternating Mondays, and From Beyond every Sunday.

Hell, in general I actually only really care that they follow through, if not it feels like stealing. Like Brainthief's Patreon, which from what I can tell we hit the goal in over a month ago, which should have insured an update every two weeks, but low and behold, no update.
