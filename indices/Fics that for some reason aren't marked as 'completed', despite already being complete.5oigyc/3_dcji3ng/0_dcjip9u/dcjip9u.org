  Read the A/N of the last chapter, also read the reviews, the most recent will usually be about the last chapter, and people will often be thanking the author and such for the "amazing journey"

It doesn't always work though. I'm pretty sure fics like Dodging Prison, which are split into more than one 'Books' get reviews like that at the end of every 'Book' the writer finishes.

  Also, it will also tell you if the author has not updated in months and is on hiatus/abandonned.

Good advice. Another very nifty little trick is how you can find out the update schedule of a writer by checking the date on the first review of every chapter.
