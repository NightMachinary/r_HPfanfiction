For humor based ones, there's good ones (IMO) in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - the MC being a crossover from a D&D world means he's not particularly interested in the /exact/ names of things (very true to most D&D parties ;) ), and has some funny ones for that.

For instance: "Wrongton Wunderbars", "Quidditch Midwestern Final Pseudo-Regionals", "Cuddly Cannons", "House Medal/Cup-Medal", "Gringotts Every-Flavoured Beans", and the like. When used sparingly like the fic does, I find it a lot of fun!
