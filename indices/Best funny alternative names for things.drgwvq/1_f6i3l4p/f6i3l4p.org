Order of the Phoenix nicknames used by Indy!Harry to mock Dumbledore (AKA, "Manipulative Old Coot".)

- Fried Chicken Boy Scouts

- Fellowship of the Flaming Fireturkey

- Order of the Crispy Chicken Nuggets

It's as dumb as the nicknames fanfic authors use for Voldemort ("Moldyshorts", "Tommy Diddle") and the Death Eaters ("Corpse Munchers"), but I enjoy the rare occasions when I see ones that are actually creative and original.
