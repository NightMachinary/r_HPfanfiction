For the same reason, it's pretty amusing for an outsider to hear two Unspeakables talk to each other. It sounds somewhat like this:

#+begin_quote
  "Hello, Dr. *█████████*!"

  "Ah, good evening, Dr. *███*. How was your day?"

  "Pretty good, we've been working on [REDACTED] and made some real progress. Although [REDACTED] keeps [REDACTED], so we had to [DATA EXPUNGED] for three hours straight... well, that's what Class-D is for."

  "I see. Well, I have to go now. I have to report to Director *████* on Project [DATA REDACTED]."

  "See you at ███████ 's, then."

  "See you."
