There is nothing *you* will accept as redemption for murder. If I chose to write a story in which there was nothing *my depiction of Harry Potter* would accept as redemption for murder and I still wanted a TR/HP pairing, I would either have to make Harry okay with Tom having murdered someone (as in many dark!Harry stories), or make Tom not be a murderer (as in Prince of Slytherin).
