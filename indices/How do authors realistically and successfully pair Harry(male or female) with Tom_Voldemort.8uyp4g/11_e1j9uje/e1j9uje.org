My instinct is to use the Diary. It drains several people, not just Ginny, and produces a fully corporeal Tom Riddle from his Hogwarts years. I'd probably drop his age a couple years. Start off with him going to join old Voldemort, finding out what he's been up to and what he's like, and then rebelling. He and Harry become reluctant allies.

Then I introduce a redemption arc along with a slow reconciliation with Harry.

Once the reconciliation is more or less complete, circa 1995, I can start on their romantic relationship.
