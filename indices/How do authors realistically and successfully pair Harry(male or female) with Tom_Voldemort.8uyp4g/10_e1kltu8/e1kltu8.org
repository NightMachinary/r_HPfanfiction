The best HP/LV or TM fics are either massively AU, dark or timetravel fics. There are some very good fanfictions where it is either an unhealthy relationship or entirely nonconsensual! There are some where Harry is dark (AU), where Voldemort is sane and kind of good (AU) or where the war as such never happened and you have the politician Tom Riddle. Sometimes Harry is not the BWL.

I can't quite remember the name of the story, but my favorite one where Harry was not the BWL. He was a genius and an unspeakable at 15 I think. Voldemort did exist, but not many knew about him. Tom Riddle i think was the undersecretary to the minister and very influential. It was really good and very AU.
