This is my favorite pairing, and I have read a ridiculous amount of it. As a result, I see tom ridde/voldemort as his fanon character, more than his canon character. And while the fanon one is based off the canon one, the fanon one is more flushed-out, human, and without a anti-slythern prejudice. I think part of the problem with people disliking this pairing is you can't jump head first into it. You have to ease into it. For example, the first fanfic that made me like voldemort as a character was The Darkness Within by Kurinoone. This is not a pairing fic and the Voldemort is still the bad guy to harry. However, voldemort raises harry in this fic, and you get to see voldemort's human moments where he shows affection to harry, albeit in small ways. From there, I slowly eased myself into fanfics that depict riddle more fanon and eventually slash. Now I am able to read the more out there HPLV and HPTR because I already understand Riddle's fanon character without needing extensive introductory chapters slowly easing me from canon Harry and canon voldemort into the fanon pairing, which can vary in quality based off of the author. And if your first fic is by an author who doesn't do a thorough job with this transition (and that doesnt necessarily mean its a bad fic. just not a good first fic. As a well read HPLV, i often find the transition uneccessary and boring)

***********************************

To answer your question specifically:

First of all, in the best fanfics, voldemort never says I love you. He cares about harry deeply and often times this shows if harry is wounded and voldemort cares for him at his bedside. but voldemort is not the i love you type. Same as riddle. They often show a more possessive, obsessive type of unhealthy love. This plays on canon voldemort's obsession with harry (though in an entirely different way). It also is in character seeing voldemort was born from a love potion made due to obsessive love

.........................................................................................................................................................

If it's tom riddle being paired with harry, it usually happens in one of two ways:

- horcrux (usually diary!Riddle) resurrecting himself through harry. He plans on killing harry like ginny in CoS, but discovers that harry's a horcrux. Riddle, being possessive, keeps harry around as a mere possession and perhaps younger mentee to toy with. Slowly falls in obsessive love

- Harry sent back in riddle's time. Riddle is immediately drawn to harry. Usually a combination of the horcrux in harry drawing out to riddle's magic and/or Harry being scared of riddle during riddle's youth before he has moved his scary reputation into the public eye. Harry catches riddle's interest, interest turns obsessive, obsessive turns into Riddle's version of love

................................................................................................

If its a harrymort (voldemort aka Dark Lord), common ways of addressing it are:-voldemort becomes sane through the reabsorption of horcruxes. i have seen multiple fanfics where harry is the initiater to this reabsorption, helping voldemort gain back his sanity

-voldemort discovers harry is a horcrux --> voldemort takes harry away from the light and dumbledore, where he is in danger of being killed for being a horcrux ---> voldemort is possessive (sometimes soul bond through literally being soul mates) ---> slowly lust turns to love. Sort of.

- dumbledore bashing as being manipulative. Voldemort is depicted so bad in canon because the light manipulated harry. Voldemort is the good guy. Harry runs away to him. These tend to be the fics with the more healthy type of love, and not the obsessive unhealthy.

-harry goes back in time after war, to fix things. this time he allies voldemort, due to noncanon postwar events that make the dark side a worthy alliance

- AU voldemort wins dystopia. Often, the low-class harry catches the great voldemort's notice.
