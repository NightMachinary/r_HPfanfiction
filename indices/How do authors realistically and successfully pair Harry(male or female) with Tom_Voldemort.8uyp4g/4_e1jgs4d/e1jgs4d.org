Yes, it is mostly time travel. It's usually "Harry goes back in time and joins Voldy cause Dumbledore was a manipulative git" or "future with Dumbledore is bad but future with Voldy might be better" or "Harry goes back to 1940 to save Tom Riddle cause Dumbledore took one look at him and deemed him lost"

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light) was the first HP/TMR fic I read. It is very well written. My current favorite is linkffn(Full Circle) , quite funny and entertaining this isn't really a HP/LV fic though since these two have been together for like 80 lifetimes
