You have to rewrite the story from the ground up to the point where you could basically change on or both names and have them suddenly be unrecognizable because at that point it's a different character for all intents and purposes. You'd get the same thing from an OC in an AU where Harry doesn't exist (unless you're specifically looking for prophecy/horcrux shenanigans)
