Going to second this one - I really enjoyed it. It's well-written, has an interesting plot, and the author managed to make the pairing believable.

There's also another that I like that started out as a crack fic and is unrepentantly silly in a lot of ways, which is the only way it works. It's an ongoing fic where Harry and Tom are soulmates who always find each other (lame, but bear with me) throughout multiple reincarnations. Problem is, every time they run into each other, they recognize each other from their first lives as Harry and Tom and all their memories come flooding back. The fic starts when they're finally reincarnated as themselves again (however that works (who cares?)) on their 200th or so life. Cue crazy hijinks from two very old men in young bodies who have no more shits to give and can hardly take anything seriously anymore. I'll try to track down the link.
