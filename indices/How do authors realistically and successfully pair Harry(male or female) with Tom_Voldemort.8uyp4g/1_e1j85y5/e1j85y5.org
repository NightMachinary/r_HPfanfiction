linkffn(Again And Again) is a time travel fic which postulates that Tom Riddle was evil but human, and could be redeemed, but splitting his soul turned him into the crazed monster we know as Voldy. Harry repairs his soul and he turns back into Tom, who is horrified by the creature he'd become. also Harry is like 900 years old. Im still not sold on the pairing but I liked the fic overall.

EDIT: jesus, 300k words?? it was like 100k when i read it. i missed a lot apparently lol
