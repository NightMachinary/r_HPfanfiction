As someone who has read waaaaay too much TMR/HP/LV, I was going to write a long write up, but time travel and horcruxes sum it up. All of the good fics are slow burn as there is no good other way to write it without total AU.

Tom Riddle and Voldemort are written as different characters, with the horcruxes taking away Voldemort's ability to love. Harry is written as someone who is sympathetic to this, and forms an odd friendship with Voldemort.

Time travel to Tom Riddle's era just before the Chamber is opened is done so Harry can befriend Tom and acknowledge he isn't Voldemort yet, and a bit of angst and Tom being convinced not to create a horcrux when he finally does open the Chamber cements his change.

The Diary and the Scar are the most used horcruxes. Diary fics normally aren't written to be healthy relationships, but in the rare occasion they are, it's by having Harry get the Diary instead of Ginny. The Scar is written by having Tom change from being exposed to Harry's soul and Harry understands this Tom is a different Tom than Voldemort, even if he did kill his parents. It works with a conversation where Tom's ideals switch from Voldemort's to Harry's, or a heartfelt apology.

And Voldemort pairings are done convincingly by having him reabsorb all his horcruxes (but Harry's, unless the plot demands it), and regains his sanity. He apologizes for his actions and works to fix them. If the author decided to keep Voldemort Voldemort, it's done by having Voldemort's obsession with Harry changed from wanting to kill him to wanting to dominate him, and that turning to lust.

Or Harry is a captive and is forced to be cordial until he realizes he actually does enjoy Voldemort's company, and is deeply conflicted in his emotions. Voldemort finds himself needing Harry (because horcruxes) and starts to change.
