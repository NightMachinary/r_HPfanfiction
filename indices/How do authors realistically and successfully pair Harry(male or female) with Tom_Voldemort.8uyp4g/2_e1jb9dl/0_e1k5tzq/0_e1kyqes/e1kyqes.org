To follow-up on the other reply, we only see 11 year old Tom Riddle through Dumbledore's memories though and what Dumbledore has gathered. Ignoring the authorial intent that Dumbledore's interpretations of events are correct, it's possible to fan-wank that, say, Dumbledore was biased and although the young Tom Riddle was messed up and not a good person, he wasn't actually a psychopath and could have had a chance at redemption.
