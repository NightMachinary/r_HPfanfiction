This pairing is my otp. I would recommend reading one of the popular fics of this pairing just to understand it. Probably would be better to read a time travel one cause they tend to be more tame. Actually I recommend doing this for anything that you hate on cause it's cool to be informed. Ron is my favorite character and I generally love the weasleys, but I recently read a fic with weasley bashing and I kinda understood it. Didn't like it. Didn't change my views. But I understood.
