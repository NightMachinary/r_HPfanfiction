Other commenters have explored the more common tropes (time travel, horcruxes, etc.) Another common trope is the 'pleasure feedback loop' where Harry and Voldemort get feel-good vibes from touching instead of pain.

Many authors are only comfortable with Harry/Voldemort pairings if Voldemort somehow regains his good looks/sanity in the story. However, a few of my favorite slash fics go the route of keeping Voldemort's more monstrous aspects. There's room for some fascinating interplay when the writer explores the twists and turns of Voldemort's warped psychopathic mind, tempered by the connection to Harry's empathetic conscience. In my opinion, the most successful fics tackle the concepts of trauma and mental growth, and some delve into the complex captive-captor interactions of Stockholm Syndrome.

I love this fic because it explores how mentally scarring Voldemort's existence was as a wraith & barely alive homunculus before his resurrection. The original books (and most fics) gloss over that, but this one made me realize just how horrific that must have been. In my opinion, this fic is a realistic exploration of how Harry can slowly begin to empathize with his enemy (in spite of the terrible things he does) when he is forced to acknowledge that Tom Marvolo Riddle is more than just a monster. linkffn(8988616)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172646/1/Butterfly-Heart][Butterfly Heart]] - And now for something completely different! In this AU fic, Tom Marvollo Riddle plays a Hannibal-esque role. Harry is a young auror whose career has been made by his uncanny ability to interpret the crime scenes left by the serial killer 'Voldemort'. However, he is tormented by the fact that whenever he enters the crime scenes he experiences the murder from the killer's point of view. Voldemort's obsession with "the boy who lived" rises to a new level when Harry is forced into mandatory therapy sessions with renowned psychiatrist Tom Marvollo Riddle. linkffn(9172646)
