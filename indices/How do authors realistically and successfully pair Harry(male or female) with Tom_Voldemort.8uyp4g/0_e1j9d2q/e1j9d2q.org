I have never done it, but if I was going to...remember that just because a pairing /exists/ doesn't mean the relationship shown has to be a healthy or happy one. Anything I did with this pairing would get dark very quickly.

There's a lot of scope for obsession and control in this pairing. A LOT. Harry and Voldemort are canonically more tightly intertwined and more closely connected than any other wizards in history, they can see into each other's minds, they can (up to a point) influence each other's minds, they think about each other almost constantly.

Horcrux-possession (sort of like what happened with Ginny, do you remember how completely Tom-in-the-diary was able to own her?) would be an option.
