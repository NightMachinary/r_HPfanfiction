HP/LV is my OTP, but honestly, most fics don't actually bother to make it especially realistic (not that it has to) and it depends a lot upon the reader's ability to buy into the pairing and accept the setup that, for example: Harry goes back in time and finds young Tom Riddle wasn't really that bad (or at least wasn't as irredeemable as Dumbledore thought); or he goes back in time and for Reasons (purebloods being right, Dumbledore-bashing, etc.) doesn't mind Tom Riddle murdering and torturing people; it was only the horcruxes that made Voldemort genocidally evil - the horcruxes get restored to him and he becomes sane and more moral; Harry is traumatized by war/the Dursleys/betrayal and is as a result more willing to compromise his morals or goes fully evil; Harry is raised differently and so is more morally compromised; or often Harry is straight-up another character with a completely different name and background but it's just understood that vampire!pureblood!Hadrian Peverell is really Harry (this last is weirdly common).

Actually, a major thing, too, is Voldemort being written as having some sort of ideals and goals that are more than just personal power and slaughtering muggles, muggleborns, and anyone who looks at him funny; so with a bit of worldbuilding about how whilst his current means are reprehensible, his goals are understandable, it gives authors a lot of leeway in terms of Harry and Voldemort coming to some sort of compromise on the means towards the ends. Obviously, all that has a lot of overlap with mentor!Voldemort or the sort of thing seen in indy!Harry, or the sorts of gen and het-fic with lots of pureblood culture and politics where it's just accepted that, sure, Harry would love a betrothal contract with Daphne Greengrass and readily accepts that muggleborns really are damaging the wizarding world.

Not to say that it's all completely OoC: in all the above scenarios, a greater or lesser amount of effort will be put in to stick to canon characterizations and do the work to make it convincing within the context of canon -- like in any ship (or scenario, really), at some point most fics just assume that the reader is willing to buy into the ship and are happy to accept some bending of canon and characterization for the sake of the story being told.

Also, yeah, as others have stated, sometimes serious fucked-up manipulation/Stockholm Syndrome/obsession is part of the arsenal used to make Harry accept the relationship and is even part of the appeal...

Well, this got a bit tl;dr, so For some fics that I think are successful at doing the work to make the pairing convincing:
