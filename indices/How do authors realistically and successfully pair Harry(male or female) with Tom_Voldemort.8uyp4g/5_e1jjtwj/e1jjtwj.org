Though I don't read too much slash either, when Muffin decided to write a Tom/Harry fic, I decided to read it.

It did feel realistic, and is a great fic, but it worked because Tom didn't go the Dark Lord route, though still is Tom Riddle. Try it out, maybe you'll see linkffn(The Burning Taste of Firewhiskey)
