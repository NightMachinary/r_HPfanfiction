Linkffn(No More by The Seven of Us)

One shot where Harry is basically a more powerful version of a metamorph, and is living disguised as an adult when Hogwarts tried to reach him. Thanks to him escaping the Dursleys and living on his own he has control over his magic and is also able to shapeshift animal traits, such as wings, in addition to his human traits.
