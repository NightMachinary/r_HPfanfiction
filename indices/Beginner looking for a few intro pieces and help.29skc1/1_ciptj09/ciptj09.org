Well, there are a few that I found very impressive:

*Completed stories*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is a super-heavy and slow paced story that basically tells the life of Severus Snape, and explains every single detail about him in a very mature way... and is basically the reason why Snape is my favorite main character in fan fiction. Warning though, if you are looking for something to cheer you up, stay away. It is also very long.

[[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377][Practical Solutions]] is basically an adult rom-com staring Hermione Granger and Severus Snape, and is all kinds of awesome. Witty dialogue, adult (and very dirty at times) humor, and captures their (complete lack of) social skills perfectly. Short, to the point, and absolutely hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5785108/1/Too-Late][Too Late]] is a disturbing "what if" that in around 6.5k words will gut you. It is labeled "tragedy" for a reason.

*Works in progress*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] is basically Ender's Game... only instead of sci-fi, it is in the Harry Potter universe. It captures OSC's type of narrative well, and is very well written... with Harry as Ender. You don't need to know Ender's Game to love this. Oh, and [[/u/KwanLi]] (the author) is one of the people who visit this subreddit and is generally awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or]] How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus... is a story about what would have happened if Hermione Granger had been sorted into Slytherin. Words cannot express the level of awesome here, as Hermione begins her path into morally grey areas.
