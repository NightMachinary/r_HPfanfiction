Do magical countries even follow muggle borders? Why would a Wizard in Strasbourg care about the treaty of Versailles or a witch in Poland that her country got removed from the map again? Would the US even have a centralised magical government? Rowling made one up, but why should there be a magical United States and not, lets say French Louisiana, Spanish Florida and so on? Can you really imagine someone like Lucius Malfoy or a native American shaman saying that they are part of a muggle nation instead of what they had before?

Underage Harry would definitely need help, but taking Hermione along the way would probably improve your odds either way, even as an adult.
