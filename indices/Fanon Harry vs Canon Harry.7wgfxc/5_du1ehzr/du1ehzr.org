Well, in my head grown up Harry is a complete fuck up that can not deal with what happened in his younger years at all and is very damaging to his children. Young Harry is an abused, neglected child that is neither pretty nor powerful and pretty much lacks talent.

I think canon Harry does not fit his upbringing and I do not like it if the main character is powerful.

Therefore I am not a fan of canon Harry, but like powerful, rich fanon Harry even less, I highly prefer the superweird, ugly, underdog Harry that some writers dare to write about.
