Opposite for me. Harry went through 11 years (ten before Hogwarts and then another added together from various summer holidays and the hunt) of malnutrition, if not outright starvation. He ought to be the shortest of his year because living through that hell with leave you a head shorter at least. The Dursleys had him at 500 calories a day more than once during a crucial period of his development. So why does everyone make him bloody six feet or even taller? And the random growth spurts mentioned over the summer hols make even less sense. Where is that substance coming from?
