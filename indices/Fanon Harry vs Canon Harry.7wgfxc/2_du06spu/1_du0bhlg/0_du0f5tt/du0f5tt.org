[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8005092][This article]] indicates that childhood malnourishment can be reversed and full height potential achieved with proper nourishment during puberty. Harry went into Hogwarts well before puberty started and was pretty well nourished through it, so I feel that any damage done by the Dursleys would have definitely been mitigated.

[[https://www.bu.edu/today/2014/consequences-of-malnutrition-may-be-reversible-later-in-childhood/][This article]] focuses more on an earlier age intervention (8-years-old) and cognitive development, but notes this toward the end:

  “Height is a manifestation of both nutrition and sickness over time,” Dearden says, explaining that genetic differences in height generally do not materialize until puberty. The study shows that “the window of opportunity for intervention may not be as limited as it appeared,” in terms of a child's age.

Since Harry didn't seem to be cognitively disabled by undernutrition, I feel that it's reasonable that he could recover enough to be reasonably tall. Also, in the seventh book, it's noted that he's as tall as James who was described as tall. When I think of someone as "tall", I think at least 6ft. I'm 5'7" myself and don't consider less than 5'10" as tall.
