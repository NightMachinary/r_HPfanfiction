Let's make it simple. According to a quick google search, the average height of an 11 year old is 143.5 cm. Now, Harry was malnutritioned until age 11, so it is reasonable to assume that he was shorter than that (and that is confirmed in either PS or CoS). When we put Harry at 135cm and then look 10 years in the future, he'd still be shorter even if he grew as much as the average guy.
