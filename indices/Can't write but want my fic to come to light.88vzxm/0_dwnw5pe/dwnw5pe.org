First, skilled writers usually have their own ideas, which is gonna be a problem.

But even ignoring this, you failed to provide the bare minimum needed for any collaboration: Effort.

This post is obviously not proofread and has a lot of mistakes that are extremely easy to catch - even for a non-native speaker. This 100% drives away anyone who would put in effort. It would just end up like a bad group project at school, so people stay away.

Seriously, if you want someone to pick up any idea you have and collaborate with you, you need to invest more than 5 minutes in "advertising". Give us more about the story, make sure it is succinct and written with correct grammar - or at least make sure it's obvious that you /tried/.
