No one can write at first, we learn by trying and trying again. I've published 90k words, but written at least 250k on the road of getting something akin to writing skills. I'm no native speaker, I care little about the literary paradigms of British literature, but you can teach yourself the sufficient proficiency in spelling and grammar. Instead of trying to dump a half cooked idea on someone else and then take credit for the "collaboration", try writing yourself.
