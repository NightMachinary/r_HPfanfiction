A lot of the stories that seem to advertise themselves as having Minerva raising Harry trick the reader and basically have an OC raise him in her place. annoying.

Some legitimate ones (if i remember) "1 High Street", "Hogwarts is My Home" (might be abandoned), "McGonagall's Soft Side", "Harry Potter and the Tabby Cat", "Hand Delivered Letter"

Hope that gives you a places to start since finding these can be difficult. Plus several you do find like "Harry McGonagall" (meh) and "Mama McGonagall" and "Raising Harry" those are the ones that are false advertisements where it's basically an OC (or for some whatever reason, an OC who is a McGonagall because somehow that's more interesting) that raises Harry.
