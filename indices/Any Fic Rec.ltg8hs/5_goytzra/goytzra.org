I enjoyed Shifts by FernWithy. This is quite an old fic ( it was written before the series was finished) but I think it holds up pretty well. It's about Remus becoming a teacher at Smeltings to protect Dudley during Order of the Phoenix. The author has written quite a lot of other Remus or Teddy Lupin fics aswell.
