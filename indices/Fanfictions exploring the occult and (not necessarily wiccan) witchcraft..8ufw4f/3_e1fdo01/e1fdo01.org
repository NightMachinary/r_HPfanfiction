I'm writing such a story. linkffn(The Coven of Albion). In fact, Harry in my story concludes that Christianity is silly because prayers never work for him. I haven't yet explored UK pagan traditions (other than a made up coven ritual they performed on the Winter Solstice in my newest chapter), but it'll come along; I'm trying to introduce it organically I guess. Wandless magic is explored a bit so far, mostly by Harry trying to figure it out so he can run away. In canon JKR says wandless magic is an expression of high skill at magic. Yes Uagadou prefers students to learn it but that's a traditional thing. But I don't treat it as this thing only Harry gets so he can be OP, that's just stupid.

Ignore the bot, I updated the story several days ago. The bot is slow to catch updates, it's annoying. >:|
