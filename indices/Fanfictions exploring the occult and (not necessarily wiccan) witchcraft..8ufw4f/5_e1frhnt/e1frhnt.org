Have you read linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild)?\\
And I think the Black Princess-Stories by Silently Watches feature lots of Voodoo practices. linkffn(Princess of the Blacks).

In the Bitter Hug of Mortality linkffn(10502653), Harry is unable to use the regular magicks, instead he is some sort of necromancer that uses rituals and communes with the spirits on a regular basis.

Those are the only stories I can think of right away.
