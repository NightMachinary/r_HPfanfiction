But my point is that the things you mention aren't really part of the occult. Western esotericism is rooted in Neoplatonism that arose among Greeks in the third century when Christianity was still relatively young, in Hermeticism that shaped itself in Alexandria at similar time, in grimoire tradition that started in earlier antiquity, in Christianised Kabbalah adapted from Jewish thought, in astral magic imported from Arabs.
