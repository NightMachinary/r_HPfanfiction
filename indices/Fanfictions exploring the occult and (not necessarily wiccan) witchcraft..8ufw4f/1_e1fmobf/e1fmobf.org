  Essentially I guess I'm looking for fics that all have what we would consider dark elements without it being totally obvious to the reader that the author grew up Christian and thinks these elements necessitate a dark and bloody story.

So much agreement to this. It's so obvious when this stuff is written by edgy teenagers who see it as a form of rebellion.

I'd love a story that takes it seriously and normalizes it. "This is how we do magic." not "This is how we portray magic to be grimdark and piss of christians"
