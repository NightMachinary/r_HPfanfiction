Thanks for the shout out! RisingSunsets if you enjoyed HG Demonologist you might also enjoy my long series "Perfectly Normal" linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]) which has a strong theme of pagan festivals, but only builds up momentum with this slowly (so it's only vaguely alluded to in the first fic, a little in the second, and is strongly present in the third and fourth fics as Harry gets slowly drawn into pagan traditions. The fifth part will start being posted in late July - I'm currently editing it.\\
I would also recommend:\\
"House Proud" (short but great) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703]])\\
"Harry Potter and the Kindling of the Fire" (series) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/97016]])\\
"Again and Again" (Tomarry, politics & religion) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865]])\\
"Dark Phoenix" (more religious elements late in fic) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1881821/1/Dark-Phoenix]])\\
I also recommend "Out of the Night" by Raining Ink, but you'll have to Google for a copy as it's not hosted on major archives any longer.
