  So, my question is how do you determine who is more magically powerful/competent
#+end_quote

In the Harry Potter universe, power levels are irrelevant. Each character is exactly as powerful as the plot demands. This is how you get a 13 year old kid capable of driving off a swarm of Dementors, and struggling with his schoolwork the next year.

There's no consistency in power ratings, with the exception of the Power of Love. The person who has the most, wins.
