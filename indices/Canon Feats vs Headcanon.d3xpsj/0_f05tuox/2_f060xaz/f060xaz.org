I disagree to an extent.

I think there are certain tiers for each characters by the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. In each tier, any character could beat the other. But, lower tiers will never a beat a person in the tier above them (barring Harry & Voldemort)

Snape completely blitzed Harry in Book 6, but fights on par with McGonagall. Mcgonagall fights to a stalemate with Voldemort with the help of two other skilled wizards (Kingsley and Flitwick?, correct me if I'm wrong).

There are definitely inferences that can be made.
