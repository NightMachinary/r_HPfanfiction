I will not lie to you 4ecks. I have not read Cursed Child nor do I have any intention of reading it. From what I hear, the story butchers plenty of things. You'd have no way of knowing this since I did not mention it in the OP, but the ranking I was making only goes up and through the Battle of Hogwarts. I do not take the Epilogue or Cursed Child into consideration.

The main seven books, again barring Harry & Voldemort, do a decent job of drawing that line in the sand so to speak.
