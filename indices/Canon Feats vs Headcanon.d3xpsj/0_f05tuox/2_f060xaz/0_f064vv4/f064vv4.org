In the context of the HP universe, power tiers become irrelevant as soon as a plot device appears.

- Lily's sacrifice of love.

- Priori Incantatem.

- Wand loyalty.

- Blood Pact. (from Crimes of Grindelwald)

- Time travel.

- Plot Fiat.

In any event, trying to find a logical way to rank power levels would result in Delphini of Cursed Child being named the most powerful, since Harry beat Voldemort, and Delphini beat Harry, who was a 40-year-old Head Auror with 20 years of experience at the time. Yes, this was approved by JKR, and she has declared it canon.

*ACT IV, SCENE XI*

  *DELPHI effortlessly rises into the air. HARRY steps back --- amazed.*

  *HARRY/VOLDEMORT (trying not to show his shock):* You learnt --- flight --- from --- me?

  DELPHI unleashes a bolt from her hand. HARRY matches her.

  *DELPHI:* Incendio!

  *HARRY:* Incendio!

  *The bolts meet in a beautiful explosion in the middle of the room. And with her other hand DELPHI sends bolts to both doors as they try to open them. HARRY looks at the doors, dismayed.*

  *DELPHI:* What? Thought your friends were going to join you, did you?

  *HARRY:* Fine. I'll deal with you alone.

  *He moves to attack her again. But she is far stronger. HARRY's wand ascends towards her. He is disarmed. He is helpless.*

  *HARRY:* How did you . . . ? What are you?
