  Ron, who probably has the best fighting feats amongst the 25 & under characters not named Harry
#+end_quote

Eh, 25 and under includes Tonks, Fleur, and Percy. Tonks should be better than Harry and Percy and Fleur should be better than Ron.

If we're talking 30 and under:

*Bill

*Tonks

*Harry/Fleur/Percy

*Luna/Hermione/Ron/Ginny

Of the older crowd that we see/hear of:

*Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald

*Snape/Bella/Dolohov/Amelia Bones/Moody

*Sirius (I feel like he should be 2nd tier, but eh)

*Kingsley/McGonagall/Flitwick/Slughorn

*Remus/Arthur/Lucius

*Molly
