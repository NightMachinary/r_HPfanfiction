I'm just talking in-text feats. Percy and Fleur don't really have any and we really only hear of Tonks when she's fighting Bellatrix...and losing. I hear what you're saying, they /should/ be better. But if I said Ron was the better fighter, there's really no way to contradict me at least in the case of Percy and Fleur.
