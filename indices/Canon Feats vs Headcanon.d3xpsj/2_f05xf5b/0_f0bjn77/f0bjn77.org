Not to detract from your point but wards don't exist in canon. There are curses and charms that can be placed on places, but we don't really know how they're dealt with, although I agree that it's likely to be slow, safe-cracking magic (as that makes it a bit more exciting), but it could just as likely be casting a diagnostic spell then a counter-curse.
