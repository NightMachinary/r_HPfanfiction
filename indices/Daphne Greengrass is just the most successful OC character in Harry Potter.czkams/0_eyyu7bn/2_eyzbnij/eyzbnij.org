You mean like Daphne Greengrass in linkffn(3912184;4236594)? Well, there she is not a mousy nerd, but a flirty (even wee slutty) poor half-blood orphan?

And I am not actually certain that her being pureblood is canonical. She may very well be half-blood (whatever it means, even that is not perfectly canonically defined).
