I actually kind of like the idea that Dumbledore hired Lockhart because he was friends with two of the people whose glory Lockhart stole.

Dumbledore being mad that Lockhart would do that and hiring him to expose him as a big fat liar isn't quite something I'd compare to the Manipulative! Dumbledore of fanficdom who enslaves fawkes, sent Sirius to azkaban on purpose, and will totally cast unforgivables on harry if he doesn't behave according to plan. For the greater good, of course.
