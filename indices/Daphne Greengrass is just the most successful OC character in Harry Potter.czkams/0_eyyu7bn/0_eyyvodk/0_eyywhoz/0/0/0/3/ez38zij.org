Something else to consider: The position is cursed. Whoever Dumbledore hires is going to fail by the end of the year regardless of their skill. Why not make it someone Dumbledore despises? Oh, some kids' education will be stifled, sure, but...

Magical Britain hasn't had a decent Defense education in 20 years. It isn't just that particular year that is fucked, it's been fucked for two decades! They might have had decent professors like Lupin sprinkled in here or there, but none of them have lasted, so those lessons get forgotten rather than reinforced and expanded upon (this is likely one reason why having a single professor per subject is considered a good thing, while you have exceptions like Snape being an asshole for your whole 7-year education).

Dumbledore gets the double satisfaction of ousting a fraud by hiring Lockhart and inadvertently teaching the students that they should not automatically trust their authority figures, no matter how pretty or charismatic they may seem. Voldemort, after all, was a very charismatic manipulator, though not nearly vain in the same sense as Lockhart.
