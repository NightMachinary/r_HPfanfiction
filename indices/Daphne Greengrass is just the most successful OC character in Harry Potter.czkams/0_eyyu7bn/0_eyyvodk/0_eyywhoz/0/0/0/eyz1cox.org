Who wouldn't want to know that the "Manipulative Dumbledore who believes in the Greater Good" stereotype is officially canon? Dumbles hired Lockhart, knowing that Lockhart was a terrible person and a bad teacher. He condemned a whole year of students to an inadequate education, in order to reveal Lockhart as a fraud and teach the kids a life lesson of "What not to be".

  Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that *â€˜there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.*
