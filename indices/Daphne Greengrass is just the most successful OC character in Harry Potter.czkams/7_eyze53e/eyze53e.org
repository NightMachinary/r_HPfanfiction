I feel like this happens to a lot of background characters in fandom (though it definitely happens the most in HP). OCs have a stigma attached to them and turning someone who is technically canon into that OC avoids that.

A friend and I actually discussed this once. It had been a long time since she read the books and had been mostly reading fanfics and was shocked when I told her there is actually next to no canon material on Daphne!
