You need to go wayyy back in Fanfiction to find where some of these started from.

re: Daphne, I think Jeconais was one of the first (?) to characterize her as the "Ice Princess" in 2005 [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/]]

re: Susan, "Scenes From October" by DrT from way back in 2004 is one of the earliest that I know of that portrays her as busty. [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/drt/SFO.html]] (used to be on fictionalley, but that seems defunct and I can't find it in the wayback machine)
