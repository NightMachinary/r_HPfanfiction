Astoria is portrayed in the films with dark hair.

And most of those details about Astoria from Pottermore and /that play/ are very recent yet these "Ice Queen" depictions of Daphne go back years now. I think the biggest dispute was at one point she was portrayed as having dark brown/black hair versus blonde hair with the latter winning out.
