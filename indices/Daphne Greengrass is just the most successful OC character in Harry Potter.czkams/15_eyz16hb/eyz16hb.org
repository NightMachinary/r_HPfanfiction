We know a few things about her sister so I think we can extrapolate from that. I believe this is from Pottermore but Astoria didn't allow Scorpius to grow up thinking that muggles are trash. And scorpius had blonde hair like his father so likely Astoria did as well and thus theres a chance Daphne had blonde hair.

And Daphne is probably not a bigot since most children get their values from their parents and Astoria wasn't a bigot.
