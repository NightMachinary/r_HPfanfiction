It really isn't that surprising, there are two major areas that Daphne fills that more well known characters do not.

​

The first is Romeo & Juliette. For good or bad, people love a good star-crossed lovers tale.

​

The second is a redemption arc. People like seeing the Dragon brought to the side of the light. Redemption through Love is also a very popular trope.

​

Now those make sense, but why not the more established characters? Well, it is because *Canon Draco is completely irredeemable*. He is comic book levels of evil. He displays pretty much no desirable qualities throughout the entire series. His 'official' redemption arc is essentially he is too cowardly to pull the trigger. He still believes the rhetoric and advocates genocide and ethnic cleansing. But he doesn't want to pull the trigger himself. This pretty much poisons any decent use of him for these categories, as well as most of the characters around him.

​

I mean, to do a decent redemption arc you gotta show questioning of beliefs and or the system they are in. Draco's character is literally hero worship of his father. If you want to redeem him, you gotta either start very young (and diverge from canon personality hard), or give it enough story development to be believable. The two stories that had the most believable Draco redemptions I can think of (Escape & Pertrification Proliferation) basically have him at the point where you can start imaging a redemption arc at the end of the fic, because you gotta put him through a lot to get there.

​

Side Slytherin characters that have screen time are almost as bad. You got Draco's muscle followers, you have the Inquisition Squad, you have the Slytherin organizing of public shaming in the 4th book. They are shown literally doing nothing redeemable in the book. (I mean, would it really be that hard to say one or two of Harry's years joined Dumbledore's Army? or at least considered it?). You have a bit more play here (I've seen a few good Greg redemption, seeing how he is being used). but the traits they have don't really make them good for pairings and/or being a central redemption figure.

​

Thus if you want to do one of these areas, it makes perfect sense authors would go to characters-in-name-only. I mean, the first thing you have to do is Slytherin less of a 'evil vs good' equation and more of a 'its complicated'. A lot of fics do that (and end up with the Light vs Dark vs Grey). It is just... a popular archtype that seems like it should fit the universe JK set up but it.. just does not.
