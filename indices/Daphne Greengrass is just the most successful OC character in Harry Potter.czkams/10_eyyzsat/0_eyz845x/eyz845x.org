I'm guilty of that. I have some irrational prejudice with the OC tag. I'm trying to break out of it, but it's still there. Reading a story that happens in another place / time and has OCs in it is something, but for some reason I'm prejudiced against OCs in common settings. Using barely known, but canon characters and developing them doesn't trigger that prejudice. I'm trying to change my ways, we'll see how it goes.
