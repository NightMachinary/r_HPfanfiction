  You mean "tits who get Harry to talk to Amelia Bones"? Seriously, I haven't seen a fic with a Harry/Susan pairing where she was not a convenient plot device to bridge the gap between her aunt and him, usually to get Sirius a trial or Harry "independent" from Dumbledore. Might be time to write one...
