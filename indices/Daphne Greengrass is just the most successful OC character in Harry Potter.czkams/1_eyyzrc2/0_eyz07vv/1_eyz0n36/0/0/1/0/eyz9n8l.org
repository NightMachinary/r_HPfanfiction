I hate that part, especially in Ministry 6 fics.

/So Harry and Hermione, Neville and Luna, wait that leaves Ron with Ginny... Wait, we are not Game of Thrones or the Habsburgs, so Neville and Ginny and Ron with Luna./

Like, not everyone has to end up paired, especially not in a fic where everyone is just 16. Hell, make Hermione the inspiration for Barney Stinson and have her seduce half of the witches in her age group just for the fun of it because she just snapped and went off on an epic journey of hedonism after the war or something like that.
