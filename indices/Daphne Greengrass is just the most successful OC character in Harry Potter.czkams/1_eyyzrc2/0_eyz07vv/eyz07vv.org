It's probably the lack of an archetypal character.

Hufflepuff you've got Susan, Tonks, Hannah, and Cedric who all have various shades of friendship and loyalty above all.

Gryffindor I don't need to list because there's enough to show their traits which you list.

Slytherin have a few characters to show their factional, cunning, political, and loyal (in their own way) tendencies.

Ravenclaw, all you really have is Luna (who says she gets bullied by her classmates) who doesn't really fit into their archetype.

Most OCs are typically a character the author likes but with certain traits added or removed (most Gryffindor OCs seem to be a combination of Ginny's sportyness and Hermione's brains but without the former's impetuous personality or the latter's awful social manner)
