Possibly. I would caveat that with the fact that though she appears more (barely) in canon, Susan Bones is nearly as successful in that regard. She is the generic Good-Ministry-Pairing for many stories. Think about how fanon it has become regarding her...assets shall we say.

So, we have major pairings for three of the four main houses most common in fanfiction:

- Gryffindor - Hermione/Ginny (waxes and wanes due to oversaturation)
- Slytherin - Daphne (and admittedly a LOT of SI girls)
- Hufflepuff - Susan

The odd man out is actually Ravenclaw, which by my estimation has the least OC characters created in the whole fandom (pairing or otherwise). Why is that? I can only speculate.

My guess is probably due to both the train-wreck relationship with Cho not exactly painting her (and possibly Michael Corner) in a good light. Another factor that, now I think of it, may be that Ravenclaw characters get the least 'page-time' out of all the houses in the books (actually checked this too).

Not to mention Ravenclaw actually seems to have the least broad characterization (everything related to being smart/knowledgeable). Compare that with Gryffindor - honorable, boisterous, brave, reckless, humorous, straight-forward - where you see both the good and bad of the house so clearly in the books.
