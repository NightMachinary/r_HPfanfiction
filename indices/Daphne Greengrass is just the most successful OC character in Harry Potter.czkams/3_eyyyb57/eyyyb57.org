And now I'm sad that HBP brought Blaise into the picture and out of the "background character" pile.

Before HBP confirmed his gender and race, fanfic made him out to be a pale-skinned brunette, hot-blooded sultry Italian dame who was the opposite and rival of Ice Queen Daphne. The Veronica to Daphne's Betty.

Fanon Blaise in today's fanfic is the sultry Italian gent, the opposite and rival of Ice Prince fanon Draco.
