Part one of a seven-book series where a younger Tonks meets Harry in Little Whinging. A bit heavy on the Dursley abuse and Andromeda is about as neglectful as Molly in canon when it comes to dealing with abuse, but especially books 1 and 2 have a very adorable friendship between Harry and Tonks. The romance starts in book 4 and is a bit too drawn out for the sake of drama, but that is a complaint you can make about most fics.
