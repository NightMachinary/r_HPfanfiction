I think she likes those characters a lot because all (well, not Umbridge)of these characters have the most (tragic) elements of her life. It's also realistic in a fantasy world where most wizards hate or severely infantalize muggles and those of muggle descent, and most muggles despise magic despite even knowing it exists it makes a lot of sense that those with one foot in each world would have a harder time of it.

Harry gets her birthday . Also J.K Rowling has said her mother's death shaping the Harry Potter series in theme and plot. The saintly dead mother that saves the child's life from beyond the grave with her love for him.

While Tom Riddle doesn't share a lot of aspects of the author he does illustrate a lot of the writers philosophies on life love and death. Also his story arc showcases her contempt at the institutionalization and abuse of children, which her charity Lumos combats.

Her experience of abuse (domestic violence and sexual abuse) is a recurring theme not only in HP, but The Casual Vacancy, the FB film series, and Cormoran Strike books.

This is also the case with most of the father figures in the series being abusive, flawed or dead . This is reflecting of her tumultuous relationship with her father (they only reconciled recently, he sold a personalized draft of HP for 10K pounds) Arthur Weasley is one of the few good men in the Harry Potter series (and JKR has said that is why she changed it so he didn't die in OoTP like planned.)

Albus Dumbledore is basically the Voice of the Author. He says all of the lines that are basically J,K Rowling sharing her thoughts on a subject.
