Ikr? Tryna think of a single person who had a good life in Harry Potter is impossible. Because y'know... WW2, then two consecutive civil wars.

In fact, pureblood families experienced all three wars, so they arguably had the worse trauma to their families across the years.

Draco Malfoy? Pampered as a kid, but also... Dark family, Voldemort, and unloving terrorist dad.

Ron and the Weasleys? Lots of dead family members.

Susan Bones? Parents are super dead.

Neville? Well shit man everyone knows Neville had it rough.

Sirius? Family is full of dark terrorist supporters, he's disowned, his whole family dies, and that's not even touching the maurauder drama.
