To be frank, a lot of this depends on whether you think the majority of the witch hunts were targeting actual wizards and witches, both pre and post-SoS. Frankly I doubt it. If you want to get real old school, the Code of Hammurabi outlines precepts dealing with witches 4500 years ago, so clearly punishment for so-called magic has been a long running theme of history. However, history shows most witch-hunts tend to target outsider groups from the majority - people who don't fit the common mold. Whether this was the Jewish and Moor converts in Spain or the random epileptic in feudal England, people went after what was different and called it witchcraft.

From what we know about HP-world, the Statute of Secrecy was partly a way of avoiding clear scrutiny from the non-magical. It isn't that witches and wizards are afraid of being caught, but to avoid a conflict of a more powerful group of aligned individuals and a more common majority (Magical vs. Muggle). They could win, but why would they want to fight anyway? What could they gain? Better to avoid the conflicts inherent in human nature than to wait for the inevitable violence and subjugation.

TL;DR: Witch-hunts were a catalyst, but SoS was in discussion decades before that actually occurred. Like many political events in the muggle world too.
