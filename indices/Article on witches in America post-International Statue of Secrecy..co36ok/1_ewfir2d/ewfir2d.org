I'd say that while witch hunts aren't a major issue any more, other issues make the Statute of Secrecy crucial for the continued survival of both the magical and the nonmagical worlds.

Due to wizards spending 7+ years learning magic and the seperation between the two worlds, there's very few people who both know about the existence of magic and have a solid understanding of muggle weapons, and that's good the way it is because the last thing the world needs is some guy casting duplication spells on enriched uranium supplying terrorists with nukes.
