Yep. Unfortunately, this is the case almost exclusively with really long stories in fanfiction, because with that length, you either need to procrastinate with the plot and focus on details, or use a large number of plot points. And really, not many writers are able to dish out that many plot points without the majority of them sucking or being tedious.

Actually, having checked out a large number of stories, I think that only one(!) long one (500k +) was /great/ and not either repetitive or plainly dull.
