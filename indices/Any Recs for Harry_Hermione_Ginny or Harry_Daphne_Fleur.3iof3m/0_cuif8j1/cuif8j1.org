H/Hr/DG that is long. My only complaint is that i feel it could have had a more difficult plot and more realistic reactions to a 14 year old. I get that he time travelled but to everyone else, they are 14. But i love Daphne and Hermione so I couldn't say no to a story with both of them haha Linkffn(Harry Potter- Three to Backstep)
