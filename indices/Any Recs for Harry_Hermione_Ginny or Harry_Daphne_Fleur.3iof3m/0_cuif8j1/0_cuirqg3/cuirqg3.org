I really dislike this fic. I mean, I would actively dislike these people in real life, and judging from the reviews, I wouldn't be the only one. I totally agree about them apparently forgetting that to others, they're just fourteen year old students, not sixty year old political mavens. Good technical writing, but inconsistent characterization, bizarre monologues, and too many tropes (one or two is more than enough) made this a DNF for me.
