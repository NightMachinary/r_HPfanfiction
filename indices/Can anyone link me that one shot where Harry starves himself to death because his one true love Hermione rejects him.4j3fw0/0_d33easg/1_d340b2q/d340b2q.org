i feel like i'm gonna catch some shit for this, but why you all saying that this fic is horrible? is it plot? part where Harry, insecure, socialy inept, no-one-ever-explained-him-how-girls-work, right-after-Sirius-died Harry, completely blown Hermione's "rejection" out of proportion and got himself in to a epic funk? or is it something else entirely? p.s. i not saying that this is "the best fanfic ever", but i definitely seen much, much worse.
