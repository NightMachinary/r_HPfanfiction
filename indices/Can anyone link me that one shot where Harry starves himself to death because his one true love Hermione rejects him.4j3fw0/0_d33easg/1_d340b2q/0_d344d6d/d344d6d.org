I'm not saying that it's the worst thing I've ever read but the way it handles the "funk" is garbage. Harry literally stops moving, eating or drinking because his crush told him she wasn't interested. He doesn't even bother opening letters that fall a couple feet away from him. That's beyond a "funk." This is like brony neckbeard creep level.
