I don't think Canon Harry is that emotionally fragile, even after Sirius's death. Canon Harry's response to people rejecting him, or keeping him in the dark about something, is rarely depression; his response is almost always anger followed by self-reflection. If Hermione, or anyone rejected him, Harry would silently brood about it for a while, think about it, and then get over it. Him falling apart over being rejected is not only wildly out of character, it's simply bad writing.
