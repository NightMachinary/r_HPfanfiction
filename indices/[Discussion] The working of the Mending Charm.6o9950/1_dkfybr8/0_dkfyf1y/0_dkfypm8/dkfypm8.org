If what's missing is rare or unique [Hope diamond; first issue of Action Comics], probably not. If what's missing is magical, definitely not. Ollivander could restore Harry's broken wand to its original appearance, but it was functionally still broken- though not 'dead', as it could try to execute spells but the effect would re-break the poor thing.

By contrast, Hermione didn't need every sliver of glass and lost screw in order to fix Harry's glasses to like-new.
