I think it can use time magic to see a blueprint of what 'fixed' should look like, but it uses only the pieces available at hand to reassemble everything and then bond it together as it had been before. I say this because Harry used a Reparo to reattach the wrong cover on his Advanced Potion Making textbook.

There's reason to think that other spells do this as well; reversing transfigurations doesn't require knowing exactly what the object used to look like. McGonagall was able to restore Draco to his fully-clothed self from being a ferret.
