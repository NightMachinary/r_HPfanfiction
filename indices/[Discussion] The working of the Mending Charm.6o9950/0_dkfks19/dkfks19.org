magic in harry potter is based on concepts rather than physical entinities. avada kedavra for example kills by making something dead rather han stopping your heart or destroying your brain. Reparo on the other hand simply makes something broken be repaired.

We also see the same spells use different means to achieve their purpose. for example the cleaning charm scourgify can produce soap, or it can vanish dirt. so it can be assumed that mending spells would depending on the skill of the caster do what ever it takes to repair an object
