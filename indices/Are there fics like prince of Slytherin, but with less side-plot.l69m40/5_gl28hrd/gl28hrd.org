I know what you mean. I'm currently on the 4th book but haven't read any of it yet because I know the first 10 chapters will be lots of side plot. But the side plot actually has bearing on what happens later so its not side plot for long, Anyways I'm waiting for the author to post Chapter 13 of the current fiction before I start reading. lol
