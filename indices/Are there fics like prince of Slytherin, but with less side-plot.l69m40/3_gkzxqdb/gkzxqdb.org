Sarcasm and Slytherin was already recommended I believe, but yes, it is essentially simpler and more straightforward plot-wise.

Another one I could recommend is Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos, though it may be closer up there with PoS in terms of complexity than Sarcasm and Slytherin. I would say it is marginally less sophisticated plot-wise than Prince of Slytherin, but more so than Sarcasm and Slytherin.
