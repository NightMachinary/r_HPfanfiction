Yeah, it's definitely overwrought at times, but there's also just so much good/creative stuff packed into it. Rare magic, everyday magic, a creative dive into mind magic in different aspects, character studies that you normally don't see, references to fanon without feeling dismissive, magic martial arts that don't feel like they're just ripping off Naruto, actually competent folk on both sides including a legitimately threatening Pettigrew, etc.

I'm definitely very hot and cold on this fic. Some stuff I absolutely love, some stuff I straight up skip on a reread. First year I liked the least, mostly because the Jim stuff was kind of comical, and even that had stuff like the Neville plotline that I found pretty interesting. Also literally /everything/ gets explained, which tends to draw things out.
