I have mixed feelings about this. It is a more streamlined PoS, but I feel it leans a little too hard into the rehabilitation of Death Eaters. Some of the plot of the latter books in particular rubs me the wrong way.

Glad to see it's not dead though. I've definitely stuck around to read way worse stories.
