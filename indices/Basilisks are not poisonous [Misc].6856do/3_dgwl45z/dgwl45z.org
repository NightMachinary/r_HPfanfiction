Sometimes little things like this annoy me too. I have to say though, as a Linguistics student, that if the meaning is clear there really isn't any cause for complaint. But I can't really say that without being a hypocrite because I hate it too when we lose these kinds of distinctions.

My guess is that venom and venomous will either retain the distinct meaning they have now or narrow further to herpetological use only. Even now, in reference to spiders I'm much more likely to hear poison/poisonous than when referring to snakes.

Poison on the other hand I confidently predict will continue to be used more broadly and eventually it won't even be incorrect. My Linguistics professors would all be saying that this is why language is exciting and isn't it wonderful how it's constantly evolving.

I suspect I may not major in Linguistics because I just get really grumpy and sad about this kind of thing. Like when I just said that it won't even be incorrect. My mind is screaming at me two things, 1) it will always be wrong! And 2) A double negative? Really?
