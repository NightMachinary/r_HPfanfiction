Another key difference between venom and poison. Most animal poisons will kill u if ingested or reaaaally fuck you up (think fugu fish) but you can drink snake venom and basically be fine (make urself sick) but you can build up an immunity to it over time. Poisons work by being ingested and absorbed into your blood stream through your stomach while venoms need to be injected directly into your blood stream
