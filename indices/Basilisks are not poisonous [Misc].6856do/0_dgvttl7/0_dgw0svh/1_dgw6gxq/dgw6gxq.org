Hmm ... basically, you could say that toxicity is about a substance's ability to mess you up if it, or a part of it, gets inside of you via any possible method of entrance (though the word “toxin” itself means poison, and “venom” is a toxin, just one of animal origin). A poisonous snake's meat is toxic. A venomous snake's poison is toxic. Anything that gives off noxious fumes is toxic. Anything chemically reactive with the result hurting you is toxic. Anything extremely acidic or alkaline is toxic unless it just cannot interact with your body negatively (so stomach acid contained in the stomach is not toxic, but make a hole and it can start to be). Some radioactive stuff is toxic, like uranium, but some of the more radioactive substances like radium are not because they can only harm via radiation and while the radiation is toxic something that /only/ produces radiation is not. Stuff like lead is toxic because of the body's inability to get rid of it and the negative effects of too much of it being present. Then stuff like asbestos is toxic because you can inhale it and that's not exactly healthy.

But then, you have stuff like water being toxic when there is enough of it (though drowning is not death by water toxicity), and stuff like parasites generally aren't toxic because it's something they produce being toxic and they themselves are pathogenic instead. [[/u/triforceelf][u/triforceelf]] explained it without the word abuse if you want a shorter explanation.

And yes, giftig can translate to “toxic” too. I am unsure if that is because of the “poison = toxin” thing or if there is more to it, however.
