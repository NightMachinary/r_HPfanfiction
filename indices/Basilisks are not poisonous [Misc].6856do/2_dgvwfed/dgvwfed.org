I believe that when you're referring to animals, poisonous refers to when you eat the animal (e.g., fugu) and venomous refers to some kind of defense mechanism by a living animal - whether the venom is delivered orally, through skin contact, or whatever.

Which is actually consistent with your point. Just saying. I think confusion between poison/venom is probably rampant, though.
