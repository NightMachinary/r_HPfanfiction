Hmm...up to chapter 11 and I'm curious; is there actually a rule that the Gryffindor Quidditch Team has to recruit from their own house?

It'd be funny if someone discovered that that rule wasn't actually present, just a rule about it being students only. You could write a story about Harry being headhunted to be Seeker in every Quidditch match, regardless of team.

For fairness's sake, though, he'd probably play once each on each non-Gryffindor team during the year...
