I'm not sure why but this kind of reminded me of what you're talking about. It's not really a person who's truly insane, or a sociopath but it's someone who is differently sane by being so paranoid. The writing isn't the greatest but it's been updating consistently and there's something about it that feel unique. Unlikely so many Groundhog Day FICS the character doesn't know if it'll end and he has to die to repeat it.
