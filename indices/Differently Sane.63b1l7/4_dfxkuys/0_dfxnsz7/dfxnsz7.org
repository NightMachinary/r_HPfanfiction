Insanity does not mean you cannot have morals. Loss of morals (or as in the case of Bellatrix, empathy) is generally considered to be a form of sociopathy or psychopathy. This is a form of mental illness, but most people with sociopathic tendencies don't engage in aberrant behavior, they don't become serial killers. Experiencing delusions/hallucinations or engaging in delusional behavior are also forms of insanity, but the key feature for most diagnosis of mental illness revolve around how you, the sufferer, respond to it. You might have something like synesthesia, which is comparable to mild-to-severe hallucinations, but since it doesn't come with aberrant behavior we would not call you 'insane', merely neuro-atypical.

I'm looking for stories where the mental state of the point-of-view character is severely abnormal, atypical, or otherwise unusual, and this mental state affects their behavior.

I don't think Lily would actually count as Schizophrenic, in a technical sense, even though she might get diagnosed that way, because she is actually responding to a truer version of reality than normal people. At any rate, Schizophrenia is a form of insanity.
