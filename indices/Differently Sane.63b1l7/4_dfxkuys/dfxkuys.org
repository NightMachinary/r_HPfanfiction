I think that you mean dillusional and not insane. I may be wrong because I'm neither fluent in English or a psychologist. But Lily in Lily and AobS has schizophr√©nia. Trouble to read reality. On the other side, you have insanity like Bellatrix. Pure insanity with an absence of all morals. Which could be normal for Harry. You don't learn moral in a cupboard.
