linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced) is a classic "differently sane"!Harry. Harry is an elf. No, not a house elf; he's a forest elf.

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren) has Harry and Neville swapping places (Neville's the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry's parents are in St. Mungo's). Harry quickly becomes consumed with finding a cure for his parent's condition through transfiguration, and [[/s][transfigures himself to the point where he's no longer fully human]].
