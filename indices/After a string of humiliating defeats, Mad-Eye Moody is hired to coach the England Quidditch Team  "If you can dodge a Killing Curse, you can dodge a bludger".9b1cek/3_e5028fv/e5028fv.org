"If you can dodge a Killing Curse, you can dodge a bludger!" Moody shouts at the team from the stands, his magically amplified voice echoing in the still night. "Avada Kedavra!"

​

Spinnet drops out of the way just in time. She was the first to do so and she was ecstatic but then looked down and saw the cluster of bodies lifeless on the floor. Not even Wood could have come up with this technique. She hung her head and went down for landing.

​

Harry was next, he wasn't nervous after all this wasn't the first time a Killing Curse had been unsuccessful. He did feel a twinge of heartache for George though, he was after Harry and couldn't hear Moody cast the curse, he was a dead man walking.

​

Harry walked onto the field confidently, kicked off the ground and sped through the air. His Firebolt may be a few years old now and outdated but it still flew perfectly, still acting on thought more than touch. He heard Moody scream the dreaded, unforgivable curse and without even looking at Mad-Eye turned 180 degrees. The curse hit him straight on his right shoulder. Harry stumbled but nothing more, the green energy bounced and headed straight for the caster. Moody did little more than move his head out of the way and release a loud sigh, "I should have known" he said to himself.

​

Harry landed safely, annoyed that he hadn't dodged the curse but glad that Moody had failed to kill him yet again.

​

George mounted his broom nervously.
