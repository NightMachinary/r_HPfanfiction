"If you can dodge a dementor, you can dodge a bludger!" Alastor Moody said whilst starting to untie a cloth-covered wagon. Horror shot into my veins like a flash blizzard.

"Wait!" I shouted but it was too late. The cloth fell down and the bars swung open releasing the hoard of soul sucking demons. They flew into the air and I shrieked, zooming away on my broom as far as I could. My teammates were similarly racing as fast as they could around me, I could hear Hennessy wailing in fear.

I turned to see if the grizzled maniac was hopefully being drained by the demons he brought. He was instead standing on the ground idly with his shiny baboon patronus circling around him. I laughed in fear. It was madness. I didn't stop flying after I left the stadium. I didn't stop until I reached the house of my mum and convinced her to let me stay the night.

The entire team quit the next day.
