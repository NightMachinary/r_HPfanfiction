Pretty much everything about him changed the day he learned that the prophecy revolved around Lily and her (then unborn) son. He became a DA after graduating from Hogwarts in 1979, learned of the prophecy in the summer of 1980 and switch sides after his conversation with Dumbledore proclaiming he'd do 'anything' to pretect her. He was a DA for 1,5 years tops. He had switched sides even before Lily's death.

Aside from that, I'm pretty sure he got a lot more confident in his abilities since he didn't exactly show that he was able to fend for himself during his teenage years, but he definitely did as an adult.
