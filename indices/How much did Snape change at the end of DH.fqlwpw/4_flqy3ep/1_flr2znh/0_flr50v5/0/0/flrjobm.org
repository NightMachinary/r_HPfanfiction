You're assuming he realized it would get a baby killed. Nothing about the prophecy says that the one who approaches is a baby. Most people don't hear "approaches" and think it means a baby is being born. It is, in fact, more likely a rational person (which Voldemort, arguably, is not) will think of somebody coming nearer, possibly coming to the UK from a different country. It could have been anybody, of any age, whose birthday was at the end of the seventh month (which also has multiple interpretations).
