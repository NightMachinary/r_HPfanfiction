It's pretty sad to think about it. Giving information that would get a baby killed, just to move higher in the death eater hierarchy. He possibly did not care at that time. I am wondering though, during the 17 years after Lily died, did his view change somehow? That he no longer cares only about Lily, but also other people as well?
