It is a good question whether any other things about him changed during his journey into adulthood.\\
I suppose, like it is with many adults, you just start to accept things more for the way they are. I think he may have appreciated the stability and safety that his job as a teacher provided, even if he hated the job itself. He got to live at Hogwarts, which, as Harry also compared to himself, was the only place he ever called home. I also believe that he may have a very hard time letting go of the past. That's not just evident with Lily's passing, but also because he returns to Cokeworth ever summer even though it is a place filled with horrible memories.

We shouldn't forget that in the end, Rowling did write the books with children as the general audience in mind. This fandom has a tendency to overanalyse things about the characters and plots as a whole because we're starving for new content in a way that an adult (which the whole first generation of readers now is) would want more explanation and expansion on the magical world she built (and I am no exception to that).

Snape is such a complex character that it's easy to keep digging into a bag of "what-ifs" in his case. In the longfic I've written about him I put a lot of emphasis on the PTSD side of his life. Whether he actually has it or not is a What-If, but from my personal stance I believe it to be true because of the scenes of him as a boy and because of what Rowling had written on the old Pottermore site about his father frequently having used a whip. The foundation of his childhood formed his way of reasoning later on in life.
