I don't think it's clear at all that he "believed in pure-blood supremacy." He was an abused child who, like Harry, had his hopes of a new start at school dashed by the sheer blindness and/or complacency of the faculty toward bullying. He makes alliances where he can --- which, for a Slytherin, means only within his own house. Desperate to fit in with his new friends, he picks up their habits of speech and behavior. Clearly, he lashed out at Lily only through abject humiliation, the specific slur he used having nothing to do with their relationship, but what, in his anger to lash out at someone, anyone, he knew would hurt. (That he nearly immediately tried to apologize, more than once, and that she refused to even talk to him /for the rest of her life/ does not speak well of HER character.) Then the episode where he is set up to be mauled, possibly killed, and HE is the one who is punished and threatened.

All of which led to the spiteful, bitter, friendless man whose only goal in life is to *make sure he is never that powerless again*. Ripe pickings for a powerful, charismatic sociopath who, by the way, CAN READ HIS MIND to figure out exactly what to say to woo this vulnerable child-man over to his side. Do you really think that a pre-insane Voldemort immediately explained or showed his followers the depths of depravity he would lead them into? Dumbledore had already shown that he held no value for teenaged Severus, because he wasn't one of his precious Gryffindors. What side would you expect him to pick?
