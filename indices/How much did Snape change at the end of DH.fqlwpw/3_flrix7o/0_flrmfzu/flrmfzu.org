I do feel that his character is set out to be tragical. If I were in his shoes, entering a school full of hope yet instantly got bullied, outnumbered, and ended up losing the love of his life to one of the bullies...Hell I might break at one point. His action is definitely not all his fault, I can see to that. But as the book goes JKR was determined to make his life all bitter. No matter what portion of these unfortunate events are actually his doing. I'm just wondering how much he changed at the end.
