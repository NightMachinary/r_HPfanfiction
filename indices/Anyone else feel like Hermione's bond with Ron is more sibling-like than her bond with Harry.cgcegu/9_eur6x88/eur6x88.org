I think the opposite... kind of. IMO, Heron has the spark needed for romance -- but their personalities and wants in a partner clashes too poorly for it to become anything longterm. Harmony doesn't have this problem but the romantic feelings simply isn't there. You don't choose who you fall in love with.
