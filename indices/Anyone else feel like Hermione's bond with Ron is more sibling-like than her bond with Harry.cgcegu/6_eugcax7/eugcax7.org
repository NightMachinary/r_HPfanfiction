I think Ron had no idea how to act and react around a girl he likes (I don't think he figured out that his feelings were romantic, he only knew that he enjoyed her company) and since the only girl he knows and likes is his sister he mimics the way he behaves around her.

Once he grows up a bit and realizes that Hermione is not his sister he realizes that he shouldn't be talking and acting the same way he does with Ginny, but he still doesn't know HOW to act. It took Krum appearing and him feeling jealous for him to realize what he felt and yet he had no idea how to communicate it to her. He has no couple point of reference beside his parents and they've been married for a looong time so it's not a dynamics he can copy. He could've gone and asked his brothers for tips, but I'm his mind the twins would make fun of him, Percy was being a dick and I think Ron was waaay too immature to deal with a conversation like this in a letter with Billy or Charlie.

His relationship with Lavender is when he discovers how this boyfriend and girlfriend stuff works and how to act romantically around a girl. And she was the one that made all the first steps for it to happen. And that's when he finally starts to make a move with Hermione and it starts to work well.

Harry on the other hand doesn't have any starting point on "how do I act around girls" so he just treats her as he would treat a friend. Their relationship becomes stronger, but the way he treats her is always in a "you're my friend and I respect you" way. He was a tool when it comes to dating as well, but he never changed how he sees Hermione, he's not overprotective of her, he respects her decisions and their arguments is never sibling-like.

Someone commented of the Horcrux Harry and Hermione moment, but the way I see it's just a fear Ron had from the way he perceived things, he thought Harry was superior and that maybe Hermione would want that superiority. Harry immediately says that he doesn't sees Hermione like this and honestly not a line when they were alone on that trip to find Horcruxes leads to romantic behaviour.

Anyway, that's how I see and interpret it, I know that Harmony shippers don't see it like that, but the beauty of art is that people can perceive it in different ways and exchange experiences.
