Yes, I'm a only child who has several pairs of siblings as cousins from the out side looking in. Ron never flirts with Hermione that we can see, it's just assumed he is attracted to her starting 6th year. The closest they ever seem as a couple is on Herbology when they dance around Hermione asking Ron to the Slug Club as her date. Even during the hunt he and Hermione maintain that weird brother sister vibe with JK shoving the one hint they are into each other with Hermione and him holding hands in Grimmauld. Then they kiss and it's kinds squiky

Harry and Hermione actually seem to take comfort in each other both emotionally and physically (not sexually) when the Ron leaves and the infamous dance happens as well as the Christmas Eve visit to James and Lily's Graves. This is just a extention of their roles in each other lives as the others true best friend.
