You are right that there was a Hogsmeade weekend before the map/cloak one. However, while they left and returned together, it's not said that Ron and Hermione stayed together the whole time. The ramble over the top of each other about very different shops. The only place we know they where together is the three broomsticks.

  They also spent weeks together during multiple summers before Harry was allowed to leave the Dursleys.

In 4th-year, yeah a little bit of friendship there (though she likely spent a considerable amount of time with Ginny). In 5th year and up it was Order Business and we have no idea how much interaction they had (likely doing homework and worrying about Harry).
