It depends on what your view of a sibling relationship is. Hermione and Harry seem to avoid confrontation at all costs as though they're trying hard not to ruin the stable familial relationship they've built. Not all siblings are stereotypically argumentative. My brother and I tend to avoid conflict like the plague because we know that it will be a lot worse in the long run. Hermione and Ron on the other hand argue like friends/potential lovers, they don't have as much fear of losing the other because you can always find someone else to love romantically but you can't get new family. Just because Harry and Hermione get on doesn't mean they're romantically attracted to each other. When I first started dating my boyfriend we argued more because we were insecure and unsure of things. Now we don't argue at all. I think we get these ideas in our heads of what other people's relationships should be based on our own experiences but there's no mould for relationships.
