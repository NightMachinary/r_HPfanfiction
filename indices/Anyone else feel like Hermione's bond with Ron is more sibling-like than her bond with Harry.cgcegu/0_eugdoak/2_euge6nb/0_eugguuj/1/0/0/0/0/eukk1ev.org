I never said otherwise, but it was also up to Mcgonnagal to understand that the 11 year old kid is convinced that the secret stone that he shouldn't even know about is unsafe, and maybe she should at least keep an eye on him overnight. I mean she is the mature, responsible adult here, so she should do more than just wave it off. Especially when said kid shouldn't even know about this. She should also know that her not doing anything would just invite the kid to try, and prove it, and with a giant three-headed dog as the first obstacle, maybe she should make sure that Harry doesn't hurt himself doing what kids love trying to do to adults, prove them wrong.
