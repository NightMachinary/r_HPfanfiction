Maybe the reason she dismissed his claim was... because the stone really was safe, and snape was really not after it?

The entire plot boils down to "Kid makes multiple wrong assumptions, tells them to adult, is (rightfully) told that it's nonsense. Decides to ignore that, as he obviously knows better, and goes on to cause the very problem that he was warning against." Thank god for the Deus Ex Machina, else voldemort would have been back a few years early, and it would have been entirely 100% Harry's fault.

Later plots get a BIT better in not being entirely dependent on Harry doing something, more on things being done to him. In most of those however it swings the other way, were Harry is ridiculously passive and merely reacting to things. He does tend to make stupid decisions still though. I mean, 2nd year, all else aside, IIRC he already considered Gilderoy a fraud and a joke. So when he had the rather clever idea of go to a teacher.... WHY choose the one you know is not only useless but also incapable? McGonnagal, Flitwick, hell, fucking SNAPE would have been a better choice, at least he knows they are competent.
