I feel like in all of these scenarios he doesn't go looking for trouble, rather because he feels like he has to, because no one actually tells him anything. For example, he went to Professor McGonagall about the stone, but she just dismissed his claims altogether. As far as he knew, Snape was going to get the stone and no one was going to do anything about it, so it had to be him.

It's easy to say what could or not have done, but with how little anyone clues Harry in about any of their plans, it's no wonder he feels like the only one qualified to tackle the problem. 'Fine, I guess. I'll do it myself.'
