To be honest, I get that reading for both Harry and Ron when Hermione speaks with them. Hermione as the older responsible but impulsive sister, Ron as the middle one who's overlooked and Harry as the youngest one who goes into extreme antics.

And that's what I always wished. No pairings at all in between these three people and then just continue onto adulthood as close confidants. But what romance we do get leaves a lot to be desired.
