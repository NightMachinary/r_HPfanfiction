He had some personality, nd he was a secondary main character that could've easily been mentioned more. And then they had chemistry at Bill and Fleur's wedding. Also, I don't like the idea of the trio getting married less than a year after the war so if she hadn't been with Ron then she could've freely dated. Then again, the main problem is that I'm not a huge Romione fan at all.
