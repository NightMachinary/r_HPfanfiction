I always thought it was odd that Ron seemed to have the same controlling, over-protective, kneejerk reaction to Hermione's dating life as with Ginny's.

  "I told you!" Ron hissed at Hermione, as she stared down at the article. "I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She's made you out to be some sort of---of scarlet woman!"

  Hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. "Scarlet woman?"

  "It's what my mum calls them," Ron muttered, his ears going red again.

  "Right," said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, "let's get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron---"

  "Yeah, it is!" said Ron, just as angrily. "D'you think I want people saying my sister's a---"

But I guess it's weird in general trying to figure out Ron's feelings about Hermione and when exactly they started changing from friendship to romance. Ron's burgeoning romantic feelings toward Hermione just don't really come off as... romantic. Of course he's a 14 year old boy when this happens, but he never seems to grow past this type of immature insecurity, since his big fear, as revealed by the Horcrux Locket, was Hermione dumping him for Harry.

  "Viktor's just gone to get some drinks."

  Ron gave her a withering look. "Viktor?" he said. "Hasn't he asked you to call him Vicky yet?"

  Hermione looked at him in surprise. "What's up with you?" she said.

  "If you don't know," said Ron scathingly, "I'm not going to tell you."
