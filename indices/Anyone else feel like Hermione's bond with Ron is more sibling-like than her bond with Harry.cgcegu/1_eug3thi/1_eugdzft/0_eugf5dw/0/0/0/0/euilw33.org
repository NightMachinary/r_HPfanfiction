It's kinda ridiculous at this point. This is my third time interacting with Hellstrike, and every single one has involved Hellstrike bashing Ron and shipping Harry and Hermione with a passion that would almost be impressive, except that they have not provided a single compelling argument to support their viewpoint, and their counterpoints are usually nitpicks or completely dismissive with nothing to back it up.
