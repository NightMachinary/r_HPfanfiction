  In regards to Ron's feelings about Hermione, The locket was only exposed to Ron's thoughts and feelings when he was in the tent, with Harry and Hermione. He wasn't worried that Hermione was out there, dying. He was right there next to her. He knew she was alive and well and safe, so his worries about her weren't as strong as the worries were for his family

You just argued why it should not show Hermione but his family. Thank you for making my point.
