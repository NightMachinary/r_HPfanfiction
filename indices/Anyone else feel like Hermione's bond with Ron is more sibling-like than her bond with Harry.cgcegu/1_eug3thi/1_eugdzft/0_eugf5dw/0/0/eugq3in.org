In regards to Ron's feelings about Hermione, The locket was only exposed to Ron's thoughts and feelings when he was in the tent, with Harry and Hermione. He wasn't worried that Hermione was out there, dying. He was right there next to her. He knew she was alive and well and safe, so his worries about her weren't as strong as the worries were for his family, since he didn't know if any of them were dead or alive at the time.

Remember, the Locket is not a boggart or a dementor. It does not show you your worst fear or worst memories. The effect of the locket was that it fed off of negative thoughts and emotions that were already there, and amplifies the negativity and makes them worse.

So Hermione dying was certain one of Ron's worst fears, but when they were in that tent, he knew she was alive and well, and didn't think about her fate as much as he did about his family's fate, who he was worried sick for, and had no information on.

However, since Hermione was alive and well and in a position where she was in constantly close to Harry, his old insecurities popped back up, not only about Hermione, but also about his family, and how he always felt least loved and the least important among his siblings. It was small at first, but once the Horcrux saw that insecurity, it focused on that insecurity alongside its focus on the facts the he was starving and malnourished, his family could all be dead right now, Dumbledore didn't train Harry at all or tell him a good course of action just in case Dumbledore died, and now they were wandering aimlessly around in the woods with a Horcrux that is slowly eating away at all of them, bit by bit.

All of those things are what led to Ron losing his temper after months of being tortured by the Horcrux and fighting its influence, finally make him give in to all his worries and confront Harry. Of course, the Horcrux had constantly taken its toll on all of them, and was manipulating all of their thoughts, which meant that Harry's paranoia about his friends losing faith in him were true, because the Horcrux was manipulating them into losing faith in him.

As a result, when Ron confronted Harry, Harry wasn't exactly kind or patient or understanding either.

The Horcrux wanted this group broken up, so that they wouldn't destroy it, and putting them against each other was its best shot of preserving itself, but I digress.

Ron's constantt insecurity was that he wasn't good enough for Hermione as a partner, and that he wasn't good enough to be a friend for Harry, and that he wasn't good enough for anybody for anything. That was only amplified by the fact that he got splinched, and literally could not be of any help to Harry or Hermione at all.

That insecurity, along with everything else I mentioned, are the reasons why Ron spoke up and left, especially the fact that his family could be out there dying and he wouldn't know, because he's stuck in a tent on a godforsaken mission with no plan and no goal other than to eventually find some sort of clue towards destroying the one Horcrux they have, and finding the other Horcuxes to destroy as well.
