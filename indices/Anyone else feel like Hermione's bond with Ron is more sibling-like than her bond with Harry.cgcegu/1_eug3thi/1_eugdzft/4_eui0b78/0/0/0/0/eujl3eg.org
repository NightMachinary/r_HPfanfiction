Ron, for all his flaws, is fiercely protective of those he cares for. When Malfoy insulted Hermione, Ron tried to curse him. Ron worried for his baby sister when she started dating guys. He would get indignant or even angry about Snape insulting and slighting Harry or Hermione in classes. He went with Harry into the forbidden forest to follow the spiders that terrified him because he wasn't going to let Harry go by himself. He would get into fights with Malfoy over insults about his friends or family. He shows this protective nature at every turn in the books.

If the locket started showing him that his family was being tortured, regardless of whether or not it was true, he would attack the locket faster than you could blink. Then he'd strike off without a plan to go save his family or something along that vein with his friends at his six. By playing on his insecurities, it's trying to turn him on his friends. To keep them all distracted from destroying the locket and instead intent on attacking each other.
