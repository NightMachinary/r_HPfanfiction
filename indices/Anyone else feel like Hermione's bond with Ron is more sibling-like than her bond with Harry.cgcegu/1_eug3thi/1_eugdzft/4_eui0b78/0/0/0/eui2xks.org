If it wanted Ron away and docile, threats to his family would be more effective. Bellatrix Lestrange whispering that they made him talk as she tortures one Weasley after another into insanity, that it was entirely Ron's fault, that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were waiting for a turn with Ginny...

You can't seriously believe that Harry and Hermione together would be a better deterrent than an explicit Reek torture montage with the Weasleys on the receiving end.
