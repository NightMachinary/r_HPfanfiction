  If it wanted Ron away and docile, threats to his family would be more effective.

What's a more effective course of action is debatable as both courses are valid and I think that debate would ultimately be tangential to our subject.

The point is the Horcrux was sentient. It's not just programmed to do one thing like show a person's worst fear. It lies, it does whatever it thinks is necessary to get what it wanted. It showing Ron an image of Harry and Hermione is a poor indication of Ron's actual priorities, etc. It says more about what the horcrux wanted.
