  since his big fear, as revealed by the Horcrux Locket, was Hermione dumping him for Harry

Which honestly just proves that he did not love her. I mean, they were in the middle of a civil war where Hermione was Most wanted Number 2, Muggleborns were deported to Azkaban, which was repurposed into a concentration camp, if they were lucky. Many met worse fates and, like Edward Tonks, were summarily executed by the countless death squads which searched the country. And his own family was under tight security as well.

But no, Ron's biggest fear is whether Harry banged Hermione and not if she was even alive, or the atrocities she or his family could suffer under the Death Eaters. Because I imagine the likes of Malfoy and his cronies taking turns with Hermione a significantly worse and more likely danger than her and Harry finding solace in each other.
