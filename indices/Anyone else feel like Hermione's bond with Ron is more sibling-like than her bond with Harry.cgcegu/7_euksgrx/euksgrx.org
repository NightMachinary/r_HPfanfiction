JKR had already written the epilogue along with the first book. She had written the canon pairings long before her characters actually grew up in the books. And she's said that she wrote Romoine while she was pining after her abusive(?) *ex*-husband. /That/ is the source of their regular fights.

You won't find good romance that's based on canon facts. /It doesn't exist/.
