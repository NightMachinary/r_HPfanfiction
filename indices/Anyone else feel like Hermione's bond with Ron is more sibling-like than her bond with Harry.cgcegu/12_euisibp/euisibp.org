THANK-YOU!!! Whenever someone brings up how Harry, and Hermione act like siblings, my first thought is 'bull.' I grew up with two sisters, and one brother, and 90% of the time we'd be arguing. Harry, and Hermione act like good friends, not siblings. I always found Ron/Hermione pairings disturbing, because that is just wrong in my eyes.
