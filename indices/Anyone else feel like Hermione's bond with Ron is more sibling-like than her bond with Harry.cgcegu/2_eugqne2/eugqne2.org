Maybe, we don't see a lot of it. I often think I'd like to see a JK-written rewrite of moments in the series from Hermione's POV.

To be honest based on canon alone I don't pick up a lot of chemistry or romantic attraction between any of the Trio. I feel like a lot of Harmonian shipping is as a result more of Harry and Hermione appearing to be the male and female lead of the text rather than any inherent chemistry they have as people.

Of course, there's also the fact that Daniel and Emma have wicked chemistry as actors to contend with though, which is unfortunate.
