You say that, but the Ministry and Umbridge's attitude towards Voldemort in Book 4 reminds me of the /ASoUE/ parents' attitude to Count Olaf so very very much...

Alternatively, there's always the possibly of crossing over not with the /books/' universe, but with the Netflix series (which is what I intend to do). The series has more reasonable numbers of competent adults.
