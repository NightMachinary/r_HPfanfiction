It's more of a stray collection of plot-points, like VFD being a society of Muggles who have seen through the Statute, Hagrid getting a pet Bombinating Beast, Uncle Monty discombobulating everyone as a Muggle Parselmouth until they realize he's not magical at all and learned to understand snakes through old-fashioned research, Inky vs Nagini, the Sinister Duo hiring a wizard who knows /Fiendfyre/ to do their dirty work...

The starting point would be that due to a Prophecy that appears to refer to them, Dumbledore arranges to get guardianship of the Baudelaires, and they end up at Hogwarts. (Cue Count Olaf as Defence Professor, because obviously.) Though the Baudelaires are by then much older (this would be an alternate post-/TPP/), this would be in Harrry & Co.'s Second Year, except with a First Year showdown that had gone down differently. The Stone is still in the Corridor, and while Quirrell died over the summer, Voldemort hasn't given up on getting it. This is so that he and Olaf can run into each other running parallel plots to get whatever mysterious thing lies in the Corridor (Olaf obviously thinks it's the Sugar Bowl).

I've flip-flopped on whether this would be book- or series-verse for /ASoUE/, and am leaning towards series, with the caveat that I reserve the right to borrow any detail I like from whichever of the two I /didn't/ pick; whatever I choose, after all, any changes can be explained as Lemony getting some bit of research wrong, or deliberately lying to us to hide something important about VFD.
