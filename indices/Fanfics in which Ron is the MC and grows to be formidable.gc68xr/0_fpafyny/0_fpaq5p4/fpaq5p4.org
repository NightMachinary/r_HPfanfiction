I love it.

I generally prefer Ron's foreshadowed "powers" and "skills" to be brought to the surface +i.e his insane emotional range that can be mistaken for a empath, his chess playing skills, his people skills which come from empath thing, his "I will make a joke about this thing that will definitely happen" thing that implies he has seer prowess, his creativity, his willingness to get into physical fights in spite of being a wizard, his oddly impressive fighting record which is off screened, his connections via family that can be capitalized on, and so on,+ but I love these stuff too. Thanks for suggestion!
