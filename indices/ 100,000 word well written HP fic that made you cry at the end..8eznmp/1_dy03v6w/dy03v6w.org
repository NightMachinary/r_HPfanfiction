The Changeling! (Idk how to link fanfic bot yet sorry)

It's the best fanfic I've ever read, it's amazing, I cried my eyes out at the end over the sheer emotional toll of it. I've been promoting it non-stop because I think everyone needs to read it.

Basically, Ginny is sorted into Slytherin instead. The character development is amazing, it sticks close to canon but obviously switches it up a little.
