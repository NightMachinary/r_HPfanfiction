I really loved Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting, Dumbledore is really well written in there. The author often starts a situation similarly to canon and/or fanon, you think you know exactly what's coming and how Dumbledore is going to be bashed, but suddenly he offers a perfect explanation of his thought process, or the situation was actually different all along, and everything makes a lot of sense. The example you gave with the Philosopher's stone is exactly that : you spend a lot of time thinking it's the same as canon, only for him to end up explaining that he needed a way to canalize young wizard's energy, and that he's been doing it for a while now, and that no one was really at risk.\\
I'm eagerly awaiting for the sequel.
