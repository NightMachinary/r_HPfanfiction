Two very different, yet fantastic fics:

linkffn(10639968): A WBWL one-shot with two sequels on the author's page. Voldemort is permanently dead, and Harry suffered from significant neglect. Dumbledore, whose only involvement in the Potter family was a warning that Death Eaters might come after the other son, is absolutely horrified. He takes on a role as a mentor figure to help Harry achieve his dreams. It's my absolute favorite fic of the WBWL genre because it really isn't part of the genre. There's no revenge, or major bashing, or weird lordship wankery. Just a neglected kid learning to be okay and trusting his found family.

linkao3(18608212) is a rather cracky fic. Dumbledore's primary goal is for everyone to do their own work without handholding so he can pursue his real goal: using his connection to the wards to randomly appear next to troublemakers and dispense koans. The 3rd floor corridor has absolutely nothing to do with the Philosopher's Stone. It's actually a way to provide reality warping children a way to think they're being dangerous and breaking the rules in a more structured manner.
