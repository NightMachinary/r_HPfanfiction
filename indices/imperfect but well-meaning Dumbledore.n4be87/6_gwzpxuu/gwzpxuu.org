He's very skilled, and a sympathetic character, but not really a mastermind of anything, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels. Tom Riddle never became a terrorist, he went into politics instead, and Dumbledore is now his primary opponent when trying to pass discriminatory legislation - so Riddle surreptitiously causes trouble at Hogwarts in order to shake people's confidence in the headmaster. When Dumbledore is on-screen, he's basically just a very good educator.
