From what I've read of the Accidental Animagus series it does this pretty well. Wind Shear also to an extent like this but probably accentuates his flaws beyond their canon selves, ending with a antagonistic relationship between him and !FutureHarry, not quite to a bashing extent, but probably tows the line a bit too much for what you want. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12498125/1/Umino-Iruka-and-the-Will-of-Fire][U]]mino Iruka and the Will of Fire (Naruto cross) calls out his manipulative tendencies but not for long and he is pretty much universally a positive influence throughout the fic.
