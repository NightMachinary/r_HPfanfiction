My headcanon has always been that the hat sorts people not based on what they /are/ but what they /value/.

Virtues are often correlated. There's no reason why someone couldn't be clever and hardworking or brave and cunning- quite often those traits go hand and hand. And there are going to be plenty of 11 year olds who embody none of the traits of the Founders.

Hermione is undoubtedly bookish and clever, and also ambitious and at times manipulative. But that isn't what she values most. Even in Book 1 she states that "friendship and bravery" are far more important to her than her intellectual gifts. The hat sorted her based on that. To paraphrase Dumbledore 'It is not who we are born but who we choose to be.'

Also this interpretation helps us decode some otherwise inexplicable sorts (Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, Pettigrew).
