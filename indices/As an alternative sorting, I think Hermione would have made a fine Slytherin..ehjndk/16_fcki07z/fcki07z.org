forgive me if im wrong but didnt Slytherin (person) hate muggleborns and didint want them in his house. if so wouldnt he enchant the hat with his ideals against muggleborns therfore barring muggleborns from entry into his house.

Tom Riddle got in as a decendant and ge was not muggle born just thought to be. other than that is there any slytherin that is a muggleborn?
