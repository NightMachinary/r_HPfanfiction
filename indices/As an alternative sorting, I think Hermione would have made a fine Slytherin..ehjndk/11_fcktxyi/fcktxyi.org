Honestly, she'd also make a good Hufflepuff... She is loyal to the point of deleting herself from her parents' memory in order to stand by her friends, and in being true to her friends even when they're total jerk (like Ron is to her in most of the books but the most in the last one), getting herself in trouble for her friends and risking death. She is honest and helpful to everyone, I mean she has her pride but she is big for others' rights (and it's not like Ernie McMillan is any less proud - sorry for spelling I haven't read the books in English). She is always kind and eager to please.

It makes me have mixed feelings about her - on the one hand, I like the character's depth, I think there are almost none as deep as she is developed, with all the facets of her personality. On the other hand, it makes me feel like she was some sort of trash can for JKR, giving her every attribute she needed someone close to Harry to have besides the obviously contradicting ones.
