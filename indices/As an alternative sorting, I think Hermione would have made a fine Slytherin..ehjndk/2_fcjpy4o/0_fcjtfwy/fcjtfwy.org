I agree with most that, aside from the 'ambitious as fuck' bit. I'd say he's more partly ambitious as fuck as he doesn't seem to do or want to do anything but play chess and Quidditch unless someone is less than twenty minutes from death, after which he finally gets his act into gear and pulls out all the stops to do things (Quirrell in book one, Ginny in book two, Sirius in book three. He starts to prepare a little more in book four, to the point of nearly oversleeping for the second task, but that's still mostly driven by Hermione and Ron). After the damsel is rescued and the adults give their regular pat-on-the-head-and-ignore-everything moment and wander off, he goes right back to complacency again.
