I see the Imperius as the most insidious and underhanded of all the Unforgivables because of how it takes away a person's agency. (This is not me saying that all Slytherin actions are insidious - hell, I consider myself Slytherin.) I also see the Imperius as the most "give me what I want" out of all of them, which is Slytherin af.

Cruciatus is another story (and speaks to your point) because when Harry tried to cast it/did cast it, it came from grief and rage. With Imperius, it was absolutely him using any means to achieve his ends.

Edit: I said something along this line somewhere else in this post, but this is the magic of the characters and their actions - it's not black and white and not a single one character slots easily into any one house.
