So here's my attempt at trying to convince you: Harry's not-so-obvious Slytherin qualities are why he's my favorite character.

He's ambitious as fuck. In every single book he finds a goal and uses every tool at his disposal in order to achieve it.

He follows the rules only when it suits him. He uses his invisibility cloak whenever he encounters an obstacle between him and what he wants (restricted section, spying on Draco, etc). He also does this repeatedly without even thinking about why it might be wrong.

He uses the half-blood prince's book to impress Slughorn, get on his good side, unrightfully earn the Felix Felicis, and ultimately get the answer about Horcruxes that he's looking for. (Not to mention using Sectumsempra without knowing what it was - a time where I think his Slytherin side scared him.)

He's a bit manipulative at times, like when he's double-crossing Griphook (he doesn't have to know when Harry's planning on giving the sword back).

He uses the Unforgivables (and in the books he does it WAY more than he does in the movies, also Ron never casts the Imperius - it's JUST Harry). There are the obvious Crucios against Bellatrix and Snape and Carrow, but most Slytherin of him I think is his repeated use of Imperio in the Gringotts break.

There are many other examples, but I'm on mobile right now... I just think all of those things are ALL Harry - not the sliver of Voldemort soul.
