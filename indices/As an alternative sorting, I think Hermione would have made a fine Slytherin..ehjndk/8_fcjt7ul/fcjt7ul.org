I think this is one of the most terrifying things about Hermione - we look at her and see how Ravenclaw she is, or how Slytherin she could be, so imagine how fucking stubborn and charge-ahead-at-all-costs she must've been to be viable for Gryffindor. Like, dear god, it's no wonder she never backs down for anything ever when that quality apparently beat out her evident nerdiness and semi-sociopathic cunning. There's a Hermione vs Harry as Moriarty and Sherlock allegories fic around somewhere that deals with that hella nicely. Call me Moriarty, I think?
