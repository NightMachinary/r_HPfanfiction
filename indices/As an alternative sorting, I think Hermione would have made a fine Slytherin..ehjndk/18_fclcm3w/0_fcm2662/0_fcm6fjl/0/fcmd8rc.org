I dont think competitive is using any means necessary. The book being better than her in potions and is a huge blow to her ego. She wants to prove that she better than the book, she can't be better if she's using it. She's used to being the smart one, she relishes it, which is why she gives in and helps/does the boys homework for them, and why her biggest fear is failure.
