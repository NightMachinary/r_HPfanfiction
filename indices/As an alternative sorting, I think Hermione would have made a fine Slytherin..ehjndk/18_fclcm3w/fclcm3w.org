I am a big fan of the Slytherin!Hermione premise---when it's actually about facing adversity and rise to power, as opposed to a romance with a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Slytherin in Leather Pants]]. Unfortunately, it's slim pickings.

However, canon Hermione is a Gryffindor through and through. You write about her ambitions, but there are different kinds of ambition. When we speak of personal ambition and "greatness", we generally speak of what one might term "Slytherin-ambition", the pursuit of recognition, status, power, or just pleasure, stability, and creature comforts for oneself and one's own, while being fairly indifferent to everyone else's well-being. But, one can also speak of "Gryffindor-ambition" to make the world a better place, often whether the world wants it or not. In other words, what makes something "Gryffindor" as opposed to "Slytherin" is the end, not the means.

In his youth, Tom Riddle was planning how to avoid his own death. Dumbledore was planning to /take over the world/ for the greater good. Worst-case Slytherin is the memetic Hitler: a genocidal tyrant who oppresses you for the good of himself or of whatever group he identifies with; worst-case Gryffindor is the memetic Stalin: a genocidal tyrant who oppresses you for your own good. The character who exemplifies Slytherin at its best is Slughorn: an expert at the top of his lucrative profession, who trades favours and cultivates connections to improve his own life.

Now, Hermione does have a bit of Slytherin-ambition: she likes to be acknowledged as the smartest person in the room; but even about that, she is not that competitive: she doesn't resent Harry in the areas where he does better than her, doesn't try to catch up, and turns down the opportunity to use HBP's Potions textbook because she views it as cheating. Her ambitions are overwhelmingly Gryffindor-ambitions, no matter how ruthless she may be about pursuing them. If she were worried only about her DADA OWLs, she could have formed a study group with Harry and a few friends. Instead, she risked expulsion to make sure as many others as possible would be prepared. SPEW was her trying to break down a system /that she was benefiting from/.

Oh, and Draco is very Slytherin. Sure, his "ambitions" are petty and small-time, but they are all Slytherin-ambitions: they are ultimately centred around himself and maybe his immediate family. Can you imagine Draco sacrificing even his time and money, to say nothing of risking life and limb for anyone else? Along similar lines, Vincent Crabbe wasn't particularly clever, but he knew enough to follow Draco---and so benefit from his resources and prestige in Slytherin---until it was time to betray Draco in favour of a stronger master when Draco faltered. (Note that he wasn't particularly competent about carrying out the betrayal.)

Ravenclaw!Hermione was a closer thing, because she does like knowledge for its own sake---even if social reform takes precedence. I think that she would have probably fit in better there than she did in Gryffindor; perhaps to the point of becoming for her year in Ravenclaw what Draco was for his year in Slytherin.
