Your original statement extrapolates that because Slytherin was a racist, every student after has to be a racist too. That doesn't make sense.

Slughorn is indifferent to muggles -- he lives among them when he's in hiding, and he doesn't differentiate between students with different blood status. I'm not sure how much more indifferent he could be.

As for Slytherins who are indifferent or better to muggles -- Andromeda Tonks, formerly Black. We know she's in Slytherin because every Black before Sirius was in Slytherin. She runs away to marry a muggleborn, so pretty sure she's okay with them.
