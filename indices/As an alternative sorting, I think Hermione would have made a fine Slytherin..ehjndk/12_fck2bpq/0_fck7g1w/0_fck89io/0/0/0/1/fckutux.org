You seem determined to think of them as racist, and there's really no point continuing this conversation. You asked for an example of a Slytherin who likes (actually, who is indifferent, which they certainly are) Muggles, I gave you two, and it doesn't count because we don't know what she thought while she was in school and we don't why Slughorn lived among muggles. I'm pretty sure being willing to live among people means you don't hate them (aka, you're indifferent) but sure, he's racist too. We don't know what 99% of the characters in these books thought while they were in school. We get tiny glimpses of them through the perspective of one character. I'm not sure why it's so important to you to paint every character in the house this way, but the fact that multiple characters choose to engage with muggless/muggleborns is a point in their favor.

There are a handful of canon slytherins by your definition -- ones that we know don't like Muggles while they were in school: Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle. If you want to use that determine that 1/4 of the students of a school that's been around for 1000 years were racist to the core, that's your choice.
