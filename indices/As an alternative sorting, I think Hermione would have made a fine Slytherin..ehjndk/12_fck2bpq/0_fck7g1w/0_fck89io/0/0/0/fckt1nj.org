Andromeda May have held those ideals until she fell in love with Ted Tonks. We can't really know. Sirius was brought up in that house and ended up in Gryfindor because he didn't conform to the Black family's ideals. In fact, it's quite brave if Andromeda to choose her love over her family which would mean she developed as a person later than the supposedly racist Slytherin she had most likely been brought up to be when she had started Hogwarts.

And as for Slughorn, it's simply a point to his cunning that he hid among muggles because he genuinely believed no one would find him there as opposed to simply moving to a magical community in Any other part of the world. You can almost presume that he thought it would be the last place anyone would think to look because...who would think of muggles? The Black family ancestral home was in a muggle neighborhood, wasn't it? For as racist as they were known to be, you could assume they employed the same logic. “Who would think of muggles?”
