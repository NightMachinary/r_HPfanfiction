I would like to agree with you, but too many Slytherins were shown to still hold such ideals that it gives more credence to the idea being plausible: not liking muggles was a common attitude for Slytherins. Slughorn, for as much as he was the friendliest seeming Slytherin adult, only admired those who had proven talented, like Lily Potter. If I'm shown a canon Slytherin that was at least indifferent to muggles like most people in other houses seem to be, I'll take back my statement. Otherwise, I think that house was designed by JKR to be where bad people developed.

(And before anyone mentions something about Peter Pettigrew, him betraying his friends was never given an understandable and explicit reason WHY he did so. Definitely a plot device. Jealousy makes no sense.)
