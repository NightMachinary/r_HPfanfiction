It's not just fanon, JKR 'told' that Slytherin was cunning and ambitious, and the hat suggested it wasn't all evil, it's just what she 'showed' never had any of that. I think this was basically a mistake. She tried to make up for it with slughorn but really she needed to have Draco get a redemption arc and/or introduce, for example, Daphne Greengrass as a good-guy Slytherin student
