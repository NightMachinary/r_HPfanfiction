Precisely. I think Fanon has really brought overly positive and cute traits to Slytherin house. Cunning and ambition can be possessed without being a master manipulator who chooses each syllable they say and snarky/catty humor. Canon said Salazar Slytherin wanted to eradicate mudbloods and muggles (he even left behind a basilisk first that goal) and also it's implied that he desired such people and qualities in his house. Therefore... it really is a racist frat.
