A lot of ppl would've done well in Slytherin. Unfortunately, at the time of the HP books, it was seen as a “dark and evil” house. So unless you were a Death Eater kid, you wouldn't have gone in. I find it hard to believe Harry was the only one who knew that u could influence the hat's decision on what house to go. Like Harry, other ppl could've pushed for ravenclaw, the closest in my opinion to Slytherin or another house. After all, what kid wants to be seen as “evil”? At 11 years old?

I believe more in the values of Slytherin as the ambition and self preservation part but kids can be cruel. It's better to be seen as a brave hero rather than a snake soooo....

And families tend to stay in one house. Like Malfoy said “My whole family was in Slytherin”. I'm guessing this is the same for other dark inclined families. I can't imagine Crabbe and Goyle naturally ending up in Slytherin. They seem too dumb to function. So they posh just ask for Slytherin as per their family's wishes and to stick with Malfoy

On the mirror side, all weasleys have been in Gryffindor. I see how Percy and the twins lean on the ambitious side (starting their own business, climbing up in ministry) but they knew how badly it would make them look. Oh no >.> a Weasley went evil. They're in the snakes pit.

Hermione would have been a good Slytherin as well. She has so much ambition. Unfortunately at her sorting time, if she had gotten into Slytherin it would've been a death sentence for her. School politics would not allow her to thrive there.

All the Slytherins talked abt in the HP series we're all Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, etc. All pure blooded ppl obsessed with blood and think they're superior to everyone. The so called “evil” house would not have accepted a /mudblood/. 😒😒😒😒Just look at how Malfoy tries to call Hermione a mudblood every time he sees her to try and get under her skin. Snape as I remember was barely tolerated and he was a half blood. That's why he clung so hard to his mother's bloodline. “The Half Blood Prince” so no one will remember his filthy muggle father. The exact same thing Tom Riddle did. Hermione as a muggleborn would not have been tolerated at all. Even if she has excellent grades, all ppl will see is her muggle heritage. Heck, the Slytherins did this even when she was in Gryffindor.
