The twins are one of those weird hybrids. They could do well in any house.

- Cunning/Ambition/Resourcefulness/Fraternity - Joke shop and all of their pranks. Wanting to become Marauders 2.0.
- Diligence/Loyalty/Kindness/Tolerance - They got what they had by working for it and building it up slowly. If you became a friend of theirs, they would bend over backwards for you. They are Hufflepuffian with their tolerance though. Well, they were pretty tolerant of their mother. That should make them the hufflepuffiest of hufflepuffs.
- Intellect/Creativity/Wit/Originality - Pranks. Says it all right there.
- Brave/Daring/Nerve/Courage - P R A N K S. Dumbledores Army. Order of the Phoenix. Final Battle.
