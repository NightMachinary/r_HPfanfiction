I recently thought that Fred and George would have made very interesting Ravenclaws. I used to think with all their sneaking, scheming, and developing pranks and their strong ambitions to start their own joke shop that it would have allowed them a decent fit in Slytherin. Though of course the disregard for the rules, not being afraid of the possible consequences, and going against their mother's wishes so strongly has its obvious Gryffindor sides as well.

So, why Ravenclaw, you might wonder... The twins are witty and have creativity in spades. They invented so many sellable items! They conducted tests like crazed wizard scientists, tinkered out their products to a good, standard, and reliable quality, started a new subspecies, and managed to invest the money Harry gave them responsibly. As much as Ravenclaw gets admired for its academics, the house is also known for creativity, wit, individuality, and originality. I would argue that the twins possess all of these traits. Yes, including individuality. They have each other and are clearly fond of their family, but they also differ from their family. Molly kept comparing them to their older brothers, remember, and how Bill, Charlie, and Percy never got in as much mischief as them. Not to mention that neither of them became Prefect while all their other brothers did (and Molly casually overlooking this), and not even trying to "fit in" by doing great on all their OWLs. And we obviously see how Fred and George differ from their peers as well.

Of course the twins are also intelligent, despite not testing well or particularly caring for standardized academics. Besides, I think it would have appealed to them as a great joke to be in Ravenclaw with all their other siblings in Gryffindor, too. They'd certainly be able to see the humour in that. :)
