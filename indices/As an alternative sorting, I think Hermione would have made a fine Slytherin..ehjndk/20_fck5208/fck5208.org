I like to think the hat also try's to choose the gose based on what area in thier personality the students want to improve themselves in, or maybe that the hat just listens to the desire of the student in general. If not, I got no clue how crab and goyle didnt wind up in hufflepuff or gryffindor with how they try to act throughout the series.
