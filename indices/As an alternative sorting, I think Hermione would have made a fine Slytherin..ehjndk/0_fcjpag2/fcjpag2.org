I always thought she was better in Hufflepuff. She was very hardworking and her loyalty to her friends was unquestionable.

BUT, her Gryffindor traits dominated her other traits. She was very brave. She set Snape's robes on fire in first year, who was most scary professor in Hogwarts. And in a dialogue in first book tells us why she was Gryffindor.

  Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.

  /"Hermione!"/

  "Harry - you're a great wizard, you know."

  "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things --- friendship and *bravery* and --- oh Harry --- be /careful/!"

It shows us that she valued bravery and friendship more than anything, so there was no question why she was in Gryffindor
