I see the Weasleys, otherwise, no to all of it, and this is why I generally dislike alternative sortings. Hermione does have very ruthless qualities but the reasons Ron didn't like her at first would be 100x more offensive to Slytherins. SPEW and DA are morally driven, and she goes about it with no thought to the harm to herself. Harry isn't ambitious, but his sneaky rule-breaking behavior especially in the first few books is definitely 50/50 Gryffindor-Slytherin. Malfoy doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve, Harry generally socializes with the very pro-muggleborn side. We don't know what Ravenclws, etc generally thought about these issues and being outspokenly bigoted definitely wouldn't hurt him considering the social circles he ran in.
