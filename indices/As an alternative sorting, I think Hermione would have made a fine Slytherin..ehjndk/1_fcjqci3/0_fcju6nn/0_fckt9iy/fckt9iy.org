For some reason, I always got the impression that Draco's previous attempts to kill Dumbledore were purposefully bad. Like I always thought that he was procrastinating as much as possible, but in order to make it seem like he was on top of everything to his parents and the other Death Eaters, he had to at least make some effort to kill dumbles. But since he was seemingly reluctant to finish the task (if the sobbing in the bathroom scene is any indication), he didn't actually try very hard. So to me, I thought it was actually a pretty clever thing for him to give the poisoned mead to Slughorn, as it meant 1) the DEs know he's trying to kill dumbles 2) Slughorn is probably going to drink it, as you said, and 3) Slughorn is like the most likely person at Hogwarts to have a bezoar or antidote close by, and therefore the least likely to actually be harmed.
