The sorting is about value as well as personality. Hermione herself, if I'm not mistaken, says she values bravery above all else. Yes, she could've, in theory, done well in Slytherin. Draco Malfoy, in theory and reality, would not have done well in Gryffindor.

Also, most characters could've fit in a different house. I think JKR, despite making Slytherin bad for most, did give us varying personalities in every house (though housemates are kinda similar). Only TMR and Slughorn fit perfectly.

Pretty sure you could be describing Hermione here if you change the hes and his to shes and hers. Snape also fits.

  crappy at making up a cohesive plan

Draco lured Harry and Ron to the Trophy Room and didn't show up. The bottle of mead plan was actually pretty good and he managed to get a bunch of Death Eaters in the school.

I implore you to read HBP and DH again. He also goes out of his way to ignore or bend a rule in every book.

  Dumbledore doesnt really strike me as Gryffindor
#+end_quote

He's a century's old politician. It would be weird if he was. His younger self was kind, ambitious, loyal, intelligent, and arrogant. That describes half the characters.

  Percy, Fred and George would have all done well in Slytherin
#+end_quote

They're ambitious, yeah, but so is Ron. One just lacks the drive. I don't see how you can look at Harry and call him a Gryffindor through and through and not feel the same about Fred and George. At their core they're not that different.

TL;DR yeah, I think, in theory, she could've done well in Slytherin.

Edited some spelling.
