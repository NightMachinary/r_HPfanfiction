One of the first fics I ever read was Riley's Pawn to Queen. Since then I've had this notion that Hermione would have become BFFs with a Slytherin girl if not for the troll in the toilet.

That fic's Slyffindor Seven was a power crew that made everyone examine what House divisions really meant, and how we really /shouldn't/ let House affiliation get in the way of a quality friendship or alliance.

The fic is pretty dated, and unfinished, and involves sexual content that is probably against the rules of this sub to link, but it was a fic that rather /established/ a bunch tropes and really opened up a lot of people to the mixed bag qualities of Slytherin House.

It was also influenced by Anne Bishop, not quite a crossover, but if anyone recognizes the idea of witch v Witch from the Black Jewels, hmu via dm and I'll see if I can find this old gem and its parody fic too ;)
