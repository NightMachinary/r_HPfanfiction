I already did imagine how they go dark in my script and they go extremely deep in there:

To keep it short it's an AU where a Gryffindor's dark wizard rise, he get so pissed off at Voldemort and the DE that his main goal is wiping off every singles Slytherins of Earth, Slytherins are the embodiment of evil and must be purged. This dark wizard will brainwashed Hogwart's students into hating this house and he'll use Harry as a weapon against Voldemort. At the beginning, Harry doesn't really buy the whole "kill all slytherins and this world will change for the better"... However when he was held captive in the Malfoy's manor during the horcrux hunt, Bellatrix killed Hermione which caused both Harry and Ron to go insane and slaughter every single DE in the manor while a terrified Luna watch. They fully embrace the anti slytherin bias afterward.

I was inspired by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][this]] fic.
