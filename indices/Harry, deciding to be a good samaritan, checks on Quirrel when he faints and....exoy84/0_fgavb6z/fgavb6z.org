"Professor Quirrel; are you alright?" Harry asked as he put his hand on the professor's neck to see if his pulse was steady. As soon as he touched the professor's skin he retrieved his hand as if burned.

Quirrel neck started to turn to ash as he screamed from the pain. Another scream joined the first one but this was one of rage.

"Kill him fool! What are you doing?" A high pitched voice came from under the turban. "I will kill you myself Potter." Quirrel's hand reached for his wand as Harry kicked his hand to stop it from happening.

As his vessel's body started to continue to crumble Voldemort abandoned it and appeared as a wraith. "Harry Potter I will make you suffer as I have suffered this past decade. And when you beg me to let you die I will grant you the privilege to be killed by me, Lord Voldemort." The wraith screamed as it fled away from Dumbledore who was quickly approaching with his wand drawn.

There was silence in the great hall as Harry turned around and saw everyone staring at him. He gulped as he saw the teachers coming closer. He turned on his heels and ran as fast as he could. He did not mean for this to happen. He did not want to kill him. They were going to send him to jail or worse expel him from school and make him live with the Drusleys. He could not let that happen. He will not let this happen. He had to run away but how?
