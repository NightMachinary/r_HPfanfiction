It was only Harry's second die of Hogwarts and he was still very nervous. He was in an entire new world after all. Of course his luck came about when he left for the bathroom during Charms.

Hogwarts is a castle full of corners and it was bound to happen that he run into someone as he quickly walked to the bathroom. How unfortunate that it had to be a professor.

"I'm so sorry sir, are you okay?" Harry asked the turban wearing professor. Harry was only small and the crash hadn't been big yet here the professor was screaming in pain.

Harry tried to help him up, he gently grabbed the mans hand and shoulder to guide him to his feet. Yet the only response was more screaming. Harry felt more than saw the mans hamd turn to ash in his grip. The professor screamed louder and pushed Harry away.

The day couldn't have gotten worse Harry thought but he was very wrong. It was never a good idea to get stuck on a wall when Dudley was beating you up. Instincts made Harry bounce off the wall and trip over the professor on the ground. Harry tumbled over and landed on top of the screaming man. In a small struggle for Harry to get off the man and stand up which took about ten seconds when you factor strange new robes Harry had never worn before into the equation.

When he finally stood again the screaming had stopped. Now all that remained of the unknown professor was a pile of ash, it seemed his clothes had burnt too. Harry stared at his hands in amazement and no small amount of fear.

Foot steps fell loudly as Professor Mcgonogall walked very quickly around the corner, she would never run. She stopped when she found Harry stood still and slowed her pace.

"Mr Potter, what on earth was that screaming?" She asked, her accent thick in the stressful situation.

"Came from around the corner professor." Harry replied as he continued to stare at his hands.
