Really? I feel like if a story has anything to do with Aurors, even if they are only mentioned once in 400k words, Master Auror Connie Hammer makes an appearance. Has to be in hundreds, if not thousands of fics I have read.

And to add to the topic, her first appearance in HP fanfiction has to be pre-2004, because I read a fic from back then a few months ago and she featured in it too.
