Most Auror related fanfiction I read are mostly post-Hogwarts, maybe she died on the battle of Hogwarts? :))

Honestly, four auror that I noticed to always appear are Dawlish, Savage, Proudfoot, and Gawain Robards; either on Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts stories. All of them are canon though, so that's understandable.

Can you give me some example where she showed up?
