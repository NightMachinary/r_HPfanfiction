I am regretful that JKR didn't take a page from Stephanie Meyers (bleah) and write alternate views of canon occurrences. Go back over the seven years, each from the perspective of a different canon, background character. Could have been a lot of fun, let the readers see more of the wider world, added some interesting perspective on what happened.

Ah, well, that's what fanfiction is for.
