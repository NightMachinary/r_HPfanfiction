Theodore Nott is very close to a blank slate, but is a popular supporting character for many fanfics. (Rowling on the old site said she had a ton of notes about him but wasn't able to fit a scene into the books.)

Sally-Anne Perks and Su Li, when they rarely pop up, are always shy.

We see a bit more of Blaise Zabini, Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones in canon. They've definitely taken on personalities of their own in the fandom though.

For some reason, Lisa Turpin is always the go-to Ravenclaw girl, but we haven't agreed on a personality (or even a blood-status) for her yet. Odd since we see a lot more of Padma Patil in canon.
