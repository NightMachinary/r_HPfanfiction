Regulus Black and Blaise Zambini Both of these characters have really consistent chatacterization even though you get very little chatacterization on Blaise and like no characterization on Regulus minus his note and the story behind it.

I like both but i think its interesting. As opposed to say Theodore Nott who gets more of a variety in his depictions.
