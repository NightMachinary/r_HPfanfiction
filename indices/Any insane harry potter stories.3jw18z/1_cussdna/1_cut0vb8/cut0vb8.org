I recently read Control, it is an incredibly good story, I wish there were more like it. Almost all other Dark!Harry or Evil!Harry fails to actually provide a good story and is instead about Harry doing amoral things.

Also one of my favorite things about the story was Tracey Davis, holy shit the characterization and interaction was wonderful. I'd read 500k words of just dialog between her, Daphne and Harry.
