linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][A second link in case the command doesn't work]]

It might be a crackfic but it's definitely an insane Harry story. The idea behind it is that when Voldemort turned Harry into a horcrux the horcrux took over Harry's mind and assumed control.

Edit: Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] is a really good one. It fits what you're looking for perfectly. Idea behind it is that Harry gets voluntarily possessed by a fallen angel at age 8ish and escapes the Dursleys. It's a really great read. It's sequels aren't as good imo, but they're still worth reading. It's sequels are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856581/1/The-Denarian-Knight][The Denarian Knight]] and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord][Denarian Lord]]. All of them are crossovers with the Dresden Files, but you don't need any knowledge about that to enjoy the stories and know what's going on.
