Yeah, maybe they realise that they need Harry's power to take on Voldemort, so they find [[/spoiler][Natasha]] and use them to influence Harry and that's when they have their confrontation. Hell maybe they are starting to Win, Harry is inflicting heavy losses on Voldemort's forces so they allow him to meet [[/spoiler][Natasha]] as a reward. They have their confrontation and Harry starts to question himself, his, already limited, sanity starts to slip away. Harry is less effective in combating Death Eaters, the Ministry is taking more losses cause Harry is off his game. So they try to force [[/spoiler][Natahsa]] into taking back the fact that they don't like what Harry did, so that Harry will be back on Death Eater killing peak. That way the story has cool bad-ass Harry killing Death Eaters. As well as a desperate Ministry willing to do anything, and also a moral sub-plot with [[/spoiler][Natasha]] trying to decide if the ends justified the means, while Harry has the same sort of moral conundrum. But I really think that to end this story Harry would have to die. He did horrible things in Too Young to Die, and he [[/spoiler][faced justice in the end, being put in Azkaban]]. But then in the sequel it gets glossed over and he's put to use and kinda forgiven because he's useful. So he would have to die to appropriately be "punished & redeemed".

Still could work really well, and now I kinda want to read it.
