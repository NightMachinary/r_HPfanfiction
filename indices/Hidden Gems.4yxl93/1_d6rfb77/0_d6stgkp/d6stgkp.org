I think that a sequel would ruin it. Or if they did a sequel it would have to focus on [[/spoiler][the newly resurrected Natasha]]. And them facing the reality of what Harry did. Maybe eventually meeting Harry and [[/spoiler][Natasha]] confronting Harry about everything he did, and Harry being confused, [[/spoiler][Harry going all "I did this for you"]].

Basically the main focus shouldn't be on Harry.
