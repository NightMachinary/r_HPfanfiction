It was the name of a Roman emperor, so it fits with the pureblood naming conventions of being pretentious as heck. It also sounds cooler than Harold, and both start with Ha with an R in there somewhere.

Tbh, I'm guessing someone wrote a pureblood fic using it at some point and the name just caught on for lack of better options.
