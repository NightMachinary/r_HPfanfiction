Petunia calling it a “nasty, common name” is irony: the reader is supposed to be aware that it is obviously not true, to be familiar with Prince Harry for example, and to read “Dudley” (and “Vernon” and “Petunia”) as... well, common and nasty. It's all very “[[http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/john_betjeman/poems/785][Phone for the fish knives]]”.

And yes, I've never got why people would think “Harold” would be reasonable. That's barely a step-up from “Neville”.
