Or concluding that the Windsors are common. One of the stereotypes around the lower middle classes who strive to be considered proper (‘non-U' and all that) is that they get it all backwards: they think ‘serviettes' is better than ‘napkins', and ‘pardon' better than ‘what', and so simultaneously mark themselves as non-U while reading the U as unspeakably crass.

There was genuinely some stuff a decade or so ago about the Windsors being a bit common, though, with the Queen using tupperware and things like that. Germanic johnny-come-latelies to the native aristocracy, or something along those lines.

But seriously, Petunia will probably have gone a bit red and then continued to maintain that Harry's name was common while ‘Dudley' was a strong, respectable name. It's hard to know how much cognitive dissonance is involved, and how much social incompetence.
