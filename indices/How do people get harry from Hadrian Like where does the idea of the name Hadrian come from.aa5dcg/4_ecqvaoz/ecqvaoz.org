From what I've seen, people go for a longer name that could believably be nicknamed to Harry when writing lord Potter/dark Harry/pureblood politics kind of fanfics. Hadrian is actually one of the better names that pop up in those, and one that I actually like - I cannot take seriously fics when Harry's 'full name' is Harridan or Haraldr. Seriously, both of them appear more than just a few times x.x
