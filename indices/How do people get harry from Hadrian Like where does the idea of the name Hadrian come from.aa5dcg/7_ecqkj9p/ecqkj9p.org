I'm writing a Hadrian right now!

Fics that I've read with Hadrian are where Harry has to ditch his original name for a disguise. I read a lot of time travel. Thus Hadrian Evans is born! It's close enough to Harry but still different.

Mine is because of a smilair reason (it's fine travel, kind of) where one Hadrian Peverell is hosting the memories of future Harry Potter. The names are similar because they are connected or some shit lmao
