If you want Harry to have a more fancy name Hadrian works quite well as it starts with the same two letters and Hadrian was a Roman emperor and Roman names are used for other characters too (Severus, Lucius etc).

Mist of the fics where Harry is short for Hadrian also have him as "lord Potter" so a roman emperor name fits with the persona.

Also Harry is usually short for Harold. Hadrian is a sexier name while it still being plausible that Harry could be a nickname.
