Even if it makes sense, I hate it when I see it in fics now. I've read through too many that use this convention where the author takes themself way to seriously while trying and failing to write something deep and meaningful. Wisdom and elegance only work when the person isn't trying to look wise or elegant. When it's forced the character just ends up looking like a tool. I'm off topic now... I just don't like seeing hadrian anymore, but it's not because I dislike the name.
