I'd recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Existence after Life by cygnus crux) and three sequels for original, expansive worldbuilding in the very early days of fanfiction (the series began being posted on FFN in early 2002).

Most of the original cast of authors from fanficauthors.net (Jeconais, Full Pensieve, Ruskbyte, Crys, Copperbadge, Kokopelli, Abraxan, Draco664, etc.) had their heyday in the 2002-2005 time frame. Much of that work holds up reasonably by today's standards.
