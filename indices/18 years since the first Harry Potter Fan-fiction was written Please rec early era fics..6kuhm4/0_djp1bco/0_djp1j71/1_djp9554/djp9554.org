I read it fairly early on in my fanfic days and it was passable. It features Harry training himself in a magical trunk (that I think he buys from Diagon Alley) that allows him to train at something like an hour's training for every two minutes in the trunk. He trains the DA as well I think. Then he has a few battles and the fic gets abandoned.

Probably would be horrific to read now but may be ok.
