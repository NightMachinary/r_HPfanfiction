You should read /Angry Harry and the Seven/ by Sinyk. Pretty much every story he's written is hands down the most cliched writing I've ever read on this fandom.

Amazingly enough, the plot is actually have decent if you remember that the author is buried in cliches from head to toe.

Let's do a checklist with Angry Harry.

Harry hates Dumbledore? Check!

Harry gets pissed off at Dumbledore and gets away with it? Check!

Harry brings the full might of his fame on Dumbledore? Check!

Harry is betrothed to Daphne Greengrass, who initially hates him? Check!

Harry and Daphne eventually make up? Check!

Harry and Daphne fuck by third year? Check!

Harry and his minions fuck over anyone who has wronged Harry? Check!

Harry is a Gary Sue? Check!

Harry kicks Voldemort's ass in the Graveyard? Check!

Voldemort is a retarded idiot? Check!

Are the antagonists incompetent! Check!

Does Harry roflstomp every antagonist? Check!

Does Harry make Grindelwald's happily ever after look tame? Check!

Does Harry become a leader in the wizarding world for decades to come? Check!

Yeah. That's what all of Sinyk's stories are like.

I assume Harry Potter and the Power of Time roughly equates this checklist?
