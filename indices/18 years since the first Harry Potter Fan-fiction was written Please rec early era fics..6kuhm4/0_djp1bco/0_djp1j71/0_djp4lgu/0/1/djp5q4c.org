Some of them, but not all of them. This one was Canon through OotP. I think this was before the Daphne Greengrass craze. Started summer after Sirius died with a depressed Harry. He got better. I think friendly goblins and a 20k word shopping trip. I believe there was a super trunk. He is super rich. Bought a whole floor of a muggle apartment building. Put it under the fidelious himself. Oh time turner played a roll so he could train all summer I think. Or something. Was Harry/Ginny. Manipulative Dumbledore, but not evil. I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. I last read it like a decade ago (Jesus, I'm old) when it updated.
