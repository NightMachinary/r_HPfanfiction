This is my favorite early fic: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html]]

It's from 2003, which means it's obviously not totally canon compliant. But it does a surprisingly good job considering how old it is. I'm not sure how much of my fondness is nostalgia, and how much of is based on its merits. Either way, the author does do banter quite well.
