I tried reading the psychic serpent and it isn't very good. I am new to the fandom, therefore have no nostalgia for the old stories and my opinion on the old fics is based solely on the writing. The plot was fine but the writing is poor to middling. It seemed as if an inexperienced juvenile was writing. I didn't read the entire fic, only the first third so I don't know if the writing improved.
