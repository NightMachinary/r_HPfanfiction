I remember I read those, and I remember I liked them enough that I sought out the third one because it wasn't on ff.net when I was reading it? Or the finished one wasn't? Anyway, I don't remember what it's about, but I have vague memories of it being pretty good, and getting better with each book. Take of that what you will.
