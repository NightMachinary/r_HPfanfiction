Interesting. The earliest I've read is 2002 or 2003, I think. Will edit post if I find any good ones.

EDIT

So I spent some time looking around. Found an author who's been writing since 2001. Skimmed over his earlier stories, which I have linked, and they seem decent. Since I've already linked them all, I might as well attempt to read them in full. Hopefully they've aged decently enough to where I won't be closing the tab faster than I can say the light charm.

To those who have read these stories in full - are they any good? How have they aged?

The author stopped writing in 2003, but picked up the series that makes up the above stories again in 2015, and is actively updating.

EDIT 2

Still looking around the stories posted pre-2003 for any good ones.
