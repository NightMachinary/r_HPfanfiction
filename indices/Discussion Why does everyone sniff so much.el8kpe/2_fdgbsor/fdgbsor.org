I'd never considered it, but it could be a very British thing to do. Sniffing rather than scoffing has a certain upper-class feel to it -- a wordless noise of disapproval but less uncouth than scoffing -- and personally I can easily imagine the tone and expression someone has when they're expressing scorn this way, even if I can't explain it well.
