I don't think it's meant to be about inhaling or exhaling. Have you heard the expression “turned their nose up”? I think that the way that “sniffed” is used is to convey this expression because that facial expression is the same when sniffing and for looking down on something. That's just my interpretation at least. Overuse is simply due to lack of vocabulary or knowledge of other ways to write a scene.
