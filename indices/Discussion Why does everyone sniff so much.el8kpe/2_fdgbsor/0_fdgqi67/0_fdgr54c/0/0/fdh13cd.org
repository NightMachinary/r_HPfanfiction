Oh, smell has nothing to do with it. It's very much an affected reaction, something done intentionally for its effect, though there could be an underlying implication that the thing is so bad as to give an unpleasant whiff. It's also a short sniff, usually with a curl of the lip, sometimes accompanied by a 'hmph' of disapproval. And in England, it does very much have the connotations of turning one's nose up at something; someone sniffing derisively at something is saying 'this thing is beneath me', possibly even 'this thing is so far beneath me it's not even worth a scoff'.
