I'm a journalist in the Navy. When we had to go through our A School to learn newswriting, almost every single one of us tried to use words other than "said". But "said" is often the most appropriate verb to use, and the least intrusive during exposition.

Most of us feel about "said" the same way we feel about seeing our nose, feeling our tongue, or breathing: if we don't overthink it, it's not an issue.
