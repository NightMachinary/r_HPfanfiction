I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] has quite a bit of what you want, but I'm not entirely sure, so don't take my word for it.

Aside from that, there's linkao3(1149623), "Disillusion, by Hermione Granger", and linkffn(5492188), "Doubting Thomas", for oneshots that work with muggles/are anti-pureblood (respectively).
