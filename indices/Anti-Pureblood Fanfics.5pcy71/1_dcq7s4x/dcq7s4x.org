[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]] may be the kind of story you are looking for. It features a Harry raised by muggles to help them drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming into the modern age after a fed up Margret Thatcher meets a squib soldier. It is however on going, though it seems to be updating with a fair amount of frequency.

A recently finished truly excellent story where Harry and Sirius turn to HRH Elizabeth II for aide and get it and more. Doesn't go the full distance of muggle/wizarding integration, but it does show purebloods getting the massive beating they justly deserve. The legal stuff and portrayal of the queen seems to be spot on to me, and the writing is top notch.
