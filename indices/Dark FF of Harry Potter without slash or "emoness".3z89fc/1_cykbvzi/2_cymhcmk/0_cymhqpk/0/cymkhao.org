Wrong boy who lived? Not sure

That's why it'd be a unserious one! I find some of the most ridiculous ones hilarious to read - I just finished Make a Wish. I found myself giggling externally, and that's rare.

Maybe Snape polyjuices himself as part of an undercover op, and finds himself trapped, and can't escape without blowing his cover? I don't know, I can't write haha
