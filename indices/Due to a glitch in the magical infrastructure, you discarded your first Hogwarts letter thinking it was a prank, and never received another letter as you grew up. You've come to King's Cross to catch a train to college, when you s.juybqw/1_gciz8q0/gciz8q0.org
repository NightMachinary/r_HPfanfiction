Turns out Hogwarts only let's people start at age 11 and there's no formal magical training available.

You may be a mage, but you'll have to teach yourself. Also, wands and books don't come cheap and like all students, you're broke.

To make things worse, the wizarding world seems to have some sort of dark lord problem at the moment so evil wizard attack is a legitimate concern.

Do you buy some more spell components and practice magic in secret after your mundane classes? Finally drop out of your mundane degree and start learning magic full time? Accept that with great power comes great responsibility and live out your dreams of being a superhero?

Or just blow this weeks earnings from your part time job stacking shelves at the pub with your friends.
