I just finished a story where somehow Harry could not be tracked by the magical community after the Dursley moved so he grows up as a Muggle, and one day while going to work at 16/17, he his stopped by Hermione and Co. and they tell him that he is a wizard and in danger because death eaters are looking for him. Ensue an Harry on the run, learning magic and plotting to overthrow the government.
