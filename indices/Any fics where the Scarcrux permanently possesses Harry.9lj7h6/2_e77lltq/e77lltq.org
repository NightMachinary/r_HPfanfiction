linkffn(Strange and Invisible History) is fantastic. It's very well written (and complete). Harry gets possessed by Voldemort in the Philosopher's Stone debacle, and Voldemort basically takes over. It's written very GoT-esque. Unfortunately the sequel seems to be abandoned.

Hermione is the main character. Harry doesn't recover, he's permanently Voldemort.
