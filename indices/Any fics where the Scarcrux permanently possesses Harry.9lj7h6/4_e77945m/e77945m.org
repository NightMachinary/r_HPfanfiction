Harry basically is Voldemort in this one, though it's a crack comedy. Some people don't like it, but it's the funniest thing I've ever read. I don't remember, it might not even have been specifically said, if Voldemort's soul completely took over Harry's body or if it's just that Harry gained all of Voldemort's memories at an age where he had no personality of his own, but it comes out to the same thing.
