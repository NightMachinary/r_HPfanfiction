#+begin_quote
  Non-canon compliant, sort-of retelling, of Half-Blood Prince. But with Hermione Granger as the main character.Hermione Granger seeks to navigate her 6th year after sending her parents to Australia with new memories. Minerva McGonagall is finding recovering from "the stunner incident" a difficult and long-winded task. Hermione helps her heal and finds a new book, filled with comments about Transfiguration and after one too many nasty remarks nearly kills another student with one of the spells within. With Professor McGonagall in charge of her punishment, will things sour? Or will they discover that family is what you make of it and perhaps they just might come through this war in one piece. Together.
