How about all of the above? Depending on thickness of the armor, some of them (like dragon hide) would be very unbendy, and horrible for joints, so i would say depending on heaviness and how they each stack up to different spells (thickness x spell resistance) nundu hide for joints, gloves and such. Basilisk (because of colour) as a vest/undershirt and pants. Dragon for pauldrons, shin protectors, bracers etc.

Tl:dr flexible material as clothing and in joints, hard material as serious protection over that. (Think knight)
