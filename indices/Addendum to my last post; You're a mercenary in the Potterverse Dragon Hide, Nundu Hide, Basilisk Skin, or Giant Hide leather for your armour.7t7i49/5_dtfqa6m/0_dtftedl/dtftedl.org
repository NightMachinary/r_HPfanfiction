Sirius studied the reports from the North Pole. It boiled down to three data points:

Basilisk Skin armour was the strongest but too thick and unwieldy.

Dragon Skin armour was light and incredibly resistant and could he hinged properly.

Nundu Hide armour was deficient in gross protection comparatively but had an interesting property. If attuned to a wearer, it acted as the hide did on the animal: stealthy, reflective of non-lethal spells(a too strong lancing pierce had cut right through it and removed a researcher's arm), and could be induced to mimic other materials.

As he read, he had a mental image and grinned. A hastily penned memo was sent back to the North Pole.

⁂

Head Researcher and former Unspeakable Hamish Doright idly watched his assistant, Glenda Goodwitch, as she cleaned up the broken vase. The room they were in was completely proofed from magic so she was currently bent over sweeping up the shards, shaking the best looking arse Hamish had seen outside muggle pornography. He tore his gaze away when she started to stand and didn't notice the smirk on her face.

A tap at the door and she opened it to find her assistant, Sara Leigh, holding a missive from Sirius. "The big boss had an idea."

She took the note and brought it over to Hamish, bending over more than necessary to put it on the desk in front of him, showing off her lack of of undergarments. Hamish blushed and she grinned.

She was going to marry him no matter what it took.

Hamish pushed the thought of Glenda underneath his desk and read the letter. He laughed and went to do as ordered.

⁂

Harry saw the mark of the Academy on the box and, after verifying it with his glasses' verification mode, he opened the box.

As soon as his fingernail broke through the spellotape, the box burst open in a bout of fireworks and somethign white flashed past as Harry thought Sirius promised to stop doing that!

His vision was obscured as he felt something wrap around his leg. Then his arm. Then his waist. And his other leg. And the other arm was wrapped in a cool embrace. His vision was obscured again and then he could see but something was pressing against his face.

After a long moment, the students watching what was happening to Harry burst into raucous laughter. The third year student was covered in a nundu hide and head, cut and tailored to fit the boy.

A letter appeared in front of Harry and Hermione grabbed it, as she, Licorice, and Sophie giggled as Harry sighed at the humiliation.
