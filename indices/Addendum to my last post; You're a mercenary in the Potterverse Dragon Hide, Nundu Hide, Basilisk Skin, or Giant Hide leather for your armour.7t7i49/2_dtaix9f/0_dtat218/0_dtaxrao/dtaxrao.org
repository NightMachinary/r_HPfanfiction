Yes, but it is the magical resistance we are talking about here I'm fairly sure. The ability to resist 50+ stunners at once is far greater than a dragons, though again we don't know how good a basilisks skin would be. Maybe it /is/ better than a nundu's skin, but we probably will never know for sure.

Also, as far as not being able to kill a basilisk... it depends on the situation, but just aim a ton of machine guns in its general direction, as well as a few RPGs. lol. Or with time to prepare, I'm sure people could get a sonar system for a basilisk. And of course there is the canon method of recruiting Fawkes, though that only works before 6th year. hmmm... I wonder if theres any giant (and entirely blind) bats that are the mortal enemy of basilisks lmao, or maybe some deep sea horror.
