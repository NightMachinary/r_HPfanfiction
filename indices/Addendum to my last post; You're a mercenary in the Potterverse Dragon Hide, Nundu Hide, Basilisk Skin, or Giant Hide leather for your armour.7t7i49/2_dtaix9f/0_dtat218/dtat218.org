It takes 100 wizards to subdue one (as in stunning or otherwise taking it alive), which does not mean killing it is difficult. NBC gear and a good rifle will make dealing with a Nundu easy but good luck trying to deal the instant mortal gaze of a Basilisk, which also happens to fry optical systems.
