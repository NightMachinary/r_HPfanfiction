Like, we can just choose one? Because the nundu and basilisk skin ones would be wayyyy more expensive than dragonhide. IDK about giants, because 1. they are sapient, and 2. I think there might have been laws protecting them? and 3. they are endangered regardless of whether it is legal, so it would be more expensive than dragonhide, but I dunno how much compared to the other 2. Anyway, dragonhide would be by far the cheapest, so unless I'm a rich mercenary...

As far as actual protection goes, its likely the nundu is the best, since 100 wizards are needed to take one down; it seems unlikely that they need that many wizards just to cast some wind spells to keep the breath away from them. After that it would be giant hide or basilisk skin because Hagrid, a half giant, took 6 stunners with no effect, while dragons are taken down by 6 or above. Basilisks we don't really know how effective their skin is, so it could be above or below dragonhide.
