If I was a time traveler I'd definitely write everything down that I knew and that I needed to accomplish. But then I'd put a TON of spells on my notebook so no one but me could read it. And if someone did bypass my spells I'd just play it off that one of my elderly relatives was a Seer who gave me this information before they died so I could try and change things.
