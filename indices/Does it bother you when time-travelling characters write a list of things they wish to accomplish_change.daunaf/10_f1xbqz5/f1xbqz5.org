As with most things, it's not a bad idea, but can be poorly executed.

A list helps you to organise your thoughts, sort tasks by importance, chronological order etc, mark things off as you go, keep an idea of your total progress and prevents you forgetting anything.

Provided you actually do more than write

1. Kill Voldemort
2. Free Sirius
3. ????
4. Profit!

And you don't write it in plain english with "Harry's time travel plans" at the top and leave it in the common room, I think it's fine.
