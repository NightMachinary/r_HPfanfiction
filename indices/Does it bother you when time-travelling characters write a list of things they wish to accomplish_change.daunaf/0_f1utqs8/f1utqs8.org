... didn't you just answer your own question? Same reason you write grocery lists: to remember what you need to do.

Frankly, if you don't have a detailed, written plan for something as far-reaching and which involves so many moving parts as changing the past, you are not the kind of person who should be entrusted with that power in the first place. "Relative secrecy" is meaningless when the Wizard world has mind-reading, truth serums, and compulsion spells up the wazoo.
