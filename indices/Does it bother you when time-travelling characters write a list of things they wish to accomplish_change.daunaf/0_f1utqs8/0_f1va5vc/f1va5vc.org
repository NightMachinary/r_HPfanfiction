Yeah, I think a lot of the goes back really far into the past stories make such a big deal of the preparation and planning work required to go back that /not/ making a grocery list would be completely out of character.

I'm frankly not buying a character that spends 20 years working out how to do it and just wings it when they finally pull it off.
