Why? All you need is a list of everyone who has to die so that good people do not have to (Umbridge, Voldemort, the Lestranges and so on), the Horcrux locations and traps as well as a few notes (eg Lockhart = fraud). A good time traveller should be able to resolve the series within a few months, tops.
