Admittedly, when half of the former Death Eaters disappeared within a week, the other half is bound to become suspicious. That's why you prepare a plan with contingencies. But "make sure Bellatrix does not kill Sirius" and "reform the DA" are kinda redundant when the traveller already plans to kill Bellatrix and prevents Voldemort's return by removing the Horcruxes.
