I'd counter that most of the common goals become pointless if you go with the kill list. Bellatrix cannot kill Sirius in the DoM if you kill her in 91. There won't be a DoM battle because the time traveller knows about the trap. So that point is moot. And fake Moody cannot get Cedric to the Graveyard if you get him discovered (and executed by Ministry practice) before Harry starts Hogwarts.
