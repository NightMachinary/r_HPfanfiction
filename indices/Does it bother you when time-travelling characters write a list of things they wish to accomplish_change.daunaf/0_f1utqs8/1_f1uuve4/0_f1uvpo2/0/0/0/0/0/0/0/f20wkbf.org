  And the Death Eaters/Dementors/Ministry will just stand by and allow Harry to execute prisoners?

That is the part where time travel gets morally complicated. Killing child Hitler means killing a child for what he would become without your lethal actions.

Honestly, there isn't a good answer when it comes to morality because you must not put their lives above the ones of their victims on the slim chance you manage to change them as that puts every bit of suffering they cause on you.

That being said, the magical world has the death penalty. And Harry coming from after the war will be hardened by it and come with a decade of combat experience, so from his PoV killing the people he has been fighting for a decade will be the obvious solution.
