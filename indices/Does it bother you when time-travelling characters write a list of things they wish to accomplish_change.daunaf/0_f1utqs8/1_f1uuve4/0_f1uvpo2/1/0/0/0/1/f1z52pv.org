Although that could be a funny fic. Get one of those "Bigger on the inside" trunks and turn it into a library filled with everything the time traveller thought was relevant. Not just the notes on what will happen, that's only a small portion of the library, but things like potion recipes, and the schedule for this one janitor in Sweden. A bunch of seemingly random things (possibly including decoys in case they're discovered) that only the time traveller can make sense of.
