So you think it would be a better idea to have the time traveler wing it off the back of half-assed memories of an incomplete plan which is itself based on unreliable memories? Really? Because that absolutely sounds like the best way to ensure our protagonist forgets about important things like "Save X from dying."

Keep in mind: normal people have notoriously finicky memories. They have problems remembering grocery lists with 10+ items, let alone a sprawling *7 year plan to save the world,* which realistically should have hundreds (thousands) of bullet points. Break out those dividers and highlighters, Hermione.

You don't see how writing down a plan, running it past reliable allies who are decent planners (Dumbledore, Hermione, etc.) to refine it based off their own memories of events, and then following this plan is a much, much better idea than randomly changing things and hoping things turn out better? Because, barring plot armor, that seems like a great way to ensure a Bad End, since Harry's original victory relied on a heck of a lot of luck and coincidence lining up just right.
