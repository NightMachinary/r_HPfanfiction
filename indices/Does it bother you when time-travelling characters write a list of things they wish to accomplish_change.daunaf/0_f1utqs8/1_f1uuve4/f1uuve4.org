I might have expressed that badly, I meant that the character doesn't remember events accurately anyway, even for memories they consider extremely important. Witnesses to 9/11, for example, have experienced changes to their memory of the attack. So technically, that list of based on what they remember wouldn't be factual with regards to what actually occurred... (making the whole thing redundant)
