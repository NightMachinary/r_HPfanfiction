Totally agree. Harry/Ron/... writing a list would be OOC, but I could see Hermione or Snape writing a to do list. Harry's usually not all that prepared or organized, but you could argue that if it's a grown up ending up in their younger version's body, they might have grown more organized over time.

Even though I am a list person and am 80 chapters into a HP time travel story, I haven't had any characters writing a list. I don't see much literary value in writing down a list in the story. It doesn't really add anything to the story.
