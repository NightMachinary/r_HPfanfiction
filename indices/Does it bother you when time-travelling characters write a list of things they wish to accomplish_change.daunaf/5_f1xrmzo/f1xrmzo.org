I personally would not write a list. I would have an entire bloody wall, mind-maps, networks of contacts, about a calendar per significant person, a shelf for bound copies of old newspapers...

I mean, it seems realistic, you're never going to track that stuff, it's hard enough remembering when birthdays are, let alone that one significant day when a particular photo appears in a newspaper or whatever.
