I don't care if they have a list, I just don't want tp read about them writing it or the specifics of what's on it, only referencing it when it's relevant to the story. There could be a whole bunch of things on the list that are irrelevant to the story like "See a Rolling Stones concert" or "Bang a young madame rosmerta" that might have nothing to do with the story and do nothing to inform us about the characters or their motivations that the author might have in their notes but shouldn't be mentioned because it's irrelevant. I nope the fuck out when a story spends a whole chapter going over every bullet point in a 10 page list, it's unnecessary and detracts from a story's pacing.
