Does that happen in a lot fics? The only case I've seen of a time-traveler writing notes for himself was in a fic where he needed to undergo a memory charm to hide the truth of his past from a master legilimens. But it wasn't like the information was unsecured on paper - he set up an elaborate system of wards to hide the words from anyone who didn't know the password.

So I can imagine cases where writing notes could make sense with the plot, but it would be pretty weird if they wrote down blatantly obvious things about their goals without some additional reason for why they wouldn't just remember it on their own.
