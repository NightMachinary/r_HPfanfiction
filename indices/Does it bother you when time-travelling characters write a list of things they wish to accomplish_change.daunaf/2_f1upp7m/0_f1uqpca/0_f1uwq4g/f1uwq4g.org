I think you may have had your thoughts on the subject tainted by the quality of the fics you've read it in. The character making a list of what they need to ensure does/doesn't happen (whether it is written or otherwise) isn't inherently a bad thing, particularly when they go back with a lot to accomplish. Perhaps (like it was said above) you'd prefer it if it had more plot relevance or there were a more unique spin? Maybe your just burnt out from seeing it so many times?
