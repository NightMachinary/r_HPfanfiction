For 3) the gold standard has to be linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels. The first book isn't close to new(ish) but book four is still being written. I can't remember where it starts, but what the author calls "the lower alleys" feature prominently, with excellent detail and wonderful characters.
