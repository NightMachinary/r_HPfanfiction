Oh, I totally didn't think about the maze from the triwizard tournament probably counting as a labyrinth haha. Technically there's not really a difference? But I was thinking things besides the triwizard maze, I guess more of like an exploring mysteries type of theme that has labyrinths involved? And thank you for the rec!
