I'm generally of the view that the spell requires you to place genuine faith/trust in another, so any clever workaround which removes the need for trust and the risk of betrayal would cause the spell to fail.

So I think entrusting the secret to a house-elf is likely fine. It seems likely that house-elves have souls (the secret is hidden inside the soul) and giving a house-elf something of such importance and no one ever figuring it out feeds into the idea that wizards almost always underestimate house-elves. Especially the Death Eaters - they're never going to think that a wizard would trust a house-elf with something so important.

HOWEVER, I doubt you can give the secret to your own house-elf, who is magically bound to be loyal to you. That binding removes the need for trust and thus the spell would fail.
