That's an interesting view and in a way it does make sense. I think it could still work with your house elf though just consider that Dobby and Kreacher were both able to do things against their family that would have been considered as being disloyal. That little bit could be enough to allow the need for trust that you are talking about.

With the flexibility that JKR left us I still like my idea. 😁
