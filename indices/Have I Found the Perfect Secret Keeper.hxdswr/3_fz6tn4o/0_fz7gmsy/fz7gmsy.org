I don't think that a random house elf would work. If the house elf was already bound to a master he would have to give up the secret if his master asks. As the family bond would override Harry's order to tell no one unless he gives permission as Harry is not the House elf's master.

I think something similar could happen to an unbound elf who later becomes bound. If the elf hasn't been abused by this new family eg he likes his family. When the Master goes "I have to find Harry Potter" which the elf overhears the elf is more likely to help his master and go "Tippy knows where Harry Potter is". And then gives up the secret when asked directly.
