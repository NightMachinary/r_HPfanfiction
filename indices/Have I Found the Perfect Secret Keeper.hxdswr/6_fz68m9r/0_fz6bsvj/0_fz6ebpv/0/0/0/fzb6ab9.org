That's just an example. It doesn't have to be rent. It could be X's house that they stay at and are allowed to put under fidelius, even though they don't own it. Like if I owned a home, but let my sibling use it, I would still say "let's go to sibling's new place" and if it was put under fidelius, it would still be fine and I would still be the owner. The fact that there is a discussion means saying "Bill' and Fleur's new place" does not */clearly/* indicate Bill's the owner. You taking it to mean it is their house, fair. But it isn't clearly Bill's house as you initially indicated.
