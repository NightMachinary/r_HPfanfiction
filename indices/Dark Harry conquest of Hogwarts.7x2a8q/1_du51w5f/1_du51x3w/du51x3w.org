  What would have happened if Merlin had never been healed magically after the Dorocha attack? I find it a little convenient that Lancelot manages to set Merlin down by a river where some kind of spirit (Villia) is able to emerge in a bubble and heal him. So, I wrote what might have happened if Merlin had never been healed by magic at all. Warning: Angst may ensue.
