A little self promo ðŸ¤­ If you don't mind Harry/Multi, then you might give this one a go. It is completely unique, I've never found anything else like it. I had been looking for a fic like this, but since I couldn't find any, I wrote one, myself.

Now, I'm just going to tell you about the most common criticism; Harry's reluctance to kill his enemies. It features Harry as a vigilante, but if you go into it, thinking he's going to be killing Death Eaters left and right immediately, you'll be disappointed.

I based my hero! Harry on Peter Parker and Clark Kent, so him going on a killing spree makes no sense. He does get over himself, becomes more ruthless, and evolves into a kind of mix between Pete, Clark, Bruce Wayne and Oliver Queen.
