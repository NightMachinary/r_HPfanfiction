So one of my all time favorites is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] Harry is called Izar in this which takes a bit to get used to. (Slowburn Harry/Voldemort) I highly rec you to check it out. One of the best Death Eater!Harry fics I've read. It has a very interesting plot and plot-twists. Features manipulative!Voldemort, smart!Harry, a good character developement for Harry as well, cool world-building, especially in spell developement, alive Lily and James, Death Eater raids, clashes with competent Aurors.

Minor spoiler alert but an explanation for the premise: So basically Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix. She gives him up to an orphanage. Thus Lord Voldemort never got defeated the first time aroumd, but the Order is still fighting hard against him

I linked the complete fic on ffn above, but an edited version is currently being posted on ao3, chapter by chapter which is that one Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26953177]])

ttps://archiveofourown.org/works/25836640 This one is called "Of Gods and Men" and it's a Sirius/Harry fic In the future a disease called "magical consumption" devours wizards and witches, stealing their magic. And somehow the power get's tranfered to Harry, who tried to kill himself the release it but it doesn't work. So he intends to travel back in tim to let himself being killed by Voldemort during the battle, but somehow he ends up in the marauders era where he is forced to pretend to be a student. MoD Harry. Very good engaging story

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil. Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus I highly rec it as I think you will enjoy this though I'm not quite sure if it's rated M

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Highly rec

When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.
