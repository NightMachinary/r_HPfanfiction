[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/][FF2EBOOK]] might add "ficwad.com" in their sources, in the future. It's on their to-do list, apparently.

I've never used ficwad, so maybe it works now already and didn't update the homepage? Not likely, but you could get in touch with the developers of the webpage to learn about more.
