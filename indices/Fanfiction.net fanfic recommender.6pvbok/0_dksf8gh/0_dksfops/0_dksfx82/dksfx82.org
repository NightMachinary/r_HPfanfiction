Collaborative Filtering is pretty much exactly what I've been doing (forgot the term).

Oh, one thing I do: I only save the 100 stories with the highest s_ij for each story, to reduce the data needed. This makes a lot of the quadratic stuff linear, and allows me to work on all stories.

If you want I can also give you access to my crawled database of FFN, which might make things easier.
