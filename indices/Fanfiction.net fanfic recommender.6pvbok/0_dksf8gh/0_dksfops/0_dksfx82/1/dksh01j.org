  Collaborative Filtering is pretty much exactly what I've been doing
#+end_quote

No, weighted k-nearest-neighbor and Collaborative filtering are different things, and CF is performing statistically better then KNN (unfortunately I can't find link to the paper).

#+begin_quote
  Testing it, your algorithm also seems to be rather conservative and stick to the bigger stories
#+end_quote

Well, tendency to recommend well liked stories isn't bad as long as well liked stories are relevant.

#+begin_quote
  there is also an indication that the recommendation isn't that good, for example it often doesn't predict sequels
#+end_quote

Hmm, you are right about predicting sequels, but I am unsure about how much it's fault of algo, how much of metrics and how much of data. I'll investigate this later. Edit: it doesn't work because sequel has <400 favs.

#+begin_quote
  If you want I can also give you access to my crawled database of FFN
#+end_quote

That would be great.

Can you also give me link to your recommender?
