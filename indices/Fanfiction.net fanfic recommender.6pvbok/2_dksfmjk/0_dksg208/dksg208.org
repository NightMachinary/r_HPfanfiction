  Finding fics based on popularity is a false metric
#+end_quote

It doesn't find fics based on popularity, it finds fics based on people who has favorited stories you like.

  Also, does the 400 threshold mean its never going to pop up with new fics?
#+end_quote

It would pop up with new fics if I update database. For now I have plan to update it monthly but we'll see how things go.
