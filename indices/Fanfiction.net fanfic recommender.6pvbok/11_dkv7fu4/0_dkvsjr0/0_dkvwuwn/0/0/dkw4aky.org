Thank you so much for this. This is exellent. It's a wonder why fanfiction.net doesn't provide something like this. In fact now that I think about it fanfiction.net hasn't really developed any new features in a long time. It's really rather stagnant. It's just that most stories are there.

I would like to request one more feature. That more meta data on the stories be displayed next to them in the results.
