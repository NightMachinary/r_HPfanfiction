I've read something like this before. Is it the same one where Vernon turns into an accidental hero?

Edit: I've found the one I read. It's called Defending Sirius Black by Luiz4200. I haven't read it in years, but I do remember enjoying it at the time.

linkffn(Defending Sirius Black)

Edit (again): It's not nearly as good as I remember. Some of the characters seem more like caricatures of their canon selves whereas others act completely out of character altogether. The transitions from one point of view to the next leaves a lot to be desired and the dialogue is pretty weak. Still, the premise is fun, and if you're into the Dursley's not being abusive guardians, this could be worth the read.
