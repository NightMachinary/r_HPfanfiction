Harry did a quick recap of his actual situation. Sometimes you had to stop to smell the roses. or better yet, sometimes you had to hide behind something and reevaluate your life choices.

Points in his favor: The summoning spell actually worked and his broom came to him. He was unharmed! not on fire or mauled, or torn apart. He was really close to the golden egg.

Points against him: the dragon was faster than expected. The status of his broom was unknown. His glasses were MIA. He couldn't actually move at the moment.

This was the second time in his life that something big and scaly (and scary) snatched him up and wouldn't let him go. It was as unexpected as the first time. When the horntail plucked him from his broom in the middle of a dive, to the horror of the crowd watching in the stands, he expected to be squished like a bug, or roasted in her flames. Instead, she sniffed him a bit (and, oh boy, those FANGS) and after giving him a lick that made his heart stop, his hair stand and his glasses to disappear, shoved him under her right wing and settled over her nest.
