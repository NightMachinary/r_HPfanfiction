I ended up writing for so long this became too long to post, so here it is in 'chapters'

One day when Harry was about 7 years old, the Dursleys have had enough of Harry's freakishness and decide to put and end to it.

Vernon comes home from work one day and acts unusually nice to Harry, smiling at him and even tells him he doesn't need to cook dinner that night, that he brought home Hamburgers for everyone.

Harry is cautious, but starved not just for food, but also emotion, he joins his family for dinner. Dudley reaches to take Harry's burger after devouring his only to have his hand slapped away by his Petunia who encourages Harry to finish up before Dudley does take it. As he is drinking a glass of water, his memory gets foggy and passes out.

Unbeknownst to Harry, Vernon loads Harry into a dishwasher box and drives him out to the docks where a man hands him an envelope of money and puts the box into a shipping container where a number of other children are huddled against the walls. The doors are shut and a crane loads the container onto a departing ship.
