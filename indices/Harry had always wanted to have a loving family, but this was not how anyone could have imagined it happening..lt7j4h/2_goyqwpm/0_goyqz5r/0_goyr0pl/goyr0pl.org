They float for another 2 days when, starving and dehydrated, they wash up on a beach of a tropical island. Crawling up past the beach the found a small pool of water under a banana tree. After drinking, the two took turns throwing rocks at the tree finally knocking down a few bananas. While they are eating, Harry hears a small noise behind him but nothing is there when he looks. After eating, the two fall asleep. When they awake, there are about 2 dozen bananas laying next to them.

For the next few days, they explore the area around the beach, both of them feeling like they are being watched they attempt to get food on their own, succeeding in very small amounts, but when returning to the place they rest, finding fruits and berries, and various bugs which they avoid eating.

That night, Harry is woken by Lyra screaming, she says something about a hairy man who disappeared. Harry calms her down but stays awake the whole night. The next night, he stays up as well and after Lyra falls asleep, he feels a presence, but stays quiet and eventually, he sees what can only be described to him as 2 small men covered in white hair with large eyes creeping into their camp with bushels of bananas. As they are laying them down, Harry sits up and says, "Hello."

Both the small men let out a screech and vanish into thin air. Harry wakes up Lyra and tells her what happened. She scared, but Harry tries to calm her down, with some success telling her they are bringing them the food.

Each night, they try to stay awake and wait for the hairy men, each night trying to greet them, only for them to drop their gifts and disappear. After a week, they realize that it is more than just two different hairy men, but at least 4 or 5 that they've seen based on size and hair color shades. One night, one of the hair men is also carrying a small hairy baby and when they try to greet them, they as usual disappear, but the baby does not and seems to just hover in mid air. It then seems to float away.

Harry grabs Lyra and drags her after the floating hairy baby deeper into the tropical jungle than they have been before. The finally reach a clearing where they see the baby float up into the trees and disappear into the canopy. Not knowing what to do next, they lay down and wait for morning.

When the sun comes out, they can see what look like large nests across the tops of the trees surrounding the clearing and hear noises coming from them, rustling and murmurs. After a few hours, one of the hairy men comes out of a nest and slowly and cautiously climbs down to them. In the daylight, they can see now that it is some kind of monkey, but nothing like what they have ever seen before. It stands up nearly 5 feet tall, with eyes like an owl, hairless hands and feet, and a tail more like a Labrador than a monkey.

They stare at each other for a time before another of the creatures fades into existence next to them causing Lyra the let out a Yelp and both of the creatures vanish. Lyra looks around and apologizes to thin air before kneeling down and crying. Harry moves in to comfort her and as he holds her, a hand fades into existence next to them to hold them both. Then another hand, and another hand, and another; until there are 5 of the creatures offering them some kind of comfort.
