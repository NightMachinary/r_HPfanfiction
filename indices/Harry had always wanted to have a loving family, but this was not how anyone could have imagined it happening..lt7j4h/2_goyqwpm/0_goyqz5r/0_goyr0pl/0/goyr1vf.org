Harry and Lyra spend the next week trying to figure out how to live with the creatures. It is very hard as the smallest noises tend to cause then to vanish, so Harry and Lyra begin to primary communicate with hand gestures. To their surprise and fascination, a few weeks later the creatures begin to mimic their gestures. A kind of communication between them begins as the creatures try to teach them to gather food and build nests.

After a month, a small rumbling can be heard in the distance and one of the creatures begins to glow blue before letting out a loud chirp and the entire clan vanishes. A plane is seen flying over the island and Lyra tries to hide in a small nest she built but it collapses in her struggle to get in. She panics and looks around for a spot to hide while Harry motions her to come to a hole he dug out in the ground as he is not a very good climber. Lyra is frozen in place and just curls into a ball on the ground.... And then vanishes.

After the plane has passed, the creatures come out and walk over to where Lyra disappeared and scoop up an invisible Lyra and hold her, until she fades back into sight. A number of them begin to coo and make happy noises and Harry explains to her that she vanished like they do. When asked, Lyra explains that she was scared more men were coming to take her and she just tried to disappear... And then she did. After another few days, Lyra was able to do it at will.

After another few months, so could Harry.

After a year, the baby they had seen before was almost their own size and could communicate with them in basic hand gestures almost as well as the did with each other. They almost never spoke out loud anymore. One time Harry observed Lyra signing to their young friend that he was a much better brother than her last one.

Occasionally, one of the creatures would glow blue and often times the clan would hide. Sometimes it was because of a plane, others because of a crocodile from a inland lake was venturing near their nest area. One time a large hooded snake came near but Harry simply yelled at it 'GO AWAY' and it left. Harry swore he could hear it say, 'Fine!' as it disappeared into the underbrush.
