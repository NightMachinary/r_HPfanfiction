Years later in a castle, far off in Scotland, a magical quill scribbled green writing onto an envelope. From another room, few pieces of parchment flew into the room, folded themselves in half and slipped into the envelope. A pot of bubbling wax nearby lifted itself up and poured a dollop of melted wax onto the back of the envelope and a stamp was pressed on top.

A large owl swooped down and studied the writing on the outside before letting out a loud hoot and flying away without the envelope.

5 minutes later a tall woman wearing a pointed hat, glasses and a Scottish Tartan walked in and picked up the envelop to gasp and look confused.

On the envelope was written:

Harry James Potter

Philippines

Invisible

---***

Well that took a while to write. I'm sure it's quite obvious who Lyra is and what the creatures are.
