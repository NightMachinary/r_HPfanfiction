Harry wakes up the next day still in the box. He hears murmuring from outside. When he opens the box the other children gasp. None of the other children speak to him, they all have one hand cuffed to the wall. A dim light is attached to the ceiling. A small girl with platinum blonde hair, and younger than him near the door is sobbing and reaching for a bag just out of her reach.

Still very confused, Harry crawls to the bag and opens it. Inside are various food stuffs, some it smells bad, but most of it is better than the scraps he received at the Dursleys. He passes some of it to the girl, and then proceeds to distribute it to the other children cuffed to the wall. He tries to get someone them to talk, but most won't even meet his eyes. When he is done, he has an old Orange and some bread for himself.

The next day, a slot in the ceiling opens up for a second and a bag falls in. Harry repeats the distribution. This cycle is repeated for a week before he gets enough information to understand his situation. These other children were taken from all over the UK along with himself. He had been the last to arrive after the others had been there for over 2 weeks. One of the men who had taken them had brought them the food before they left the port.

Harry estimated it was nearly 2 months before the shipping container was opened and 4 men came in and started dragging out the children. Harry resisted, kicking and clawing until one of the men punched him in the head connecting right where his lighting bold scar was.

A burst of energy released, partially accidental magic, partially something else. Both the men and the children that been unchained were sent flying. The ship itself let out a groan and began to list to the side. The other containers started to slide off the ship into the water with the one containing the rest of the children staying put at the bottom of the stack. That would not last long with the ship almost about to capsize.

Harry held on to a railing on the ship as he saw a few of the crew members fall over the side. He heard the scream of the girl who had been by the door and been taken out at the same time he had clinging to a railing near to him. As the ship got almost rolled over completely, the girl let go and fell into the sea. Harry couldn't hold on much longer so he dropped as well after her. Scrambling in the water as he had never swam before, he tried to reach the girl. Suddenly, he felt his clothes fill with air and he was able to move easily. He reached the girl and she grabbed onto him just as the ship near them completely flipped over and began to sink.

Almost an hour later, Harry and the girl found a wooden desk that had been part of the debris from the ship and climbed on top. Being that they were both very small, and the water was quite warm, they had no trouble fitting both of themselves on top.

Exhausted, they laid down and didn't speak as they floated away. When they woke up later, Harry finally introduced himself pointing to himself and saying, "I'm Harry, but most of the time people call me Freak."

The girl stares and responds a moment later, "My name is Lyra, but my family mostly calls me Squib." Harry of course has no idea what the nickname means.
