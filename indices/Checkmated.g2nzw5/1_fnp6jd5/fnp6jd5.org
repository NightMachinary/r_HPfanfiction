Aw, Checkmated! You'd have to search for individual authors on AO3 and FFN. I know LavenderBrown has stuff up on FFN. Melindaleo is still writing. I think I've run across Sunshinedasies on AO3. I know RedBlaze/BlueRain took her stuff down (RIP War Mages) as she's an actual published author these days. Schocolate and BelovedRanger are names I recall as well. Poke around and see what you can find!
