I think the author may have just lost interest, or else, like The Santi or Perspicacity, had real life issues come up that got in the way of her fanfiction writing.

If I recall correctly, she was a geologist who would write on down times when doing field work, then would upload several chapters in a short time once she again had internet access. It may be that a career change made this fanfiction-friendly lifestyle untenable.
