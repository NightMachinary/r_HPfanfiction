Jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and sequel have an interesting take on the animagus transformation. They're nominally Harry/Luna (though not really--Harry manages to sleep with most everyone but Luna). Two novel-length stories, complete.

The "Who can give Harry the strongest animagus form?" battle has been won by Perspicacity with his longish one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]]. Harry's form is [[/spoiler][Cthulhu]].
