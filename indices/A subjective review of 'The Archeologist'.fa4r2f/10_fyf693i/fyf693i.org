I just finished reading the story and I completely agree with everything that you've said. Unnecessary cameos, unnecessary crossover (the whole city could have been called Atlantis for all that matters) and most of all: the tangents are a pain and the writer complaining about reviewers advising against show-don't-tell just feels entitled rather than pertinent.

One thing that I disagree with is the story being an 8/10 overall. I agree that the story COULD have been an 8/10 if the author had a nicer writing style (a tangent once in a while is ok, but the story feels a bit too much like an essay rather than, well, a story). The story would have been an 8/10 for me if it didn't fall into the unnecessary things mentioned above, but in it's state, I fought a lot against the tangents to not bore me to death and actually power through them to get to the rare interesting parts making it feels only a little above average for me. A shame!
