  Side note: placing Yarnham in northern Italy is stupid. The aesthetic is so aggressively gothic that it just doesn't make sense to place it anywhere but in Britain, or at the very most northern France/Germany. I say this as a guy born and raised in Italy, though I can acknowledge it's nitpicking.

I agree with this, it doesn't make any sense for Yarnham to be in Italy, you could probably put it somewhere in like Calais or Normandy, or Somewhere in Prussia or on some remote Island off the coast of Britain that it would work but not Italy.

My main issue with the story overall was it's pacing and the fact that it was an Untagged crossover. when i started reading the story and got smacked with Bloodborne all of a sudden it left a sour taste in my mouth...yes the setting can work for it, Yes i love Bloodborne but years of dealing with Shitty Naruto fanfics where Naruto is suddenly a soul reaper has ruined untagged crossover for me to the point where it's a pet peeve of mine.
