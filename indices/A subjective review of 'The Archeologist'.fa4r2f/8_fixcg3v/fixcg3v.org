I'll have to say, from your description, it sounds like a barely legible shitshow that has a very few interesting scenes in it (cursebreaking), but is otherwise uninspired, stale, and generally unpleasant to read.

For example, the cursebreaking segments sound very interesting, and the original lore is also pretty good, but I don't see why time-travel had to be an element at all. Like, the story would have been much better if it was just an original prompt with an adult fem!Harry cursebreaker that has an adventure. that way the author could have focussed on that aspect without being bogged down with original canon, which doesn't seems to be the story's focus at all.

It would also have avoided the expectations of dysphoria and the problem of age.
