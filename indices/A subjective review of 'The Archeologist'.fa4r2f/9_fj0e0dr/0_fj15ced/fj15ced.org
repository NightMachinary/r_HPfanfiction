Don't get me wrong, integration of Bloodborne in a HP-ish setting was definitely one of the strong points of the fic, pretty sure I acknowledged it in the post too. My complaint with the cameos is mostly from a perspective of someone who knows just enough about the series they come from to know they exist, and this definitely took a toll on my immersion. I was mostly fine with Inuyasha, Kagome and Argo because they have a role in the story and (at least for Argo) diverge quite significantly from their counterpart, so after a momentary loss of SoD I shrugged and disassociated them, but the other two had no role in the story after being introduced, which makes them stick out all the more.
