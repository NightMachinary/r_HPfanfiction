I read this fic before and until you just said it, I had absolutely no idea there was supposed to be a bloodborne crossover. The name Yarnham means nothing to me, so I didn't pick it up at all.

I also didn't know who any of the other cursebreakers were or that they too came from other sources. I thought he made them up.

In that regard, he did an excellent job of integrating them into HP, because they don't feel out of place at all.
