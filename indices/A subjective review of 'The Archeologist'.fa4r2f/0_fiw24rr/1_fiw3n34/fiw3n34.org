Inuyasha showing up was when i stopped reading. I dislike untagged crossovers, but at least with Bloodborne I could think "Ok, maybe it could work and while i'm miffed about the crossover i'll get over it" but then suddenly Inuyasha is their and it makes me flashback to my Naruto days. Their are to many fucking Naruto fanfics where Rukia and Ichigo are in the Naruto Universe for no goddamn reason that it's left a bad taste in my mouth for YEARS, and while the Archaeologist has it's moments it doesn't have nearly enough good moments for me to read past where i stopped.
