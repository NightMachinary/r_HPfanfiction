Wow this is a deep dive. I found the fic a breezy enjoyable read, except for some cliche repetitive moments like resorting to getting drunk to show exasperation, or the random pairing at the end. I think Inuyasha randomly showing up in the story was a bit out of place, but the author made it work by portraying him as this absentminded academic.

The one thing I didn't like it how the author responds to criticism. He gets very angry at what he perceives is unsolicited criticism and will definitely make his point clear. It totally soured my look at the whole story after getting a long angry personal message in that vein. There are some really interesting ideas, like turning the Resurrection Stone into an Eye, and the unintended effects of teaching wards to underage wizards, but a lot of that gets lost in some of the character interactions and a lot of detail in a game that if you haven't played, takes you out of the story
