Oh I agree definitely. I actually don't watch anime or play video games, so I wasn't even aware of the unlisted crossover until the end. But I think the characterization of the Harry Potter characters was just slightly...off, and not because they were in an alternate universe.

And I think the author only acts this way when you address him personally. I think this general review in a forum will not be a problem
