  random pairing at the end
#+end_quote

Yeah, I get you. I was expecting a pairing all throughout the fic just from how the whole gender issue was (not) handled, but shoving it all in the last chapter was definitely jarring.

  I think Inuyasha randomly showing up in the story was a bit out of place, but the author made it work by portraying him as this absentminded academic.

Already said my piece on cameos and expys, but to be clear I'm not completely against them. I just prefer them to be more subtle than "here is this guy from that anime you like". It would also work better to be subtle about it because, well, there are people who haven't watched Inuyasha, but know about it. If the cameo is subtle, a fan of the series can point at it and go "oh, cool, a cameo" and move on, and one who doesn't know it can move on regardless, oblivious to it, without losing immersion. It seems like a double-edged sword.

  The one thing I didn't like it how the author responds to criticism. He gets very angry at what he perceives is unsolicited criticism and will definitely make his point clear.

I'm kind of half dreading getting called out by him for this review, haha
