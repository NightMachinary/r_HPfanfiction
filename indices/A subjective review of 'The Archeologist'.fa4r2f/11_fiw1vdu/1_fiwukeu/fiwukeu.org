I really liked the hints to the past timeline. Except for one thing - there is no separation between his new persona and the old Harry, at all. If you skipped the first chapter, you would think he was born a woman. Just the simple change of thinking of himself as male when thinking about the time when he, well, was, would have made it so much better on both fronts (the tangents and the sex change).
