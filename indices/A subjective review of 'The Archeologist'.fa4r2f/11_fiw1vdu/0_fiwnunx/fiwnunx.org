I disagree, I really don't think you can change someone's sex just like that and have them "taking it in stride" neither biology nor psychology works like that unless they have an ego so big that they literally believe to be above the matters of the flesh (a very specific case of god complex) or if they are in the other extreme and simply don't have any ego at all for it to make an impact, besides there are a myriad of things you can do to add that shock value without adding what should be a monumental shift in a character and ultimately adding nothing to the story.
