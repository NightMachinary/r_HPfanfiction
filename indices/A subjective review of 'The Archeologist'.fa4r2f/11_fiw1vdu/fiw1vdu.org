I feel that the change into fem!Harry did have a point, as a introduction to Harry's character... as in: Harry is so used to crazy stuff, that this life altering change doesn't really matter to him at all.

Other than that, yea I agree... except I fall into the camp that likes the writing style (especially that while we are given facts about the past... they aren't in /Flashback/-form), and don't really care either way about the Crossovers.

so, I too do recommend reading The Archeologist
