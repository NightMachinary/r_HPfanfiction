...yes

Byrgenwerth is on the edge of a lake, quite possibly the same body of water near Castle Cainhurst. However, the Fishing Hamlet is on the coast, and is based on Innsmouth. To my knowledge, we're not given a very good indication of where Yharnam is in relation to the Fishing Hamlet, since the only way to access it is the Hunter's Nightmare. Geography is a little odd in there.

I personally would place Yharnam somewhere between Germany and Poland and have the Hamlet be on the Baltic Sea. That fits with Germanic names and gothic architecture and puts it close enough to the sea for the Kos-or-some-say-Kosm screwup.
