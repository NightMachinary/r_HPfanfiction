Well, Yharnam is based off of Prague, so Central Europe somewhere is the appropriate location for it. The author probably went with Italy due to the Healing Church being similar to the Catholic Church in general theme and appearance. As far as the fem!Harry... I despise pointless genderswapping, so I've never read this fic, despite Bloodborne being my absolute favorite videogame of all time.

Excellent in-depth review that confirms the opinion I already had of this story. I am uninterested in it.
