  Well, Yharnam is based off of Prague, so Central Europe somewhere is the appropriate location for it.

Didn't know that, but I've been to Prague and I can kinds see it.

Can't say if the Healing Church is similar since I haven't actually played the game, but the aesthetic is all wrong for northern Italy. We just don't really do gothic, outside a few very specific exceptions like Milan's Duomo. The names too, they are very Germanic in how they sound while we tend towards the Latin ones. It really feels like a British enclave, which could make sense if it was a secreted wizarding place built by British wizards in another country, but that's not how it's presented.
