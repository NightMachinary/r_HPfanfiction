Oh, I've been slowly working on a review too with this fic, though it's mostly jotted down notes right now. It seems like a fairly divisive fic. Saw a bunch of people recommend it as a good fic and then a bunch of people push back against it. I'd personally put it slightly above average. Technical execution is good, premise is interesting, but heavily marred by all the telling which makes action less intense and the whole cosmic horror much less horrifying. The cameos are downright awful and the whole shrugging off the transformation in a way that isn't in-character greatly bothers me since reading about how characters have to deal with transformations is one of my favourite themes. And oof, I don't read author's notes usually so I didn't know how salty Racke is. I am of the opinion that if you willing put out a work for others to read there is an implicit understanding that you will get criticism, constructive or not, positive or not, and if you don't like it then you shouldn't be putting it out into the world. I think I've read like two or three other stories by them, I think they said this was their first long-form work? Regardless, it's their worst one by far.
