  The author addresses complaints about this in chapter 3, where he (rightly) professes that 'show, don't tell' is not the end-all of writing advice, since it mostly pertains to writing movie scripts. Which, well, ok yeah, you're right. He also says that he doesn't like dialogue-heavy stories, which ok, matter of taste. You're the author, you decide what to write. On the other hand, between this and the next chapter's notes, he expresses opinions I disagree with, so I'm taking the time to address this now.

  He says, and I'm paraphrasing here since it's spread over a few paragraphs, that giving unsolicited criticism is wrong, because it discourages authors from continuing their stories. That becoming a better author is done by keeping writing, and listening to advice is useless. And that fanfiction authors don't write to "perfect their art", but for the sake of telling a story.

You see this position with growing frequency. To me this inability to handle criticism just screams narcissism.

If you're writing purely for yourself and you don't want to expose yourself to criticism: don't publish your story online.

In reality, most of the individuals who adopt this position are in the business of writing fanfiction for ego-enhancing praise. It's a transaction: I write, and instead of paying me, you praise me in exchange. But in seeking out people to comment on your stories in the hope of receiving that praise, you impliedly consent to the risk of some of those comments being critical.

As for the fic, my overwhelming impression when I tried to read it was that it was just incredibly dull. The inconsequential gender change, the crossover elements, and the dense prose all add up to severe disinterest. Add the magic system to that, which is at best uninspired, at worst actively irritating, and it wasn't long before I was skimming and soon after that walking away.
