  would have to be more slytherin-ish

- You said Lawyer. He would have to be Slytherin.
- You would need different friends. Tracey Davis would possibly be a good idea, as she is also a half-blood. Confirmed as canon. Blaise Zabini? He could be either-or with blood status.

  He was weaker, magically
#+end_quote

- You could explain that away as an infant binding on his magic, or he self-bound it because of the abuse or something. Or even have him get a hold on it earlier, a la Tom Riddle did in the orphanage.
- You can get rid of this after book 2. Have his friends actually know about wizarding culture. Have him go to St. Mungos or something. Let's face it, Ron might have come up with a few tidbits of wizard culture, but it's not like the Weaselys follow into tradition or culture unless it is slapping their face with the obviousness.
- You can use this as a bulletproof way to get away from the Dursleys. Maybe expose the Dumbledore meddling if it is part of the story.

  old society brimmed with injustice
#+end_quote

- He can start with getting away from the Dursleys. This moves into who he was supposed to go there. More dirt digging, more research. Lots of Wizengamot/courtroom drama.
- Insert Sirius.
- Toss in some backroom politicking, greasing, more research. Sirius gets proven innocent.
- With Sirius free, this can expose Harry to a lot of societal functions now. Winter balls, Summer events, etc.
