I'm literally thinking of Daphne behaving like Kaguya-sama. Especially those times when she gets mad at Chika.

Actually, Tracey Davis can play Chika Fujiwara really well.

Except, James Potter wouldn't be alive so we couldn't have a Dio voice.

And we don't know who could play best girl Ishigami-kun.

Edit: Just the thought of a bruised and battered Tracy pointing proudly at Harry and telling Daphne that she raised that boy is definitely going to be a riot! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
