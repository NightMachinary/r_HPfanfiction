I'm basically thinking she's like Haru from P5, but she has all this wealth and political clout and actually knows how to use it.

But, as a trade off, her entire understanding of romance is from books and media so she's trying all these tricks behind the scenes but is still monumentally shy and has no idea what she's doing.
