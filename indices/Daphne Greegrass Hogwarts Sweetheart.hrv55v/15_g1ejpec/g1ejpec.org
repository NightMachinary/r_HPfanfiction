First time posting on Reddit, so here goes.\\
I've been working on a fic ever since I came across this prompt, and I felt compelled to try my hand at it.\\
Without further ado, here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13610399/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Pie-Throwing-Championships][Daphne Greengrass and the Pie-Throwing Championships]].

I posted on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24626260][Archive of Our Own]] too.\\
It'll be quite a few chapters. Probably around 100 - 200k words.\\
I hope it's what you're all looking for.\\
Enjoy. :)
