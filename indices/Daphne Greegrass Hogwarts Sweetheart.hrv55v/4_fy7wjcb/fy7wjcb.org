I could imagine Malfoy trying some shit, only for Crabbe and Goyle to place their hands on his shoulders in a menacing way and slowly leading him away.

I can easily see this becoming a source of sit-com like entertainment for the students and teachers, which forces the whole "Voldemort isn't back and he's a liar!" thing to the back of their minds as they watch him shyly, timidly get roped into Daphne's web.

....You know, Umbridge actually encouraging this as it'd, in her eyes, "anchor him to the 'right sort' and get him over his delusions over that tragedy of Diggory's death" would creep everyone the fuck out. Daphne included, heh.
