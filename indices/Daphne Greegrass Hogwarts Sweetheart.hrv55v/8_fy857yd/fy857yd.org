This could be a cool take on a Marriage Contract thing too. James Potter/Lily and Mr/ Mrs Greengrass sign a marriage contract in an attempt to protect Harry if things go south for them. Dumbledore takes Harry before they can get to him and reluctantly agree to let Dumbledore keep him in hiding. After Harry resumes Hogwarts, Daphne watches her betrothed from afar, too scared to do anything like approach him, but she is shown lightly affecting how things happen in the story and helping the Team Potter from afar.

Year 1 is tough, but year 2 maybe she's someone who helps tip off hermione as to what's petrifying people, and she and her father drag Malfoy through the mud after year two and his attempted attack on Harry after Dobby is freed. Year 3 Mr Greengrass scours the Great Britain for information on Sirius Black and finds out he never got a trial, and lightly uses his influence at the Ministry to push a trial for Sirius through. Year 4 Daphne is one of Harry's only supporters and Harry constantly hears tales of people being sent to the hospital wing after terrorizing him (of course he has no idea what happened to them). Year 5 Daphne turns it to 11 and tries to move forward with things and yeah. I also like the idea of throwing in some Mr Greengrass spends years trying to figure out where Harry has been staying after seeing him at the end of year 1 at the train station (of course he's always blocked somehow from actually communicating with Harry). Eventually he finds out about the Dursleys, and maybe gets a vague idea of how they treat Harry, and implements a Revenge plan (I like the idea of him buying out the company Vernon works for and firing him)
