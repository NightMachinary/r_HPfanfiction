Harry ducked into the secret passage, leaving the hidden door open just enough to see into the hallway, he stayed very still as he saw his "hunter" as Hermione called it, passed through followed by Tracey Davis.

Daphne Greengrass was a strange character for Harry, it had all began on second year, when she stopped to talk to him in the hallway, saying she didn't believe he was the Heir, he was grateful for that.

And so it began.

Contrary to popular belief, Harry wasn't stupidly oblivious, he caught on quick that she was flirting with him(or trying to), she would send sweets and other small gifts, and then either of them would try to talk to the other between classes, and engage in what Hermione called "the most endearing and frustrating flirting ever."

Now, also contrary to popular belief(even if those two should be contrary), Harry had no clue about dating, or even flirting, his relatives were never examples, his social experiences had been dreadful until he reached Hogwarts and he was barely thirteen.

He needed help, because for once, he was interested in her, not only she seemed to be truly sincere in her interest in the real Harry, he also found her pretty, and cute.

But who could help him? It would need to be a girl, and she needed to be knowledgeable.

He almost slapped his face, there was only one answer.

Hermione had barely entered the common room when Harry intercepted her.

"Hermione, I need your help!" the desperation in his voice immediately raised alarms.

She guided him to one of the tables and started whispering.

"What is it, Harry? Is it Sirius Black?"

Harry frowned before seemingly just remembering there was a mass murderer out to get him, but he shook his head, he had priorities.

"What? No, look, it's about Daphne, Daphne Greengrass."

Hermione immediately relaxed, before a small smile came over her, "Oh, Harry, look you just have to gently let her down..."

"Let her down! No! I want to..." he lowered his voice when he realized he had almost shouted, "I want to try and..." he blushed, "date her Hermione, and I, don't know how."

Hermione tried not to gush, he looked so cute doing that! But she limited herself to widening her smile and tried to speak in a comforting voice.

"That's great Harry, and there's no need to feel ashamed, we are still young."

"Yeah! But I don't even know how to ask her for a date! Or even, what to do in a date." his blush increased two fold," I know about kissing and...stuff, but that's not all there is to it, people have to talk, and have fun? Right?"

Hermione put a comforting hand on his shoulder, holding her frown when he tensed a bit, she didn't have to think hard on the reasons for Harry's lack of social skills, but she vowed to help him. Harry had gone through too much already and deserved some happiness.

"You are right, Harry, definitely right! But don't worry, I will help you, and I think there are some other people who would want to help too."

Seeing him get ready to protest, Hermione raised a hand, "I trust them Harry, and I know you trust them too."

"So, little Harrykins wants to ask the sweet Miss Greengrass on a date?" George asked with a smile.

"And he wants our esteemed help."

Harry wasn't sure of that, but he wasn't placed in Gryffindor on a whim, "Yes, but guys, please..."

Fred stopped him before he could continue, his smile a bit less mischievous "Oh, don't worry mate, we will take this seriously, you are our friend, and after what you did for Ginny."

George nodded, "Yeah, and if Mum gets wind we did something to distress you..." he grimaced.

Fred looked at his brother, "She might actually tell Dad." both paled a bit and shuddered at that, making Harry believe they wouldn't turn it into one of their tricks.

Hermione, with her arms crossed, looked at twins for a bit before nodding, "Ok, with this out of the way, here's the plan, next weekend is a Hogsmeade one, so Harry, I think it would be good if you invited her to go with you. On. A. Date."

Harry's stomach sunk, so soon? Would he be ready? What if he messed up? He was thinking he preferred to face the Basilisk again, at least it wouldn't make him feel the worst person on the planet for making it cry.

"Calm down! Harry, we will help you." she gestured to her and the twins, "And it's very simple."

"But what do I say? What if she can't go? What if she doesn't like Hogsmeade?"

The twins shared a look, before placing a hand on each of Harry's shoulders. "Oh, don't worry, our date challenged friend, we have a solution for that." Fred removed two very small spheres from his pocket," this, is a prototype for one of our products. It was supposed to help us hear sounds from behind wood barriers."

Hermione narrowed her eyes at that.

"But, sadly, it can't do that very well, it will, however, hear what you hear if you place it on your ear, and when if we use two pairs," he removed other two spheres, "we can talk back and forth, and us three can guide you while courting your blond haired snake."

Harry wasn't very sure that would help him, but needs must.
