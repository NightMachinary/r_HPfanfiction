Harry walked down the hallway where Fred and George said Daphne would be passing through(how they knew that he didn't ask.) trying and failing to control his nerves. He tried to forget how Hermione and Fred were following him under his Cloak.

And then he saw her, blonde, on the tall side and with a very pretty face, he especially liked her gentle blue eyes, gentle, but with an undercurrent of strength that was oddly familiar.

He smiled softly, for some reason thinking of deep red hair.

He must've been distracted, because he did not notice she had stopped, her eyes widening, he stopped too, and both looked into the other's eyes.

Tracey Davis who realized she hadn't even been perceived, huffed with a smile, Blaise Zabini, who was coming on the back, scoffed and glanced at his companion, both nodded and stepped back a little.

/"Harry, talk to her."/ he had almost forgotten about the magic radio.

"Er, Hi, Daphne."

She smiled and he thought it did look cute, "Hi, Harry, how are you?"

"I am good, thanks..." why did this have to be so hard.

There were sniggers on the radio, before the sound of a muffled 'ouch' and then Hermione spoke.

/"Compliment her Harry, and ask about her day."/

"I like your eyes, they are pretty. How was your day?" more sniggers, and he now noticed the two other Slytherins a few paces behind Daphne, Tracey seemed to be coughing, but her eyes were full of mirth.

/"That was...nice, Harry, now let her answer."/

Daphne smiled again and took a few steps towards him, "I am having a good day, Harry, thank you for asking." she giggled.

"/Ask her to Hogsmeade."/

Harry froze up a bit, and couldn't look Daphne in her eyes, he started rubbing the back of his head. "Look, Daphne, I..."

She apparently took this the wrong way, because her face took a sad expression, but still tried to smile. "I understand, Harry..."

His eyes widened and he looked at her "You do?", only to frown as her expression.

"Yes, I know I am trying to hard, and you aren't interested, I am sorry to have made you uncomfortable..."

"/Harry, talk to her! Right Now!"/

Hermione once said Harry was good at reacting to things while under pressure, while others would panic and be paralyzed, Harry could act with a cooler head, or at least do something.

Once again, she was right.

Harry took a step forward and grasped her arms. "No! I am interested!"

He also barely heard Zabini murmuring "Smooth, Potter." and Tracey giggling lightly, Daphne however, smiled widely, her eyes alight!

"You are?"

/"Say yes! Say yes!"/ two voices repeated on his ear.

"Yes!"

"Ask her to go with you to Hogsmeade!"

"WillyougowithmetoHogsmeade?" he said without stopping, trying to ignore the soft laughter on the other side of the line and from Tracey.

"What?"

Harry took a deep breath. "Will you go to Hogsmeade...with me...for a date?"

Harry was expecting a myriad of reactions, from laughter(despite all her signs, he was still insecure) to a soft yes or even no, he wasn't expecting for her to launch herself at him and give Hermione /and/ Molly a run for their money in hugs.

"Yes! Yes! Of course, I will go with you!" she said, the smile clear in her voice.

Harry had stiffened when she hugged him.

/"Harry for the love of Merlin hug that girl, right now!"/

He did so, and had to admire how he enjoyed it, she smelled of lavender and gooseberries, and was also soft, and warm, very warm.

"That's good," he said into her hair. If he was talking about her answer or her hug, even he didn't know. Perhaps both.

They stayed in that position for a few moments, just enjoying the close contact, one of the few times Harry enjoyed close contact, actually. And he wished for more.

Daphne was the first to pull back, but she kept her hands on Harry's upper arms, and smiled at him, her cheeks flushed, something that Harry thought made her even more attractive.

They looked into each other's eyes, but Harry, couldn't stop his eyes from going to her lips.

Someone cleared their throat, and Daphne looked back with a furious expression.

"Sorry, Daph, but we /really/ need to go."

/"Harry, say to her you are happy she accepted and that...you can't wait."/ Hermione said.

"And place your right hand on her cheek while doing so, trust me." Fred piped up.

Hesitantly, and with courage he would bet came from the high after the hug, Harry did so, and if Daphne noticed his slightly trembling and somewhat clammy hand, she never said it.

She only blushed even more and smiled, and Harry found himself caressing her face, finding her skin soft and warm, just like she was.

"Daphne, I am happy you accepted, and I will be counting the days until our date." she placed her hand over his squeezing it, and he felt a bit faint.

"Me too," she said softly, before she quickly pressed forward and touched her lips to his,\\
a featherlight kiss, but it sent a such a jolt of excitement through him, that he barely noticed when she caressed his face too before turning back with a smile and almost skipped back to her friends, face alight.

He also didn't hear the gasp coming from the line.

Both Tracey and Zabini said their goodbyes, though Tracey said, "I think you broke him, Daph." and upon seeing her friend was not all there either, grabbed her arm and started guiding her away while rolling her eyes, "probably mutual, what do you think Blaise?

"That I need an insulin shot."

With that, the trio left, with Daphne turning back and waving, Harry returned it in a bit of daze, before placing his hand on his lips.

"Wow, Hermione, and you said he needed help? Our Harry here is /smooth/."

He almost jumped upon hearing Fred's voice, now not muffled by a spell, and turned back just in time to see them remove the Cloak.

Hermione walked up and hugged him with a smile, "I am so proud of you Harry, you did well."

"Yeah, mate, she was putty in your hands."

"Yeah," Harry smiled, before his eyes widened, "I got a date! Hermione, I got a date! What do I wear? Where should we go?"

Hermione just smiled at her friend and patted him on the back, "Don't worry Harry, we got the full package deal, we can order clothing by Owl mail and ask for Alicia or Angelina to adjust them a bit, and Hogsmeade is full of places for you to go."

As color was returning to Harry's face, Hermione turned to him, "Don't worry Harry we will not let anything ruin your date."

As that trio left, no one noticed when a tabby cat emerged from the shadows, looking for all the world like she had eaten the canary.
