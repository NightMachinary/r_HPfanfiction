On Saturday, at precisely two in the evening, Harry and Daphne met in the Entrance Hall, he was dressed in black and silver robes, with a small Potter family crest on the breast(apparently Madam Malkins had a register with them and went all out when Harry wrote to her in such a formal way), his hair was just a bit tamed, and he was without his glasses(Madam Pomfrey talked to him about contacts /out of nowhere/).

He had a nervous smile on his lips, that turned into a full-blown one when he looked at where Hermione was pointing.

Daphne was dressed in a pretty green dress(a similar shade to his eyes) had her hair out in wavy locks, and just a hint of makeup. But Harry thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen.

He tried to remember the tips Hermione, The Twins, and The Chasers gave him, Hermione was thoughtful enough to put them in a list.

Compliment her.

"Daphne, you look beautiful, very beautiful."

He was rewarded with a shy smile, and an honest compliment too. Trying not to dwell on it, he went to the next item, one of the hardest.

Offer your /hand,/ gently, and confidently.

He did so, trying to control the trembling, but he didn't have to wait long because she took it earnestly, and squeezed it, both exciting and calming him at the same time.

This dating stuff was confusing.

"Shall we go?" He indicated the exit with his had and what he hoped was a confident smile. It wasn't confident at all, but he looked definitely happy.

She nodded and kissed his cheek, he gently pulled her a bit closer and returned it, before guiding her to the entrance. He turned to look at his friends.

Hermione was smiling gently, and nodded in encouragement, Ron grinned at him and gave him a double thumbs up.

Properly encouraged, Harry left, enjoying the feel of Daphne's hand on his.

Hermione and Ron were joined by Tracey, who was smiling too.

"Good Work, Granger, I couldn't stand all that flirting and dancing around anymore."

Hermione nodded, "They look happy."

"Oh, they are, and will be, if we have anything to say about it."

Hermione turned to her, "So, Malfoy?"

Tracey smiled, "Poor Draco, breakfast just did not agree with him today, I think he will be in the dungeons until tomorrow."

The other girl nodded with a smile, "Good, we've got people on the village to make sure it all goes well."

Ron, was frowning, thinking about something, "What about the Dementors?"

"Didn't you hear? There was a bunch of them on the entrance when the Headmaster's Phoenix swooped in, with another Phoenix, a Patronus one, and if what the upper years told is true, the Dementors /ran/, or flew fast I guess, as if scared."

Hermione filed that information away for later. Ron laughed "Heh, I think Professor Dumbledore had enough of them near the school."

The girls smiled at each other, thinking. "Probably."

Harry and Daphne had a great date(the first of many), they noticed they had two followers, completely missing the third(who wouldn't, when the person would look different every time).

After a few hours, Harry was finally able to relax around Daphne, and know more about the girl who was interested in him, while he became interested in her in the process.

He found her funny, driven, and caring; even if a bit aloof(he thought it just added to her charm). She loved her family, friends, and magic.

Harry could relate to two of those, the other one was a bit harder, but he talked to her about some things he never had before.

She also liked Quidditch, horses, and dueling magic(she promised to take him to see a professional duel).

Daphne found Harry to be funny too, very determined, brave, and even a bit cunning, even if he could hide it well(and didn't that make him all the more cunning?). He loved his friends, Quidditch, and magic. He liked Hogwarts

And Daphne could see he never had enough opportunities to experience the world, to get more things to like, she vowed to provide those for him.

They returned at the last minute, just before Filch closed the gates, their cheeks were flushed and they looked ruffled, if from running or something else, only they(and a young Auror) knew.

Fred and George returned a bit later, being baffled as to how the young couple could lose them for most of the day, they caught on that same hallway, halfway between the Tower and\\
the Dungeons.

That goodnight kiss was definitely /not/ featherlight.

My try at cheesy 'romance', perhaps a bit too much, but I felt it was appropriate for this Prompt. I would like to explore Daphne's character more, but it would become just too big.
