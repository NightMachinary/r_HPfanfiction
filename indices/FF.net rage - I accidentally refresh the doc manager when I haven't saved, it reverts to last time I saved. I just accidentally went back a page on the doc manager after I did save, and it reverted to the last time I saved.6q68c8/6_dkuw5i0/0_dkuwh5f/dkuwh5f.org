Like I said to the other comment, I've been using it for 6 years and I'm institutionalised to it at this point, I have a /feel/ for pacing and structure in the doc manager I don't have on Word. I like the full screen width of the doc manager, the formatting is easier/less fiddly than Word and I like chucking everything that needs edited beneath a big horizontal line and deleting it bit by bit as I redraft it above the line.

I do have stuff saved as word/odf documents, and have done a bit of writing in that in the past.
