It's totally the opposite for me! I find Word far too narrow, I like having the full screen width on ff.net. I guess it's just more that I've been using it for years now, and while other options are probably better/more practical I have a good /feel/ for writing on ff.net. The pacing of words and sentences is very important in my writing, and I just feel like I have a better idea of how many words to put in a paragraph on ff.net than on Word.

Plus, when it comes to editing I like having the 2nd draft above a horizontal line and the unedited material below it.
