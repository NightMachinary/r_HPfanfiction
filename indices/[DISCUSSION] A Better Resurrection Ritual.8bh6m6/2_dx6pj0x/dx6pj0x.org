...How was the ritual hampered? It didn't seem to require talent of any sort on Pettigrew's part. I don't see how adding an Obscurus, Dementor and sacrificing one of his Horcruxes would increase his power. Unless I'm misremembering, what made Voldemort more powerful upon coming back was the fact that he could now bypass Lily's sacrificial protection, not because his already ridiculous magical power was increased.
