Well yeah the ritual he used brought him back to existence with his normal magic and stuff, but it really didn't require much talent. I feel like it could have been the 'your servants aren't particularly good at these' ritual, but ideally Voldemort would use a 'yeah, you're basically OPAF now' type of ritual.

The Obscurus/Dementor/Horcrux ritual would basically give him the magical power from the Obscurus, the basically indestructible nature of the Dementor, and the Horcrux to tie everything together? this is purely theoretical though.
