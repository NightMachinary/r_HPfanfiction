I feel like chucking a load of individually powerful things into a pot and thinking that this will inevitably result in a powerful product is not how the HP system works. All of the elements of the canon ritual were symbolically important. Replacing "bones of the father" with "random powerful magical creature" doesn't really have the same symbolic resonance.
