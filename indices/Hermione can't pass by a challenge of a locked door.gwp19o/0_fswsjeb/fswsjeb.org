I'd read that.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5) sort of does that, though it's mostly post-Hogwarts, and she certainly does steal stuff.

IIRC, in linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl), Hermione concludes that the corridor is an obstacle course set up as a challenge to the students and figures out how to get to the Mirror of Erised after several attempts.
