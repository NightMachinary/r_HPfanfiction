I like they tried to add depth to the Titans, but I don't like that it was basically because of a villain/power-creep over expansions.

Each expansion needs a new villain more powerful than the last to keep the zombie of a game going.

Hell, their rewriting the lore for the Lich King, just to give this Shadowland shit validity, made me shake my head and lose interest. That, and Windrunner basically becoming a Mary Sue.
