Biggest thing I don't like about the game is the constant theme of the world getting worse/beauty destroyed/every day darker/fire and death and blood.

Pandaria was nice because most of it was green and lively, and even if things got dark towards the end the evil was beaten and the lands were supposed to heal in time.
