On the plus side their cannon makes a convincing case for why the Titans are evil and need to be destroyed. The whole giving Neltharion a 'blessing' that drives him to madness, a job involving the old gods and zero protection from them, plus the whole 'why aren't there intelligent proto-drakes/dragons' that didn't, at one time, serve the Titans?

In any case, I'm having fun writing it. Got a shovel and some fill dirt on hand for all those plot holes.
