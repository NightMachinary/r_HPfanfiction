It's a fic with a lot more dragons than cannon. Brief summary: During Fifth year, Harry gets sent a dream and rushed to the Room of Requirement to open his side of an interdimensional/world/universe portal. He promptly ends up with a pile of rather desperate dragons at his feet and his life gets more complicated, but in a good way. Features an Albus that really should have listened to his pheonix and torched the Elder Wand, many, many dragons, the main characters gaining power by combining two very different magical traditions, and a Harry/Hermione/+ ship that isn't mentioned much really.

And for your request, Remus Lupin had been on assignment for about 20 chapters in North America searching for a method to bind your animagus form to a sample from a creature. Remus isn't my favorite character really so it was a good way to get rid of him for a while.

If you want a taste of my writing style, check out chapter 19, it's a self-contained origin story for the hallows.
