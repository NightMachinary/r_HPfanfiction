Yeah, it's my favorite for a few reasons, though I can see why people didn't enjoy DA2 as much as other entries in the series. Personally, I really liked having the area and timeframe narrowed to just Kirkwall and the surrounding areas; it WAS limiting, but it also made you appreciate your supporting cast and Kirkwall all the more because you were there so much instead of running across a bunch of different places you only vaguely knew anything about or touched on. You really got to know the place and its people and its stories.

And I'll give A03 a look. I've been scrolling through it for pure DA fics the last few weeks; just wanted opinions on crossovers before slogging through tags myself.
