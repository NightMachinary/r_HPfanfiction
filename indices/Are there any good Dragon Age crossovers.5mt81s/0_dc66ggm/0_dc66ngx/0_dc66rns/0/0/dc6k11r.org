Not the person you were originally responding to, but I'll try to answer why DA2 was "bad".

Note that I put bad in quotations, mostly because DA2 had all the potential in the world to be the best game of the series. But what seemed to be a great, unconventional concept (a fantasy RPG taking place in one city detailing the rise and fall of one man/woman), was cut off at the knees by a short release cycle and publisher demands, and what we got instead was Dragon Age 2: a clearly rushed mishmash of cut-and-paste dungeons, a small and lifeless "city" in the place of Kirkwall, possibly the most tropey party out of any of the DA games, and a third act that practically falls out of the sky. This is ignoring the numerous complaints the game received for its battle system and controls, mind.

That's not to say the game is completely irredeemable. When DA2 is good, it's quite good (see Act II and a rare few of the story beats from Act I). But to get to all that, the game requires you to sit through anywhere from 10 to 15 hours of slogging through the same dungeon over and over again, or running through the same, bland sections of Kirkwall over and over again, and fighting wave-spawning enemies over and over again. Sure, that might not bother fans of the series too much, but the average gamer would be forgiven for seeing the worst of the game and never coming back.

Due to this, we saw Bioware revert to a concept more strongly modeled after Origins for DA Inquisition, most likely due to the backlash against DA2. But hopefully, with the success of The Witcher as an unconventional fantasy RPG series and EA toning down their moneygrabbing tendencies, Bioware might be willing to tackle an unconventional Dragon Age entry like DA2 again, with more time and funding.
