What exactly is it about DA2 that doesn't sit well with you if you dont mind me asking? I know people give the game flack for its controls and battle system, and its relative scale compared to the previous game, but no one is ever able to really tell me why they think its /bad/.

And that sucks. I might just end up having to write one if nothing good is out there; its a fun idea to explore I think. Having Harry dodging High Dragons and trying to keep off the radar of the circles seems like it'd be neat.
