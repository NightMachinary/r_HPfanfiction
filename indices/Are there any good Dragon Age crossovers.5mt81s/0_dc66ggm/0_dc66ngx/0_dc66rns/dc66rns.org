Yeah. I guess it's not so much the DA2 timeline that is all that bad. I guess it's mostly just the game, and that sort of clouds my opinion on it as a whole. Anyways, I have literally skimmed every single HP/DA crossover on there (as of a few months ago) and none of them really stood out to me as memorable.
