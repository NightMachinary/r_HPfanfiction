Why did you have to remind me about that? I got into Harry Potter fandom when the last few chapters were posted and will forever wish it had received a conclusion. So much great characterization, though Dumbledore's portrayal was so irritating I am half convinced he was a genuine Manipulative!Dumbledore. I also wish I knew what happened to Percy in that reality.
