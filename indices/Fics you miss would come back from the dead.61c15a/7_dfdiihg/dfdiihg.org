The fact that We Are Nothing by Ruskbyte is 1 chapter away from completion, and will never be completed is infuriating. Linkffn(6868583).

Also, Forgotton by StrictlySomething is a Lost/HP crossover fic with a really promising start, but was abandoned after only two chapters in 2011 so I don't know why I care so much. Linkffn(7267559)
