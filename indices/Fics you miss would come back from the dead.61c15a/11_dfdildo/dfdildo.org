linkffn(New Ages by GriffinSky): The only post-Deathly Hallows story I like. It stars Percy, my favorite character, and is well written, with really good characterization and portrayal of Ministry politics. I have never liked the Percy/Audrey thing in fic since she's basically an OC, but she's not too bad here. It's a sequel to story that covers the seventh book, though it stands well enough alone.
