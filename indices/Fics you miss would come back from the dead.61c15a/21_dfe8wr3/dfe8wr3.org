linkffn(The Marriage Stone) is something I want to see the end of. Voldemort is extremely competent, and the last chapter ended with a almost cliffie in the climax of a plot arc. Fortunately the author updated a few months ago to quell rumors of her death, and said that she'd post the rest of the story all at once, but nothing much is likely to happen for a long time.
