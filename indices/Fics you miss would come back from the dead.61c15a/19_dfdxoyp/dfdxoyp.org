linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild) I discovered this two months after the last update. "Great," I thought, "it's still being updated!" Ha. Ha. Ha. I love the humor in this, as it completely manages to avoid all the usual HP tropes.

linkao3(1155472) I still can't understand why there is a complete lack of Person A/Person B/Person A fics in Harry Potter, especially with Voldemort/Tom Riddle pairings. Horcruxes give you the perfect setup for those! But this is the hilarity of all the horcruxes completely focused on Harry (and raising him too). The author went on hiatus and never managed to get back her mojo for this story.
