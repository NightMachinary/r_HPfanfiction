Someone's already mentioned Paimpoint's /To the Waters and the Wild/ which I love as well, Harry's naivete is somehow really admirable in it.

/The Peril's of Innocence/ by Avidbeader. I'm still hopeful this one isn't quite abandoned it hasn't been updated in about 18 months.

/Harry from Another World/ by Sprinter 1988.

/By the Light of the Moon/ by MoriasDepths.

/A Different Start: An American Harry Prequel/ by DarkeStar.

/Elementary Calculations/ by KCourCat

These are just four of the 42 fics in my alerts list that haven't been updated since 2014.

/Black and Bones: A Love Story/ by JenniRose isn't on my alerts list and hasn't been updated since 2009.

/Green and Blue/ and /Second Life/ by NiaRiver who is one of my favourite authors.

/Me and Myself/ by The Funny Idiot.

These are all fics I torture myself with and reread all the time knowing I'm going to die a little inside when I reach the end. But I'm afraid it's tip of the iceberg stuff people. I could name a couple dozen more...but I won't.
