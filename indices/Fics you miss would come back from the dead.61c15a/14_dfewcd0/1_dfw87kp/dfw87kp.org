Thanks for the recommendation! I just finished Hell Eyes and loved it. It had some rough patches but was really solid. I also wish that Harry ended up with Lush instead. His thing with Enna basically disappears at the end so while the author develops Lush instead.

Regardless I loved it, but no way I'm reading 3 chapters of an abandoned sequel
