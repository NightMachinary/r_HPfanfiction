Yeah I agree that Lush is a better love interest for Harry but I don't mind Enna because she's really temporary while Lush has eternity to spend with Harry. Consider it a period of maturation for Lush. She acted really wrongly when she raped Harry so she has around 100 years to fix her shit so she's worthy of Harry.
