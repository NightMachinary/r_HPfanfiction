linkffn(The Life and Times) - the fic that got me into marauders-gen fics. Some of the bits/plot points at the beginning are a bit rough, but the writing matures a lot throughout the story, and it has some really lovely parts and overall great characterization and storybuilding. The author is still out there, but I think she's moved on from fanfic.
