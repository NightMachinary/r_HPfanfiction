Corporal punishment is a very vague subject and how okay I am with it depends entirely on the context. I do not think a kid is unduly harmed from occasionally getting slapped as the highest level of immediate punishment and behaviour control, but systematic and deliberate usage of pain as punishment is only gonna tan the kid's hide (at best) or harm him outright. It's more of a shock tool than educational in any way.
