  A father of my son's friend has Italian ancestry, and he once proudly claimed that he had often been beaten for nefarious deeds:” Hey, my parents are Italian, so you know the deal. I can even show you my scars!”

There's nothing inherently ethnic about corporal punishment. Just take a look at literary works from pretty much everywhere up to a few decades ago and you'll find it an extremely common practice that has mostly died out in the first world. If your friend has scars from punishment it's because his parents were deviants, not italian.
