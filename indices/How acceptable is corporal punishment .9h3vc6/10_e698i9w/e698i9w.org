You don't spank children who had already suffered abuses before. If such thing happens in a fic, it's instant stop for me.

I'm not sure spanking is an American thing though, more like Asian or Southern Europe. When I was in China, my coworkers talked freely about spanking their own, and are generally of the opinion that such acts are necessary. Outside of big (well developed) cities, I've seen people doing that in public.

A father of my son's friend has Italian ancestry, and he once proudly claimed that he had often been beaten for nefarious deeds:” Hey, my parents are Italian, so you know the deal. I can even show you my scars!”
