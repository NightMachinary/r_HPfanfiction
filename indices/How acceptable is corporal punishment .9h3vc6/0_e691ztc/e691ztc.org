I nope out and think it's a fetish thing.

I have to say though, the other side of it is applying today's standards (where the vast majority of the western world agree that hitting children is wrong and harmful) to parenting practices in the 80s and 90s. The books mention the Weasleys parents hitting their children after serious misbehaviour and Harry makes light of physical punishment himself. Yet in fanfic we often see Molly saying things like "I would never hit my children." That simply isn't true and was an attitude that was not common until the late 90s. The difference is, and you have picked up on the Americanism here - is that it was usually a cuff round the ear or a wallop on the backside in momentary anger, rather than that American calmness around it? It feels evangelical.
