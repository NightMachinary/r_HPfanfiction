Of course its stupid not to punish children for breaking established rules but i believe that pain shouldnt be part of this. Maybe i am sheltered but pretty much all the kids i see in RL seem quite well raised, while the only friend of mine who was raised with corporal punishment left his parents house at 17 and never had contact with his parents again
