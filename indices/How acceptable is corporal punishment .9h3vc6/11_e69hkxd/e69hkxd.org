I went to a catholic school and the usual punishment was to go to the front of the class and stay there still the whole hour, sometimes holding your books in your hands, some older teachers didn't minded using a ruler on us or dragging us by the ear all the way to the equivalent of the headmistress. Honestly, it didn't really bother us at all and we never saw anything wrong with it. We did wrong, so we got punished, that was all.

From my point of view all of this didn't start to be seen as wrong until the media started showing extreme cases of abuse that had nothing to do with just punishment a few decades ago. Nowadays I feel kids feel entitled to much more because of all the anti punishment media, and this makes kids believe they shouldn't be punish no matter what they do. Basically we have gone to the other extreme, we are raising Dudleys all over the world.

That is to say, based on the timeframe of the HP world, some punishment is perfectly appropriate, just don't go to the extreme unless you are making an abused!h story, there is a difference between punishment and abuse.
