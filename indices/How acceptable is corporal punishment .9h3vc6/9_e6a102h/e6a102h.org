I was born in the early 70s, I was spanked by my parents, and slippered at my prep school (they got rid of caning in my first year there), at a guess something like half a dozen times a year. My personal experience, and my impression of society at large, is that it would stop around about age 12 to 14. Reasons? Who knows, but I suppose some combination of recognising that kids that age are beginning to become miniature rational adults instead of animalistic children and so would not react as intended to a spanking, and also because at that age you begin to be capable of hitting back and it actually mattering.

Spanking young children was completely normal in Britain until the early 90s.
