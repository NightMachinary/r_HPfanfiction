The question exists in too many contexts:

Do I accept corporal punishment in real life? I don't have kids, so I haven't had to make the call.

Do I accept corporal punishment in fics? Absolutely, if it follows a consistent use by the character.

Is it alright if I see spanking in a fic? Not really, because it isn't funny - if you see it in fanfic, it's usually done to drum up emotions of sympathy (or excitement), and that's not my thing. If it's funny, we're fine.

Do I think the wizarding world accepts corporal punishment? Hell, yes. Half the characters were raised before the notions of Dr. Spock would have filtered down into magical culture, so they'd accept it without question. Also worth mentioning, the wizarding world is very unsympathetic to injuries and emotional pain, probably due to the use of spells and potions to immediately correct the damage.

Altogether, my reaction to seeing it in a story is 'why?'. If I agree to the 'why', we can move on.
