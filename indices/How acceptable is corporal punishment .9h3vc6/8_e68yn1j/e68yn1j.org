Corporal punishment seems to be a matter of ignorance, more than anything. It should be frowned upon and parents should be properly educated and instructed on how to raise their children.

To explain, spanking your child /doesn't work/. It doesn't improve their behavior or really incentivize them to alter their future actions. So all a parent spanking a child is achieving are trust issues and resentment.
