Maybe it would be more accurate to say it definitely /can/ work. It doesn't always work, but neither does it never work. In fact, it probably fails more often than it works, but I know that it can work quite successfully sometimes. As for your last sentence, I don't really understand it, but I'll just elaborate on what I was trying to say before.

I believe it's occasionally effective when used on a child not used to corporal punishment. For example, when corporal punishment is used for very serious wrongdoings, e.g., stealing, hitting another child, etc., as someone mentioned earlier in this post. Then the punishment stands out and the child will remember it in the long run. They may not fully understand why what they did was wrong, but they probably won't do it again for a long time. It's a very superficial way of discipline, as the child still has the underlying problems that caused their wrongful behaviour in the first place, but it works well enough to curb the worst of the child's wrongdoings in many cases. Of course, it depends on personality as well. A more timid child might be more susceptible to this harsher discipline, for example.

Sustained corporal punishment over a longer period of time however, generally results in children becoming desensitised to corporal punishment. My primary school teachers used the cane on us quite liberally. Rude in class? A smack. Got below 70% on the test? Two smacks. Talked in class? Another smack. Personally, it just made me loathe school and look for ways to dull the pain (this sounds a bit ominous, but I'm honestly just referring to a school-wide practice of rubbing superglue onto our hands in the belief that it would absorb the impact. Still not sure if it helped at all). There were kids who were taken to the Principal's office and caned every week. Obviously, they didn't stop doing whatever it was they'd done to get themselves into trouble.
