Disclaimer: I don't believe in corporal punishment.

But. It works. It's not all that effective, especially in the long run, and has more negative effects than good. However, growing up in a culture that normalised corporal punishment, I can say that it definitely works - on some people. Specifically, children who are rarely subjected to corporal punishment.
