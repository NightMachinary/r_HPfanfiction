I don't like it at all, both in real life and in fiction, and I really don't want to read about Snape spanking a young Harry after rescuing him (it seems to be common for this type of story and oh I hate it). Also spanking teenagers, nope. I usually drop the fic immediately.

If it's consensual BDSM between adult, it's a different matter. I want a warning though so I can decide if I want to read it or not.
