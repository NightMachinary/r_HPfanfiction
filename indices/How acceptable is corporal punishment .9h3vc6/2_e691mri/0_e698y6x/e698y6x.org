I don't like to read it, but I do think it's realistic. Snape, a boy raised by a drunken, abusive, uneducated father and a mother who didn't help at all... yeah, he isn't going to be reading parenting manuals. He would treat Harry with the strict discipline we see in the classroom, which could be considered abusive, like threatening to poison Neville's pet.

Spanking teenagers is just weird though.
