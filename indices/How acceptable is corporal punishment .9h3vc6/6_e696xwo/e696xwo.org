Threads like these remind me that I'm one of probably only a handful of Asians on this sub. Depending on where you come from, spanking a minor can be acceptable in some cases. Non-whackjob Asian households cane kids only after very severe offences such as stealing stuff or beating up other kids. My family was the same. Of course, caning should only be used hand-in-hand with explaining what the child did wrong. And caning should be stopped after a child reaches emotional maturity. So I guess many Asian people would find corporal punishment okay.
