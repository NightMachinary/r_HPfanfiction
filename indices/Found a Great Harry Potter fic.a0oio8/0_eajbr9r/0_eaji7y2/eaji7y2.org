The summary of the story isn't actually a summary, it just says that the fic is Snape being tasked with taking the letter to the boy no one has seen in a decade.

OP is right when he says that telling more about the fic would lessen its impact, being a "horror" fic, but while the descriptions and characterisations are quite good, the story itself is quite meh. I felt that the author was trying too hard to make a horror story, and ended up with something that more or less leaves you scratching your head wondering what you just read. You also find yourself raising your eyebrows and going, "Really?" every now and then.

It's not nearly as horrifying as the user below is making it out to be, and it doesn't really catch you off guard all that much. Right from the first paragraph, there's signs that this isn't a regular story.

The thing that I'm really curious about is where the Dursleys are getting so many animals from. That can't be cheap.
