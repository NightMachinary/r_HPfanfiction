What caught me off guard specifically was the animal stuff That's where my initial "WTF" came from.

I obviously knew that the story was headed in a dark direction and was prepped for that because of the atmosphere it built up, but the animals just seemed over the top and edgy to me. Just horror for the sake of being horror at that point.
