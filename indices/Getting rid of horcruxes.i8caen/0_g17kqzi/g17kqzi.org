Well, the rule appears to be that Horcruxes are unmade if they are damaged beyond repair; the corrosive properties of Basilisk venom, which cannot be reversed by any known magic save Phoenix tears (which would be antithetical to Horcrux-magic anyway), are one way to do this; so is Fiendfyre; in the case of a living Horcrux, death is another simply because no magic can truly reverse death. Interestingly, this implies that if the living Horcrux had themselves created a Horcrux of their own, killing their body might not do the trick, as they could just resurrect themselves later and so wouldn't have been damaged "beyond repair" --- the surest way to safeguard one's immortality might be a two-person pact, making one another Horcruxes. Of course, Dark Wizards rarely have anyone they'd trust enough for that.

Anyway... the point I was driving at was, there is a simple logic to unmaking the Horcrux curse, and a Gringotts curse-breaker would simply be very good at implementing that method; I don't believe they'd have some completely unrelated ability to do it instead. There could be other, obscure, irreversible destructive spells /like/ Fiendfyre that we don't hear about, though. Maybe some forms of Dragon-fire work the same as Fiendfyre, for example.

All that being said, there /might/ be other avenues canon doesn't speak about. For example, it's often been proposed that a Dementor could probably suck a soul-shard out of a Horcrux, just as it could suck it out of a living being. Of course, the question thus rests on whether a Dementor "digests" the souls it eats, or simply traps them inside itself. If it's the latter, then the Dementor would essentially become a Horcrux and, considering how hard it is to destroy a Dementor, that wouldn't really get you anywhere.

It's also been suggested that chucking the Horcrux through the Veil of Death would probably cancel out its power as an anchor: Horcruxes work by anchoring the "main" soul to the mortal realm via its shards, so if you manage to transport the Horcrux into the Afterlife (whether or not it's even /destroyed/ by this process!), the Dark Wizard would lose that anchor.

By the same token, /Cursed Child/-style time-travel would probably work --- if you change Time so that the Horcrux was never made in the new timeline, then you can kill Voldemort in the new Horcrux-less timeline; the Horcrux has either stopped existing, or, at best, it now exists in a parallel timeline out of the Dark Lord's reach.

Yet another amusing option might be the soul-shards bringing about their own destruction: if e.g. Diarymort had succeeded in gaining a physical body, he'd likely have begun to fear for his /own/ existence, and tried to create "meta-Horcruxes". Repeat enough times and you'll likely hit the sorts of limits that caused Voldemort Prime's soul to begin to unravel by 1981; in their paranoia, the sentient Horcruxes would split themselves one time too many and implode into nothing.
