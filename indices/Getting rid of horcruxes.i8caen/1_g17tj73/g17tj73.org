It depends on what the object/soul container is, IMO. The diary, cup, ring, locket and diadem are all self contained objects, so the Horcrux inhabits the entire thing. Nagini we don't know enough about - is the Horcrux inhabiting the whole body, or just part of it? /Decapitation/ with Gryffindor's Sword destroyed her, but what if Neville had cut off the last foot of her tail instead? Would that have worked?

Harry, on the other hand, we have a possible solution for, which I have seen done in a few fics: Muggle surgery. The Horcrux is in Harry's scar, so excising the area around it takes the scar with it, leaving Harry alive and a Horcrux sitting in a patch of skin. When whatever life is left in the skin fades and dies, the Horcrux is destroyed.
