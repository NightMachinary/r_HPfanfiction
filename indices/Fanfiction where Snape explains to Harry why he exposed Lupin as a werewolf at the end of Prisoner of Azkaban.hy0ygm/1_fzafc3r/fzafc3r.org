Tbh the whole not telling anyone about sirius's animagus form, only telling Harry that he is a friend of his father because he has to, and never sending Harry a single letter afterwards should prove pretty simple overall that Lupin is not loyal to Harry (and commitment issues with Tonks)

Would want to read this story too tbh, though i am curius about what the in-story reason is for Harry going to Snape and actually expecting a response. And for Snape actually telling Harry instead of giving him detention for beeing a dunderhead.

(And is Snape right about Lupin, and not just lying to punish the marauders?)
