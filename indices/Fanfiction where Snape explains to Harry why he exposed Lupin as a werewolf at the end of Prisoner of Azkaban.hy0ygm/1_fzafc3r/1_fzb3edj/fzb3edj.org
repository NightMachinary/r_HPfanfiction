In canon none of the professors (Mcgonagall, Flitwick, or Hagrid) tell many stories about Harry's Parents even after they hear that he was told that his parents were drunks and died in a car crash. So even Lupin's conduct is not so surprising.

And I think all of their conduct is what helps create the justification of the manipulative Dumbledore trope. Eg why do none of them tell Harry more about his parents then he looks like james with lily's eyes and they were good in transformation and charms? So those stories take the story arc that Dumbledore tells them not to talk to Harry about Harry's parents.

And with Snape's behavior up to that point I'm not sure why Harry would even listen to Snape at all let alone believe any explanation that Snape gives.

And Lupin not telling about Sirius' animagus form is easily explained by two words "plot reasons". If he had told then Sirius wouldn't have escaped and you wouldn't have had the third book.
