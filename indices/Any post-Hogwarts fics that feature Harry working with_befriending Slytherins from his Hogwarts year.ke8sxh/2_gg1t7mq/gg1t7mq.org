The great thing about Harry having a relationship with non-Gryffindor women (or men) is that it significantly opens the number of stories that you can explore. Here are a couple to consider that include Slytherins:

- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]]" features Draco helping Harry recover from his long-term alcohol induced stupor. Harry plays relationship chicken with Daphne. linkffn(6257522)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898815/1/Wheels-Within-Wheels-Part-1][Wheels Within Wheels]]" features a marriage contract between Harry and Daphne with them becoming a power couple. There are 3 separate fics covering roughly 20 years. The first one is linked here. linkffn(12898815)
