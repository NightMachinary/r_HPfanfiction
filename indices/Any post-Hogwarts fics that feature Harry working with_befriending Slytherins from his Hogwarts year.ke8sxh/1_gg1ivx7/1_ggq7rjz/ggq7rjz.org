It would be funny and surprising if your fic ended up as a Harry/Daphne pairing. They've been friendly every time they encountered each other (~4 times through 100 chapters). However, it wouldn't make sense with how the plot has developed to this point.

My favorite female interactions for Harry in your story thus far have been with Helena, Sophie, Gemma, and Lisa.
