I remember really enjoying books 1-4 despite a lot of the issues (I was on a Honks binge at the time, though), but the contrived drama that occurs during book 5 that seems to have just been caused by everyone holding the idiot ball and acting out of character was what killed it for me. Which is a shame, because I was looking forward to how the series really diverged during book 6.

I tried starting it again but couldn't find it in me to go through even book 1. Also I've read quite a few H/T fanfics (series and ome-shots) and this doesn't ring a bell for me. Hopefully someone finds it and it's good, I wouldn't mind checking it out.
