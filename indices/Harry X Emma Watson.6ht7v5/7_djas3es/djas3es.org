Reminds me of a story idea I had that I wrote down a few months ago.

"Someone starts publishing a not quite accurate version of Harry's story, and then wants to make a movie, so Harry takes on the fake name of Daniel Radcliffe and gets his own role in the movie while slowly trying to get the full truth into the script."
