I really want this to be a thing. I know this wouldn't be a serious fic but I think it has the potential to be hilarious as all can be.

Edit:

Maybe the story could revolve around the cliche of the characters watching the movies and Harry deciding that Emma is really attractive. He then proceeds to obsess over her creating awkward situations between him, Ron and Hermione because Harry is attracted to an actor portraying Hermione.

Eventually, Harry caves and reveals himself to her in some way (maybe after deciding that some of her social work is attractive?) Crazy shenanigans than ensue
