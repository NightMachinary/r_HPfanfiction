Canonically, he actually may be the author of the phrase, or the one who isolate it from ordinary talk (HPDH, chapter 18, “The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore”), WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN. However, we have no proof he ever used it ever since, especially because it was so much misused by Grindelwald later.

We have absolutely no evidence he ever uttered the phrase seriously since, and it seems (chapter 35, “King's Cross”) he regretted his friendship (or whatever it was) with Grindelwald ever since, so it seems ridiculous he would ever say it. Like somebody casually declaring “Arbeit March Frei” after The Second World War.
