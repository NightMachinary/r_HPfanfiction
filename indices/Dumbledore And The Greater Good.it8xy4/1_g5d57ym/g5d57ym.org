Literally the only direct 'link' between Big D and the Greater Good phrase was someone's eulogy during Albus' funeral. Something to the effect of "He always worked for the greater good of others" or something. Not a reference to the Grindelwald slogan, just a general comment about him being selfless.

He could've developed it before or with Grindelwald during their association, but we don't really know for certain.

But otherwise, it's a common Knight Templar style justification for doing things generally disapproved of by society. If Dumbledore is the type to kill a child to save millions, then he'll likely be the type to have that sort of mindset. "We do terrible things for the best of reasons." and all that.
