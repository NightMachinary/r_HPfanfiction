If you like the Harry-Hermione pairing and are willing to read stuff of questionable quality to get your fix of it, that particular author's fics are easy to find and are pretty much all just shrink wrap around that pairing.

Plus, on the technical side their writing isn't that bad, it's using their plot devices and making their romance believable that they have problems with. And when someone is looking for a “guilty pleasure” stuff to read, these things probably are secondary at best.

Or at least that's what I gathered from my time here. I tried to read one of their fics at some point, got a few chapters in, and got bored; meh.
