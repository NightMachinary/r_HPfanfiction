Spoiler

Harry raised by goblins, goblins are nice and just want to be equal to goblins, Harry gets sword of gryfindor and somehow becomes “guardian of hogwarts” Harry Hermione pairing whose parents are supporting of an early marriage, Dumbledore gets kicked from the castle and ends up evil, Hermione gets a goblin sword and uses it expertly, Harry can kill dementors, Voldemort is free for longer with a few followers and releases inferi at the World Cup and goblins save the day, the story concludes at the third task with Harry Hermione Padma and Neville killing Voldemort with one other person I can't remember right now. Oh and Harry becomes a baron and owns a lot of land. Probably not the best summary but it's so long that's the major events I remember.
