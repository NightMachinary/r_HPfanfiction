Durmstrang from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

The Transfiguration Guild from some OP Harry fic I don't remember - it's either Pendant of Slytherin, Saga of the Lightning Speaker, or one of Stargon1's series. Maybe Cadmean Victory? Can't remember.

The apprenticeship system in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) sort of counts as this.
