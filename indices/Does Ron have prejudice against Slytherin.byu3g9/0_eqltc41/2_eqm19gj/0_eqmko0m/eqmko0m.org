I feel like comparing Slytherin to the Hitler Youth is a bit unfair. Slytherin isn't the Hitler Youth, it's Eton and other schools like it in the UK. It's for upper class children who grow up to be disproportionately influential adults, many of whom are incredibly reactionary. These schools play a massive role in upholding the class structure in the UK. Most of the leaders of the British fascists attended those types of schools, as well as many colonialists. JK Rowling was a single mother on benefits so naturally she portrayed magical Eton as a place that produced terrible people.
