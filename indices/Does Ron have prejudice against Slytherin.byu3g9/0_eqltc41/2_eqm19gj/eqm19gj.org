Slytherin House was founded explicitly to segregate students based on their blood purity. Saying somebody is "prejudiced against Slytherin" is like saying somebody is "prejudiced against Hitler Youth."

I know that Slytherin as a house doesn't /only/ care about blood purity --- it cares about ambition and cunning and so on --- but at the same time, Hitler Youth wasn't /only/ about Nazism --- it also taught kids about hiking and camping and stuff.

And I understand that most kids don't choose to be sent to Slytherin, and it's unreasonable to assume every 11 year old is a blood purist beyond saving. But at the same time, it's totally delusional to pretend that Slytherin as an institution exists on equal ethical foundations to every other house, or that it doesn't play a role in indoctrinating wizarding youth into an evil ideology.

People always get so very defensive about Slytherin, and act as if it was treated unfairly by Rowling, but the blood purity in the books is a /very/ obvious magical analogue for real world racism. Slytherin, the Death Eaters and the Ministry all embody very unpleasant and and all too real racist institutions. People in this fandom sometimes glorify Death Eaters, but if you replaced the muggle lynching in Book 4 with its real world historical counterpart I doubt they would feel so comfortable romanticizing prejudice.

And again, I'm not saying that everyone who identifies with Slytherin is a Nazi, but at the same time nobody should act so outraged that Magical Hitler Youth wasn't portrayed in a positive light.
