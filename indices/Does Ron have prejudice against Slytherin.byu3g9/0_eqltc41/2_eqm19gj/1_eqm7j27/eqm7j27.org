If Salazar Slytherin's history and ideology are well known, and people are aware that his house is being used a propaganda mill to brainwash impressionable kids into being wizarding Nazis, isn't it the moral responsibility of all the Headmasters over the last 1000 years to do something about the issue? Yet Dumbledore didn't do anything about it, and neither did his predecessors, and neither did Harry Potter. Because Slytherin house exists to the present day, and even to 2020, where Harry's son gets sorted into Slytherin and will therefore, as you said, undergo racist indoctrination as well.

Instead of pointing fingers at Slytherin being the Evil House, perhaps it's worth considering that the entire social institution of Wizarding Britain propagates its beliefs and sustains its existence, by virtue of the fact that they allow it to exist. Some people criticize the ideology, some people fight against it, some people steer clear of Slytherin members. But they don't do anything about the House itself. If there's an analogy to be found, I'd imagine it'd be that.

  *ALBUS:* Dad . . .

  *ALBUS pulls on HARRY's robes. HARRY looks down.*

  Do you think --- what if I am --- what if I'm put in Slytherin . . .

  *HARRY:* And what would be wrong with that?

  *ALBUS:* Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It's not a House of brave wizards.

  *HARRY:* Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew. Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus. I promise you, there is nothing to be frightened of there.

Harry Potter himself is part of the system!
