  If Salazar Slytherin's history and ideology are well known, and people are aware that his house is being used a propaganda mill to brainwash impressionable kids into being wizarding Nazis, isn't it the moral responsibility of all the Headmasters over the last 1000 years to do something about the issue?

It absolutely is --- I fully agree.

  Instead of pointing fingers at Slytherin being the Evil House, perhaps it's worth considering that the entire social institution of Wizarding Britain propagates its beliefs and sustains its existence, by virtue of the fact that they allow it to exist. Instead of pointing fingers at Slytherin being the Evil House, perhaps it's worth considering that the entire social institution of Wizarding Britain propagates its beliefs and sustains its existence, by virtue of the fact that they allow it to exist. Some people criticize the ideology, some people fight against it, some people steer clear of Slytherin members. But they don't do anything about the House itself. If there's an analogy to be found, I'd imagine it'd be that.

Again, I fully agree. They should have done something about Slytherin decades ago, but blood purity is a prevalent and socially accepted ideology the magical Britain. And that's sadly not hard to believe --- racial segregation existed in the USA all the way until the mid 50's.

But I also think you're deflecting somewhat. You can't say that Sytherin isn't evil just because the rest of wizarding society bares some responsibility for allowing it's existence. That would be like saying Jim Crow laws weren't evil because the rest of America shared some of the blame.

Also, I think JKR said that canon Slytherin was reformed after the war, and it now admits muggleborns and doesn't segregate based on blood purity, so perhaps the depiction of Slytherin in the Cursed Child makes sense in that context.
