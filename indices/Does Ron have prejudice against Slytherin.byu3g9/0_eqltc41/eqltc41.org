It's not that Ron has a prejudice against Slytherin, [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/596635888446218240?lang=en][*JK Rowling has a prejudice against Slytherins.*]]

To quote the great creator:

#+begin_quote
  "Not all Slytherins think they're racially superior. But all those who do are Slytherins."
#+end_quote

.

We can look at how Slytherins are portrayed in terms of characters. The Slytherin students at Hogwarts are described in terms of their physically ugly looks more than other Houses. Flint's teeth, Draco's pointy face, Pansy's pug nose, Crabbe and Goyle's trollish looks and demeanor. Slughorn, Regulus, and Andromeda Tonks are held up as "good" Slytherins, but Andromeda is a barely there character, Regulus didn't turn because he decided that racism was bad. He turned because his beloved family servant was tortured by Voldy. Slughorn can't remember his students' names and thinks Lily was so talented she couldn't have been Muggleborn.

  "Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good."
#+end_quote

Gee, I guess she's a credit to her race. He also does this to Tom Riddle, who is known as a charity student of uncertain background.

#+begin_quote
  "I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple. I have excellent contacts at the Ministry."

  "I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away. "I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing."

  "Nonsense," said Slughorn briskly, "couldn't be plainer you come from *decent wizarding stock,* abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet."
#+end_quote

Thanks, Slughorn. You are the most positively portrayed Slytherin the story has ever had.

.

And how is Slytherin introduced in the books? Before Harry even meets Ron, who fanon has decided hates those "Slimy Slytherins", we have this:

#+begin_quote
  "I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been---imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you? I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window.

  "That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. ‘He works at Hogwarts.'

  "Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"

  "He's the gamekeeper,'" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  "‘etter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,' said Hagrid darkly. ‘There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."
#+end_quote

.

Harry was never going to end up in Slytherin, no matter what the Hat told him about all houses having good potential for him. The Hat can say one thing, but JKR knows differently.

#+begin_quote
  "I always imagine that the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on, because it's strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it."
