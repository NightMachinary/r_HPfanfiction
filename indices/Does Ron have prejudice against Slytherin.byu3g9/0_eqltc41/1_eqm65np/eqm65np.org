Wait, is this Rowling's actual line?

Does she imagine that muggles, muggleborns, half-bloods, and purebloods are different /races/....?

That's absolutely ridiculous, even if you assume she's talking about Slytherins and not putting forth her own interpretation.... since the opposite of this is racially equal, which assumes race to be a relevant idea for magical people.

I can't even begin to get into just how stupid this is, on so many levels.

What we colloquially know as "races" (black, white, Asian, etc) are just generalizations of genetic differences presented by geographic distance and difference.

Scientists isolate differences in genes and smaller genetic data like alleles to form region-dependent haplogroups. This genetic clustering can be broken down to even smaller but genetically distinct regions - to the level of even regions within France - but there is highest variation between the wider circles, such as Europe or Asia.

Canon magic is clearly shown to be a near random thing, and one that presents in Indians (Patils), Africans (Shacklebolt), Asians (Chang), and is even random within those races - is a muggleborn with magic suddenly a different race....?

This framing by Rowling makes absolutely no sense. Much like many things in her books, I suppose.
