No he isn't. He shows "some" prejudice on the Horgwarts Express (when he says to Harry that every bad wizard went to Slytherin), but he is only 11 at this point (and most of this prejudice comes from his parents I would say). I have a lot more problems with a character like Hagrid, who shows the same prejudice while in his 50's (or 60's?).

Once at school, I don't remember Ron showing any prejudice to Slytherin, in fact I don't even remember Ron showing any thoughts to Slytherins. He hates Malfoy (that always try to edge him on with Harry) and his gangs, but beyond that he doesn't seem to care at all about the other Slytherins in school.

Even Harry seems to show more anti Slytherin prejudices, saying things like all the Slytherins hate him (though he had it's because he keeps beating them at Quidditch, showing some kind of . . . innocence in the middle of a civil war).

So no, I don't think Ron ever been truly prejudiced against Slytherin (except maybe right after the "Weasley is our King" song, though he could have redirected all his anger on Malfoy), and his fanon characterization of "You can't be with her, she is a /Snake/!" is just that, fanon.
