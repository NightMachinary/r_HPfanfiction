  No he isn't. He shows "some" prejudice on the Horgwarts Express (when he says to Harry that every bad wizard went to Slytherin), but he is only 11 at this point (and most of this prejudice comes from his parents I would say). I have a lot more problems with a character like Hagrid, who shows the same prejudice while in his 50's (or 60's?).

That's a very good point, especially since it was Hagrid and not Ron who said the line about bad wizards going to Slytherin. The movie gives Ron the line, mainly because Harry's first meeting with Malfoy was cut and the movie needed to give Harry a reason to plead with the Sorting Hat to not put him in Slytherin.

On the train ride, Ron's main concern is what his family will say if he's not in Gryffindor like everyone else. His line is "I don't suppose Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

(Even here he's echoing Hermione, who has just come and gone, saying that she wants to be in Gryffindor because it sounds "by far the best, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad.")

You're right otherwise... I went through the books and Ron barely mentions Slytherin at all, Over the course of the series he really only has two real anti-Slytherin moments (once where he's upset at learning Salazar Slytherin was the one who started this whole "Pureblood" thing, and once after the Sorting Hat has urged the Houses to stand together and Ron's all "I'm not standing together with Slytherins").

So I would say he has SOME prejudices, but of the main three characters Ron definitely displays the LEAST anti-Slytherin prejudices.
