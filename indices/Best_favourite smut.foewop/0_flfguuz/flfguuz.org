[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It could only Happen to Harry]] is just imo flat out the best one ever written. It's not romance which might turn some people off, but aside from some aspects of the first chapter, when it tries to be funny it's generally actually funny, the characters feel like they TALK like canon, which is a goddamn rarity in that genre, and the scenes themselves feel well, realistic. It takes a few strides outside of realism but it knows it's at least aware it's doing so and I think pulls it off well. The author put serious effort into making it feel like Harry was hooking up /with these characters/ as opposed to writing scenes and throwing names on there.

If you've only read this a while ago, the author finally finished it. IMO the last few chapters read a bit more like they wanted to write and felt obligated to finish it rather than they wanted to finish the story, but it's not like ......some where the ending was so unsatisfying it was worse than the cliffhanger. They did a good job overall.
