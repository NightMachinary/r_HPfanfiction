linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is without doubt the best one. Amazing adventure story where Harry is sent back to 1978. Just completely brilliant.

linkao3(Strange Visitors from Another Century by Izzyaro) is also very good. Trio are sent to the Founders era. Good there's a lot of back story with the Founders wars.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is good fun. Harry is sent to Marauders era but doesn't get on with the marauders. It's an interesting conflict and we learn a lot about Sirius.

Also linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680]]) is worth reading just for Teddy Lupin. Him and Harry end up in OoTP times. It's worth reading just for the chapter where they end up in Grimmauld Place. Teddy Lupin is a goddam treasure and I love him so so much it hurts. He has bit goggles and a sparkly bag and eugh he's completely amazing I adore him. This fic is... Rounded off but not conclusively completed. It was obviously a set up for a bigger story that never got written but what's there is really good and again, Teddy ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hope that helps üòä a bit of everything I think.
