linkffn(Unfogging the Future by Naidhe) Lavender/Tom Riddle. One of the most unique time travel fics I've ever read.

linkffn(Narcissa's Chance by ReluctantSidekick) Harry/Bella/Narcissa. Harry saves them from their future husbands.

linkffn(Delenda Est by Lord Silvere) linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence) Both Harry/Bellatrix.

linkffa(1678) Harry/Amelia. This one is unfortunately unfinished but still worth a read.

Edit: So apparently linkffa doesn't work correctly rn, here's the link for the last story: [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1678]]
