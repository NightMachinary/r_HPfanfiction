Do you mean "Yuletide Blessing in Disguise"? linkffn(12773140)

I liked the idea. I'd like it even better if Hermione was asked directly by Harry, but there are barely any fics. Wasn't too fond of the execution of this one. They start dating right away and immidiatly confess their undying love, when minutes before Harry didn't even realise Hermione is in fact a girl. They are my favourite pairing. Unfortunatly I rarely find a fic where the plot doesn't go from 10 to 1000. From them being friends to them being married after a week or soulmates or the like.
