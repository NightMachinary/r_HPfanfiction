I agree. Book four gives so many possibilities for it to turn into Harry&Hermione. Despite that there's barely any fic for that written. Either that or they turn OOC really quickly.

"Hermione rescuing Harry" usually turns into Harry at the Grangers which then births either before mentioned OOC H&H or the story drifts into some kind of other fantasy world which could be a completely different universe of its own.

"Sirius mistakes them for dating" would also be interesting if it wouldn't lead to an immideat relationship(which again, rarely happens). It could just be the pre-ball wake up call for Harry that Hermione is actually a girl. (Wasn't year 3 where Cho was first mentioned? So there is some tiny bit of awareness towards girls already.) But since he's young and naive he just pushes it aside until the yule ball comes and there we go.
