Yep. I didn't recall Yuletide fitting this request very well, just that its concept was one I could see fitting the request very well.

Once you get to year 5+ both of them seem to have enough romantic baggage that this seems unlikely without at least one of them working toward it. End of year three would fit well (particularly a 'sirius mistakes them for dating and it snowballs'), but they are a bit young and you have to deal with cannons 'summer resetting Harry to a shitty situation'.

So 4th year seems like the best candidate for this. The ages fit, not a lot of other romantic baggage, there was a period in the book of 'Harry & Hermione vs everyone', and Harry was busy trying to survive the year. And the best chance for a 'just stumble into dating' in forth year would be the Ball.

(Now that I think of it, I could also see Sirius/Hermione doing a summer rescue either before or after forth year kinda fitting this, since you don't have to play up any existing romantic feelings for that, but the Ball still feels like the best way for a 'it just kinda happened' situation in this timeframe...)
