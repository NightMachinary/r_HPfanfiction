Honestly only time I see this fitting in would be right before yule ball or perhaps maybe slug club.

Most h/hr has the secretly pining for each other, and once that one obstacle is removed they get true wuv. The rest tend to be with one side interested and resigned with the other oblivious. Sadily even situations that seem apt at throwing people unexpectantly into a romantic situation (the dreaded marriage law fics), usually fall into one of those two catagory so.

I do recall one fic that was McGonagall going 'harry you have a date yet? No? Hermione, you are drafted' with a predictable follow up from there...
