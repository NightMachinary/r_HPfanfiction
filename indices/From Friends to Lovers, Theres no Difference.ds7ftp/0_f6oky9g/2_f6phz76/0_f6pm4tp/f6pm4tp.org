Smut in longer fics gets repetitive really quickly, and writing good, explicit scenes is one of the most difficult things to do. Like, I have read a lot of fanfics across a few fandoms, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of 10 where it was really done well.

As for a 50 chapter romance, I really struggle when making one-shots into something longer because it is impossible to capture the same spirit; the same narrative tone. And I am quite busy with other projects. I have two ongoing fics (150k words combined) and am working on two other fics as well as at least 2 WiPs. So I am sorry to say, but it won't happen anytime soon.
