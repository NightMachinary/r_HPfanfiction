The thing is, usually, when I write something, I start because I am annoyed by the way a fic I've read turned out. For example, I started to write "No Longer Alone" because I couldn't find one where Harry gets an adoptive family and does NOT end up banging someone from said family. I wrote "Bad at This" because I was annoyed by the angst in the FWB fics I came across. I am writing a Clone Wars oneshot because there was no fic similar to what I was looking for (SW is one of those fandoms which is too canon-compliant IMO)

So usually, I have a very clear idea of what I want to do, what note to end on and so on. And once I get to that point, I have no idea how to continiue.
