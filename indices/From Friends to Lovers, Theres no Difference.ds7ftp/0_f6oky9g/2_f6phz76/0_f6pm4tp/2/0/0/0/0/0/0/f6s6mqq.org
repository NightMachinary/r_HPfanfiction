Yeah I guess.

I just finished reading No Longer Alone and I'm absolutely in love with the fic but ffn won't let me leave a review so just wanted to let you know I LOVE IT and can't wait for the next chapter. I'm all for Dumbledore-bashing but I love the unique way you decided to portray him (hands off and not just a "dumb light side"). I'm so sure there will be repercussions for his weakening influence compared to cannon, so I cant wait to see what goes down.
