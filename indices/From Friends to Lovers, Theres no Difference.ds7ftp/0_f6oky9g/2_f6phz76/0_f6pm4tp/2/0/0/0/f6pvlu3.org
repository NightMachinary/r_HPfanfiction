  And so you choose to end them?

You either die as a hero or live long enough to become a villain. And I'd rather not have my fics compared to struggling artists who drag themselves on stage after 30 years because they need the cash.

The thing is, in my friend circle, we played that one through, and pretty much all of us agreed that, if we, for whatever reason, ended up in a woman's body, none of us would leave the house for the next few days because we would be "busy". And if it's long-term, well, time to dress butch and be a lesbian. We all agreed that it wouldn't be a downgrade.

The thing which really annoys me about them is that Harry suddenly embraces the social side of being a woman with the usual stereotypes (liking make-up, dresses and so on) but struggles with his body. If I were to write one, it would just be business as usual with the exception that Harry now has different plumbing. Which would be a novelty for a week, but get boring rather quickly. So I am not sure if I would be the best to write such a fic.
