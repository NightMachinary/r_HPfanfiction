And so you choose to end them? Honestly, that might be smart, so many fics turn bad bc they continue writing after reaching the goal for their fic. Like, yes I'd love to know how it goes for Harry and Hermione at her parents house in Bad At This or how the rest of the school reacts to them becoming public, but as it is, Bad At This is so good and complete, there really is no need to. I think the way you do things is good (just read Stop Worrying For One Evening, loved it) so I guess I'm trying to say don't feel bad for not giving in to greedy readers asking for more, we're stupid and can't realise that the more we're asking for is not gonna be as good, like addicts.

Quick Edit: I'm obsessed with GenderBender Harry, particularly To Reach Without by InwardTransience (it's so good). Lots of other gb Harry fanfics are really terribly written, do you have any qualms with them and would write something to that effect?
