The thing is, a lot of people want smut. In one of my fics, Harry gets a "You as a girl" polyjuice set as Christmas present from his girlfriend Tonks. And that promptly got me a lot of requests for an explicit scene. I mean, I don't know a guy who wouldn't want to experience sex from the female perspective, which is why I even came up with the idea in the first place, but the thirst for porn really surprised me back then. And I don't think it would have added much to the story in terms of anything really.
