I think there was a Greek myth with a similar thought under it - an oracle (?) was asked what she wanted and she pointed at a pile of dust and said she wants to live as many years as there are dust in the pile and her wish was granted, but she forgot to ask for youth. Years later when she was so old that she was nearly as small as a dust particle herself, she was asked what she wants the most - and she replied /''to die''./

I kinda imagine that centuries later in an undying but ever-aging body Voldemort might wisen up and arrive to the same conclusion...
