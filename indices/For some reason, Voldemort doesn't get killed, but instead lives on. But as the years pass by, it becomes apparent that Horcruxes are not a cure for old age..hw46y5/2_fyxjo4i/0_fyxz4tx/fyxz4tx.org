His manor long since rotted and crumbled, still hosts his throne. And upon that throne, an ancient skeleton sits. Upon its head, a gleaming crown, the only object within many lightyears that is not tarnished, rusted, eroded. The Earth is shrouded in shadow, Sol long since dimmed under a cloak of darkness that covers the star and suppresses its light, though keeps it alive as a twisted anchor. the planets permanently misaligned, their orbits twisted and erratic. Mars, if it were illuminated by anything but the dim brown light of the sun, would be permanently in zenith where ever one stood on Earth. Endless war. A war waged, a war lost, the Earth's life extinguished, its magic chained and prevented from fleeing with its demise. It flowed into the crown, now - all lines of Earth, the once-blood of nature, the magical channels, were bent and twisted towards the crumbling manor, lifting upwards slightly to converge into the crown. The channels of gravity, light and magic spanning the stars, forming the galactic web, long since re-oriented towards the dead star that had once been Sol. There was a hole in the galaxy - large, ever-growing. Within that hole existed a shadow, if one knew how to look. It loomed, twisted and roiled. One by one, the stars surrounding the hole lost their power, had their magic drained and their fusion engines extinguished, their spark of infinity stolen to fuel a dark god the likes of which had never been seen in this universe.
