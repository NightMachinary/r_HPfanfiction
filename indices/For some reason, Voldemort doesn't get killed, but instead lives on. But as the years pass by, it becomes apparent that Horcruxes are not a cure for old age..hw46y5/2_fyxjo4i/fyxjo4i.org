So when I was reading your prompt an idea from star wars popped into my head. In star wars there's this sith lord Darth Nihilius who used the force to drain the life out of people, but it caused damage to his own body to do so. Eventually the guy's body faded away to nothing until he was just a spirit bound into a mask and a set of robes, but in return for this damnation he became the lord of hunger and was able to devour the life from entire planets in mere moments. I can just imagine Voldemort realizing that organic flesh is failing him despite his spirit remaining intact, so he decides to pursue a more advanced form of the wraith existence he had after his defeat. He finds a way to retain his powers in his spirit form, and then to possess physical objects in addition to living creatures. He eventually has his servants give him all their most prized resources and through his own ingenuity creates a magical vessel, a hollow shell almost like a horcrux in its own right, enchanted with the darkest of magics to amplify and channel his power. He abandons his mortal shell and transcends to a new existence wherein he surpasses the limits of the mortal body. Tireless, ceaseless, sleepless, unfeeling and cold, a twisted avatar of dark defiance, the body he makes is an insult to the laws of nature. It is at once a crown and a throne in which the Dark Lord's spirit dwells, and the bindings and magics within it connect to all who bear voldemorts mark. As long as those who bear the mark live the vessel cannot be destroyed, and when they die they are consumed by the vessel further fueling its strength and the strength of the black soul that is seated within it. Eventually, having learned to possess physical objects, Voldemort's presence stretches beyond his physical shell. Struck by the realization that he is not limited to his body he begins to expand his consciousness and binds his spirit to first his throne, and then his throne room, and then his manor, on and on enthralling those within the bounds of his influence and feeding on them to increase his strength. Eventually his black shadow looms over the earth itself and everything in it, all the while his presence permeates the very air and his mind is seated in his twisted crown, a hollow puppet of death and steel, cold as the grave, molded in the shape of a man. Eternal.
