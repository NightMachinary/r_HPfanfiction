In my mind, all Horcruxes can do that if they find a victim who gets overly attached to it, but that would seem unfeasible because every time your Horcrux comes to life, it becomes mortal. And considering that no other wizard than Voldemort had more than a Horcrux, that would mean that you only get to live twice and then spend the rest of eternity in limbo as a flayed baby.
