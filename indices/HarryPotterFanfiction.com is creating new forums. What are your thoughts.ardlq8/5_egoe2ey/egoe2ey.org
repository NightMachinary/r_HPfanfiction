- What would you like to see on these forums? I would love to see a shipping section and threads dedicated to each ship.

- Any old staff from years past interested in making a come back? I was never on that lol.

- What do you miss from the old forums? I don't, I feel like a lot of the old staff ruined it for me, they had rules they didn't follow, and they liked to delete accounts for no reason. I got deleted for rec-ing a fanfiction in the correct board/thread. I was more into the portkey & EWnet forums, good staff and communities.

- What did you dislike about the old forums? ^
