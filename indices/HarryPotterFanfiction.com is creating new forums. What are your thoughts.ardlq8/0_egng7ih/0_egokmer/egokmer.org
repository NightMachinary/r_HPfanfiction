Hi there! Thank you so much for the thoughtful response and for shedding some light on the experience of members from the past.

We are definitely striving to build a brighter future for the site - one that's loving of all skill levels of writers and encourages them to improve their craft through fanfiction.

I'll be reaching out personally to learn more about the difference between old HPFF and the new HPFT.

Thank you again for sharing!
