As a member of HPFF before it went down, and now a member of HPFT, which was created by members of the then dead HPFF after everything went down (literally) - and yes I may not be very active on HPFT at all recently but being a student sucks balls and I'm trying to get back into everything - I know first hand the reactions of those who had to experience the original shutting down announcement (wanna know how bad it was for me? - it was on my 13th birthday when I was having a shitty day IRL and had opened up HPFF for some cheering up) because I was one of those.

HPFF was literally the first thing I would open every day when I got home. I practically lived on the forums. I found the site when I was a lonely 12 year old, and 6 months later it had become integral to my identity. I loved the writing, and the sense of explicit community and a family it was to all of us.

And when it closed down, and all the drama happened with the previous owner (don't want to disparage him so publicly, but it was kinda bad) we members rallied together to rebuild ourselves, this part of our shared identities, and that rebuild in the wake of our shock is what became HPFT, which has grown strength by strength in members, activity and all-around support every day since it officially opened.

I don't want to put down your efforts, as none of the events of the past can at all be blamed in any way on you, Gwen & Ronnie, but in all honesty I'm not at all sure that you would regain many of the previously very-active members from HPFF at the time of its closing, for we (but I do not speak for all of us) seem to have found our home for the next while, at HPFT.

I wish you luck in your endeavour of rejuvenating HPFF, Gwen & Ronnie style of course. HPFF was amazing in the past, although flawed in different ways. Some advice: keep your operations, managing costs, policies etc. transparent and fair. Be just and sure in your decisions, but don't be afraid to admit mistakes and fix them.

I hope you create a loving community for new and old HP fans to come together on HPFF once more, free to write what they want (within reason and advisories/tags as appropriate of course) and speak their opinions and beliefs about everything within, and outside the fandom of HP and any others they may personally enjoy as well.

If you want, feel free to PM me about the differences of old HPFF vs. HPFT now, and what could be changed/fixed. As I try to remember, there will always be room to improve on everything.

Best of luck, always.
