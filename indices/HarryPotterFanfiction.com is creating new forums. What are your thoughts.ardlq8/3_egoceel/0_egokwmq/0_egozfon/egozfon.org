I shall put it this way: there's no effective rating mechanics iirc, like favs in ffn and kudos in ao3. Sometimes I want to make more people to see the great fic I've read, but all I can do is to comment, which I don't think can be used as a filter option right now. This makes the story list very inconsistent, letting great fics mixed up with mediocre ones instead of having a way to make them stand out.
