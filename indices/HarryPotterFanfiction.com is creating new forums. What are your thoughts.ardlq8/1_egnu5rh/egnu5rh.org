I recently re-discovered HPFF.com when I googled my name and found that all of my fics were alive and well on there. I have to say the site itself is pretty gorgeous to read on, and the uploading is amazing (you kept ALL the formatting, even with the one story that had a full outline included! WHAT!).

​

I didn't spend much time on the forums back in the day, though I did love that there was a culture of helpfulness. I still have some fic banners created from back then!

​

I can tell you that what I abhor about the fanfiction.net forums is that it's incredibly difficult to use like an actual forum. If the functionality to find where you've posted in the past is there, I can't find it, which is a problem in and of itself. Their forums are not threaded, which I understand makes it feel more like a 'forum' but it does end up stifling discussion, in my opinion. I've posted to the ffn forums and then never been able to find the post, ever again. While some of that has to do with the fact that they're 'user created,' the overall feeling in the end is that of anarchy. I would participate in fic challenges if I could *ever find the challenge thread again.* So that's some stuff to probably avoid.
