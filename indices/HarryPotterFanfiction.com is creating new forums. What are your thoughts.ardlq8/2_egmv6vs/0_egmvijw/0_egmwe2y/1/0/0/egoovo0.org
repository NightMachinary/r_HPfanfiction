My biggest criticism limited pairing options. With so many 'time turner' stories out there, it's really shortsighted to avoid having relationship tags for some pairings. I mean, I get that there is a balance to be had between wanting the site to be easily navigable and pleasing readers. Perhaps there could be a drop-down in 'other pairing?' I write mostly Hermione/Remus or Hermione/Sirius, and there's just no option for this. These stories are MASSIVELY more popular than any Sirius/OC or Remus/OC stories, but those are in the list. I've written both.

If you're looking for more users, you can't help but expand that if you make it easier to search for the stories they want to read. Since you've got non canon pairings already listed, it seems like the limit has more to do with either habit (the old site's already listed pairings) or popularity (you can't gauge how popular a pairing stuck in 'other pairing' is if you don't separate them by what pairing they are!). I strongly encourage that if the hold up is user interface related, please reconsider. Adding a 'more crowded' pairing list or more drop downs (splitting pairings by era? or having more rare ones in a 'rare' dropdown?) will only encourage people to write and read more of those pairings. If it doesn't, and they're not being used, make them a legacy code and don't make it available anymore.

I love that you guys are looking for suggestions. That is my biggest gripe about the site and it always has been. Having your pride and joy stories stuck in 'other pairing' because it's not an option is a downer.
