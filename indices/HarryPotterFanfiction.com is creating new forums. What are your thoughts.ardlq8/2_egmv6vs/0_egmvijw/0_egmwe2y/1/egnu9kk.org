As someone that's been updating my newest stuff on their site, I will tell you it's a million times easier to upload fics onto harrypotterfanfiction.com than it is on FFN. I've been using FFN since 2003 and my jaw dropped when I recently uploaded one of my chapters on HPFF. I just copied it over from my google doc and it was exactly the same when I hit post. No fiddling with spacing, no adding italics or coding.
