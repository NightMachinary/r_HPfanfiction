This is the first fic in the black queen series, but the main character Jen the twin of the boy who lived is definitely amoral ( though there is some guilt in a couple of the books, but it doesn't change her actions). This is definitely a dark series that deserves a trigger warning for pretty much everything though the only thing that's graphic is blood/ gore and violence. It's an amazing series though, definitely one of my most favorite.
