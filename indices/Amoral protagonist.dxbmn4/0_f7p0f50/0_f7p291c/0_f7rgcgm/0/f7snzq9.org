Haruhi doesn't abide by social norms, but that's not really the same thing as being amoral the way Lily is. Haruhi is rude, pushy, random, etc, but she's never blas√© about death and human suffering the way Lily occasionally is.

I agree that there are similarities because they are both female characters with godlike capabilities stuck in mundane situations, but /Melancholy/ is not the only story with that sort of character dynamic. Overall I think the plot, personality and themes of "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" are driving in a much different direction such that those similarities aren't enough to claim direct inspiration. I suggest asking the author about any anime inspiration she might have had.
