  I don't think that's an accurate statement about that anime. Haruhi doesn't even realize that she is a god, and thus her behavior is roughly as moral as all of her human classmates.

Ehh, I don't know. I remember her doing all sort of weird stuff. Didn't she more all less sexually harass her red-head female friend at some point?

I think that it's undeniable that Lily and the Art of Being Sishiphus is inspired by Haruhi Suzumiya. There are a lot of similarities between the two protagonists.
