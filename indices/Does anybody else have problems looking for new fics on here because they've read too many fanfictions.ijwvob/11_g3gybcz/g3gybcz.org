Honestly i don't read fanfics that much. Used to be 1-2/month, since i started writing them that number is more like 1 every other month. Afraid i will subconsciously rip someone off.

That being said, i'm a member of a HP fanfic author's discord, and there is stilll good stuff being written, it just gets buried by the 1,000s of "Harry is sodomized by a neo-Nazi" and "Hermione is molested by her Potions Prof" fics. You really have to dig to find anything that is well written by someone typing with both hands ðŸ™ƒ
