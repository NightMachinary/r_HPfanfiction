I've been reading Harry Potter Fanfics for about a year now, I am relatively new to it considering, and yet I'm in the same predicament you're in.

​

I have certain fics that I like, for example I prefer the longer, darker, and more realistic side of Fanfics, where Harry grows to become a bit jaded and darker, but still the character we love, so the maturer side of the Fanfic world, however the few good ones I've read and the rest are just poor smut filled nonsense that's incredibly cringy to read.

​

Don't get me wrong I don't mind "Lemons" in stories, it happens, its life, but when it's just the focus point its just awful and mind boggling.

​

So whilst I have not been around for probably as long as most people here have been, I am also just struggling to find stories that interest me.
