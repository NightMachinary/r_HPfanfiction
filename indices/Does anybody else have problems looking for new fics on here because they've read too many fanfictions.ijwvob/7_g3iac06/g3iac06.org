I think my main problem is that I only read fics that are over 100k words, because most of them are bound to be of a decent quality. That plus sort by reviews, along with whatever pairing i feel like at the moment. Ff.net really needs to add sort by wordcount, because if a story is extremely long, it takes me sometime to read it, as I'm able to read 300k words a day if I feel like reading (which I do 90% of my free time)
