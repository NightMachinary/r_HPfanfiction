Very common problem amd if I dont have a fic to read I dont feel right. Used to sort by over 100k words and completed, then it included in progress and slowly the filter is being lowered but the frequency of finding good fic that actually get finished is slowly dropping. After a couple hundred fics all you can do is start over and re-read your favorites.
