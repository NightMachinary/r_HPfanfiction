I mean I have the same issue, but sometimes there are some really great hidden gems both on ao3 and on ffn, just have to look for them. Some of the ones I found a while ago are picking up speed now, which is great for them but I kind of wanted them to stay a secret, y'know? I'm reading one at the minute its pretty good called The Glass Orphan. The author's written two more and she's good. Veery Black Family based.
