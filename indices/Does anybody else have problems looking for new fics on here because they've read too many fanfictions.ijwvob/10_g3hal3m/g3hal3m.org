Everyone has that sort of problem at some time. I suggest going through the DLP library. They have some good reccomendations there. In case you've not read it though, here are some of my recs. Mostly popular stuff. Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness); Linkffn(Circular Reasoning); Linkffn(Ectomancer);

For romance, linkffn(Grow Young With Me); Linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic);
