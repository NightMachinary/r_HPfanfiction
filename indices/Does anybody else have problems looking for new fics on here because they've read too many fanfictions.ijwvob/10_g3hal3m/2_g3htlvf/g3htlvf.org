The library has a lot of quality and not necessarily popularity, everything in there is really well done and there's a lot of stuff you won't find on the front pages of FFN or AO3. They do have a taste for dark Harry and AU fantasy epics, so if you're looking for high quality lighter stuff it might be hard to find everything you're looking for there. But it's always a good start.
