I might have worded that badly.

What I meant to say is that Perfect Slytherins has been my favourite fic for years, and it was only a couple of months ago that I even thought to see if Jeconais had written any other fanfics.

I was super happy to see that they had written a bunch that I didn't know existed. Turns out I really like lots of what they have written.
