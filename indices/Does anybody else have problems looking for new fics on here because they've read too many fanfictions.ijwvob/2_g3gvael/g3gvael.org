I've been reading HP fanfiction for 15 years and obsessively.

I'd say conservative estimate I've read 100 million words of fanfiction (and thats being super conservative)

I still trawl this subreddit occasionally and get new suggestions a surprisingly high amount of the time.

Sometimes you just randomly miss good fics and you think 'how have I never read this?'

For example, my favourite fic is Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais. Only a couple of months ago I discovered he/she has written a bunch more, and for some reason I had just never checked them out.

So that was a fun time.
