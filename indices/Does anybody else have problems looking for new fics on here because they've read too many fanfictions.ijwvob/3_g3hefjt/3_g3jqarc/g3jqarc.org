Too true, since I started reading fan fictions on my phone, reading physical books seems like a lot more work and money (I still read books, just not as much). So sometimes it's a little strange when people ask what I like to do in my spare time, and my answer is reading. When they ask what books, it's just, uhh...

I usually try to recall some random books that I've read before, because fanfiction has a bit of a stigma against it. I'm definitely addicted to fanfiction, but not exactly alone in that matter
