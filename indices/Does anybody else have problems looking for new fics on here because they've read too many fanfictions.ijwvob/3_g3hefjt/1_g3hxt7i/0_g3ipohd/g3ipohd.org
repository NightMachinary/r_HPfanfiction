Honestly yeah. I rarely go a day were I don't have my phone out in class just reading fanfics. It's so much more interesting that most of what we learn. Somehow, I've become so good at hiding my phone, that it has only been confiscated about 2-3 times in around 3 years. And it's not even that the teachers don't care, whenever they see another kids phone they take it. Somehow they always miss mine.

Fanfiction had taken over my life. Not sure how I feel about that cause I've got around 70 books I have sitting on my shelf waiting to be read. It's already ruined English for me. Spelling and grammar mistakes I just read over cause I've gotten used to sub-par fics.

I don't suppose anyone else has realised the similarities between Shakespeare and fanfiction? In class we're looking at Othello, and it's honestly just a really shitty fanfic. My teacher mentioned that there was an interpretation of Othello in which the genders of the characters were swapped, and it's given me a headache with how cringey it would be. Apparently, it was a complete failure, but the fact that it exists kills me.
