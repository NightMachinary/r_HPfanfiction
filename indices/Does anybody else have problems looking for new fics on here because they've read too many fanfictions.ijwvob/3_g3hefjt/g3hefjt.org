It's weird. I used to read books all the time, but because I can read fanfiction on my phone wherever I am, I'm constantly reading fanfiction on my phone during my free time, especially if I'm not home. It's a lot easier to just pull up a fic on my phone then carrying around a book everywhere you know?

That eventually leads me to read a TON of fanfiction, including HP.
