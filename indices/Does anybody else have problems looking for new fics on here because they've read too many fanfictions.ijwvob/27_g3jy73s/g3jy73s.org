I extremely rarely read fanfiction now because I went through most of what was published that I wanted to read/considered worth reading a few years ago and it's such an incredible struggle to find something worth reading. The overwhelming majority of fanfiction, even the stuff recommended here, is just absolute garbage. Every once in a great while something sparks interest and ends up being good, but it's rare.

The last long fanfic I read was Antithesis and that was last September. Before that was a half dozen Twiligh femslash stories when I first looked into that a couple months before Antithesis, and then before that was back to August/September of 2018 with four or five HP fics.
