Bruh ive gone through the top hits on ao3 until page 100, and top kudos until page 100 (surprisinglyblittle overlap in the later pages) and now i just wait for this sub to filter stuff out for me.

I cant bring myaelf to read shit stories, so i wait for those that martyr themselves on crap fanfic to find the one good one that ill finiah in an hour and have nothing to read.
