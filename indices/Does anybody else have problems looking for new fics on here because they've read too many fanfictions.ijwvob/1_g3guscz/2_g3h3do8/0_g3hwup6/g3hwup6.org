Ofc. Heres some constructive criticism:

Punctuation: you need to include more commas, m-dashes, and break up lists. You should also try for more descriptor sentences (e.g. the first line should be more akin to:

"Number 12 Grimmauld Place remained silent through this particular night--a rare oasis of peace in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts."

This would concatenate your first two sentences, and draw a picture of what you want the setting to be. Here, being vagur is not your friend--emphasise what you believe to be important characteristics, otherwise readers will never see it that way. When introducing characters, at least give a brief look-see at them. Kreacher might be introduced as "a battered relic of times past" or something like that.

Also, I would give advice on what seema to be the tripping point for most fanfiction writers--dialogue. There needs to be descriptors around it, it needs to feel real, and I only recommend reading LeGuin, and maybe some King to better see what im talking about--its never just two people talking to each other in a vacuum. They are in a place, fiddling with things, feeling emotions, coming from somewhere, going to somewhere--and all of that needs to come through.

Im not going to critique the plot, as I feel that even the worst plot, if written with an adept hand, can be quite good.
