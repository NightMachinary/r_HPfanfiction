I do, but at the same time, I don't. Just let me explain myself.

I've been reading fanfics during four years now, and I think I've seen the most of types of fanfics. Good Voldemort, Drarry, Gray Harry, time travel, Slytherin Harry, fics about other characters like Percy Weasley, the lost sister of Harry, etc. But the thing is that, even when you know the most of the plot, it's still fun to read the histories.

I don't know why, but doesn't care how many times I read about how powerful is Harry at true and how evil is the light side, it still entertaining me. So, yes, I have problems looking for new creative fics, but I never found myself in the search of a fanfic. There's just too many I didn't read!

(Did I explain my point well? English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if this is confuse or it has bad grammatic).
