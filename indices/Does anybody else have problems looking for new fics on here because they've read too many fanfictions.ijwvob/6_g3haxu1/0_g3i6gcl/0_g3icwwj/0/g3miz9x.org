Or where he also is being controlled by Dumbledore who paid off Ron and Ginny, and he's been neglecting his lordships and suddenly there are a lot of rules to remember that never were even hinted at in the books. Also hate it when the author /without fail/ calls Dumbledore "Dumd-as-a-door". Like, once to make fun of him, alright. But every single time??? Don't even get me started on how some people just have the goblins as little angels when someone remembers their name,, because they are CLEARLY little spiteful creatures and hate humans. Case in point: Griphook. I could go on and on.
