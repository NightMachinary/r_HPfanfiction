*Say a Prayer* - linkao3(4629198) Part one of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] series.

I've been throwing this around and seen it thrown around a bit lately.

After Dobby appears, Harry prays to Loki (Marvel). Loki whisks him away after a day or so, and legally adopts him. Dumbledore isn't happy. Hermione does hermione and goes after it like a terrier on a rat. Which annoys Harry and Harry literally explodes when he can't take it anymore. RIP Hagrid's windows.

Anywho, the Dumbledore and Hermione bashing isn't really bashing, it's plot doing its thing. It resolves itself. Dumbledore aside, Hermione gets it extra hard because let's just say Harry wasn't following the script.

Except for Ginny. It accentuates the issues I have with her. Hell, I don't think Ron gets "bashed" at all. In fact, this fic has a pretty canon-compliant Ron.

This story does mesh well with the canon books. It explains so much of the weird and plain out stupid things that happened.

For the last point, the "bashing" and the bad guy are only a small part of the series.
