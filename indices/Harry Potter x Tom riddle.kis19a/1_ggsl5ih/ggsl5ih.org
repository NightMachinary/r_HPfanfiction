Linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord)\\
Political maneuvering slightly obvious, haven't been updated for ages, but a good introduction, leaning towards middle-good on the scale of all decently popular Tomarry fanfictions. Can compare with other fics once you've read more into the pairing.

Linkffn(Again and Again)\\
Loved this concept, wanted to see more of it, but it grew slightly too long towards the end, lovely fic nontheless.

Linkao3(Heir Apparent)\\
Best one I've come across in recent times. In fact, all of the author (MonsieurClavier) their works are nice. Think they write solely for HP.

Linkao3(Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up) Nice slice-of-life fanfic, very chill, good fic to return to when you've had enough of reading politics and wars.

I can't think of any more at the moment.
