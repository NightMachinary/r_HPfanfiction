I've read a couple of stories that had that happen. In one of them, if I remember correctly, Harry died to get rid of the horcrux, and Hermione resuscitated him. After that, Ron didn't believe it was Harry anymore, because, once you're dead, you're dead, so his body must have been possessed by an evil spirit. I can't remember the title of that one.

And in [[https://crys.fanficauthors.net/Chattel/index/][Chattel]], by Crys, Harry is resuscitated with CPR after his death in the final battle, and it has legal consequences for him.
