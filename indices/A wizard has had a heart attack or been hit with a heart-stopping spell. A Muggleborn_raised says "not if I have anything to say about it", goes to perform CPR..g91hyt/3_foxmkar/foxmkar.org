I've wondered for a while what would happen if someone tried CPR on a Killing Curse victim. There's really no way to know because we don't know the exact means by which the Killing Curse kills- only that no one but Harry has ever survived it. I suspect if anyone asked Rowling she'd say it doesn't work, Killing Curse victims can't be revived. But there's no way to be sure. Modern CPR is a fairly new discovery, most wizards wouldn't know it, in all likelihood, and it rarely works without additional medical support. So it may simply be that no one has attempted it on a Killing Curse victim- or that one or two tried it, and failed, and it just affirmed most wizards' assumption that no one can survive the Killing Curse.
