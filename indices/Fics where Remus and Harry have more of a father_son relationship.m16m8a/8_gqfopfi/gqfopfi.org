IDK any but I understand why people put Remus into the awkward 3rd wheel spot tbh. These are the reasons they use

Remus could've gone to rescue harry anytime when he was at the dursleys.

Remus is always considered sub par to Sirius as sirius is generally considered more handsome and his backstory with azkaban and his family makes him more appealing.

Due to Remus having no family name or such he is thrown to the side as a pity case for being a werewolf. Even if it is not on purpose it is done quite often accidentally.

I personally disagree with the fact Remus is not used its just the reasons I found why its like that.
