Oh wow, this is the first review I've done which has actually been seen by the author! I'm glad you liked it.

In regards to a), I think you can give yourself the promise to only fix up the grammar on the rewrite, and not change any of the plot in order to keep the integrity of what you wrote. It was clear to me that you really got your stride in the later books, and I noticed a dramatic increase in the quality, so I can tell that as you go forward you'll keep writing even better stories. The only "change" I would recommend in terms of plot is to maybe add in something explaining what happened to the diary horcrux. The way the events of CoS panned out, by rights Ginny should have still been in possession of it, but given that the trio walk into a trap looking for that particular horcrux, it seems apparent that this is not the case, so maybe write in a line or two explaining how Voldemort got it back.

Otherwise yes, I think your idea of getting all your ideas down and then letting them sit for a few days is great. Personally I'm seriously impressed at the rate at which you write - you obviously love it. I just think you'll really up your readership with a little bit of polishing.

I did want to tell you as well that I particularly loved your characterisation of Snape and Gellert. Especially when Snape was scolding Harry and even trying to give him deeply flawed life advice in the later books I could really feel Snape coming off the page in the dialogue you wrote for him. Made it a really gripping story :)
