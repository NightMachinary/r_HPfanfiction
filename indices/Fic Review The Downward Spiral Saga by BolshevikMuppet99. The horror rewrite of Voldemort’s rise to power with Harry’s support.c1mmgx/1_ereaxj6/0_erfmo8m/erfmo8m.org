Yeah I can understand. I definitely hit a point where I disconnected my feelings from it, otherwise I might not have been able to finish it either. A few people mentioned the epilogue and the timing of it, though I didn't mind it. Possibly it should have been combined with the chapter beforehand, but contentwise I found it to be a suitably horrifying inversion of the canon epilogue.
