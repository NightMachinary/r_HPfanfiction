Amazing review i have to say, the series was one of the best works I've ever read in YEARS. It was such a breath of fresh air, extremely believable, doesn't torture you with clich√©s and tropes that we've been used to. The character developments are extremely well made and honestly? I hope this doesn't get downvotes but the torture/rape/porn was one of my favourite parts. Call it morbid if you and any but it extremely appealed to me. More so when it was Daphne and Harry together, if anything it only solidified just how much they're meant for each other and the fact that Daphne IS the one that he needed to keep up with his nature. The scenes were brutal and bloody hell were they well written so you can FEEL the pain and sadism from both sides. I loved it. A lot. The epilogue felt a bit underwhelming for me but overall the series entertained me during my binge reading :)
