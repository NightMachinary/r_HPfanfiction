Thank you very much! This review took me the longest to write so far, so I appreciate the comments :)

Yes, the way Daphne was written was very, very clever. In a way, she is made for Harry and they fit together extraordinarily well, to the point that no one else could have made Harry as happy as she did. But simultaneously it's clear that her influence in his life was a tragedy, because he was on his way to taking some responsibility for the appalling way he treated Pansy before Daphne came along, and it became just another lost opportunity for Harry to become a better person.

I don't really think there's anything inherently wrong with enjoying horror and torture porn as a genre, so long as there's always a level of awareness maintained that this would never be a good or desirable or justifiable thing outside of the realms of fiction. If it's your thing, more power to you.

Thanks again for commenting!
