  Also because of the *fixation* Draco and Harry had a eachother.

I see people use this argument a lot to explain Drarry, but while I agree that Draco was almost obsessed with Harry (always trying to bait him), was the fixation truly mutual? Because outside of HBP where Harry "/is stalking Draco because he is (rightfully so) convinced that he is up to no good and the only reason why nobody believe him is because Rowling made everyone else hold the idiot ball for plot reason/", did Harry ever initiate any contact with Draco?
