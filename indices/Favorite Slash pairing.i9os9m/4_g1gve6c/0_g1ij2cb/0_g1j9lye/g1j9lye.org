I think they are quite versatile. You can right Colin becoming disillusioned with Harry and that pushes him towards Draco so they re United in their bitterness for Harry

​

or you can have Colin be more mature

​

the best time to get them together is usually sixth year

​

i think Harry and Colin and work too but I think often falls into a pattern where Colin is treated more like a pet for Harry
