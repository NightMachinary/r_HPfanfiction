It's a long-standing problem. The thing is that, though they /do/ feed on /happiness/, Dementors /also/ thrive exclusively wherever there is gloom (they only find it safe to multiply when strife and misery is at its peak among humans, and they focus on Harry over other possible victims because he has so many reasons to be gloomy). So it seems that though it's the happiness they take, there has to be some gloom mixed with it for them to be able to consume it.

My personal theory (and it's just a theory) is that they can only take someone's happy memories while they're not thinking about said memories; hence why they cause gloom in their victims even from afar, diverting them from their happiness so that they can take it more easily. Within this framework, Patronuses are the opposite of ideal food for a Dementor: not only are there no sad thoughts to divert the being away from the happy ones since it's /made/ of happiness, but it's happiness that /actively fights back/ at that.

...The real answer, of course, is that Rowling wanted to create a species of scary, villainous spectres who spread gloom and depression, and of /course/ they'd be defeated by focusing on happy thoughts because Symbolism, and she didn't really stop to really think if the whole thing made logical sense in-universe.
