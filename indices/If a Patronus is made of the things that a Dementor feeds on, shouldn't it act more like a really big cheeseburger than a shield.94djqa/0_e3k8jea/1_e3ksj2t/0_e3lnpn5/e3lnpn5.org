It's a popular theory. I'm not entirely convinced, however; the Dementor on the train wasn't trying to Kiss him (that would be stupid), which is the only context in which the amount of soul would have been relevant. Besides, wouldn't eating a Horcrux-soul shard be akin to eating a rotten shred of goat entrails, from a soul-eater's perspective?
