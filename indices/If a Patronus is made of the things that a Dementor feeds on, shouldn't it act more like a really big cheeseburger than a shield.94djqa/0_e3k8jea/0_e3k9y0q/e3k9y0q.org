  The thing is that, though they /do/ feed on /happiness/, Dementors /also/ thrive exclusively wherever there is gloom (they only find it safe to multiply when strife and misery is at its peak among humans, and they focus on Harry over other possible victims because he has so many reasons to be gloomy). So it seems that though it's the happiness they take, there has to be some gloom mixed with it for them to be able to consume it.

This is utterly correct. In chapter 12 of /PoA/, we get the following explanation of the nature of the conjured Patronus (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon --- hope, happiness, the desire to survive --- *but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.* But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.”

It is the generation of despair by draining away the positive emotions that gives dementors power. By having an intercessor incapable of feeling despair, a dementor or dementors are rendered essentially powerless, and are driven off.

EDIT: Spelling and capitalization.
