Ah, so you see the despair as "environmental conditions" as opposed to the happiness being "food". Makes sense, makes sense. My thinking is rather that they /choose/ to breed when there's much misery at hand, because much misery means easy prey means lots of potential food for offspring, as opposed to it physically /enabling/ them to do so, but both interpretations are canon-compliant.
