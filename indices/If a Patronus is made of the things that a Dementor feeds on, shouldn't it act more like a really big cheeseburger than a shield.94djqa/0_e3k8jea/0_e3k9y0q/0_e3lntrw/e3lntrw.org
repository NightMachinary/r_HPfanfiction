Good work on digging up that quote. Nonetheless---

#+begin_quote
  (...) that gives dementors power. By having an intercessor incapable of feeling despair, a dementor or dementors are rendered essentially powerless, and are driven off.
#+end_quote

---you seem to imply that it's the creation of despair itself that feeds the Dementor, and that taking away the happiness is only a byway. As I outlined above I think it is the reverse: your quote itself mentions that "hope, happiness, the desire to survive" are "the very thing the Dementor feeds upon". Dementors eat the happiness, but can only do so if they can get the victim to focus on sadness instead while they eat the happiness.
