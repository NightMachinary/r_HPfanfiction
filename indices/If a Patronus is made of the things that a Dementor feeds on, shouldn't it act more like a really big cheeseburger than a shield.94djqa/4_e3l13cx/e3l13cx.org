Consider what we know about the Patronus the first time Lupin explains it.

#+begin_quote
  The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the Dementors can't hurt it.
#+end_quote

This tells us two things:

1) Dementors get their happy memory burgers by making their target feel despair. They can't eat the Patronus at all.

B) Because the Patronus is only a projection of your emotions, there's no reason to believe it would somehow drain them out of you, nor does the text suggest that anywhere else. A Patronus is draining certainly, but that's because it's a powerful spell.
