Maybe it's like a really concentrated form of that emotion. So, like when dementors feed off of humans normally their positive emotions/thoughts/feelings are tempered with other emotions and make it tasty for them, but in super concentrated form its painful? Like eating salsa vs a ghost pepper.

On to using the emotion, I never thought if it as draining them to use it. It seemed to me like a buildup of mental energy to cast the spell, and once it's cast it kinda takes on a life of its own until the threat is gone.
