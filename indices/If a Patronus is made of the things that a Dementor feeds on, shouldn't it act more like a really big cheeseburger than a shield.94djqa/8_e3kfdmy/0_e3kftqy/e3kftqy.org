In fact I included this reasoning in a story:

  I ended up in an argument with him over Dementors, a topic of much interest nowadays. Professor Lupin said that they feed off positive emotions, stealing away every happy thought you have.

  "That's not what happened!"

  "Miss... umm... Evans? You have an opinion?"

  I stood up as we had been taught to do when making an extended point.

  "You were there on the train! It didn't take away my happy thoughts..."

  Blaise Zabini piped in, "Do you even HAVE happy thoughts?"

  "Kinda my point, actually."

  "Nevertheless, Miss Evans, both the text and common knowledge indicate that Dementors induce an effect that makes a person feel like they'll never be happy again. The happy thoughts are gone."

  "That makes no sense."

  "As magical creatures, you will find that they operate under a different set of rules than normal beings."

  "No, I mean your position isn't supported by my experience."

  "Sit down, Miss Evans."

  Hermione stood as I sat down. "Professor Lupin?"

  "Yes Miss Granger?"

  "I think what Holly is trying to say is that Dementors wouldn't want to take happy thoughts."

  "Really? Explain. Perhaps we can learn a bit more by the discussion."

  "Well, they're like mosquitoes, really."

  The class laughed a bit, but Hermione soldiered on. "A mosquito won't bite you in the nose, because there's almost no blood there. They can see the heat coming from your arteries where the blood they want is flowing, so they naturally are drawn there. That's what they want, and they're built to go get it. Dementors are parasites, like the mosquito. They don't bring up your happy thoughts for them to eat; instead they prompt all your worst memories to come to the fore. They feed off the negative emotions, so that is what they have developed the ability to find. It explains--"

  "It explains why they went straight for me."

  Hermione saw my haunted expression and gave my shoulder a squeeze before continuing.

  "Yes, and it also explains why the only weapon against them is the Patronus Charm. The Patronus is the embodiment of a happy thought brought to life. If a Dementor fed on happy thoughts, the Patronus would draw them in like moths to flame or mosquitoes to blood, but the Dementor fled from your Patronus."
