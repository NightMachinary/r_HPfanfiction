I'm with you; I don't think Dementors feed on happiness. They feed on despair, but their influence chases memories of happiness far away. It's not like someone meeting a Dementor who feeds on them suddenly can't remember their first kiss or something.

As embodiments/personifications of Depression, I think the canon interpretation is valid only in the sense that victims feel like happiness is no longer attainable -- 'Like I'll never be happy ever again'. That's the effect of Depression: it gets your mind swirling about the things you dread. And the answer to fighting Depression is to remind yourself of the moments you were really happy, because those are the ones that make you feel like the Depression isn't going to be forever.
