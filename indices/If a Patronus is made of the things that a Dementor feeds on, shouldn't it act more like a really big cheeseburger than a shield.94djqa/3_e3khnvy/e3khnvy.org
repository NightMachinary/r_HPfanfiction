Rowling created Dementors at a time when she was facing strong depression. The Dementors are really a symbolism of that - like depression, it feeds on your hopes and dreams until you feel like you're not good enough or that you'll never be able to achieve success/happiness. The symbolism of the Dementors and the Patronus Charm, I think, is that a person who can truly remember their happiness and their hopes, and hold onto that feeling, will be able to drive away depression. Though whether that actually works to treat depression in real life is another matter entirely.
