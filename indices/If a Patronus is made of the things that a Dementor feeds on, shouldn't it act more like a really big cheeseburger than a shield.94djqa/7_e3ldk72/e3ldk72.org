Kind of. Harry does narrate feeling exhausted after practising it. However, /any/ strong emotion is stressful to sustain, so it's more likely that he would have just as much trouble feeling anger or sadness as he would joy.

Whether one can "run out" of Patronus-joy specifically, there are several psychological forces at work, in different directions. One might become habituated to a particular happy memory, so that it becomes boring rather than happy; but one might also become sensitised to it, to make reaction to it more reflexive and robust. If there any actual psychologists reading this, it'd be interesting to know which applies.
