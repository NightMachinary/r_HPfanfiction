  Hermione/Bellatrix - Time Heals All Wounds
#+end_quote

That story is kinda lame. I've always hated reset button time-travel stories. Why go through all the character development just to wipe it all away later. I understand tragedy, but this goes way to far into fatalism ("Why even try to do anything?"). "Debt of Time" (which also seems very popular) has the same problem, but at least that story is upfront about the fact that the time travel is just sightseeing (also it's Hermione-centric and she takes her character development with her, Bellatrix in Time Heals All Wounds just gets a reset button).

Time Heals All Wounds totally fails as a tragedy though, because Bellatrix is already mentally unstable and is screwed by fate (removing her only support at a crucial time). Her "downfall" isn't happening because of bad personal choices like in a proper tragedy.
