Post OttP and abandonded, unfortunately. But a very interesting fic, that's stayed with me throughout the years.

This is a post-GoF, Harry/Cho, Harry goes to Azkaban story. Unlike most shitty Azkaban fics, in this story things happen for a reason.

Well plotted, well paced, brilliant action scenes. The dialogue is maybe a bit weak at places but it's a pretty minor flaw. The fic does away with the worst of Azkaban cliches (excessive angst, forgiveness wanking) and presents one my favorite interpretations of Harry in the fandom; he slowly becomes dangerous, subtle, pro-active and /lethal/. Best of all, the story is completed and there's a finished sequel too.
