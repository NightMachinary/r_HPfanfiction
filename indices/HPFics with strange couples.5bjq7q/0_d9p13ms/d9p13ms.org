We're a fandom with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3096379/1/First-Encounter][Hogwarts/Giant Squid]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Drapple/100478/][Draco/Apple]] fics. Honestly, Sirius/Narcissa barely warrants a raised eyebrow in terms of "strange". The incest is ick, but given that there are plenty of fics with sibling and parent/child incest, first cousins becomes a little less weird (especially within the Black family, which is canonically incestuous).

But for an actual rec of a rarepair, my favourite is still Theo Nott/Piers Polkiss in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1213036][The Housewarming Party]].
