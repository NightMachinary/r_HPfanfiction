I just noticed that I misunderstood everything you just said and deleted my previous comment that didn't make any sense. Lol

First of all, thank you very much for the recommendation! :D I'm reading it as soon as my finals are over.

And about the couple, it's curious to see someone saying that, because every time I told a friend about it they were like "ARGH, STOPPED IT NOW". I'm very relieved to hear that's not that absurd hahahahahah

Thanks!
