Speaking of strange couples, I usually don't read femslash but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]]) is probably the weirdest couple I have ever read and the Fic actually kinda managed to pull it off. As opposed to most Dramione fics I've seen the author actually made Hermione stronger instead of weaker to make the pairing work. IMHO she's quite consistent with canon-Hermione in the way she stoically deals with her situation.
