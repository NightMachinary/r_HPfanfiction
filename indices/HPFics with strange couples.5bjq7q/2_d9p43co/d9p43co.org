It's interesting. There are only 8 fics on ffn with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&r=10&c1=547&c2=9&pm=1][Luna/Snape]] as compared to the 850 with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&r=10&c1=3&c2=9&pm=1][Hermione/Snape]]. I understand that people love Hermione and that she's a bigger character, but Luna does have a large following! Maybe try one of those eight fics? An strange couple indeed!
