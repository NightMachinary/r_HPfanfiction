- I'm sure that the first choice would be Sirius. As for the second and third choices, I'd probably say Peter and then Remus, although the latter might be difficult due to his /ahem/ 'furry little problem'.

Fourth would maybe be some of Lily's friends? Although, I don't think canon ever explicitly goes into her friendship group, but I like to imagine that she would've been close enough to one or two people to make them good choices. Otherwise, I'd say the Longbottoms would be a good shout for number four, not least because of Neville - as you can imagine it would be quite a decision to give custody of your child to someone who has little-to-no experience or doesn't want them - so the Longbottoms fit quite nicely here.

Other than that, maybe - /and I mean, maybe/ - they'd give Harry to someone like Professor McGonagall? I like to think that they were both close to her, not least due to being Head Boy and Girl, top students and both good Gryffindors - well, in seventh year at least, in James' case!

Although, this is of course assuming that they wouldn't just want Petunia to have custody of Harry in the event of a disaster, in which case Petunia would probably place number three/four on the list, in my mind.

The real problem with a whole contingency plan is how little of James & Lily's lives and friendships are explored in canon, leaving the whole lot open to endless reinterpretation on our end. But ah well, here's my contribution.
