Yes, who in their right mind would make a will while being hunted by a madman and their friends fighting and dying left and right. Complete and utter madness!11!!

I'm not even fighting in a war and I've been an organ donor since I've been 18 and talked with my parents about my wishes in case of an accident. Shit happens. People die.
