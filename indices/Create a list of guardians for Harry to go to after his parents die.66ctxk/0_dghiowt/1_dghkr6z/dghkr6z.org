Part of it is also just the fanfics with "wills" (who the fuck has their will written at the age of 20) that put Harry with everyone and explicitly say not to put him with Petunia. Lily may not get along with Petunia, but she doesn't hate her. and it makes sense that their kid goes to a closely related living relative over some random friend or a second cousin once removed. I also personally like the interpretation of Petunia hating wizards for taking her sister away from her more than anything else, which only got worse after it became permanent with her death. I can easily imagine them reconciling when they're older, Dudley growing up, etc.

Like, irl, if my parents were to have died when I was young, I would have likely been placed with their siblings, even if they're not especially close. The order of distant family>close friends seems most realistic. It's just confounded in HP by the Dursley's being atrocious, fairy tale stories, etc.

Canon didn't realy have space to explore James and Lily's lives and friendships beyond their relationship to Harry. For all we know, Lily's only other friend was Mary MacDonald. Fanfics often make them friends with Alice and Frank, presumably because of the Order, but Alice and Frank are a couple years older (and we see minimal cross-year friendships in canon).
