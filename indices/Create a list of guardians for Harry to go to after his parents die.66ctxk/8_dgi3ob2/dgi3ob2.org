I've always wondered what happened to Lily's parents. We know that they died but how? Lily was only 21 when she died and they apparently passed away before. Also did James and Lily not have any cousins or aunts and uncles? James was an only child but did none of his parents have siblings or cousins? And Lily in the muggle world surely must have had muggle relations through her parents. Do they not exist, or did they all mysteriously expire?

Honestly the bigger problem for me is the secret keeper issue. Why didn't James or Lily be their own secret-keepers? It's shown to be possible in the last book, and they knew someone in the Order was a traitor. Why did they not have a portkey on them? Dumbledore was influential enough to get them one. James died trying to buy time for them (in what was a wasted effort. Really didn't understand Voldemort calling his death brave.) Lily had enough time to get to her wand and try /something/. She could have tried to fight, disapparate, cast something instead of pushing furniture against the door and begging. But ultimately, they were young, unprepared and in over their heads. I don't think the possibility of dying became real until that night, and thus the lack of contingency plans.
