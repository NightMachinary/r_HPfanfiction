Would this even be a question that's relevant in terms of the cannon magical world? We can assume Sirius didn't have a will, since I'm pretty sure that there's no mention of that in the book (regardless of Fannons obsession with it). We see that Dumbledore had a will, but that was dealt with by the sitting Minister, not something that could be common. We also know that the magical world split away from the muggle world centuries before the story begins, in a time when nobody but the elite bothered with wills. So all this leads me to say; I don't think the Potters would have a will, they possess little in the way of money (1 small vault) a single home that was likely inherited and no positions of power (like Dumbledore).
