I dont think Lily and James would even consider the possibility that they both die during the war, without harry dying as well. They were literally hiding their child from Voldemort himself and they probably thought that its more likely that Harry would be killed after the death of both of them and that their primary concern should be to survive the war and raise Harry themself.

But the only choices I would think of are Sirius and Peter because they are the only ones who are trusted by James and Lily not to be the spy. It was a civil war I dont think they could trust anyone beyond their best friends not to turn on Harry should Voldemort confront them. The safest place would actually be with a muggle or a squib living in the muggle world but I doubt they trusted anyone enough no to sacrifice Harry in favour of their own family.
