Dumbledore. He is the safest and best person for Harry to go to in the event Lily and James die during the war (when they likely created their wills). And since by then, they have discovered the prophecy from Dumbledore (or at least the amount Dumbledore knew), it's only natural that Dumbledore would be the one capable of helping Harry train the power "The Dark Lord knows Not".

There's also several other reasons, such as Dumbledore being an amazing mentor and father figure, I think that having a sort of son would make Dumbledore a little more battle-hardened when the war reignited because if he doesn't kill, he has something to lose, someone that depends on him. Dumbledore would also likely accept it and fulfil his duties to the T (unlike Petunia, Sirius, Remus, etc...). He's also the only one we fully know on the list, whereas putting him with someone like Agusta or Andromeda, is a shot in the dark.

Sirius. This would mostly be at James' request, as the fact that a mini-version of him would be running around and furthering his legacy would be the best possible outcome for him. There's also the fact that Sirius is financially stable, capable of supporting a baby. He will be available both physically and emotionally. And he will understand Harry when they come across the whole Teen-Angst phase. Sirius raising a Soldier isn't likely to happen, or maybe it is? Who knows what would become of a Sirius that survived the war, while most of his friends died around him.

/Insert Female Order Member that already has had Children/. I think that having Children would be a big plus in Lily and James' eyes, there's also the fact that they fought with these people and trust them with their lives. If they could get any of them onboard, they would definitely be somewhere down the line. But this would then create the spoiled Harry we were worried about, he has absolutely no chance of winning the oncoming storm and defeating the Dark Lord. So while he'll have an extremely good childhood, his adolescent years would be filled with death and likely destruction, before ultimately falling at the hands of the dark lord.

Orphanage. Now, you may be asking yourself, "why would Lily and James attempt to send Harry to an orphanage?" But the reasoning for my decision is based on the more likely scenario that Lily and James didn't have a will, or didn't think to write one.
