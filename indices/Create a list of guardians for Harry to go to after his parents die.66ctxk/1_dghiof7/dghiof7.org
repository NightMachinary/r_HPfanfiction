I actually don't think they thought that much about it. They were 20, war or no war, and they wouldn't think much further than 'godfather/other mauraders, whoever Lily's closest friends were'. It wouldn't occur to them Petunia was a candidate, because wizard baby hunted by dark lord, and they were estranged from her. By Petunias choice.

We know there were no other close relatives. It's hard to tell, but it's possible Andromeda is the next closest viable relative.
