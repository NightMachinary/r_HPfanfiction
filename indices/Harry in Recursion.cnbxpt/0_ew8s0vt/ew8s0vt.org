The fic you have described sounds like a lot of fun, and I would probably enjoy reading it.

I will note that your story idea has a lot in common with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]].

The similarity isn't necessarily a bad thing (afterall, fanfiction tends to be iterative), but many of your potential readers will probably have already read the other two fics, so you should try to ensure that your plotline is unique enough to not be overshadowed by what's been done before.
