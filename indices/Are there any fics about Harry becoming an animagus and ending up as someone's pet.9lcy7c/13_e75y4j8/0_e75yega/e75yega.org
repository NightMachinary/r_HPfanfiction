  Draco retreated after the war. Despite the Wizarding world turning a smiling, forgiving face to any and all with a black name and stained reputation, he wanted none of it. All Draco wanted was to be left alone.Unfortunately for him, Harry Potter doesn't want to leave him alone. And more than that, he finds himself with the most unlikely of house guests that he just can't seem to rid himself of.Why is life never simple?
