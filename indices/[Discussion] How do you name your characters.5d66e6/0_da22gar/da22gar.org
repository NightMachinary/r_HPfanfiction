Mostly random. I might know what letter or sound I want it to start with, then I just browse [[http://www.behindthename.com/][behindthename]] until I find one that I think fits. I almost never have middle names because it never comes up in fic. Only times I've bothered with them are when characters have babies and are picking the names; that kind of situation, you have to broach the topic.

As for a favourite, probably Gareth Stuart Martin, who is the one middle name exception to the baby thing and I'm disappointed I never found chance to mention his full name in fic, because it meant there was never chance for anyone to get the joke, especially as he's an over-powered OC with a mysterious past.
