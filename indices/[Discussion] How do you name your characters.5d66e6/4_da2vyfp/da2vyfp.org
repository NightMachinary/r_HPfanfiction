A bit of a mixture. Sometimes I'll hear or see a name I really love (like Rowling, I like walking round old graveyards) and I will create a character around that name. Sometimes I look up meanings or play around with similar names until I hit one that feels right. My biggest OC, Theia Higglesworth, was named for the ancient planet that supposedly collided with earth and created the moon. I felt like her name risked being too ethereal so I grounded it with a mildly silly sounding British surname - a combination of Higsworth and Biggles.
