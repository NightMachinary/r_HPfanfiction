I usually try to make it fit in with the rest of the family naming pattern if one is established. For example, I've given Astoria and Daphne an older brother named Jason Greengrass. Jason is a Greek hero which I thought fit with Daphne's name. I'll also check what baby names were popular in the birth year for the characters I'm writing to give ideas when adding things like siblings or parents to characters. I rarely give a middle name to a character.

My favorite is Nephele Rosier. I got her name from a random Harry Potter name generator and thought it was perfect for a pure blood witch.
