I'll happily second this one, I read it for the first time last week and I thought it was brilliant. I'm not normally a big fan of Marauder Era and I think this might be the only Marauder Fic I've ever read through to it's in progress mark and will be following.

A word of warning though it is very long, at just over 600k it is quite a length, particularly given that it's only just reached second year, if Stoplight Delight is planning on covering 7 years it will probably take a while. I thought it's portrayal of Remus' parents in particular was an excellent examination of what his condition must have meant to their family life, which is often glossed over in both fics and canon.

11/10, it's awesome!
