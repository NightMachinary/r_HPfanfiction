I disagree regarding Sirius, I think that him being a dark wizard but striving not to be like his parents in this gives his personality depth and mixes nicely with what we know about him from canon.

And also Harry needed someone (whom he trusted before) to be dark otherwise he might not become one himself thinking everything dark=bad. The conflict you describe could be anyone else
