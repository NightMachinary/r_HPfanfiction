My one major problem with this fic is how the author has whitewashed Slytherin.

Almost all the slytherin characters have done a 180 in personality because Harry is in Slytherin.

There is so much wasted potential conflict. It would have been a far better story if half of the 5th year slytherin class actually believed in Voldemort and were still somewhat shitty people.

Its the same with Sirius. Having him be a dark wizard makes no freaking sense to his personality in Canon. He shouldnt have been Harry's mentor but trying to stop him. Eventually they would rekindle, Sirius would be more supportive and provide Andromeda as his mentor.

This fic is one of those good ideas that could have been implemented about 5x better if they hadn't made it so easy for Harry. So much wasted potential.
