I just read this story recently. Are there any other stories where "the dark" and/or "having an affinity for 'the dark'" is treated similarly to this story? I've tried looking at many dark!Harry fics over the years, but just couldn't get into most of them because of the writing, and the ones with readable writing "dark" was mostly synonymous with "evil," or Harry was "grey" or "edgy" or "indie." Maybe I haven't delved deep enough or looked at enough stories, but I've never seen a story where "the dark" was handled the way it is in this story.
