I just read this fic recently and loved it. I'm usually wary of fics like this because, more often than not, Harry turns into an edgelord, all the Gryffindors are bashed and Slytherins deified, and there's an undertone of condescension towards canon that really irritates me.

This fic manages to avoid all of those pitfalls. Harry's character is more or less retained while still allowing for growth and change, all characters are written with nuance, no one is all good or all bad, and, thankfully, no one is bashed. I love the concepts that are explored in this fic, and I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
