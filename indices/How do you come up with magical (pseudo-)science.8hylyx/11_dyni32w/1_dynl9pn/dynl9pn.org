You might have a good point about cheapening it, but I (an I can only really speak for myself) do try to leave some mystery in some aspects of magic, particularly soul magic, to try and keep that alive.

The fact of the matter is, without a background, Magic has no rules. With no rules you're left with contradictions, and deus ex machina whenever you feel like it.

It makes lazy writing too easy of a habit to slip into. Sure there are those that pull it off, but I need rules and routine.

I feel like that is what makes a universe, no?
