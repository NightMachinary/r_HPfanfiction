One of the 'unofficial rules' of fantasy storytelling is that magic may only be as helpful to the protagonist as the rules themselves are understood by the reader. (see [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteAFunctionalMagicSystem]])

If Gandalf could just wave his staff and set the entirety of Sauron's armies on fire, turn the Balrog into a kitten, or teleport the ring six inches above the lava inside Mount Doom, then why was there so much tension?

Instead, pretty much all he's allowed to do is counter Saruman/Sauron's magic, and [[http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Light][cantrips]].

Alternatively, The Dresden Files tells us magic has rules, and the rules must be followed (or consequences will be suffered) and Harry Dresden uses magic within those rules as a tool.

In Harry Potter, there's a strange middle-ground---we don't really know much about what magic /can't/ do, mostly because we don't know what magic /can/ do, and for either reason we never learn /why/. So we have to justify it /somehow/.

Even if the answer is "We don't know why."
