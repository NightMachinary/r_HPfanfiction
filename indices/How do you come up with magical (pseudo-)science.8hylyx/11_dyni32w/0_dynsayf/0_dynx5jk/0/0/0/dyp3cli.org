The thing is, we don't know these rules (although in the case of HP we know some of them) but we know the characters follow them. It's enough to be consistent. The system must be here (and coherent enought in the mind of the writer), it doesn't need, however, to be completely known by the reader.\\
Just how much you need to tell the reader really depends on how magic is used in the story.

I think one of the best examples of this is Alice in Wonderland. Very little is known about magic, everything verges on the absurd constantly and yet everything remains coherent. I think this is because L. Carroll himself knew perfectly well what was possible and what wasn't in this world. The system's there, even if it's only implied, and it's enough to make it work.
