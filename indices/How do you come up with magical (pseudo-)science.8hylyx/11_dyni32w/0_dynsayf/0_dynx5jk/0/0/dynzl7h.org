My point is that we don't know the rules for Gandalf. We don't know the rules for Harry Potter. Though we know that both have rules and limitations we don't know what those are for the most part. I prefer this to fantasy where all the magic rules are laid out for the reader. I find that takes the feeling of magic away.
