I... I don't understand what you're saying here. What's your point?

Gandalf doesn't solve hardly anyone's problems. His list of achievements:

1. He combats Durin's Bane
2. He heals Théoden
3. He drives away the Nazgûl
4. He guides the Fellowship through Moria
5. He takes Pippin to Gondor

He doesn't actually overcome the Balrog, he doesn't best Saruman in either fight, he doesn't transport some or all of the group with magic, and so many other things.

If he did, there would be no tension. It would be Deus Ex Machina.

Harry Potter magic isn't. They have to work for it---very few are shown to learn the spells quickly, and they /need/ a wand. Apparition is dangerous, and can be blocked. "You cannot Apparate within Hogwarts." There are dozens of /rules/ that /cannot/ be broken, whether the /why/ is ever explained or not.

And Harry Potter magic, because there are numerous rules and restrictions, /know/ what can and cannot be done. Magic stops being Deus Ex Machina and becomes yet another tool, another weapon.
