The Arithmancer is really bad magic-wise though.

I have four sources of inspiration:

- Harry Potter media
- Other works of fiction
- Real life esoterics
- Myths and legends

For example in Agrippa's Three Books on Occult Philosophy it's said that:

#+begin_quote
  There are four Elements, and originall grounds of all corporeall things, Fire, Earth, Water, Aire, of which all elementated inferiour bodies are compounded; not by way of heaping them up together, but by transmutation, and union; and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into Elements. For there is none of the sensible Elements that is pure, but they are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed one into the other:
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  Next after the four simple Elements follow the four kinds of perfect Bodies compounded of them, and they are Stones, Metals, Plants, and Animals: and although unto the generation of each of these all the Elements meet together in the composition, yet every one of them follows, and resembles one of the Elements, which is most predominant. For all Stones are earthy, for they are naturally heavy, and descend, and so hardened with dryness, that they cannot be melted. But Metals are waterish, and may be melted, which Naturalists confess, and Chymists [chemists] finde to be true, viz. that they are generated of a viscous Water, or waterish argent vive. Plants have such an affinity with the Aire, that unless they be abroad in the open Aire, they do neither bud, nor increase. So also all Animals Have in their Natures a most fiery force, And also spring from a Celestiall source. And Fire is so naturall to them, that that being extinguished they presently dye [die].

Now what is the law that tells us what is possible to do with transfiguration?

#+begin_quote
  Gamp's Law of *Elemental* Transfiguration
#+end_quote

But I wasn't a big fan of that type of body - element association so I ended with something like that (note, it's a very rough note):

#+begin_quote
  The school of transfiguration is based in theory that every object being composed from the mix of base elements: air, fire, earth, water, and aether with the transfiguration being able to manipulate the first four to change the object into another object and as the elements are Core Concepts the change is permanent. The inability to manipulate aether directly results in a limited influence on magical properties and makes creating actual magical materials impossible, and creation of some mundane materials with strong magical properties either very hard (silver) or outright impossible (gold). It also results in the impossibility of recreating virtues that aren't tied directly to material such as "foodness".

  An important part of transfiguration theory are four base types of bodies each consisted with a different element. The early theory associated them as follows: rocks - earth, metal - water, plants - air, animals - fire. But the fire association of animals, in fact, reflected the aetherical aspect of their life force and thus resulted in a high difficulty of animal transfigurations. To combat that the revised system was created where metal was associated with fire and water with animals.
