I feel like my method for designing the magic system in the Arithmancer-Verse parallels the real scientific method. First, observe what happens in canon (or sometimes fanon); then, try to craft a theory that coherently explains those observations without causing too many other problems.

Taking transfiguration as an example, in canon, we see inanimate to inanimate (match to needle), animal to inanimate (beetle to button), inanimate to animal (teapot to tortoise), animal to animal (guinea-fowl to guinea-pig), human to animal (Draco to ferret), and human to human (Ron to "Dragomir Despard). Yet we also see that transfiguration /cannot/ create food, despite the fact that it can create animals. So my theory is that transfigured animals are not "real", but are merely constructs, which also makes sense since the caster would not be able to visualize all of the details of an animal's anatomy.

(We know that humans transfigured into animals lose their human minds, and yet Slughorn appears to transfigure himself into an armchair and retain his ability to change back, suggesting that this more of an illusion-type spell.)

We know that conjuration is not permanent (except for /Aguamenti/, apparently), but transfiguration isn't insanely dangerous due to not being permanent like it is in HPMOR, so it either is always permanent (which conflicts with the animals/food restriction), or there's some other effect that keeps it from being so dangerous. So my theory is that it's the second one; all transfiguration is a construct in some sense. Some of it is permanent, but some is not, depending on the specific spell. And notably, you can transfigure something that* look*s like food, but it transfigures back immediately if you try to eat it.

In canon, we see Hermione vanishing kittens. This seems bizarre on multiple levels. It's established that vanishing objects sends them in "non-being", destroying them, and it is very surprising that Hermione would kill kittens even for the sake of homework. It also seems too powerful for the story that you could theoretically kill a person just by vanishing them. Why wasn't it used on Barty Crouch Sr., for example? So my theory there is that vanishing does not work on true animals, but only on transfigured/conjured constructs. (There is some suggestion that vanished objects can be "rematerialized," but this is an even weirder dynamic that we never see used, and I really don't know what to make of it.)

This connects to the other part of my method: if anything would seriously break the story, it's not allowed. So you can't transfigure a nuke even if you know how to build one. This is sort of already there under the hood based on the observation that the world hasn't been destroyed by magical nukes yet.
