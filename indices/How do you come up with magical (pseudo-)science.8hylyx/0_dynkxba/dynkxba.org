I often pay homage to other works. For example I asked myself why wizards don't conjure flames inside of their enemies. This draws some parallels to Worm so I made reference to it (Manton).

My stuff on soul magic in linkffn(The Mind Arts) is taken from Semitic mythology.

My stuff for elemental abilities is taken from Hindu mythology.

For rituals I took a page from the book of Full Metal Alchemist. Sacrifice to gain something of equal value.

My stuff from potions comes from chemistry (slower temperatures slow down reactions, kinetics 101) and some ingredients I took from Skyrim (Jazbay grapes, and I did something with bees).

For wand movements I often figured that, on average, more powerful spells take longer to cast, it takes longer to gather and dispel the arcane, compared to a shorter wand movement which would produce a less powerful version of the same spell.

This is how Harry helped Tracey develop the magic “muscle memory” to cast a shield charm. Sort of like lifting a smaller weight until you are practiced enough to just let the magic flow by habit.

Different magical talents came from a list of psychic abilities, which I whittled down to a usable amount, with some balancing. For example, seeing the future can be maddening. (I also took from Greek Mythology in particular for seeing the future and, again, was inspired by Worm.)

I hope this helps.
