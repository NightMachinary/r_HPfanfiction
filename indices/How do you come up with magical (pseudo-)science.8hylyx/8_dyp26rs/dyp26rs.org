I don't like magic as science in the HPverse. I'm not saying it can't be done right, It obviously can, your recs are enough proof of that, and it isn't reason enough to ditch a fic to me. But I think you can do so much better than that.\\
I'd really like to see more fics with a very detailed and deeply thought out magic system that isn't a physics' rehash.\\
I think it's really better (although certainly a lot harder) to have a magic that operates in a very different way than what we know.\\
I'm not advocating for soft magic, but for hard magic that isn't even remotely comparable to physics.\\
For instance, I really like Taure's direction in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/]]), even if we haven't seen much yet.\\
Think also of the ancient magic in Enembee's Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light]]), which isn't as much detailed as I'd like.

Outside of fanfics, this is one of the ggod things about some Xianxia, where the magic, although far too much formulaic, often succeeds at feeling really alien in the way it operates. see [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/coiling-dragon]] for an example.

+The Mind Arts, which is wonderful fic (and certainly one of my favourite recent ones), is also a very good example of something I've really come to despise in HP fanfics and is very common in magic as science types of stories. It's constant use of magical exhaustion doesn't really creates the intended tension in the story, but rather a deep frustration in the reader (at least in my case). I think It would be far better off without it.+ Edit: I was actually thinking about a different fic.

Too often, it is implied you can either have a very detailed magic system or a very mysterious one. I disagree. I'm certain you can have the cake and eat it too, in this case, provided you're smart enough.
