I don't like the idea that the only answer to something is "lolmagic." Magic doesn't follow the laws of science, but that doesn't meant it doesn't have it's own laws. It doesn't really matter how, there just doesn't need to be leaps of logic twisted into knots and not every minor twist needs to be examined with scrutiny
