I reject the notion that going the quasi-scientific route is the only way to make magic "hard" (i.e. complex and detailed). There are plenty of non-scientific types of knowledge which can serve as an inspiration for a complex magic system, one which does not reduce to "it's magic, don't ask questions" but neither reduces to "magic is just physics that hasn't been discovered yet". See my new headcanon doc for an example of complex, non-scientific magic.
