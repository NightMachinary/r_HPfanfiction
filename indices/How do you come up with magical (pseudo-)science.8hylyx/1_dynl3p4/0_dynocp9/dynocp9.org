It's semantics, but I disagree with the assessment that /your/ purported magic system /isn't/ scientific. Science is not defined by looking sciencey and involving numbers; it's analysis of how the world works and recognizing the patterns the universe follows. In your magic's case, it so happens that those patterns are most efficiently described, not with numbers, but with human words; but as long as laws can be defined, as long as there is a coherent system that exists in the abstract, then its rigorous study /will/ be science.
