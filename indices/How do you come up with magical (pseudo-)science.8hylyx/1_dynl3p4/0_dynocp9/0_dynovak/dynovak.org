As you say, this is largely semantics, and a huge area of debate besides (whole books have been written about the definition of science) but I disagree with your definition of science, which is far too broad. By that definition, stuff like Aristotle's physics would count as science (as opposed to philosophy).

Not all attempts to understand the world are scientific in nature. Not even all empirical methods are scientific. Science is not really capable of neat definition, but as a "loose predicate" it possesses a number of common features: systematic observation, mathematisation, social institutions to regulate accepted knowledge (such as the journal system/peer review), reductionism, unity, and symmetry, etc. Not all of these characteristics are present in all forms of science (string theory, for example, contains little to no observation) but science will typically display at least a few of them.

All that aside, the word "science" has two meanings in common use: a) the scientific method, as discussed above, b) the body of accepted scientific knowledge. In my post above, I was really referring to b.
