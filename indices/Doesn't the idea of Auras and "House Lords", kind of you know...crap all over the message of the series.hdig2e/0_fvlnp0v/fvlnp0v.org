Yep.

​

A lot of common fannon tropes are... well... poorly thought out.

Magical Cores: It was pretty much explicitly stated that magic was not based on some inner supply or strength, but on imagination and practice.

Wizarding Culture: Making it into some feudal society kind of defeats the entire purpose of this fun, magical world just beneath the surface

Canon character bashing: Often character bashing is just a disguised rant about the canon character, which almost never acknowledges the very important reasons the character was the way they were. For example, making harry powerful/independent when his place in the story was to be the everyman the audience viewed the wizarding world through

​

HOWEVER, these are all in response to either flaws in the canon or simply missed opportunities that would be interesting to explore.

Magical Systems: It is nice to think out the rules and restrictions of any fictional system, and fun to try to exploit the holes in those rules. This is the classic "Weaknesses, limits, and costs are more important than powers" rule from Sanderson. Canon Harry Potter falls into the "rule of cool" way too often. Thus, Magical Cores.

Culture Clash: There is something interested about the interactions of an isolated culture that has its own standards, and how that would be resolved. HP Kind of glosses over it all (Wizards are declared to be super-isolated, but then somehow pick up all sorts of modern technology to be adapted and such). This is mostly a missed opportunity: Canon never really explained why the wizarding world was the way it was. Thus, the lords and ladies concept.

Character Bashing: It is quite natural to note that there are character flaws that are not explored very deeply, and there are character archtypes that are never really introduced to the wizarding world. Thus the bashing.

​

Just because these are good areas for fanfiction to explore, doesn't mean they are done well. Standard rule of fanfiction: 90% is crap. I have read good fics that explore a characters flaws, but most fics I read end up just being the author on a soapbox bashing canon. I've read good fics that try to expand on the muggle/wizard culture clash or try to place limits/explain the HP system of magic, but most of them just slap on a framework and go "Hey, problem solved"
