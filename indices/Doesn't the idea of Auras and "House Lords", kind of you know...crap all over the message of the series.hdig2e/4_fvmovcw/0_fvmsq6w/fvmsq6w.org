It's one thing if the writer in question actually makes it part of the story, but every example of magical peerage I've ever seen reads as pretentious self indulgence from the characters disguised as sophistication from the writer. What does making Lucius Malfoy a Lord do for the story? What is he Lord of? Would the story be exactly the same if he wasn't a Lord of [Data Not Found]? More often than not I get no answers to those questions, it's just taken as a matter of fact that rich English people must be nobles. Tywin Lannister wasn't just Lord of the Westerlands for shits and giggles, it shaped his life and defined who he was. I'm not asking for George R. R. Martin levels of detail, just expand on a concept you decided to add to the story.

Some wizards are more powerful than others, in the same way a linebacker is stronger than a baker. Life is intrinsically unfair, everyone's got natural talents others don't, and some people, like Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, rolled Nat 20s when it came to understanding magic as a whole. But by and large magic is portrayed and taught as a skill you develop and understand as you get older, which is more interesting to some people than having a larger power level just because. Not saying you or anyone else can't have it your way, but for some of us it looks boring.
