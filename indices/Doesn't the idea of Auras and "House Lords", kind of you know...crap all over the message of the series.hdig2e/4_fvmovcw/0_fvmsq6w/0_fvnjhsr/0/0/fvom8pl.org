  Harry getting stronger through rituals and increasing his 'magical core' is anime talk.

I think it depends on how the rituals work? Magical core bullshit is a no, no.

But a ritual to increase his reflexes? A ritual to make him physically stronger? A ritual to fix his eyesight? Make him more resistant to certain poisons? (All within reason, not super strength, just peak human)

I think those fit general magic, it doesn't fit canon because JKR did a whole lot to distance HP from paganism to avoid the Bible Patrol, but, I think it would fit a magical system to have rituals to improve or fix your physical body. All with the law of equivalent exchange in mind though.

Voldemort did a ritual to build him a new body, I don't see a problem with rituals for other things, as long as it's within reasons.

For me, blanket banning tropes is not the solution, normally fics that misuse those have a slew of other problems that make them hard to read or bad stories.
