I don't think that's what people have a problem with. I think it's more how the idea is expressed, often through what I can only describe as Shonen logic. Harry getting stronger through study, imagination, and experience is fine; Harry getting stronger through rituals and increasing his 'magical core' is anime talk. From a technical point of view all wizards and witches are equal, in that they can cast the same spells and produce the same results with sufficient practice, but experience and innate talent are what separate them, not blood, legacy, or power levels.
