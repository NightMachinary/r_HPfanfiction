I don't know why people just pick up a trope and interpret it as if it's always used in the same way.

A Magical peerage system is not that out of place for a society that still has roots in Victorian England and never went through the Revolutions. But I agree that reading and controlling other people through their "auras" is just boring.

I have never read/seen magical auras used in any way that wasn't to just perceive if one had a spell or charm placed upon them. Or by Luna.

And on people using the lineage to make a wizard more powerful or something, well, I don't see the problem, maybe not powerful because they are the Head of House or Lord, but because all his ancestors were on average, powerful wizards? Maybe it's random too, since the last generations of Gaunts were very weak magically.

JKR may say it so, but it`s not a far cry to imply that even in canon, not all wizards are equal? What makes Dumbledore so powerful? Or Tom Riddle? Or Gellert Grindelwald? It wasn't just the Elder Wand. And yet these guys were just above their peers, was it training, study? Or talent? And what defines talent? Blood? Chance?

It could be said that some wizards are just born more powerful than the rest, regardless of lineage.

I find no trouble in many tropes people complain about when they are used in a good and exaggerated way for the good of the story.
