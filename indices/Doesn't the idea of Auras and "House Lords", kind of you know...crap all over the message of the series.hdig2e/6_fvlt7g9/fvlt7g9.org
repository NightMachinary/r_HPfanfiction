As far as the title of Lord is concerned, hereditary peerage is still part of the British government. The House of Lords still contains individuals who are sitting on seats that they inherited, without being elected by the populace. As far as the feudal nature of Wizarding Society is concerned, one need only research the Witenagemot from the 7th - 11th centuries to see the institution that JKR modeled the Wizengamot after.

In the British legal system, judges are referred to as my Lord or my lady depending on their appointment. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that Lords and Ladies are more common in British verbiage than you think.

Portraying Wizarding society in a feudal manner with Lordships and all that is just another way of showing a fictional, fantastic version of British Society in the past. And honestly, when we read the books, didn't it seem to us that Wizarding Society was stuck in the 16th century? The only thing missing is a proper monarchy.

As far as the power level of Lords and Ladies are concerned, I look at it this way. The implication is that as a Lord or Lady, you definitely have more /money/ than the common folk, so why wouldn't you have more power? The titles are inherited through the blood, so why wouldn't the power be inherited the same?

On the subject of auras and reading them, I played too much Vampire the Masquerade to really be upset about the ability to gauge someone's truthfulness, intentions or relative power level from their aura. Seems legit. Those darn kids and all the wacky things that they're doing with pretend, made up magic these days.
