Agreed 100 percent. A lot of fanon tropes are just a pain to slog through, mostly because they're almost always used the same way. Magic Cores and power rituals are just a cheap and easy way for Harry to rival or surpass Voldemort and Dumbledore. Magic Aristocracy is used as a way for characters to be "better" than others.

I never see fanon tropes used to develop the story or the characters, they just serve as shortcuts to world building and wish fulfillment, function over form.
