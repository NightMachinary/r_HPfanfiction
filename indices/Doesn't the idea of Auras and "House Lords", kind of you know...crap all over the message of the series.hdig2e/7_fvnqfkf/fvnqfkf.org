There was a message?

The whole blood supremacy thing had nothing to do with actual literal purity of blood. It was a social class asserting their dominance, nothing more. Halfbloods and mundane born witches and wizards are 'lesser' because they aren't raised fully within that society, and any difference in outcomes is down to the purebloods enforcing their own privilege over them.

Obvious, really. How easy is it for a kid who grew up in a magical household to come into school knowing the basic theory behind what they're about to be taught? How much less do they struggle when they are effectively immune to the restriction on underage magic due to living in households where it is impossible to detect them casting, so they can practice at home on breaks?

How easy is it to keep pushing this viewpoint when the good jobs go to the purebloods, and most of the mundane born witches and wizards go back to the normal world after graduation where they can have a real career?
