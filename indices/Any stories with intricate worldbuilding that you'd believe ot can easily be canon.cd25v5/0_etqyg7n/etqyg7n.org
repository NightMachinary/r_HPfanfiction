Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is one of my faves for worldbuilding, though it's not the focus. R-dude is extremely creative with that stuff, in ways that feel like they absolutely could slot neatly into canon.

Anything by Jbern is good for this, but especially linkffn(Bungle In The Jungle) and its sequel, Turn Me Loose. Fair warning though, it's entirely in second person, which can be jarring for some people.

And last but hopefully not least, my own work linkffn(The Imposter Complex). Much of my positive feedback has been on my worldbuilding.
