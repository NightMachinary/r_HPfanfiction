Before FB, canon implied some ties to the Nazis (both were the big bad which fell in 45 after a big final battle) and the early bits we see in DH imply that he had a vision of dominance, of actually ruling rather than Voldemort's "I take over but then do nothing but an ethnic cleansing". "Hitler was Grindelwald's puppet" used to be a popular trope a few years ago. And if you are Hitler's puppetmaster, you are responsible for the whole WWII thing, which would make Grindelwald truly dangerous.

I was never really comfortable with that trope since as a German, we are taught early on how and why Hitler came to be and making him a wizard's puppet is revisionism at best and at its finest. But it was quite common when I started getting into HP fanfics.
