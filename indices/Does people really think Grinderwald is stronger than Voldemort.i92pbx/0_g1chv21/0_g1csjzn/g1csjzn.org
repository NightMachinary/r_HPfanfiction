Exactly! Tom Riddle always struck me like it was some sort of mask that hid the real Voldemort beneath; his charisma is manufactured whereas with Grindelwald, he's just a genuinely charming person, and you /want/ to be friends with him. However, you like the idea of being close to Riddle, he seems too perfect to be real. I don't think the direct parallel between Fred and George is a coincidence, is all. Grindelwald has a personality other than power hungry.
