Honestly, I'm one of the people who looks at this very differently.

Voldemort is undoubtedly the most POWERFUL of the two men.

But I will always consider Grindlewald to be more DANGEROUS. Because there is ALOT more to danger than raw power. Grindlewald comes across as the kind of man who, given enough time, could convince you to willingly murder your own parents, not out of fear (like Voldemort), but because you truly believed what Grindlewald was telling you.

It's the difference between a Scalpel and a Sledge Hammer.
