Except that a good player will ambush the "stronger" player and oneshot him with some x30 stealth crit since that's what their class is built for. Or snipe them from the other end of the map. Or out-circle them because they are more nimble and never be in a position where the stronger player can hit them.

Likewise in RTS. That big army of tanks will go down against a good recon jeep and a few guys with ATGMs. Or in GSGs, where you can easily defeat stronger enemies with proper use of terrain.
