A big problem of Voldemort is that he isn't that scary at all compared to Grindelwald, especially if you take the movies where he appears into account.

Voldemort as we see him in the books and movie is kinda pathetic as a main villain to me :

- He struggled to counquer a signle country while using very very underhanded tactics and a liberal use of the most OP spell ever (seriously a "you die lol" spell that you and your follower spam at will VS the order of the Pheonix who doesn't is an incredible advantage), while Grindelwald became a threat to the whole Europe.

- He fails to kill a teenager much too often, and somehow never thought of circumvating the priore incantatem problem by crushing harry with a big rock, making him sink into the ground or any creative use of magic.

- The magic he wields isn't that impressive except at the ministry honestly, whereas we saw Grindelwald do incredibly impressive spellwork.

- In his modern form he as absolutely no charisma, and most followers are here out of fear and not of devotion to his ideals.

So yeah, overall he feels like a less impressive villain than Grindelwald, and than most villain from other work of fiction if I'm honest, so I can easily understand why people put the emphasis on good ol Grindelwald intead.
