I concur. Voldemort truly was the most dangerous of the two. Grindelwald took over Europe, but could not invade Britain because of Dumbledore. Instead of choosing the easy path, Voldemort took over Britain, choosing the much harder path. Without a doubt, Voldemort was on the path to a much more dangerous world than Grindelwald was ever capable of.
