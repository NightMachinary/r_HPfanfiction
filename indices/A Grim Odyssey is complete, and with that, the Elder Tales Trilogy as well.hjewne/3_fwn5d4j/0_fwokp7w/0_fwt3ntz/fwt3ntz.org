Thank you for the reminder, first of all! I appreciate it, and I appreciate the feedback. [[/u/Lineofeld19]] words it well: Dumbledore didn't have all the Hallows, and I should add that he was far more adept at Occlumency than Harry.

Harry's weakness is his depression. It's a shame you don't like it, but it was a conscious writing choice.
