I've seen a fic where Hagrid uses an axe on Voldemort. Don't remember the name, but it might have been one of those popular ones back in the day. I think Hagrid is killed in the middle of legilimacy, to try and get Voldemort caught in a loop or something? Also I think the basilisk is involved somehow.
