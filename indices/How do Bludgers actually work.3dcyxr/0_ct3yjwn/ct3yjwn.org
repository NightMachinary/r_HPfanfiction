I imagine idle Bludgers make wanton arcs around the field, speeding along until it decides to change direction, with some enchantments to make it somewhat homing toward players. Enough to keep it interesting and keep it away from the audience, especially when it's struck by a bat.

I once wrote a story that shows Quidditch equipment being sentient (because the game can't get that much sillier), so there's also that.
