I think that Bludgers are commanded by enchantments to travel in random arcs, no matter what is in their path. The stands would have "bludger repelling" charms on them, to keep them in the field. This would explain why there are two bludgers in a game. The Snitch most likely has a similar enchantment except instead of random movement, it is enchanted to constantly evade capture. I also bet that the Hoops in Quidditch also are enchanted. Probably with a barrier charm to prevent bludger damage. Just my personal thoughts on the matter.
