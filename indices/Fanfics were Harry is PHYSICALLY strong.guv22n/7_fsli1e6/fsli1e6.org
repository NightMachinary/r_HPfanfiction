The premise is that Lily performed a ritual on baby Harry. The ritual gave a lot of physical strength and resistance to Harry. I think he was doing hand-stand pushups and threw weights to the roof on accident. It wasn't really my taste but I remember the grammar and story were good. I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
