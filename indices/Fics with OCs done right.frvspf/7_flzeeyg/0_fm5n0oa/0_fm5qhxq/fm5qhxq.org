Which pairing in Fate? If it is the main one, yes, it does.

Normally threesomes are written bc the author could without considering whether they should, thus they tend to be an utter disaster. Not in this case.

It actually helps push the plot along, it gives a valid reason for Kingsley to be there and explains some changes in Snape. Snape is simply not the person he was at the Battle of Hogwarts, he had time, reason and opportunity to change. In this regard you could call him a bit OOC bc he is not the hateful bastard, but it works.

Regarding the pairings for the original characters of Andy Boniface and Nanette Odont, those work beautifully too.

It is really good writing and if you don't care for the smut, just skip those parts.
