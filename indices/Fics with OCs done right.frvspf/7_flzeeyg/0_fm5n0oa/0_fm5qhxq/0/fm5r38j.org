The main one, yes. Like you said, threesomes are usually 'could over should' affairs - I've only seen a couple of OT3s that aren't.

And ah, okay. Good to know. I'll give the fic a go, then. If they manage to do something like that right, I can forgive the lacklustre first chapter. :)

Yeah, I will. I'm ace and I find sex scenes as dull as I find football (and I find football very, very dull - I fell asleep at a Liverpool-Manchester United stadium match once).

Thanks for the recs!
