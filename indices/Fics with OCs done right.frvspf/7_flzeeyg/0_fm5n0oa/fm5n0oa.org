Darkness and Light looks interesting enough - a student who purportedly sees through the eyes of her owl is certainly a concept I've only seen once before (in a D&D twitch show called Critical Role, though that was an old black dude and not a young student).

Not overly sure about Fate is a Four Letter Word after the first chapter. And does the pairing actually have character growth and development behind it, or is it the usual "They're in close proximity and we bend them into OOC until they fuck" type fic?
