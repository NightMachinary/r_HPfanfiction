Cool. It looks interesting - and there certainly is a lot of it, so that's good too. Do the relationships with Snape and Draco have some growth to them so the Werewolf and the Half-Blood aren't immediately dating people who are members of a group that would favour their deaths? Or is it just "We're in close proximity, you're hot, I'm hot, let's bang?" or Snape/Draco were good people all along and just forced to be the twats they were in canon?

No complaints either way, some fics have them grow into it and some do not, I just like to set my expectations when reading about Death Eaters shipped with their targets.
