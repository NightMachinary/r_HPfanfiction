The Durmstrang Chronicles by Loup Noir

This is about a group of teachers at Durmstrang, and only one HP character appears in a short section (Remus Lupin). It's interesting and has complex, grownup, flawed original characters. Mostly gen with some het relationships adding a bit of interpersonal drama, but it's not a romance series.
