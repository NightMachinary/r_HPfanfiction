No biggie - like I said, no complaint or accusation, just looking to confirm. And heh. Nice. You're learning. :)

But yes, thank you for all the recs.

Floreat's thing looks like it might be a bit smutty for my taste (I find sex scenes incredibly dull to read), but the rest look interesting enough. Changeling particularly sounds fun - women being awesome is a good tag. :)

And thanks! No pressure to hunt any down though. Just if you're amenable to it. :)
