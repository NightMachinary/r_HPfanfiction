Fair enough. And will do. I've read the first chapter and enjoyed it greatly (The lily-ginny parallels with the bathrobe thing are utterly hilarious), so I'll likely enjoy the rest of it too, but I'll letcha know when I've finished a full fic of it. :)

And damn. That's a shame. Reviewers can be dicks sometimes in these big fandoms. Hopefully she'll consider it, at least. Can't let the trolls win, right? :)
