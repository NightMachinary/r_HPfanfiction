Wont need to hunt down, just as i read, something will come to mind. The TeaTime is prob my fave, the first one I can say I love love love the many OC's in it. And from there my list went on and on lol. Please let me know what you think of the TeaTime series, the last one is not complete, the author was trolled and chose to start writing in the GoT fandom. I follow her on twitter and she is in lockdown due to Covid, and said she is bored, so i asked her to please consider finishing SFTOH. No reply, but i remain hopeful. Anyway, happy reading!!
