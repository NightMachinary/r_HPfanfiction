frombluetored's It's TeaTime series has some great OC's, most are next gen friends of the Potter kids. Caden, Nora, Iset, Ben and Evie, I have to stop or i can keep going forever and still miss one out. (plus there are Harry and Ginny's grandkids! - wait till you meet the twins!). Jenorama has a great OC amongst her Potterverse series, Ben, a a gay muggle who is Ginny's best friend. And I am currently reading an older fic, St Margaret's The New Zealand Chronicles and it has some great OC's as Harry is training for a Search and Rescue gig. And Hedwig's romance with a native owl is so cute! Continuing with my OTP Hinny, Annerb's The Changeling and the Armistice series has the Parlour girls and (again)Ginny';s best friend, Tobias. Floreatcastellum's current WIP is a James Sirius story with an OC Hazel. Shall I stop now? LOL
