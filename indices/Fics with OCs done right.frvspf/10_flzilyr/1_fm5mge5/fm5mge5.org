I'd say yes, but mostly because I imagine most authors here aren't introspective enough about themselves to make a wholly accurate character of themselves, so it's basically an OC inspired by themselves anyway.

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is another of those fics I've apparently read (it's in my read-sorted bookmarks folders) but remember nothing about - so thanks for the rec that I'll be rereading for basically the first time!
