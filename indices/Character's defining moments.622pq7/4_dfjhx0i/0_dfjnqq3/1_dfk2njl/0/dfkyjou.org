I actually don't like H/G or H/HR and think that H/Cho would be better or even the king of bullshit pairings H/Draco. I generally try to ship harry with a black or a delacour or oc/crossover character or just avoid major romance. I also like the Weasley's even molly and ginny though I am indifferent to the twins because I used to know these 3 "pranksters" but they were just bullies and kinda dicks unless you were friends with them which leaves me with a negative view on pranksters.

Edit: also the only reason I don't dislike the twins is because their characters were kinda like what I used to wish I was like back when I was like 15 if you could replace prankster with that one bastard who is always behind you and steals things before giving them back without you even noticing and does that weird thing where you can't tell where he is by his voice which led to me taking singing lessons and spending hours trying to figure out how to do that and DAMMIT I'm going on a tangent.
