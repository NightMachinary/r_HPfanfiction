I understand what you mean about the skydiving metaphor. The gist of it is the idea and peer pressure make you feel all hells yeah until you get there where you are like "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuuck. I do not want to be here right now" until you are watching your Friends jump out where you have the whole peer pressure and hormones practically dragging you out and you feel this sense of obligation where you *need* to jump out /or else/ and it turns into fight or flight where both involve jumping out.

So the thing with the DoM would be like yeah it can't be that bad (because your fucking ignorant) and peer pressure make you go until you going through all the dangerous shit and realize that you are in deep shit but can't really get out if it until the corpse munchers arrive where you are In such deep shit that you *need* to fight /or else/.
