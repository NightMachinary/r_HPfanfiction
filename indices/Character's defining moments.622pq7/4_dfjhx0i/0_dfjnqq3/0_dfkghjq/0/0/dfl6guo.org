I can see your reasoning. I guess I just don't really get the skydiving metaphor from a personal point of view, since I'm naturally a very cautious person in terms of risky behavior and over think things a lot, and try my absolute best to not get involved in potentially dangerous things. (The idea of skydiving scares me shitless, so I would have a very hard time deciding to do it on the basis of 'fuck yeah this is awesome.') So for me it would take an insane amount of bravery/courage/loyalty to be able to do half the shit Ron does.

Also, I find it funny that you don't like Ron because he reminds you of your 15 year old blunder years, which is the exact reason I like Ron. I see a lot of myself and my flaws in him, especially his jealously issues. Because of this, I can sympathize with a lot of his poor choices over the series, especially the ones rooted in jealousy (which is to say, almost all of them.)
