1st year = naivette/ no real danger

2nd year = spiders - (peer pressure + monster that kills people by turning them into stone as soon as they are alone or in a small group) = monkey level of shit flinging (also known as bad but not too bad)

3rd year = trust me until someone you know gets killed mass murderers out for people who either are your friend or fit your friends description feel vaguely threatening but not life endy

4th year = actions speak louder than words/better ask for forgivness than permission is the rule of theives and dicks the world over.

5th year = umbridge does not even reach monkey levels of shit flinging until the end of the book, it was get detention or get your friend killed and even the biggest cowards chose the former and DoM was like skydiving you were like fuck yeah until you were in a plane but by the time you realized the shit you got into peer pressure and adrenalin kicked in and by the time fighting started he was either about to die or being mind raped by a tentacle monster.

6th year = the little shit he could have betrayed harry over were nothing compared to the size of harry's metaphorical stick

7th year = lightbulb mode was its FINAL FORM^{tm} because peer pressure and weird light thingy were influencing him even when it was not in it's FINAL FORM^{tm.} also horcrux hunt uses same skydiving metaphor along with harry has the biggest stick until he realizes harry doesn't and then runs away until lightbulb/peer pressure forces him to realize that he is harry's friend, he wants to copulate with hermione (do not make me think of ron/15 year old white ginger me having sex it was bad enough when I did it), and the fact that the only thing he really wants in life (respect for his own accomplishments and surpassing his family in every way) were not things he could achieve working for deaths bitch but could easily get with fate's bitch.

I think that the reason why I don't see the good in ron is because he reminds of myself from when I was like 15 because back then I was like Ron: Black edition with subtitle 'whiny bitch who dreams big and tries bigger but runs away as soon as shit hits the fan only to run back to help clean the shit once someone sprays some fabreeze.

tldr: I hate my 15 year old self. ron reminds me of 15 year old self ron. I hate ron. its whatever you call that awkward form of narcissism.
