I'm really interested in how you said that as soon as shit hits the fan Ron would stay you in the back, because aside a few minor arguments throughout the course of the series, he consistently stands by Harry, /especially/ when shit hits that fan. The only two major times he turned away from Harry are during the triwizard Cup, which, fair enough, was a dick move, and in the 7th book while under the influence of the horcrux, which has been shown to negatively influence people by making them not think clearly and bringing out their worst traits on multiple occasions. As soon as Ron left the influence of the locket he tried to return, but got caught by snatchers. He escaped and the tried numerous times to find Harry and Hermione, but they were hidden from him. He went to stay with Bill and Fleur, but when the deluminator showed him how to find the others, he left to find them as soon as possible.

In first year, he stuck with Harry through the traps before the stone, and willingly sacrificed himself so Harry and Hermione could go on when by all eight he could have just fucked off and not helped at all. Keep in mind he had known Harry less than a year at this point and was only 11.

In second year he went into the forest with Harry knowing they were walking right into a spiders den, despite them being his biggest fear.

He continued staying with Harry throughout 3rd year, knowing that a mass murder was after him, even after being seemingly attacked. I also vaguely remember him stepping in front of Harry to protect him in the Shrieking Shack, even with a broken leg, but I'm not 100% so don't quote me on that.

Fourth year he was pretty much an all around dick, I'll give you that, but he apologized in the end.

In the fifth year he went distracted Umbridge so Harry could contact Sirius, and then insisted on going to the DoM with Harry, sticking with him until he was critically injured and couldn't continue.

In the 6th year he was a bit of an insensitive jerk, but he never intentionally betrayed Harry over anything.

In the 7th book he transfigured the ghoul in the attic to resemble him so he could go Horcrux hunting with Harry, and stuck with him through the entire hunt with the exception of when he was manipulated by the locket, and like I said, as soon as he was out of its influence he tried to return to them.

All of this was done completely voluntarily, putting in himself in danger countless times, and going to further lengths than anyone could reasonably expect a child/teenager to go, and even just being friends with Harry made him a target. In all seven years he had known Harry, he only abandoned him once while in his right mind and not being manipulated by an evil artifact.
