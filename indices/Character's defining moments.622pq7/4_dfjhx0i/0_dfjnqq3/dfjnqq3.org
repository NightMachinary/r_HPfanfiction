No matter what I will always dislike Ron just like I dislike h/g. Ron is a good guy but like peter is a good guy, as soon as shit hits the fan he will stab you in the back for his own safety. I think this is no better shown than when he runs off in DH where he is rallied by dumbledores wierd ass compulsion light of spirity weirdness. It really seemed that Ron would have become a snatcher or fled the country if he did not have said light to guide him. I believe that this also shows Harry's character better than most scenes when he meets Ron again and immediately accepts him without question, how would you treat Ron after he pulled that shit?
