My opinion on Ron was majorly influenced by his tantrum after Harry became Champion. I remember being really annoyed at him, as a reader, because back then I identified with Harry a lot and felt that such betrayal couldn't be forgotten, nor easily forgiven. Which made me pretty annoyed at Harry for forgiving Ron like he did. That was the moment for me when Ron was suddenly tinged in a very different, more negative light in my mind. He had his moments of greatness, no doubt, but his flaws and shortcomings were always reminding me of people I didn't want to be friends with in the real world.

This is something that also reflects on my writing. I can't write Ron. Period. If I write him, eventually it falls into a bash of his character. Therefore I mostly just don't write him at all. I also remember one fic I once read where Ron's tantrum was a complete break between the two, but without bashing. The friendship just ended, which was the more "realistic" outcome in my head.

Hermione is a bit of a double-edged sword with me - /nowadays/. There were a lot of moments, small ones and throughout the series, that made me put her on a pedestral. She was intelligent, valued knowledge and learning and was loyal to a fault. I think a lot of her negative traits were simply ignored by my ~14 year old self.

I don't really remember there being "a moment". Looking back, I think her character just resonated with me from the start. Probably because I too was a socially awkward loner with no filters in my mind when it came to sharing my book-knowledge. I only remember the moments when she broke with this glorified picture of her. The moments that tainted her character for me. For one that would be her zealous ways of trying to free the elves, regardless of the elve's wishes. It was her acting purely on ideology and ideals, rather than on conclusion from research and discourse. The next was her (and Ron's, to be fair) dismissal of Draco's plot in sixth year. For her to so completely disregard even the /possibility/ was a pretty scarring thing to read.
