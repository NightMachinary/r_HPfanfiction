  Hermione was stuck at the last task, for only one of us could go forward. She suggested that I should go despite her voluminous spell knowledge. Her argument was simple, and I couldn't deny it.

  "I am just books and cleverness; there are more important things, like friendship and bravery and..."

  "And?"

  "Well, a killer instinct. You don't flinch, Holly."

  I guess I must have looked a little sad as I nodded my head, because Hermione gave me a hug to compete with the strangling vine just then. It took me a minute, but I finally relaxed into it. I hope someone gives you hugs, Harry. They make you feel like you can do anything. Hermione gave me one last piece of advice before she turned to go back.

  "Don't you die in there. I would feel severely put out."
