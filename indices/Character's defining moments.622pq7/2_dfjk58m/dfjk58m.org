For me nothing in the books defined Harry better than the moment he accepted death, lying on the carpet of the Headmaster's office, having just surfaced from Snape's memories in the last book. And I think the reason for this should be apparent enough.

Another crucial thing is when Harry went back to save Fleur's little sister in book 4. When I was younger I thought this move was just silly and came from Harry's naivete; but now, having taken the way Harry Potter grew up and the sort of life he'd led up to that point into account, I think things are in fact just the opposite. He /knew/, all too well, how unreliable people could be when you need them the most, how death is just around the corner, and he'd decided long ago to be the person who would come forth to help, if nobody else will. It never even occured to him to not go back to save Gabrielle. That for me is Harry in a nutshell.

Oh and another moment: in the first book, when he sat before the Mirror of Erised for three whole nights. The reason for this one should also be apparent enough. His whole character is built around his orphan identity, his desperate love for his parents, their heritage, and consequently his deep seated need for a family of his own.
