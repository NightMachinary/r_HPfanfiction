Actually, that part made me the angriest, out of any other part in the book. Harry is someone who never got to live a good life, his girlfriend was someone who he couldn't really relate to/express his emotions to, and she wasn't really a person who seemed to be the shoulder to cry on, Harry was always the one everybody cried on, meanwhile he had his own demons to deal with.

We see throughout the books that Harry is made out to be put at a disadvantage from the start. He shows no particular interest in magic, he only shows skill when he needs to, and he only shows ambition when he needs to. He learned a Patronus Charm to play Qudditch, but after seeing the Dark Lord rise, he just moped about for the next book, and trained everyone else, but himself. The only reason he had to die, the only reason Dumbledore acted OOC and set it up like that, the only reason any of the Battle of Hogwarts happened, relied entirely on OOC decisions. It was when I really looked back at the series as a whole and realized that Rowling mostly did it to fulfill a narrative, rather than tell a compelling and believeable story. You even see this when Harry attempts to make Voldemort repent.
