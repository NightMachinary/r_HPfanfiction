I was referring to your statement that what Dumbledore did regarding Harry's Horcrux status was OOC, and that Harry "moped about" in book 5, and that it was an irrational move from Harry telling Voldemort to repent. That's not at all the way I see these events in the books. However I'm not going to argue with you, it'd take a long while and I'm really tired. Perhaps if I had more energy right now I'd lay my thoughts regarding these issues out in detail, but not now. We're all entitled to our own opinions of things.

*Edit: Also, you will notice that I added "(at least when it comes to this particular plotline)" when I said the events and the characters are "perfectly consistentâ€œ. I'm not saying that there are no inconsistencies withint the books at all, but I'm certainly not seeing them in the points you've brought up.
