1.) It's a common consensus that Harry's pov was Angst-Filled exposition throughout OOTP. The only moves he made, was training up the DA, instead of himself, on something Hermione said.

2.) Not saying it was an irrational move, just saying it was OOC, Harry had constantly reiterated that he would never forgive Voldemort. If he experiences the murder of his parents in such vivid detail, I don't understand how he was capable of consciously attempting to allow Voldemort to live.

3.) Wait... so you're saying that Dumbledore throwing Harry up for the slaughter, is in character? He had always been against 'The Greater Good' that's precisely why he stopped following Grindelwald's beliefs. He even reiterated that when he met Harry at King's Cross. Which is a whole in the plot itself. The same could be said for Harry's sudden interest in learning advanced magic in the third year, then suddenly losing that interest in the fourth year when it was required of him.
