  Plus, I don't see why Harry has to do anything.
#+end_quote

Harry is someone who always does something, even if he doesn't have to. Case in point, the DA and the Patronus Charm. If he felt powerless from watching Cedric die in front of him, which he did, the only natural move for Harry would have been attempting to train himself in Magical Combat. Because that is what Harry does, and has done for most of the series before that. Tri-Wizard Tournament? Learns Spells to compete on an even playing field with the other competitors. Dementors threatening Quidditch? Learns Patronus Charm to repel them. Heck, he even learned the Disarming Charm in passing because he saw Snape use it effectively.

That's why his entire character arc was thrown out of the window in the fifth book. The Harry we've known for almost four books may have acted similar, but he most definitely wouldn't have sat there knowing the Dark Lord was still out to get him (with dreams through his eyes to boot).

Harry is supposed to be the 'Leader' and 'Take Charge' most of the time, that is what he did most of the time in all the books. He wasn't struggling with his role as saviour, he was struggling with Voldemort's visions and his PTSD.

  You might not understand it, but nevertheless, Harry is the sort of person who would tell Voldemort to repent.
#+end_quote

Harry at that point had grown up from previous ideologies, he used an Unforgivable on someone for spitting on Professor McGonagall, and inferences that you're trying to make with previous incarnations of the character are pretty much useless, as that is when the narrative took over fully. Don't believe me? Think about HPB, and his "Monster in his Chest", and then think about how suddenly before going into the forest, he gets a wave of "savage pride for his parent's sacrifice". It's inconsistent with everything.

  Dumbledore dedicated his whole life after his sister died to prevent the rise of Dark Magic,

No, not the rise of Dark Magic, the rise of Dark Lords. There is a huge difference.

  and planning to massacre millions of Muggles to build a non-existent ideal Wizarding society.
#+end_quote

That's your own headcanon. Albus was still a genius even during his Hogwarts years, and he was still a Gryffindor. The plan likely sounded good enough and saved enough people in the end, that he approved of it. Otherwise, he never would have gone along with it.

  you will find Dumbledore's whole reasoning and the mental struggle he went through in the years
#+end_quote

Yes, he said that he did this all for Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Reducto, Sectumsempra, Patronus, Confringo
#+end_quote

These are all spells he learnt in a short amount of time, that are well above his year when he learned them respectively. Harry's interest in the Patronus Charm was because he felt powerless in their presence, and he wanted to play Quidditch. Once again, an inconsistency when he sees the Dark Lord rise and is powerless in the Duel against him.

  I don't know why you're so bent on picking a fight with me, do you not have anything elese to do at all?
#+end_quote

Sigh.
