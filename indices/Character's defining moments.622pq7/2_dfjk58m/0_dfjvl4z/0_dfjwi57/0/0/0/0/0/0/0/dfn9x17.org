I agree with everything except for the whole Dumbledore is 100% bonafide gay thing. It's never explicitly stated in canon, and even in the interview with Rowling, she said that she 'imagined' him as gay, thus she never actually put it into canon.

Even when she said that Albus 'loved' Gellert, she could be referring to the infatuation he had with Grindelwald's power and intelligence, almost emulating through him.
