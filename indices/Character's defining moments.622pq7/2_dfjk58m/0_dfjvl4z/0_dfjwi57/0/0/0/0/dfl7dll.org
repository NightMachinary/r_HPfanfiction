Re: 1. First off, there's a difference between being a tramatized 15-year-old who had just went through a whole year of hell filled with, but not limited to, being ostracized by the whole school, almost shunned by his best friend for good, almost losing his life god knows however many times, and to put the icing on the cake, witnessed the sudden and unexpected death of his school rival and sort-of friends, right in front of him when he could do nothing. I must see Harry differently from how you see him, if you would describe how he felt and the emotional state he was in after all that as simply "angst" and "moping about". It's liking calling a knife wound "a scratch", and calling the victim a whiny little baby for saying it hurts.

Plus, I don't see why Harry /has to/ do anything. It's not his job to be a saviour. It's his job to be a teenager. If he becomes a saviour, it's because he chooses to do so. He spent the whole of book 5 struggling on the choice, and he only made up his mind by the end of it. He was in complete turmoil (and very understandably so) throughout the volume, and if you really put yourself in the shoes of a 15-year-old (and one who has been under his relatives' ceaseless abuse and had essentially no one to rely on for the first 10 years of his life, and who had been through more in four years time than most adults have gone through by forty), and if you put aside Harry's literary role as the heroic protagonist for a moment and just looked at him as any other boy, I think you might understand why.

Besides I don't know there ever was a "consensus" on this. A lot of people brings up the same complaint that you just made, yes, but also a lot of others hold views more similar to mine. You were just exposed to a limited crowd. When it comes to Harry Potter, I don't think there are many "consensuses" among its readers. This is one of the most divisive fandoms. Every possible point could and have been argued.

Re: 2. You might not understand it, but nevertheless, Harry is the sort of person who would tell Voldemort to repent. Not because he had forgiven him, but because it was the right thing to do, for Harry. By the end he was looking at Voldemort in a near pitying light. He understood things that Voldemort never will, and even as he advised Voldemort to repent, he knew Voldemort most likely wouldn't do it, and yet there is still a small part of him that can't helpt but hope. You will notice that the books mention the similarities between Harry and Tom Riddle throughout, and out of all the people, it's Harry who understands Voldemort the best, even better than that man understood himself. Besides, he wasn't attempting to allow Voldemort to live. He was attempting to prevent the final devastation of Voldemort's soul before all hopes of salvation had gone out. He knew what kind of existence Voldemort would lead after he died, and he wouldn't wish that on anyone, even if the other is his worst enemy and living nightmare. Voldemort would have died no matter what; the Elder Wand was Harry's, and Voldemort wouldn't use any other curse than the one he thinks to be the most powerful (the Avada Kedavra), and so the spell would have rebounded on him no matter what Voldemort did. The difference is how whole his soul could be when he goes into that ephemeral station.

Harry understood the importance of the integrity of one's soul. Voldemort didn't.

Re: 3. I think Dumbledore is a vastly complicated character, and his attitude towards Harry is even more so. He had shunned his teenaged ideal of the "Greater Good", because it was a warped one, and he would never do anything in his life again that's simply all block letters and helps no one in reality, much less do evil in the name of good. However, at the end of book 5, Dumbledore specifically mentions he had a plan tor Harry, and that that plan began to fall apart the moment he laid eyes on the eleven-year-old little boy. To me, that tells me that Dumbledore plans with his logical mind, but his decisions are not always immune to emotions, as in the case of Harry. He cares for Harry, perhaps more than any other living thing, yes, but at the same time he knew how crucial Harry is to the war, and he even explicitly said that he had weighted the life of Harry against the life of everyone else, and he found that perhaps he had cared for Harry a little too much. Yet the simple fact that he was able to make that comparison says that he would still do what's necessary; it's in the other places that he made compromises, like the fact that he should have let Harry know everything the moment Harry came to Hogwarts, and he didn't. And I don't think it was ever a question of if he would give up Harry's life; all he did was lead Harry onto a path and hope that Harry chose the right direction when he came upon a crossroad. He had already given up training Harry as a soldier, back in year 1. He yearns to protect Harry; he knows what Harry had to do (and guessed that when the right time comes, Harry would voluntarily do it.) These are two types of motivations and emotions inside of Dumbledore that exists simultaneously; one doesn't exclude the other. Again, Dumbledore's complicated, and a lot is behind every seemingly simple decision he makes.

I haven't read book 5 in a while, but if you looked at the chapter after Sirius's death, when Harry and Dumbledore talked in his office, you will find Dumbledore's whole reasoning and the mental struggle he went through in the years after James and Lily's death laid out there, in detail. He spoke in riddles, but it's all in there.

Dumbledore dedicated his whole life after his sister died to prevent the rise of Dark Magic, and he was prepared to lead a little boy onto the same path because it was necessary to do so, but there is a huge difference between being a war leader and doing what it takes to win, and planning to massacre millions of Muggles to build a non-existent ideal Wizarding society. The "Greater Good" he abandoned was a dangerous and harmful ideal, but I think the utilitarinist part of him still remains, even though it tortures him as well as he had to watch people's lives play out (either in misery or in triumph) because of his decisions, even if he tries to suppress that nature, just as he tries to suppress his own power-hunger and thirst for control. It's what's required of one when one is literally the only viable leader against a Dark Lord. He mitigates that utilitarinism with his genuine caring for everyone who works for him and his cause. Besides, you will notcie that even as he was planning to wage war on the world alongside Grindelwald, that aside from his power-hunger, there was also a part of him that was driven by something truly good: he wanted the wizarding people to be free, to not be like his father and sister and mother, who had either gone to jail, went mad, or been killed by her own daughter because of what three ignorant muggle boys had done. He didn't hate those boys; he simply fantasized about a way to prevent any of that from ever happening again, and in his teenaged, love-addled mind, that equated to Grindlewald's "brilliant" plan. This is what set him apart from Grindelwald, even from the beginning.

As for Harry's "sudden interest in learning advanced magic": no, he never was "interested" in the Patronus Charm, he learnt it because if he didn't he would most likely die, and even if he didn't die, he would experience something a lot like death when he ever went near a Dementor. And again, he isn't a boy who is setting out to be a saviour and hero; he's just a boy trying to survive when everything is out to kill him, and struggling to do the right thing at the same time. Remember that before book 5, he didn't even know he and Voldemort was fated to die at the hands of each other (i.e. the Wizarding world is essentially on his shoulders), he just knew that he survived one of Voldemort's attacks and the guy will always be after his head for that.

I don't know why you're so bent on picking a fight with me, do you not have anything elese to do at all? We could argue the finer details of the book for whole days, but you do know that there has been whole books written about the themes and characters of Harry Potter, and I'm not sure I'm willing to spend my breath on it when I do have other duties to attend to. Can you not be content with the fact that we will hold different opinions on this matter, just as everyone does on every subject there ever was? You are free to hold your own opinoins and I to mine, and before you had to reply to my post with three long points when I didn't specify what I thought about your views just that I disagreed with them, I wasn't going to type out these many words at all just to argue a fictional plot with some stranger on Reddit. I'm not the only one who thinks of the book and the characters in this way, and if you're determined to start a fight with someone, find someone else. I've stated all I can on the subject, and if you have anything else irl to do at all, let this go, and feel free to discuss the OOCness of Dumbledore and the plot holes in the books with someone of a similar view to yours. I'm not going to reply anymore. Have a good day.
