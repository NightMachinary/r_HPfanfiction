you know, this nigga got a point. by the end of book one harry had come to terms with the whole wizard jesus thing otherwise he would not have tried to hel with the stone, book two he did the same. Harry was struggling with puberty, survivors guilt, and ptsd along with being the voldemort jinchuuriki. it's not ooc that harry spent his time angsting but it is ooc that harry never got off his ass and tried to prevent that shit from happening again.

Harry is shown to be ambitious and incredibly adept at magic. except when he's not. harry is able to learn and use high level spells in a short amount of time with relative ease yet he only does so for arbitrary reasons. he tried to learn more advanced magic during year 4 but stopped because he wanted to angst about not knowing good enough magic? that shit makes no sense.

harry is a child soldier. harry is the worst kind of child soldier, he literally suicide bombed voldemort because it was the "right thing to do" and would "honor his mothers sacrifice". Harry was like that from the moment he realized that voldemort may not be 100% dead. i'm sure that if he read a book with a ritual in it that would let him permenently kill voldemor or seal him into something he would have skipped from step one to dead demon consuming seal and sold his ass to the shinigami. by the time year 2 started he was ready to kill himself to help put down voldemort.

also on the repentance bullshit. that shit is like the H/G bullshit. it exist to make him a better shonen protag and not for common sense. he pities voldemort in the same way you pity the rabid dog that killed your best friend, you put it down like the like the little fucker deserves and do not try to make it better with the power of love

I also don't think dumbledore ever acts ooc. he has a president or reason for everything he does and really fits everywhere from the repentant old man trying to atone for his sins to the evil dictator who realized he done goofed putting on the death ring and merely set up everything so that his ideal world could happen after his death. the only label aside from straight male that does not fit dumbledore would be blood purist (assuming that you ignore everything aside from harry potter books 1-7 because pottermore, and fantastic beasts are bullshit.)

also I view dumbledore as a crazy brony who is supergay like that guy who you don't think is actually gay because he tries so hard to "act gay" and uses all the shitty tropes associated with a "gay" character and that dumbledore wants to solve everything with the power of love like some sailor moon character. so basically my headcannon is that dumbledore is a batshit insane brony who wants to solve everything with "the power of love" and a caricature of a gay person.

Note: not being homophobic it's just that dumbledore is perfect for that role, it's really more satire than anything serious but it stuck with me
