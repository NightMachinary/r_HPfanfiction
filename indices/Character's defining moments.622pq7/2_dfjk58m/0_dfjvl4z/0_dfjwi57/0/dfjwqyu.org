  I definitely can't agree with your assessment of Harry and Dumbledore's Character.
#+end_quote

What assessment did I make? I stated simple facts, Harry is constantly seen as an active person, who does things not because he has to, but because he feels that he needs to. Dumbledore is someone that cares deeply about Harry, he constantly did things to better the boy's life and allow Harry to grow, but it was in moments where things should have escalated; when Harry should have taken his experience in the Graveyard to heart, and trained himself (or asked Dumbledore for assistance) because obviously, this Dark Lord is out to kill him. For someone who is always supposed to have initiative, and who always clings forward, Harry seems to miss those qualities in times of need.

I don't know if that's a joke or not.
