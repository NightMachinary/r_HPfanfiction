Each will have their own interpretation of the books and its events, I guess. To me the narrative and characters (at least when it comes to this particular plot line) are perfectly consistent, I don't see any of the plot as manfactured to fufill a certain objective, and I definitely can't agree with your assessment of Harry and Dumbledore's character. However, I will choose not to go into detail here, because then this comment would devolve into a page-long essay that nobody in the sub would have the patience to read. So guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on the point.
