Can't remember if it was in the books, but in the Department of Mysteries at the end of Order of the Phoenix, when Sirius yells out, almost absently: "Nice one James!" when Harry disarms (I think?) Lucius Malfoy before Sirius finishes him off.

That one line says so much about his character all at once, and it's so sad at the same time.
