I agree that's a really great moment (probably better than mine, but I liked that she was able to help in a moment when all hope seemed lost). I've almost never read an accurate Luna in Fanfiction, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]] is one of the ones that comes to mind, as it doesn't make the mistake of almost making her inhuman.
