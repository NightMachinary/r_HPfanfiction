For me the Luna moment will always be the bit about 'it was like having friends' or something like that. To me that showed that she was a slightly broken little girl, perhaps too accepting of her lot in life but simply a odd little girl, no seer, no hidden genius or whatever people in FanFiction try to do to her. Just someone peculiar enough she was awkward to be around and she didn't see the need to change.
