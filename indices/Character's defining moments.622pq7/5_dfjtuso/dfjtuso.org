Character defining moments that come to mind (mostly just ones that made me love the characters in question all the more).

Percy and Fred: I was mostly ambivalent towards Percy during the books, this scene however, changed me into really respecting him-and even liking him-it takes a lot of bravery to admit his mistakes as he does. I also liked that despite Fred normally being the one to harrass Percy, here he immediately accepts him back into the fold.

  'I was a fool!' Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. 'I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a-a' 'Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,' said Fred. Percy swallowed. 'Yes, I was!' 'Well you can't say fairer than that,' said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy.

Luna: Luna saves Harry, Ron and Hermione here. The fact that she's able to encourage Harry in such a dark moment really stuck with me.

#+begin_quote
  'That's right,' said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply the spell practice for the DA. 'That's right, Harry...come on, think of something happy...'
#+end_quote

Ginny: Ginny really stood out to me in the OoTP and if it weren't for Luna she would probably have been my favourite character of that book. This is my favourite Ginny scene.

#+begin_quote
  'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.' 'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?' 'The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'
#+end_quote

Hermione: Hermione's bravery was especially noticeable in the OoTP, this is one of the moments that come to mind.

#+begin_quote
  'Harry,' she said timidly, 'don't you see? This...this is exactly why we need you...we need to know what it's r-really like...facing him...facing V-Voldemort'
#+end_quote

McGongall: There are a /lot/ of standout McGongall moments (even in this very scene) still I really loved that she offered to go beyond the call of duty of a teacher.

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move; she towered over Professor Umbridge. 'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'
#+end_quote

Ron: Ron really has some great moments (such as standing up to Sirius), I thought this really emphasised his character the most however.

#+begin_quote
  'We're nearly there,' he muttered suddenly. 'Let me think-let me think...' The white queen turned her blank face towards him. 'Yes...' said Ron softly, 'it's the only way...I've got to be taken.' 'NO!' Harry and Hermione shouted. 'That's chess!' snapped Ron. 'You've got to make some sacrifices! I'll make my move and she'll take me-that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!'
#+end_quote

Neville: I just loved that he had no idea what was going on-but still tried to protect Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  'Got 'em all,' said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room. '/That/ one,' he poked a thick finger at Neville, 'tried to stop me taking /her/,' he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin holding her, 'so I brought him along too.'
#+end_quote

Arthur: Not necessarily a smart move on Mr Weasley's part, but a very brave one.

#+begin_quote
  'One moment, Runcorn.' The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr Weasley said, 'I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.' Harry had the impression that Mr Weasley's anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance to act stupid. 'Sorry?' he said.\\
  'Don't pretend Runcorn,' said Mr Weasley fiercely. 'You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn't you?' 'I-so what if I did?' said Harry. 'So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the man you are,' said Mr Weasley quietly, as the lift sank even lower. 'And if he survives Azkaban, you'll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons and his friends-'
#+end_quote

Molly: I sort of imagine that Molly is actually quite powerful and this really shows it. And of course it's all in defence of her family.

#+begin_quote
  'You-will-never-touch-our-children-again!' screamed Mrs Weasley. Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
#+end_quote

Malfoy: HBP gave a lot more character to Malfoy and this sort of summarises the buildup for me.

#+begin_quote
  'There is little time, one way or another,' said Dumbledore. 'So let us discuss your options, Draco.'\\
  'My options!' said Malfoy loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand --- I'm about to kill you ---' 'My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first dis-armed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.' 'I haven't got any options!‚Äù said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!'
#+end_quote

Dumbledore: I think it's really quite poignant that Dumbledore probably saw something very similar to Harry in the Mirror of Erised.

#+begin_quote
  'What do you see when you look in the Mirror?' 'I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.' Harry stared. 'One can never have enough socks,' said Dumbledore. 'Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.' It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful.
#+end_quote

Harry: Harry really grew I felt as a character after Dobby's death. I loved the respect he gave in burying Dobby himself.

#+begin_quote
  Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared under the Rock's surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read: /Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf/.
