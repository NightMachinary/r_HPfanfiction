Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has the ministry forced to ally with Hermione's IRA-equivalent Muggleborn Resistance (who bombed quite a few pureblood manors) against Voldemort. After Voldemort's defeat, tensions rise again. Also, Daphne and Tracy become double agents.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Harry, as an auror, helping the thieves he's supposed to hunt to rob Malfoy to reduce his influence in the government.
