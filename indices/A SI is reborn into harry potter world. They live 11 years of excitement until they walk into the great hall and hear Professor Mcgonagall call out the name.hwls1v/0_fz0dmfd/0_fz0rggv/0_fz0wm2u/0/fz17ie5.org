It's just horribly bad, more so than the usual parodies, and people thought it was a legit fanfiction for a long time, some still do in fact. I guess it's the confusion that stems from the fact that they can't quite seem to put their finger on whether it's real or not. There's been fanart, and a while back somebody came out to say that they wrote it but it seemed to be a fluke, sadly, and so the plot thickens.
