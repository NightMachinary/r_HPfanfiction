  Ever wondered what the events of 'My Immortal' would be like through the eyes of a normal Hogwarts student? 'My Mortal' retells Tara's literary masterpiece through the eyes of Lucy Bonniface, a Slytherin girl in Ebony's dormitory who just wants to get through her final year at Hogwarts smoothly so she can get into the university of her dreams. But that isn't easy when the school is teeming with Mary Sues and bizzare, OOC canon characters having sex in the middle of classrooms all the time.
