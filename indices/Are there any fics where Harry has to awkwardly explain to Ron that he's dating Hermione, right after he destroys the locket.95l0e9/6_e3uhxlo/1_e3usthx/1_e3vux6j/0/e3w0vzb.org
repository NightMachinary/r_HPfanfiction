Hold up. The comment I responded to is a clear cut violation of rule 8. It's a request thread, and they complain about the notion of the request and start talking about how the would want something else entirely. Hence them acting like a twat. If calling them a twat is vicious enough to qualify as a 'personal attack', there's no way in hell then taking a paragraph to deride the very notion of Hermione enjoying Harry's company doesn't qualify as 'expressing your opinion about the thing being requested'.
