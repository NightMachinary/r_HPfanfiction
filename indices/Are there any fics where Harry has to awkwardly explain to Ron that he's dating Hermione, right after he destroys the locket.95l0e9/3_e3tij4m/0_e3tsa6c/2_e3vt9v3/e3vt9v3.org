See for most fiction I'd agree. But HP is a special case, I've read so many different fanfics and AUs that although I love the world, I can't take much seriously about it anymore. If I see one person die, I know they're alive in another bajillion different fics out there, living their lives happily all the way through. I appreciate the writing and plotting and new ideas more than I have empathy for the characters, they're like beloved puppets that we pick up and play out scenes with, but in the end, they're all right.
