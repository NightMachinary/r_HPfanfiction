Honestly, I'd read this kind of thing so that I could see Ron learning to move on from the jealousy and insecurity to become a better wizard. I don't have any doubt that he could overcome these difficulties, especially since there's still the death eaters and Voldemort to fight. And if the story isn't a bashing fic then I'm sure Harry and Hermione would still want to reconcile with Ron and vice versa.
