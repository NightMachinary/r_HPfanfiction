That always comes across as sad to me. He has the base to be a really interesting character if people take the time, but it's too easy to join the bashing band wagon and write him off. He'll never be my favorite canon character but I would still love to see him more often as something other than the trio's dip-shit or the jealous ex friend. (note, I mean this for harry centric fics which I spent the majority of my time reading)
