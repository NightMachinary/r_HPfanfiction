I also loved how the author named the chapters. It's always the hardest part for me but I got a real laugh out of that one. And yeah, I loved how they made divination into an actual branch of magic not just this "You need the talent or you'll never do anything worthwhile in this course" thing they did in canon. Why would they even teach it if that was the case?
