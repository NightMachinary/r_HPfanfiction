I don't have a recommendation but i finished Rent-A-Hero literally two minutes ago and i need to rant about the author not updating after that last chapter. I was really looking forward to Tonks' reaction... :(

I truly hope the fic isn't abandoned because i have never read anything that made Divination look so cool; not to mention that Harry/Tonks is awesome and i need more of it.
