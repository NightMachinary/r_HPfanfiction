For the longest time I mused about a series where Harry opens a foster house and takes in some war orphans and is somewhere between a teacher and a parent to them, including the children of people that once tried to kill him.

edit: oh, and technically, my Darkness!Harry story will have Harry teaching his friends some spells, an expanded DA, and his Darklings things because of how their minds work, he has to teach them how do to the things he wants them to be able to do. They can't just summon a gun because he wants them to, they have to know how a gun works which means Harry has to know first.
