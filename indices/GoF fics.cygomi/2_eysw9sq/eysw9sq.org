linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is a complete work that goes up to the end of 4th year (though I think there was an abandoned sequel that was supposed to comprise 5th year). It starts at the end of 3rd year. Harry receives the memories of his father. There is romance and Harry is powerful but not OP. This author writes the best Quidditch scenes and also does really good action scenes.

My personal favorite fic that involves GoF stuff is linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) it's Harry Potter in the style of Ender's Game. It's a really well done AU where after the 1st Wizarding war against Voldemort, Hogwarts gets significantly more militarized and it's curriculum becomes much more combat based. It starts in the beginning of 3rd year, but GoF stuff takes up the last half of the work. There is romance, but not much, Harry is again powerful but not OP. Dark with lots of mystery and plot twists and turns in this one; combat is also well written. In progress, updates bi-annually, but the tournament has been finished.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13035363/1/I-m-back]]) is a fic that borrows heavily from kathryn518's I'm still here but does a better job of it in my opinion. Harry time travels to 4th year but quickly realizes that he's in an alternate world where there is a Girl-Who-Lived. Incomplete but very well written and worth the time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]]) the original. Again, IMO I'm Back does a better job but I'm Still Here was written a few years prior. Incomplete.
