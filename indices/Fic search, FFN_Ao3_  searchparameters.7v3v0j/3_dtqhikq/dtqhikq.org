Hah, I've been on the same binge (honestly, I've become unable to read anything that isn't Harmony or at least where the romance isn't emphasized), and I too need to get into Ao3. Wish they had a dedicated app, as I much prefer reading FF on the app via my phone. Easier to lay down and read after a trying day. I haven't yet read that Harmony fic you mentioned, so thanks for that!
