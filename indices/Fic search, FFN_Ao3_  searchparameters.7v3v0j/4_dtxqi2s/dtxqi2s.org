- Livejournal is a site you're probably missing out on. It's incredibly hard to search, especially if the community doesn't use tags. I made a list of HPHG related sites last year. Some of them may not be updated anymore, but you can look for some old fics.

- Portkey is another site. It went down last year. Luckily, there's an archive for it. I think you can search by title and author?
