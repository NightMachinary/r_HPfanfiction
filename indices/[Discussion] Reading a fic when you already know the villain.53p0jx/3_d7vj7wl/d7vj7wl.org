That can totally work, but then the tension from your story will need to originate from something else other than the "who's the bad guy?" question.

I think the best way would be to write your story in such a way that you really focus on selling the villain's competence and making the reader believe that he really might win. It would also go a massively long way to make him so sympathetic that the readers are torn between supporting his plans and actions and doing the same to the other side.
