I think as long as there's extra tension beyond the characters simply finding out whodunnit, it works. For me, it was that one protagonist didn't realise they were in a close relationship with the villain, and the other was being will fully ignorant because he didn't want to face the fact that it could be a friend. The story has to take on a very human element above action for it to work. It's NOT everyone's cup of tea, at all, but the reviews I had for chapter 10 and the climax itself were just the best.
