That's sort of what I did with my fic. Revealed the villain in chapter 10 and had the rest of the fic focused on the tension of the protagonists not realising how much danger they were in. I think it worked fairly well, lots of people mentioned that they were on the edge of their seat or had to put the fic down for a bit because they felt very anxious, but some people definitely felt I should have reached the climax quicker than I did, which is probably fair. I really enjoyed it from an author's point of view, but I suspect it was too frustrating for some people to read.
