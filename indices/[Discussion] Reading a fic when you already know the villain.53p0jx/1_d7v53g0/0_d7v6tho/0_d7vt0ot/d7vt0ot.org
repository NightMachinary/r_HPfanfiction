The Villain Problem occurs when the villain of the story is more proactive/successful than the hero, who's reacting to whatever the villain does. The Problem is that readers may root for the villain, the guy who's actually good at what he does.

Interesting characters do stuff. They have a thing they're good at. It may not be the thing required to succeed in the plot, but they have something.
