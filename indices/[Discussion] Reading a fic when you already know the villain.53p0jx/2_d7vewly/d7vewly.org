It could definitely work, but the timing can be kind of iffy. It's really hard to strike a balance between revealing the villain to the characters too soon and revealing the villain too late. And even if you do manage to, from your opinion, you'll always get people who think otherwise.

That being said, I love fics like this, and it always keeps me in suspense. Unfortunately, I have a really hard time dealing with suspense like that so I usually skip ahead just to find out when the big reveal is going to happen haha.
