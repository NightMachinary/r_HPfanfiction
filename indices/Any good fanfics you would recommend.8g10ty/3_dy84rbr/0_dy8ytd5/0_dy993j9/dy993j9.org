true, but I feel the excuse of Pureblood family silliness (gotta marry, man has power) is an acceptable excuse to be sudden about it...

and at that point in the story the HP stuff is kinda finished anyway, and the story does have that 'where the fuck is my husband' stage where HP cast are mysterious OP people who scare the mafia (for those reactions) and provide a outside viewpoint (as a introduction to the Hitman stuff)
