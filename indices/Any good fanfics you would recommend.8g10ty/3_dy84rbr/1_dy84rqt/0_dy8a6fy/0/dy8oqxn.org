The first time I read this fic I had no knowledge of KHR but I still enjoyed it. It certainly drags on considering the length but if you are a fan of worldbuilding you may like it. The second time I read it after getting into the KHR fandom it was definitely more enjoyable and showed things that I previously missed out on. I would recommend giving it a try at the very least, Umei no Mai is an enjoyable author. The beginning of the fic focusses more on Dorea so you would be more familiar with the HP world before other elements are introduced.
