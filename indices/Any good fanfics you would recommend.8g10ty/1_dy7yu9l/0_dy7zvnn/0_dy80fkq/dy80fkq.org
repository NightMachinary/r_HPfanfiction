I can admit that amazing was an exaggeration now that I think about it, I'm not yet comfortable enough with the english language to always use the correct descriptive word. And in my opinion the fact that Harry is Super!Harry is not a problem since that is nowhere near the focus of the story. The focus is the feelings between Harry and Gabrielle and all the mushy stuff there.

It's not a story to read when you're looking for 'Sitting on the edge of your chair' action. But rather when you're feeling a little down or disappointed in your life and just want to escape for a short while.
