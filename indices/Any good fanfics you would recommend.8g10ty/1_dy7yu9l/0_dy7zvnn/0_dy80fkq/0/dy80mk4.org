And I think he/she handled the Veela power rather well, in that they didn't repeat it Over and Over again but rather explained it once and then just said "And so they explained Veela nature to Ron" (of course, much more well worded than that) and then moved on.

Ps. If anyone has any other decently written Veela stories for me I'd be happy to hear your suggestions. :)
