I'm going to be careful. I've got 3 abandoned fics, 2 that are H/Daphne and one that is H/F that are all excellent, but they are not complete and likely never will be. If you want I can link them.

However I do still believe I can help you.

linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery) is my favorite of all these. It's not terribly long but the prose is excellent and the author does something truly amazing with a unique idea. A must read. H/Daphne.

linkffn(The Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7) is Harry/Daphne, is long and complete. The author is well known around here and all their work is very well written. (Although I'm still angry about Limpieza De Sangre)

linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) is Post Hogwarts and H/Daphne, very well written and is a nice look into what the epilogue should have been not just "Happily Ever After"

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) is a classic and its H/Fleur. I'd imagine you've read it by now, but I felt obligated to mention it.

linkffn(Paid in Blood by zaterra02) is the ultimate guilty pleasure that is H/Daphne. The writing is not great but its still a good bit of fun.

linkffn(Resurgence by Acturus Peverell) is H/Daphne. Tropey and not entirely original but readable.

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) like the above fic its Tropey and not great but still readable. H/Daphne.
