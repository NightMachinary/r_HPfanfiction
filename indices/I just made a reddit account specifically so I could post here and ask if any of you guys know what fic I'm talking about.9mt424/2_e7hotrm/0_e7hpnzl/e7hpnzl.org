Oh its absolutely possible. I usually find a trope I like and then consume as much of that trope as I can get my grubby little hands on.

There are two scenes I remember perfectly. The first one is when Harry breaks into St. Mungos to look at security footage/memories/ records of the day AU Harry died, and it was like a bomb hidden in a plant or something. Basically, Harry realizes the fire was set to kill the Auror in the room so he couldnt ID a deatheater or something. AU Lily, James and Harry were just collateral damage.

The second scene I remember is the one where Neville Hermione and Ron decide not to invite Harry into the DA. (As described above) I remember that one very clearly because it was really funny to me. It like a college student getting left out of a middle school study circle, and yet he was so affronted. Like "how DARE they not let me in!!! I'm supposed to be defenseless!!! If anybody needs the DA its me!!! " eventually he admits that it would be harder to keep his cover in the DA, but the hilarity of his initial reaction really stuck with me.

That title seems familiar, I'll go take a look. If it isnt this fic, its probably a fic I've read before, and likely a good one if I still recognize the title.
