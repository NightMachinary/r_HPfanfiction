The St Mungos stuff, is definitely in Stranger in an Unholy Land (maybe it's in other stories too).

This description reminded me of a story where Harry travels to a dimension where Lucius attempted to/succeeded in killing alt-Harry but then canon Harry miraculously appears and has to figure out why Lucius is trying to kill him (maybe with the help of Draco?). I think that alt-Harry is dating Hermione and Harry's brother/Neville is the BWL. That's the only other story I can think of where Harry is trying to solve alt-Harry's murder

If someone could help me find that story, that would be swell.

EDIT: nm, it's Free Will and Fate by Sara Winters. He didn't dimension travel, he went back in time and changed things, then went forward again. `And it was Snape trying to kill him. The Harry's brother/Neville stuff isn't there though.
