I dont think it was. I would go as far to say I'm 99% sure it wasnt finished when I read it.

Honestly idk when I read it. It definitely was longer than 2 years ago, so anything written since then is out. 2011-2016 was my peak fanfic reading years, but it could have been older than that.

I'm almost positive it's on fanfiction.net. I knew of mugglenet, but I pretty much used ff.net exclusively until ao3.

I dont remember any ships. In fact I'm pretty certain it wouldn't fall under any sort of romance genre.

I know that wasnt ver helpful. Sorry! Let me know if you have any more questions that might help, I would be happy to answer! I really appreciate your help!
