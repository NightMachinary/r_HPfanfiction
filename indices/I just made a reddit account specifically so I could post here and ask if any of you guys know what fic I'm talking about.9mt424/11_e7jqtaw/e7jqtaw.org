God I wish there was some way I could go through a shit ton of fics and filter out the ones that dont have the words I KNOW are in there. Like if it doesnt mention St. Mungos or fire I know it's not it.

Today I also remembered that the auror that also died in st. Mungos had his face wrapped in gauze or something (I think). Also I'm fairly certain Harry was in remedial DADA (again, I think, that might have come from a different fic.)

Also I'm almost positive the plant that exploded was devils snare. It had moving tentacles and it was a plant mentioned specifically in the books, just not for blowing up obviously lol.
