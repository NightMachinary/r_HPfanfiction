I think you've mixed up two fics. The scene you've described where the 'original' Harry and his parents die in a fire in the long-term ward of St Mungos, after a bomb is planted, is from A Stranger in the Promised Land by serpant-sorcerer (AKA Jono) linkffn(3592984) It's the sequel to A Stranger in an Unholy Land. Neville isn't the boy who lived though, Katie Bell is the girl-who lived. Everything else is exactly as you've described; Harry's parents were tortured to insanity, Harry grew up isolated like cannon Neville, the fire that kills all three and the rest of the ward was orchestrated via a bomb, which Harry discovers by stealing and reviewing the security tapes, McGonagall was outside the ward and meant to be supervising his visit. New Harry takes over the old Harry's life and keeps his identity a secret, Katie is living his original life with Ron and Hermione (plus Neville), and they don't trust him to be included in the RA (AU title for DA).

There were only four chapters ever posted to ff, but some more were posted on the yahoo group for the story and can be reached [[https://strangerinland.weebly.com/a-stranger-in-the-promised-land.html][here]].
