Lmao I would, except in middle school/ early high school I read a lot of fanfic through proxies to get around school firewalls reading through proxies. So theres a good chance I wasnt even logged in when I read it.

I should have more time this weekend, I'll go through my fic history then. Maybe we'll get lucky and i just missed it before.

I wish we could some how run our fic histories against each other and find the similarities.
