Hi, just wanted to let you know that the story you are after is definitely a stranger in the promised land, I've just reread what there is of it.

It has useless Harry being replaced by a Harry that had already defeated a Voldemort(in the previous story).

He isn't invited to the DA.

Katie is the Girl Who Lived.

The useless Harry and his parents are killed by a bomb in St Mungo's.

Harry breaks into St Mungo's to watch the security footage.

It has Lockhart hiding behind a potted plant in the security footage as a disguise to escape just before the bomb is planted.

And the actual target wasn't the Potters, but a healer that was in there.
