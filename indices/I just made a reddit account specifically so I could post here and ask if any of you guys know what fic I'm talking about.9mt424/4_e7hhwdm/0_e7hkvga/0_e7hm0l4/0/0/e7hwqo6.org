I don't suppose you remember any lines of dialogue at all?

Or even just a sentence describing something as it happened?

If you do, use it as a search term in google like: site:[[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]] "sentence/dialogue here"

I've used similar searches several times to find fics I barely remember anything about and it's worked for me.\\
Doesn't even need to be full sentences, just a part of it that might make it stand out.
