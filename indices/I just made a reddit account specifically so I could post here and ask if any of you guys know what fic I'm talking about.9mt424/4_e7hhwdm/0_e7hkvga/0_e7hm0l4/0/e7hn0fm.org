Maybe? I thought he was in gryffindor bc I remember the au golden trio not trusting Harry enough to invite him into the DA. Like they thought he would crack under pressure from umbridge or something. But they felt bad about it tho, bc obviously Harry was so defenseless and helpless, so they start tutoring him separately from the DA. Which is hilarious on multiple levels, like Harry knew exactly what they were talking about when he interrupted bc he remembers having the exact same conversation, so when they dont invite him and change the subject hes like personally offended. And on top of that hes like already defeated Voldemort at this point. Hes better than all of them, and yet there he is, in a spare classroom with the AU golden trio, pretending to be a dumbass while they "teach" him Expelliarmus.
