That's not it, but I have read this one! It's pretty good. It's very similar, but in the one I'm looking for I think it was a bomb that caused the fire/explosion? I remember thinking it was hidden in a potted plant at the bedside of some auror. But thank you for your help and for reminding me about this fic!
