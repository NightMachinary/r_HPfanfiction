  Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the trio find themselves separated and struggling in the aftermath. When Harry and Hermione are reunited after years apart, neither are where they want to be. Neither feel capable of meeting the expectations set upon them as children. Together they saved the world but can they save each other from the scars the battle left behind?

  He glances at the boxy too-uniform numbers flashing on the face of Richard's radio. It's nearly noon, and he should be getting ready to leave; but there is still a harsh tension in his shoulders and neck that he wants to work out before Hermione finds him. It is, after all, Tuesday; and while his Tuesdays were designated ‘tea with Helen' days previously, they are now ‘lunch with Granger' days, ever since the chance meet-up with the Weasel's wife and the insufferable swot herself.

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

  “It's possible that I need therapy,” Hermione declares. “You have needed it since you were eleven, at least.” “Do wizards have therapy?” Harry asks, with a laugh. He's not taking it seriously. Hermione is, though. “Muggles do.” [hermione, eighth year]
