The word /logic/ has a number of related meanings. Hermione was using the more mathematical one: logic could be used to go from the propositions in the text of the puzzle and the arrangement of the potions to a conclusion about which potion did what. Not being in the habit of using this formal logic to reason, most wizards could not have solved it.

What to do with that conclusion was a different matter, and a different meaning of /logic/.

Now, the idea of Hermione going to confront Quirrelmort in Harry's place is a fascinating one, and I can definitely see her being afraid and rationalising in canon. I know of one fic---linkffn(The Mudblood's Logic by Cervantes Diderot)---that explores it. She justifies it by figuring that Harry is this big symbol of hope, whereas she is relatively expendable. However, fic quickly goes off the deep end, in my opinion.
