It kind of ends up having practically every single Indy!Harry trope and fanon but with Hermione, including inheritances and Manipulative!Dumbledore.

It's disappointing, since the premise itself is intriguing: Hermione essentially deciding that since Harry is obviously the designated protagonist, he must be protected, and in doing so, stealing the protagonisthood from him.
