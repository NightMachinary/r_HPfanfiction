Harry made the choice to do it, which kinda sets up the whole series.

No, Harry doesn't /have/ to do much. He doesn't /have/ to be the one to do a lot of what he did. Choices are theme of the series and it's established in HBP Horcruxes that Harry does most of what he does because /he/ made the choice to do it.
