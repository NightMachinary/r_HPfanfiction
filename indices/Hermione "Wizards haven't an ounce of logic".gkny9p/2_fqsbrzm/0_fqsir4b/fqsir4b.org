To be fair, they tried to go to the deputy headmistress who didn't listen to them, and the only person higher in the hierarchy, the headmaster, just happened to be on his way to London (by broom if I remember correctly). And while they could have gone to another teacher, why bother when one is obviously untrustworthy, another appears to be a coward, and the deputy explicitly tells you to mind your own business or else. They obviously thought it would be useless and that they had to do something.

Also, they suspected an other teacher, and thought that teacher was trying to bring back Voldemort (and on that part they were right, even if they had the wrong teacher).

And Hermione was kinda right, some stuff are more important than knowledge. But it's true that Hermione would have been the better choice knowledge wise (if she had been courageous enough to go).
