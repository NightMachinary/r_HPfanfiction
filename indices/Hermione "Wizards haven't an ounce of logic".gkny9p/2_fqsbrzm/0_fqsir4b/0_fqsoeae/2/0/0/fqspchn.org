Oh I definitely agree with you.

And some stuff was introduced in the same book, only not to be used, to feel like a greater punch to Harry. (The mirror that Sirius gave to Harry, for one). Although honestly, why didn't Sirius explain what the mirror did? Why didn't Harry ask? Plot convenience, so it could hit even harder when he realizes.
