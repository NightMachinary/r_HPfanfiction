None of those had been invented by Rowling yet, seriously though I understand where you're coming from. Thinking back on book 1 or book 2, and I'm like wait, why didn't this person use the thing introduced in this book here? Most likely because it wasn't invented yet.

A lot of issues with the books as a whole, when you dig a little too into it, still love the series and the characters and the way it makes me feel, but yeah, definitely problems.
