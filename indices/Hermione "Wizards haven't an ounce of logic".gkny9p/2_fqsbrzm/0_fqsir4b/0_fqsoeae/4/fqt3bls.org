The author of this post goes pretty in depth over Dumbledore's master plan. Basically, Dumbledore needed Voldemort to be amazed at Harry as the child of prophecy to ensure he used Harry's blood in his resurrection. So he engineered a controlled scenario to do so. The poster claims that Dumbledore never left the castle during the climax of the 1st book and was likely in the mirror room during the climax, ready to merc Quirrell in case of the plan going off the rails.
