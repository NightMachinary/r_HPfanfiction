That's why I find it so annoying when people try and make patterns from the first books where there aren't any, if you go to [[/r/Harry][r/Harry]] Potter you'll see a ton of fan conspiracy theories about the most inconsequential stuff, but it's so damn minor that apparently Rowling was a genius to put it in. Honestly guys, your finding patterns in nothing.
