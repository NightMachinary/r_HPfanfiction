Yeah. Age line probably being the worst offender. If Dumbledore could just stick a semipermeable by age magical barrier anywhere he wants then he should have stuck one in front of fluffy's door. Or around the forbidden forest. Or in front of the restricted section.

Though, I've never quite believed Dumbledore ever actually left Hogwarts.

"“I don't need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently." From the conversation about the mirror of erised.

"“You got there? You got Hermione's owl?” “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you ---”" from Harry's discussion with Dumbledore after quirrell's death.

Just a bit odd to be like "yeah I suddenly realized, for no reason at all mind you, that as the headmaster of Hogwarts I should probably be at Hogwarts." Especially since he's often not at Hogwarts, apparently.
