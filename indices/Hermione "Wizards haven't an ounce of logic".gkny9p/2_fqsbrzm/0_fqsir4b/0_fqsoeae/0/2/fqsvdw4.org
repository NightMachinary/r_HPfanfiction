Apparition most certainly was- Dumbledore is shown Apparating to the Dursleys', and the random wizards Harry meets growing up are always described as disappearing before Harry could get a good look at them. Presumably they were Apparating as well. Even if it had been established that you can't Apparate on the ground of Hogwarts at that point (not sure if it had been), it would still be much faster to leave, Apparate off the grounds, then Apparate back outside rather than broom ride all the way there. More so, even if Dumbledore didn't realize the danger the Stone was in (which seems like a huge oversight but from what he says that seems to be at least partially the case) and decided to take a leisurely broom ride to the Ministry, as soon as he realizes something was wrong then he should have Apparated right back. Which he might have, however he told Hermione (I think, maybe it was Harry) that he must have passed Hedwig "mid-flight," which implies he was flying a broom back. So either he was lying to them about how he got back for some reason, was speaking in an odd metaphor that makes no sense, or he really did fly a broom despite knowing about the danger at Hogwarts and there being a faster mode of transportation already established.
