Yea I think this was the biggest reason. I doubt JK even thought up those other options yet.

Something could be said about Dumbledore being such a weirdo that he would respond to any inquiry by saying something like this for taking such a method of travel:

  Please allow an old man to indulge upon the exhilarations of his youth. Changing of age comes with a changing of acceptable ways to drink in the wonders of life. The exhilarations of ones youth can become unsavory to indulge upon while others can still be enjoyed in the meditative calm of solitude. /sigh/ oh, the missed thrill of height and its accompanying swooping sensation felt in the stomach. The whoosh of air as it blows against the hem of robes can become exhilarating as it rustles against against knobby knees and rickety ankles.

I could actually see him saying this to stop any more questions while he actually used the time to quickly check up on individuals and assets he had in The Order, consolidating them if the rumors of Voldemort sympathy being revived.
