Likely because Rowling didn't put weeks worth of thought into every small scene.

If you want in universe explanation, then maybe Dumbledore wanted a nice relaxing flight, before he had to put up with that little shit, the Minister, again. (I think it's in first book that we are told how the Minister of Magic constantly pesters Dumbledore for advice.)

And by going on broom instead of just relaxing in the castle, he could truthfully say that he came the moment he got the Ministry's letter.
