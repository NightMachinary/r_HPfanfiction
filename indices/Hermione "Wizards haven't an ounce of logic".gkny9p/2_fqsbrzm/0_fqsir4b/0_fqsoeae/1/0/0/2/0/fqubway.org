Because it literally didn't matter how Dumbledore got to the Ministry. He would have been away from Hogwarts regardless. And I believe you overestimate the importance method of transportation used has on the ending scene.

But I did offer a potential scenario and it's very much possible Rowling had actually put the necessary thought into it. It is perfectly plausible in universe that Dumbledore, the somewhat wacky old wizard, would do something sub optimal for the fun of it.

It certainly wasn't 'the stupidest thing ever' as one guy put it.
