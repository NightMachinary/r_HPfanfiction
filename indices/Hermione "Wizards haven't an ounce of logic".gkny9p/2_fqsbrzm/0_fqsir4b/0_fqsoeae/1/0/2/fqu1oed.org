Maybe "flew" is the past participle of the verb "to floo" that is, "to use the floo to travel somewhere."

"To Fly" can also mean "to go quickly" without referencing the exact mode of transportation. "The wide receiver flew down the field after catching the ball, thus scoring a touchdown" vs. "there was so little traffic I flew down the highway."
