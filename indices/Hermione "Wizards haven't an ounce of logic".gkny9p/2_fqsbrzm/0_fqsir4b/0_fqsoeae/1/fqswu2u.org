If he had apparated, he would have still been gone by then, and McGonagall would not have interrupted his important ministry business.

And from skimming the last 2 chapters of Philosophers Stone, it seems that the urgent Owl Dumbledore got from the ministry was actually from the ministry and not faked by Quirrell. So he would have been kept busy regardless.
