Cool. I think it's an interesting possibility, but I feel like it probably would have made more sense to first time readers later in the series, once JKR had really established this trait in Hermione (PS was a start, but not enough for me...). It makes sense in hindsight, but that's just because I know future Hermione. Anyway, here's an upvote for you...
