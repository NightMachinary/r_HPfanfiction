Another thought just occurred to me.

So, suppose that Hermione's the one to go ahead. Quirrelmort quickly subdues her, and tries to use her to get the stone out of the mirror. But, can she? The mirror would only give it to someone who wouldn't want it used, and Harry didn't.

Unlike Harry, Hermione thinks big. She might consider all the good she could do with the gold she could transmute. She might remember that her grandma and grandpa could use a rejuvination. She might want Nicholas Flamel to keep living, so that she could talk to him one day. Indeed, she might not covet the Philosopher's Stone for herself like Voldemort, but she would certainly like to see it used for good.

As a result, she is no better at getting it out of the mirror than Quirrelmort. What would happen next?
