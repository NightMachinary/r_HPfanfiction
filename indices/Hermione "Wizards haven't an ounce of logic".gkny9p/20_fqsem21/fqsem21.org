It's actually really annoying, now, reading back, how much the adults had to be dumbed down in order for Harry Potter to work. None of those kids stood a chance; however, I will say, that if it had to be one of them, it should have been Hermione. But, the books are called "Harry Potter" for a reason...

EDIT: I completely forgot about Hermione under pressure...
