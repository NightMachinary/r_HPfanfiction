Sort of. They were in different situations.

Hermione did not choose to confront the troll. She was just moping alone, and then the troll showed up, and someone locked the only way out. Harry and Ron /chose/ to enter the bathroom and engage the troll. IANAPsychologist, but that seems like something that would completely change how a typical person would react to a given situation.

If either Harry or Ron had been been doing his business in the bathroom alone, a troll had wandered in, and someone had locked the door, it is not unlikely that they would have reacted similarly to Hermione. Similarly, if Hermione had seen someone in danger from a troll and had chosen to intervene, it is likely that her actions would have been more similar to Harry's and Ron's canon actions than to her own.

In the hypothetical case of Hermione taking Harry's place, it would be her choice, and so she would be less likely to freeze.
