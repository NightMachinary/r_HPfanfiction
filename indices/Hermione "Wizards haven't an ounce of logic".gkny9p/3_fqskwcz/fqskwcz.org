I dunno, Harry is definitely better under pressure than Hermione: with the troll she froze and with the devils snare she forgot she was a witch.. Also Harry was in charge, he talked them into it with the whole stop Voldemort or die trying speech. And he's more athletic, the most likely scenario off a first year going against an adult would pretty much look like a game of Harry hunting on steroids while hoping for help to arrive. I don't think knowing a few extra first year spells makes enough of a difference to compensate for that.
