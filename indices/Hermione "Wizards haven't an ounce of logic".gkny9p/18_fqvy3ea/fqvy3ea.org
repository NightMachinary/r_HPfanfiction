Tbh the whole "wizards don't have any logic thing" is a /huge/ cop out from jkr. Why didn't the wizards or adults do a or b? Why weren't James and lily their own secret keeper? Why didn't they check pettingrew for a mark? Why didn't Voldemort do the ritual in Harry's first year? Why were the ministry so stupid? These are just the first rhetorics that came to the top of my mind so they aren't very good examples but you get what I mean. The title just reminded me of how essentially easy an explanation it was to just have the answer instilled into the reader when confronting anything that had an easy explanation that wizards should understand. But also i don't get it?? Wizards went to school ;their work was very theory heavy so why /don't/ they have an ounce if logic?
