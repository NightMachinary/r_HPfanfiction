I'm not excusing their behavior of course, but to be fair, Dumbledore was gone, they thought Snape was after the stone, they told Professor McGonagall that someone was after the stone. (She's also the same one who let first years go into the Forbidden Forest when there was an unknown monster killing and drinking Unicorn's blood, WTF McGonagall?). I mean Forbidden Forest wasn't just a name, Dumbledore said himself the forest was dangerous.

Also from my memory (unless I'm thinking of the movie, which can be possible) there was only one potion, for only one person to go meet up with who they thought was Snape. But yes I agree, very stupid. Though to be fair, there's a lot of stupidity in the Wizarding World, that I know Rowling probably didn't think fully through, but some of the things that happened in the books, I'm just like wait, why didn't you use this thing that was introduced in x book here? (And it was likely because Rowling just then had thought of it).
