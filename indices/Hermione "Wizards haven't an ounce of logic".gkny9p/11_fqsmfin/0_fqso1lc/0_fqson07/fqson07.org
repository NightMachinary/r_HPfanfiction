Ah thank you for the correction. But even so, the fact that a few first years figured it out should have made her (and Dumbledore to be fair) more on guard and be there. McGonagall should have contacted Dumbledore immediately afterwards.

Also WTF would Dumbledore have the very important stone set in a school full of children, where someone might (and did try to steal it).

I love the series a lot, but yeah, so much problems when you think about it too much.
