As much as we like to analyse Harry Potter, theories ship and write fics, we can't forget that Harry potter is a kids book.

Especially the first few. The maturity and age group of the novels increase with the books. But it is important to realise that the characters are not meant to be realistic they are meant to tell a fantastical story of a little kid beating a powerful and experienced adult with the power of love.

I love HP and have gone down this road as well over thinking things. Like why not place a sonorous charm on a mandrake and poRtkey it into diagon alley? We can't hold imagine charecters to the same standards as normal humans.

That's the origin of the crack, powerful and bash genre. I do enjoy these but in moderation.
