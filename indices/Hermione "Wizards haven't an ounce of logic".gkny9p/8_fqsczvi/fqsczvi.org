Oh wow. It actually never occurred to me that there's no reason that it has to be Harry going forward other than him being the main character, haha! Now I really wish Rowling had included some reason as to why it couldn't have been Hermione, who by all accounts was shown as being smarter and more skilled at that point (with the exception of flying).
