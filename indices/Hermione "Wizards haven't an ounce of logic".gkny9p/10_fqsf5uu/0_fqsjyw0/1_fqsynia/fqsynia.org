I was 8. I felt they had a hero complex from the start. But I am a Slytherin and I started considering Harry and Ron idiots on Halloween when they didn't tell a prefect. Oh yes let's scurry along the moving staircases to find a girl when there is a troll on the loose. I mean it's not like the troll is on the same floor, it's in the dungeons! But wait, surely the troll can walk....yes let's go. Two 11 year olds who can't even cast a levitation charm against a troll. And Ron the pure blood wizard didn't even think about this? Why did Albus even send them to the dorms? Yes let's risk our students coming across a troll while sending 1/2 the school towards said troll. Good idea!
