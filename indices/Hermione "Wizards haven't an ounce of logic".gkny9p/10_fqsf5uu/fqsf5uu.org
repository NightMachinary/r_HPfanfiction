I was 11 my first read through, and I didn't facepalm, but I was fairly astonished. My first thought was for them both to stay between the fires and tackle him when he came back through. Safety inn numbers type thing you know, but then I realized there might be a second exit so ok, maybe someone should go check.

My second thought was to send Harry back running for help because his history of 'Harry Hunting' probably made him the faster runner of the two and Hermione being smarter she might have a better chance to survive my favorite character of the book.

My last thought before reading on was, "why are you wasting time to look after Ron?! Go fetch a professor to save the rock and then grab Madame Pomprey to take care of Ron. Unless heroine studied healing that the readers didn't know about there wasn't a whole lot to she could do for him.

After finishing the book I had a thought that was funny to me. What if Hermione had went on to face Snape, and Quirrelmort tried to use her to get the stone, but she couldn't retrieve it because 'only those who wanted to find the stone but not use it could get it out of the mirror'. After all, as inquisitive as she is, would anyone deny that deep down she wouldn't want to find it, then "use" it to study? I could easily see her wanting to study it to learn more and replicate it if for no other reason to prove she, a Muggleborn, could. Possibly tempted to live longer to learn more, but that reason is a little more debatable.
