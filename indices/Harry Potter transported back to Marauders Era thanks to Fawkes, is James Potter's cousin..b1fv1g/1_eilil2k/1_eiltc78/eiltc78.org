I wish it was but something seems . . . . /off/. No Fawkes and it's Gryffindor Harry. Additionally I have read this a few months ago but the way Snape was obviously into Harry made me extremely uncomfortable so I stopped reading.

I know I didn't mix /A New Life/ with the one I am searching because the backstory between the sister and Voldemort is missing.
