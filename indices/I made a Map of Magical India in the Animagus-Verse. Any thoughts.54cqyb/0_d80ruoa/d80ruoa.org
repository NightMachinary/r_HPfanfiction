The Animagus-Verse comes from my story, /The Accidental Animagus/, linkffn(9863146), and its sequels. In the Animagus-Verse, the magical countries in the ICW mostly line up with the muggle ones, with a few changes. But Magical India is a confederation of pre-colonial empires, Princely States, and post-colonial republics. This is the map I'm using for a planned one-shot set in Magical India.
