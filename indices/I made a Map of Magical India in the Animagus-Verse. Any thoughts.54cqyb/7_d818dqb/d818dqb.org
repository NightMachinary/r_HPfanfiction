If I were you, I'd look into Indian mythology and geography to come up with some better names. There's a lot of baggage associated with some of these names, since they were (or in one case, are) real countries.

Indian history is full of religious conflict and invasion - by picking names like Marathas or hyderabad you're saying that an Islamic invasion happened in the wizarding world as well (the Marathas revolted from the Mughal Empire, and Hyderabad comes from the Deccan sultanates). Bangladesh and Ceylon imply British colonization, etc.

It might be best just to come up with your own names that don't have anything to do with history. How about Ayotha Amirtha Gangai, the mythological River? Or Brahmapura, the land of the gods? Shambhala, said to be found in Tibet?
