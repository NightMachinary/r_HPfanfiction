Maybe I'm just a drama llama but I think that since Peter had no problem betraying Lily and Jame, he'd have no problem telling Voldemort who the SK is. I also don't think that Sirius could survive 10 years without being found and captured, expecially since he would tell Peter where he could be found in case of an emergency. So Voldemort would probably capture him and torture the secret out of him and it would all be business as usual with the rest of canon. Well except for the part where Sirius would be dead or insane.
