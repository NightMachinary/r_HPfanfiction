The hard thing about torturing someone for information is actually not the getting them to speak part but the filtering out the truth part. While under intense and prolonged pain people will say anything and everything they think their torturers want to hear, no matter the consequenzes. Nothing against Sirius but I don't think he could withstand that. He might bite through his tounge before saying anything but then he'd be dead and I don't remember if a Fidelius holds if the secret keeper is dead.
