Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

It's 4 tasks themed after Fire, Water, Air and Earth, and the entire thing has never been canceled and is still going on after centuries. And Harry has to seriously win, because whoever manipulated the goblet entered Hermione as part of the prize (it's from a time when slavery wasn't unusual). Also, it's filled with assassination attempts instead of kidnapping because Voldemort decided that kidnapping a celebrity with hundreds watching isn't that great of an idea.
