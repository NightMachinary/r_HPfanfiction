Linkffn(Hallowed) features different tournament events, different competitors from Beauxbatons/Durmstrang, and a different Harry (6th year who entered on purpose and wins the nomination legitimately). Highly recommend, though it's likely a dead fic - I think the Transfiguration challenge is particularly unique and interesting
