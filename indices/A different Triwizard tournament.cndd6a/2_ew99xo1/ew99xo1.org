In my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn), the Triwizard Tournament is decently different, with three age divisions and some new tasks. The series features Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Slytherin and a healthy dose of politics and worldbuilding. Also, no bashing and no child politicians!
