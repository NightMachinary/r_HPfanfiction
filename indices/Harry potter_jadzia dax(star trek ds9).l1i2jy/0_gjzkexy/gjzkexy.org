OMG we need an infusion of trek xovers, stat.

I want Voldy to meet his mirror universe self.

I want Snape and Spock to compare notes on shutting down their emotions.

I want to put Lucius Malfoy in a room with Lwaxana Troi.

I want Tonks and Odo to get super freaky deaky with the morphing/shifting.

... and this is all just what I've got off the top of my head!!
