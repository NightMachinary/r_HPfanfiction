I don't think I ever saw that pairing, closest pairing I saw is Harry and an OC Klingon girl(in one of the best crossover HP/ST fics I ever read).

It should be also remembered that having the symbiote doesn't mean they are the same person, it's more like the inherit some memories and feelings, but each is a separate individual.

See how Ezri was different from Jadzia, making my man Worf really sad.

Hmm, I could see them getting closer by having Jadzia teaching Harry self defense and about the Federation and the Galaxy.
