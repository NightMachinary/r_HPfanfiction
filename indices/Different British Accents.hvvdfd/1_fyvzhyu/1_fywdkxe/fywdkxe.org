Can confirm on navigating the Forest of apostrophes in Hagrid and Fleur's dialogue. that was really annoying to read. Conveying an accent in the written word isn't easy.

By comparison there's an anime called azumanga daioh which is a slice of life story about a bunch of school girls in Tokyo. They are joined by a girl from Osaka whom they literally nickname 'Osaka'. (it would be kind of like nicknaming the southern person 'Tex' even if they were from Georgia.) For the English dub, Osaka's speaking voice is a generic Southern drawl. Like so many other countries, people from different regions in Japan have a different speaking dialect, and the easiest way to represent that to an English-speaking American audience was to just give her a Southern accent.
