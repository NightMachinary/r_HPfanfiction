I, for one, am grateful we don't hear different accents. When I read the books in English, Hagrid and Fleur were sometimes difficult to understand. I probably wouldn't be able to read the books if almost every character spoke differently, and besides, that doesn't necessarily translate well.\\
I once started to read a fic, and Mary MacDonald spoke with an accent, and I had to abandon the story because I was constantly trying to guess what she was saying.
