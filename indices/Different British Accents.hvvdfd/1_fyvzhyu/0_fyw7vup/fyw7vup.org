It's rare, but a Scottish accent (or speaking Scots rather) can be done for comedic effect quite well especially when the other characters can't figure out what they're saying either.

I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple with McGonagall going off in Scots about something and everyone just standing there going "wut???"

It being an everyday thing would be irritating, however.
