Honestly I need to sit down and watch a good video that shows the different accents found in England. I don't really know any and most things get lumped together as “British” in my head.

I'm from the USA, Kentucky specifically, and even our accents vary greatly within our own communities. Some of us have way more of a drawl than others. So I know it would be the same for the UK. I believe that it's even roughly the same size as the Appalachian mountains and you can hear a dozen or so accents peppered throughout.

I can attest that it's difficult to write in accents, however. It's been a topic of many discussions in my Lit classes.
