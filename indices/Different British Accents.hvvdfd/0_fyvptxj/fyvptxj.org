I think the problem is, there's often very little available to the author to show these accents, beyond stating that they have a specific accent (which might be alienating to non Brits) or trying to write phoenetically (which can also be alienating, difficult and hard to read). I once wrote a short piece on Snape recognising that Harry has glimmers of Lily's accent at times - obviously picked up from his aunt - and specified the short "a" on words like laugh/grass though the rest of his accent is southern, because he's from Surrey. But obviously I had to follow this up with a lengthy explainer to non Brits who couldn't imagine the difference between laff/larf, and I'm not exactly going to start spelling laugh like that in Harry's dialogue.

But I definitely imagine, say, the Patils having a Brummie accent, I like Matthew Lewis's Yorkshire accent so that's stuck for Neville, I've made an OC a geordie - but aside from throwing in the odd "pet" or "champion" there's no elegant way for me to show her accent.

Obviously with someone who has a very distinctive accent like Hagrid it's possible, but I don't think you want too many characters like that.
