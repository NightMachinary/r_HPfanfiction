I have been thinking about writing a story like this someday. Like some dark witch manipulates muggles into nuking the world into a new ice age, and then the story would pick up a few hundred years later where everyone has outposts and towns they're living in, and they're all still hiding from her because she's immortal and she made her own new kingdom atop the old world, and MAYBE some aspect about where she's the only one alive who actually remembers anything from before.
