Whom the Gods Would Destroy started out excellent. Then, when Charlie and Hermione reached Hogwarts, the whole thing with Lucius Malfoy was just ridiculous. Not to mention that Hermione was way too OOC with him. I mean, c'mon, she wouldn't ever kiss him once let alone 3 (or was it 2) damn times! I couldn't finish the story after reading two-thirds of it. I skipped to the last chapter, skimmed it, and closed it. I've never looked back. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this.
