Well it's not like I just sit there and read fanfics 24/7. I have to attend (virtual) classes everyday and work on homework, so I end up looking at fanfics about 2-3 hours a day, 4-5 days a week. It's important to not get sucked up into the fanfic (I have made that mistake) to the point that you forget you have a life to live irl.
