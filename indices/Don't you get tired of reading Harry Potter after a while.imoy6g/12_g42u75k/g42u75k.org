One of the reasons I don't actually like fics which cover the seven years over seven parts each 100k. Of course, getting tired of some aspects over time is natural. That's why I filter them out on Ao3 sometimes. Tired of dumbledore? Filter him out. Tired of eighth year fics? Filter them out. Tho idk why I just can't ever seem to get tired of Harry. I never read non Harry-centric fics.
