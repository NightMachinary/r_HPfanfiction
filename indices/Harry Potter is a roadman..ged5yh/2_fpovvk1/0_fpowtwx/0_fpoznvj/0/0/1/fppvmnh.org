I fail to see an issue. It honestly pisses me off when I get people like you trying to ruin a harmless bit of fun by insinuating that I am a racist. Being a roadman is one of the things that British people generally take the mick out off, with most being seen as dossers or layabouts. It is, thus, seen as a bad thing. And when I said it was the aids of British culture, I was making a joke. It may have been a shit joke, but it was still a joke. So screw your bloody head on, and stop getting offended over nowt.
