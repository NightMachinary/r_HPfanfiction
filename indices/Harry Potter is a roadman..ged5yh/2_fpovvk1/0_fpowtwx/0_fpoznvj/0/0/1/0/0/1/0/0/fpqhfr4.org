Ok if you're gonna do this properly, time has to be aged to at least early 2000s, figure out a way that Harry doesn't sound like he's the british version of Federline. Option 1 [Story starts with Dumbledore dropping of Harry on the wrong address in East End] Option 2 [Story starts with Dudley's gang beating up young Harry some blokes intervene, they become friends]

TBH you'd find longer more established stuff looking up a run-away Harry story. He joins street gangs but they are not the aesthetic your looking for.
