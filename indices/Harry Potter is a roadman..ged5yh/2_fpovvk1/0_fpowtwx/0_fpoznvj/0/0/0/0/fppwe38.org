Slang and words don't belong to one group once an idea is out it belongs to everyone. But the culture op wants to give to Harry is UK black culture. Period, that's it. Its not just "UK slang mate, no jogs I swear mate". That's not what their asking, they want Harry to emulate a culture that would offend people if not handled properly. And op starts out the request with referring to it as "The aids of british culture" So I'm not hopeful that they could make this Harry funny without defaulting to just being an ass.

Bottom line OP write the fics you want to see, don't censor yourself, but be self aware on what you post.
