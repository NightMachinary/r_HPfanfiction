The idea that something can belong to a specific culture is wrong, all that does is segregate people.

Who cares about offence? What does getting offended solve?

If someone is interested in your culture enough to write a story involving it then that just shows that they like it.

So what if it get used wrong, simply correct them and move on.

It's not as big a deal as you seem to think it is.
