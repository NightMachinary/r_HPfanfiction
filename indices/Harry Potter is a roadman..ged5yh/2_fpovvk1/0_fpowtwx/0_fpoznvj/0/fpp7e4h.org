Alright mate, calm down. In what way do roadmen emulate 90s black culture? People going around acting like they're harder than everyone else, bragging about how much expensive crap they have? This has nothing to do with emulating black culture. Honestly, when I was in high school at least 90% of the lads in my year acted like this, and out of about 40 blokes only 4 were black.
