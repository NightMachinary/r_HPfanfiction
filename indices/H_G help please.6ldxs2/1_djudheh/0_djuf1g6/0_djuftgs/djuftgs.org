I was going to make a pithy statement, or possibly use one of these two quotes "One must think like a hero to behave like a merely decent human being.' -May Sarton "The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference." -Henry Miller.

However, I know how that feels. I was in a very deep depression, and I read one fic several times over that just clicked with me and helped keep my mind off it. If it was deleted, I don't know what I would feel. So I'm very, very glad I was able to get you reunited with those stories, and I hope they help you as much as they did back then. I'm sorry for your loss, but am glad I can help you in even this tiny way.
