If you use an eReader, I found the fic on [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/]] in their archive. If you go to the Archive tab (view in desktop mode if you're on mobile) and type in the name of the fic, it'll let you download it in EPUB or MOBI.

I just downloaded it myself, and it looks to be complete.
