I think they could argue about taking the air molecules and changing them into food. But they still should only be able to create the basic ingredients and not full meals, especially meat.

If you want a lasagna, for the meat you would need to create something alive jet dead and that contradicts itself. And to cook something it needs several steps you have to take, I can see them creating the sauce for the lasagna but it would be cold because to warm it would be the next step.
