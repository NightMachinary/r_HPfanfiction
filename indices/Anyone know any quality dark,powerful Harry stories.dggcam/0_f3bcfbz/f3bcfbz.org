Well that really depends on what you mean by quality to be honest. Also what you mean by "dark," as lots of the time this is just Harry who kills people or Indy!Harry stories. Now, I will give you my favorite darker, powerful Harry stories, but they will vary heavily:

- Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): easily one of my favorite fics even if its as short at 20k. The premise and thrill of this fic is so amazing you won't be able to put it down. Not to mention two of the top ten duels in the HP fandom, bar none.
- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): a brutal time-travel story from VotN. A dark (and I mean DARK) future Harry travels back in his original body (a breath of fresh air) to blitz Voldemort and his Death Eaters in under twelve hours. Highly recommend.
- Out of the Night by Raining Ink was a fic that focused heavily on a Post-OOTP Harry learning about dark magic and wizards. Its not on ff anymore, but a copy has been uploaded by someone else so you can just google search. Look up Traitorous by flamata as well while you are at it.
- linkffn(Lesser Evils): an alternate take on post-graveyard Harry, this fic takes a dark spin on both the characters and world of HP (ex. bareknuckle brawl with a werewolf girl in Knockturn Alley).
- Linkffn(Circular Reasoning): okay this one is also a time-travel fic, but with a decidedly more twisted Harry coming back. Fair warning, this fic sort of goes all over the place with the plot, though I find that actually entertaining if nothing else.
- Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): this one pushes the edges of quality (though improves as it goes and in sequels). This is an HP/Dresden Files fusion, with the basic gist of Harry getting a fallen angel to work with via the Denarian Coin. Action alone is pretty entertaining, particularly in the second book.
