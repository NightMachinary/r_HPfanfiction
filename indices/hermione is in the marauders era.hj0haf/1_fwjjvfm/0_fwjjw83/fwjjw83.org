  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.This story was originally posted to Fanfiction.net in 2015 and is complete. It started off non-betaed, picked up FluffPanda, and then The Dragon and the Rose, Dutchgirl01, and Flyby Commander Shepard. It was a labour of love.
