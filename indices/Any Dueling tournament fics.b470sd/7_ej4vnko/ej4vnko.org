The Magic Quill has a dueling tournament near the start. The double barreled wizard.. It's about a group of wizards and witches trading stories at the Hog's Head. At least that's how it starts. It's very well written and was the first fanfic I ever read. It still remains among the best ones I've ever read too.

Edit: BTW It's all OC characters with little cameos from canon.
