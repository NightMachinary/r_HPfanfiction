[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/31/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Chapter 31 of DPSW]] certainly fits, and is a segway into the next arc with Harry being tried for attempted murder.The tournament itself is very well handled with good descriptions of magic being used.
