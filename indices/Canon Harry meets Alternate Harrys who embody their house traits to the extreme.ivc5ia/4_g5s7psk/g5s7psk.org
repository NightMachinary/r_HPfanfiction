Try: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council]] It's not exactly the same but it does have multiple Harry Potter's from different universes. A Harry Potter raised by Goblins in Ravenclaw A Gryffindor Harry raised by his Father and his Godmother Amelia Bones Canon Harry A female version of Harry in Slytherin A female version of Harry in Gryffindor

Each of the "Harry's" can communicate with each other and advise and learn from the others. Only on chap 38, but it's pretty good read so far
