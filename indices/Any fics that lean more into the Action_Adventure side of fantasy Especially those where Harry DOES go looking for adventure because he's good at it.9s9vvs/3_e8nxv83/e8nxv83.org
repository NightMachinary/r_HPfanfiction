I can't remember how it starts but I remember this one having tonnes of adventure. Harry joins Bill Weasley in South America to learn curse breaking and combat. It has a bit of a Tomb Raider vibe. I enjoyed it immensely but I haven't read it in a while so I can't remember a lot of the plot points but I know he gets trained by hit wizards while there.\\
