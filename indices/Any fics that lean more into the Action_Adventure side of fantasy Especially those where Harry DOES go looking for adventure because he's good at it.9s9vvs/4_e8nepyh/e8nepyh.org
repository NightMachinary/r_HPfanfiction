linkffn(Identity by highbrass) I say this story is Make a Wish taken as seriously as you could take Harry Potter in the Mid to late 00's, some Harry Playing Butt Rock and dyeing his hair A LOT of dumb pop culture references or super dumb items popping up but it's adventuring for the sake of adventuring which is what your looking for.

Unfortunately the type of stories your looking for are seemingly rare, I should know I love the same kind of stories as well and have pitched a challenge that no one seems interested in, where Harry ends up in To Love Ru in what was his 'Vacation' in reality he had moved to Sainan to flee the English magical world (English Speaking as much as the island) he gets caught up in Rito and Lala's problems and ends up being told to act as Lala's Bodyguard by Gid and keep her from being taken by any of the other Suitors or earth will be destroyed. The joke being that none of Rito's Harem which makes up so much of the female cast of the show, ever entertain the thought of Harry as Boyfriend material so Harry spends the story kicking Suitors asses and trying to actually get a serious date that isn't secretly into Rito, looking to Kill him or Rito or is trying to make Lala Jealous.
