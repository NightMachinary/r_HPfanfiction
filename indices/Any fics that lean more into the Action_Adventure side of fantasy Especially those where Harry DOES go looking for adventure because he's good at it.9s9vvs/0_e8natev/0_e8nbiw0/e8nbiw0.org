Ill have to give these a shot, though funnily enough most of these actually hit more of my turnoffs for fics aside from Magics of the Arcane.

Slytherin Harry, OC, OC, and Political, all aspects i tend to avoid in fanfiction. Not saying i wont be giving them their fair shake, but i got a chuckle from the Irony ya'know?

Though i will say D20 has been on my radar for a while now as a D&D player. Not having Harry as the main character was the only thing that made me hesitate.
