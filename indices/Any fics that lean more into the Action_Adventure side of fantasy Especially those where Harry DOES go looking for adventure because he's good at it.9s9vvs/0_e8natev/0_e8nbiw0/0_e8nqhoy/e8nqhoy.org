  Slytherin Harry, OC, OC, and Political, all aspects i tend to avoid in fanfiction. Not saying i wont be giving them their fair shake, but i got a chuckle from the Irony ya'know?

It's a bit weird that some of these fics go recommended. A Slytherin and/or political Harry doesn't exactly scream "Lust for adventure" to me. Seeking out adventure is kinda the antithesis to a Slytherin mindset.
