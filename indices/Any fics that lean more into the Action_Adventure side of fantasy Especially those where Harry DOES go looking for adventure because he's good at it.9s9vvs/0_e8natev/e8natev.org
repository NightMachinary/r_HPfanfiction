Some more recommendations:

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) features a Harry skilled at strategy and combat in an Enders-game scenario. There are political plays but they are very reasonable from what you'd expect teenagers in an Enders-game scenario to do. Fast-paced combat where Harry is the star of the show, with both internal psychological and physical real-life struggles to match. This Harry is less adventurous than you're looking for but always looking forward to his next challenge - a thirst for competition rather than adventure. There are a few moments here where he wavers and ponders whether it's all worth it, however. Might not be for you.

The linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) is the most beautiful HP AU I have ever read. Alexandra does not have the same combat prowess as the Harry's I've come across elsewhere here but this trilogy captures like no other the feeling of adventure I had when first reading the HP originals. Might not be what you're looking for exactly, but it has adventure in spades.

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) features a mentor-Dumbledore guiding a Harry with a thirst for power and adventure. Some excellent combat here, and like others, goes far beyond the grounds of Hogwarts.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) features a competent protagonist with a flair for adventure, for it's all he knows how to do. The characterization in this fic is beyond top-notch and is one of the only ones that has brought me to tears in the most unexpected manner. It doesn't try to make you feel. It just does, and the combat and adventures are great. Might be less of what you're looking for, but it's similar to the Alexandra Quick series I mentioned earlier in kindling that hard-to-capture feeling of adventure.

----

linkffn(Emperor), however, deserves a special mention. This is a fic in which Harry starts from a lowly station in an attempt to reign supreme over all. And by god, it is believable. The politics in this fic are incredibly realistic, the political acrobatics even more so. This is a web of intrigue and combat and mystery, and it will draw you in. This is Harry going up against the most formidable of enemies, internally and externally, in politics and combat. The Harry here grows political acumen and uses amazing combat prowess to steamroll his enemies. It's great. I've never come across a fic so realistic. You really feel like there's no plot armor here, you feel like it's the real deal. This is a Harry that craves power and will do anything in his vast arsenal to overcome the massive challenges ahead of him to obtain it.
