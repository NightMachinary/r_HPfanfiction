You will absolutely love the following three trilogies:

linkffn(Sword of the Hero) is regarded by many as the most epic fic in all of HPFF, where the epicness really picks up in the second book

linkffn(Wastelands of Time) is very similar to the Harry in Sword of the Hero. The action here is a bit faster and leaner, closer to Earth, but still exhilarating.

linkffn(Denarian Renegade) is a fairly epic trilogy with a wide AU reaching into Dresden Files (but requires no knowledge of Dresden to get into, everything is explained from scratch). Has some of the most intriguing character ideas I've come across and has the same fast-paced combat with this “grunge” sort of feeling to it that you'll find in Wastelands.

All of these are excellent trilogies.

- I haven't found any book or movie, both in fanfiction or outside of it, that comes anywhere close to Sword of the Hero's sheer shock and awe scale. It's worth reading for anyone mildly interested in combat.

- Wastelands of Time has more of a mystery feeling to it and is quite a fun read.

- Denarian Renegade starts with an asshole-ish Harry whose personality becomes quite endearing once you recognize it for the defense mechanism it is

All of these feature a ridiculously competent combat Harry whose challenges scale to his abilities. He's no Gary Stu and will not stroll through his challenges. It's always close and he always suffers. It's really fun to read through.
