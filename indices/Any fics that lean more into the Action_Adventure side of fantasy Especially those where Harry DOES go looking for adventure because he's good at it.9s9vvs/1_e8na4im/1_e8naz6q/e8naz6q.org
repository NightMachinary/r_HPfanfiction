Thanks for the leads! I definately wasn't expecting a trilogy let alone 3. And they all do look interesting just the introduction of Wastelands was enough to hook me. And though iv never been able to start reading the Dresden series i have always had an interest in it, partially because i play dnd (also why i adore fics like these) and that series gets thrown around so much in the community.

Definitely looking forward to binging these.
