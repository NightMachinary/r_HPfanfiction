But I start reading a work of fiction with certain expectations. Game of Thrones is often summarised with "everyone dies", so character death in general is not unexpected. Despite this, nearly no one saw the Red Wedding coming. But if I start reading something fluffy and then suddenly, death and agony everywhere, then it is not what I wanted to read, "I didn't sign up for that". Life is miserable enough, I don't need even more misery in my fiction.
