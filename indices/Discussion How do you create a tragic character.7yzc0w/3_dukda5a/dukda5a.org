The important thing is to set up the tragical twist in some way. For example, if you just have the main character or love interest die out of the blue, that is not tragic, that is bad writing. SUBTLE foreshadowing is your friend here.

Also, put some disclaimer about mayor character death at the beginning of the entire story. You don't have to say who will die, but quite a few people hate reading about the loss of a loved one and (myself included) .
