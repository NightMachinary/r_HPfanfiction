The reader needs to be able to empathize with the character and then. Which often means they need to like the character. And then whatever happens needs to have an absolute, unavoidable feel to it. More points if the character sees it coming and knows there's no escaping.

The tragic character must, in the end, lose. That doesn't necessarily mean that they die or fail to resolve the plot. It just means that the ends did not justify the means.
