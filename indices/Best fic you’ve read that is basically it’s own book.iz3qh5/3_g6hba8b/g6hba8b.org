I know that he is not a very popular character around here but Snape's biography, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family]], is one of those rare stories that could stand on their own, about a very unfortunate boy who ends up a bitter teacher, while still being canon compliant to a T (or whatever was canon back in 2012 when it was posted). The thing that makes it so good in my opinion is the fact that it follows Snape from birth to death and it's quite like real life: sometimes you have good things happening to you, other times they are bad, sometimes life is unfair and you don't always get closure or happy endings.
