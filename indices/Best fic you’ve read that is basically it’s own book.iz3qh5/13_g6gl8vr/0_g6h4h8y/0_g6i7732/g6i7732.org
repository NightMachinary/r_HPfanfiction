Well, I wouldn't call it a crack fic tbh. But since Harry is gay there're some slash elements so its not up to everyone I guess.

Basically it's “Harry goes to different school“ type of fiction but this one school is not really for humans. The new school is a mixed one mostly for non-humans like vampires, werewolves, demons etc. There only few humans because it's hard for them to survive there.

So, there's a different magic system, different werewolves (like, Lupin is basically a puppy to them). Its very HP-centric with bunch of OCs. Original characters like Snape or Voldemort are at start and somewhat in the end, but the story and writing itself is so good it could be just published as it's own book changing a couple of names here and there.
