linkao3(all the young dudes) is a marauders era beginning in their first year running all the way up to just before ootp- 188 chapters but it's so well paced it feels right, there's a slight canon divergence that remus' father committed suicide so he was raised in a boys home meaning he ends up much rougher round the edges. the writing is so emotive, i was so engaged that i read the whole thing and then didn't think about anything else for days.

it's really good if you're into a more realistic portrayal of the marauders and their lives seeing as they were at school in the 70's, explores muggle culture a little and sits well alongside what was actually happening in the muggle world as well as a really interesting and believable lead up to the first wizarding war.

i also love the portrayal of the marauders vs snape thing where it's portrayed much more like a rivalry than a victim thing and remus is much more involved

honestly i cant recommend it enough please read it even if marauders stuff isn't usually your thing it gives so much motivation to the way remus and sirius act in canon and provides a huge backstory that slides right in to the golden era
