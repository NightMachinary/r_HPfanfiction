After /Alexandra Quick,/ probably my favorite fanfiction series, and incredibly underrated. I wouldn't describe it so much as dystopian YA as a mashup of genres. The first book is somewhat dystopian because it takes place during an epidemic, but there isn't really a dystopian element to the second and third books; I also find the second and third ones remarkably mature.

But yeah, great writing and characters and highly recommended. I'm reading Slide's Anguis series right now as well and it's equally tremendous.
