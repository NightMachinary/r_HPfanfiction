Haha yeah, it's set in 2024 I think so hopefully post-Covid? There's a novel magical illness, but I think it's contained to Hogwarts. The school is in quarantine from the rest of the magical world with very little line of communication iirc. Albus, Scorpius, Rose, and two other OC students and a professor are the only ones who don't get the illness (I think the reason is explained, but I forget) and the plot is around their efforts to uncover the source of/treatment for the illness and regain contact with the outside world.

But yes, somewhat spine-chilling. And exceptionally good (the first book is actually probably the weakest in the series)
