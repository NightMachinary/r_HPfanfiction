Alexandra Quick Series by Invarety (sp) and the Stygian series by Slide.

Both series are extremely well written and function as regular published work. Alexandra Quick examines the United States's Wizarding World (wayyyy better that JK Rowling) and The Stygian Trilogy is the next generation a la Dystopian YA.
