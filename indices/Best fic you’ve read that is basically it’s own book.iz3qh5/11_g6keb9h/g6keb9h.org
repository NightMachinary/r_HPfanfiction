A bit late to the thread but linkffn(the boy who died by silirt). Great Single point of departure fanfic where Harry Potter dies as a baby. The wizarding world is virtually unrecognisable by the time our characters start Hogwarts. Kinda dark and chilling, especially in the latter years (author is on book five and publishes new chapters regularly) so I recommend pacing yourself in the reading.
