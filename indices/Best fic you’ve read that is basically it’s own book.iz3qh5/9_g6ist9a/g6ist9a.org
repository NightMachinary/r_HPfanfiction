Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) feels like that to me. It operates on the premise that Voldemort won the first war, so it borrows basically zero plot from canon. Takes concepts from the original, like werewolves, and fleshes out a whole society and culture for them. It's abandoned near the end in a very painful way, but there's still well over a million words of it to enjoy.
