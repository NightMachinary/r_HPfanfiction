[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]] comes to mind. It befits greatly from being in the HP universe, but only uses a few elements heavily, namely Dementors, Azkaban, and Umbridge. It has a wonderful atmosphere halfway between thriller and Lychian nightmare. Highly recommend.

It would take some filing of serial numbers to be sure since the whole premise is keyed on a magical prison that sucks the happiness from you, but I think it's doable. It doesn't use Harry's character in an irreplaceable way, and the only other heavily borrowed character, Umbridge, could be replaced with an identical bureaucrat. It doesn't use Hogwarts or other major world building elements, so I think it is possible. The writing is certainly as good or better than typical pulpy novels.
