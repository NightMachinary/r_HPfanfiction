DarkLordPotter.Net is without a doubt by far the most active HP forum on the net these days, not just for fanfic but for HP discussion in general.

Spacebattles has a moderately active HP thread.

As far as I know, those are the only remaining active HP fanfic forums, apart from this subreddit. By active I mean multiple posts a day.

Beyond the Veil is mostly dead but has a single active fic recommendation thread. No discussion, just fic links.

I haven't been to The Fanfiction Forum recently, but I imagine it still has some measure of activity. It was never HP-only though.

There may be other non-forum communities like livejournal and tumblr which probably still have HP fanfic activity, though nowhere near the level of the past.
