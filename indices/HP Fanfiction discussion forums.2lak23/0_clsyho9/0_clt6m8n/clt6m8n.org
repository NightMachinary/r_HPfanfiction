  Beyond the Veil is mostly dead but has a single active fic recommendation thread. No discussion, just fic links.

They have two active threads, as far as I can tell: one for HP (and HP/X crossovers) updates and a slightly less active thread covering all non-HP fandoms. (Pretty much just Perspicacity posts Naruto and Star Wars updates in the latter.)

I think that site started when the old fanfiction.net forum closed up shop and the site went to shit. (Jeconais took a back seat to running it and handed over recruitment of new writers to Kinsfire, meaning only average-quality H/Hr shippers and sub-par smut peddlers would be eligible to apply.)
