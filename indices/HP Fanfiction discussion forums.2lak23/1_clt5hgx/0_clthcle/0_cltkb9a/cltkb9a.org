The site has a fairly large number of younger members. (At least it did at one point. Sometimes I feel like the demographics have shifted quite a bit in recent years.) The idea of keeping the forums to a 12+ rating is to keep them friendly to all ages. As far as not being able to post about stories from other archive sites, that's mostly just a personal choice on the part of the site owner. His sandbox, his rules. I figure he's the one who gets dragged out of bed when the server pukes at 3:00 AM, so it's only fair.
