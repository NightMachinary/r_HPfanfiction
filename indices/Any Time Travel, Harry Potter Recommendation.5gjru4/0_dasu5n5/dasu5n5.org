Just to clarify: Instead of going way back in time like in a redo fic, you are wanting Harry to be able to pause or reverse time? So short jumps back, like hours or even days is fine, but not years or longer? Would he then be able to change the events because of this slight foreknowledge? Example: He goes back a few hours to stop Cedric from dying and LV from bein ressurected by somehow outting Fake Moody as being Crouch Jr.? Or he pauses time to move Cedric from the way of the Killing Curse, possibly even moving say Pettigrew into the path instead?

I can't say I've read anything quite like that but damn it if that doesn't sound interesting.
