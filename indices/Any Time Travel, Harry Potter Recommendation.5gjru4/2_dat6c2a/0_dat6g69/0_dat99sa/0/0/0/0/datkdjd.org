It's not as bad as people on here make it out to be. It's probably better than 90% of the fanfiction drivel out there. The biggest problem is that the author is extremely outspoken in his humanist beliefs and makes a case for them in his fic, and the fans of the fic are extremely obnoxious in insisting that every single bit of it is right. But it's definitely worth a read, (if only so you know what people are talking about when they diss it on here) and in particular the first few chapters are very funny. I believe at one point it was either the most favorited or second most favorited fic on ff.net.
