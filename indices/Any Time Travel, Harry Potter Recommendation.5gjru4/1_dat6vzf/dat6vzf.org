linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) which is the third in its series has great time turner usage. This also has main character Harry in Slytherin with Draco as his best friend and arguably HarryxHermione sort of going on as well. I would recommend starting with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) though.

Then there's [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6849022][An Old and New World]] which has the best time turner scene in the entire fandom.

And finally there's a fic I remember where Harry slows down time for combat and it nearly kills him running through the death eater lines but I can't recall it.
