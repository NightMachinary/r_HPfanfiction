Because we are told that the only way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy the physical object, and we are even given an explanation: the relationship between body and soul in a human is different to that in a horcrux. A human is a soul that happens to have a body - the soul is primary, and the loss of the body does not affect it. A horcrux is the opposite: it is a body that happens to have a bit of soul. Unlike a human, the soul of a horcrux is not independent of the body: they are one and the same, and the soul's fate is tied to the fate of the body.
