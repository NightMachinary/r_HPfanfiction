Both Diary!Riddle in CoS and Voldemort in GoF state that Lily's blood protection is a known counter-charm. He didn't need to "find out" about it from anyone - this piece of magic was already part of his knowledge base. It emphasises that Voldemort's weakness is not ignorance -- he has a vast knowledge of magic -- but rather failing to value certain types of magic.
