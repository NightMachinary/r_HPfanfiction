Just because Riddle and Voldemort are knowledgeable about exotic magic does not mean that they are omniscient.

To use an analogy, I'm quite decent at university level Mathematics, but I can occasionally struggle with simpler problems because I'm not approaching the problems the way they're meant to be. When these simpler problems are explained to me, I get a facepalm moment, because they're quite simple, in hindsight.

It is the same way with Riddle - he's looking at the causation of his defeat from all sorts of angles, thinking that the reason he was defeated was something incredibly powerful and innate to Harry himself. When he does find out the true reason, he too gets a facepalm moment.
