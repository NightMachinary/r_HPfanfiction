Sure, but then, there's no other reason to include the part in the Chamber.

Also, check out what Riddle says - '"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you."'

How does the diary know that they've met /twice/? Sure, Ginny would have told him about the fated encounter when Harry was a toddler, but what about the time with the Stone? There's no way Ginny would have known about that, considering Ron doesn't speak to his sister at all. Riddle knew about that encounter, and knew that he was thwarted too.

That's more or less a confirmation that there is some form of information transfer going on.
