  That's more or less a confirmation that there is some form of information transfer going on.

I think you're reaching a bit, there, as it happens: Ron may not talk to his sister, but he surely talks to his parents, who might well have discussed it where Ginny could hear. There's also the Hogwarts rumour mill, which would have had /much/ to say about Gryffindor coming from behind in the points the previous year, and as Dumbledore observes at the end of PS, the entire castle had had the full story. (As it happens, I think this is the more likely way for Ginny to have heard the tale, writing down every version of the rumours in her diary and Tom analysing those to figure out what elements are truth and what embroidery.)

If you're not reaching, the diary was different to the other horcruxes in that it came the closest of any of them to full incarnation: that could have been enough to form the link that the living horcruxes (Harry and Nagini) had, so that Riddle-prime was at least having a vision of the events in the Chamber.
