  he surely talks to his parents, who might well have discussed it

I doubt it. They never make any mention of the happenings of first year ever. I would imagine that they'd have a lot of things to say about a mountain troll, a cerberus, detentions in a freaky forest with giant spiders and dark lords teaching at a school, but they don't touch on any of that. Granted, the books are children's books, but still.

  the Hogwarts rumour mill
#+end_quote

They can be saying anything, literally anything. Why would the headmaster of the school, who also happens to be one the most powerful political figures in their world, tell a bunch of teenagers information that is supposed to be extremely confidential?

When he awards those points to the trio at the end of the year, he uses the most vague reasons possible. He awards Ron points for playing the finest game of chess, for crying out loud.

You cannot be serious here. This was said in jest. Surely you understand that.

  If you're not reaching, the diary was different to the other horcruxes in that it came the closest of any of them to full incarnation: that could have been enough to form the link that the living horcruxes (Harry and Nagini) had, so that Riddle-prime was at least having a vision of the events in the Chamber.

Probably. But he doesn't know about its destruction until much later after he comes back to power, which is where my gripe is. If he's having a vision or something similar about the events that happened inside the Chamber, then he should also have had the info about the destruction of the diary passed over, or at the very least, the images of HP moving to stab the diary with the basilisk fang. He doesn't.
