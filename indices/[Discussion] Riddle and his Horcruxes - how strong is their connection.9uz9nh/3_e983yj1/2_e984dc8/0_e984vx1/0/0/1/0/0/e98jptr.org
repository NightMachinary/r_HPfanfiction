  And of course, the news that the most feared dark lord wasn't as dead as people believed does not throw the country into an uproar. Of course, let's go with that.

"Most" people didn't believe he was dead, some just hoped he was after being defeated. Crouch Sr. says at his son's own trial that the Ministry knew Voldemort wasn't dead (he mentions that Jr. and Bella and co. were known to have been searching for the " present whereabouts of [their] exiled master"). And your understanding of Dumbledore's comments would make nonsense of the series because then the school would think Harry just killed Quirrell as opposed to stopping someone possessed by Voldemort. No, Dumbledore says they all know what happened there and there's nothing to indicate that excludes Voldemort's presence. And I suppose we'll just ignore OoTP confirming that everyone knew about Voldemort being there. Neville says it in the Hog's Head - that Harry stopped Voldemort from getting the Stone - and no one contradicts him:

  'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philo­log­ical Stone -'

  'Philoso­pher's,' hissed Hermione.

  'Yes, that - from You-​Know-​Who,' fin­ished Neville.

  Han­nah Ab­bott's eyes were as round as Galleons.
