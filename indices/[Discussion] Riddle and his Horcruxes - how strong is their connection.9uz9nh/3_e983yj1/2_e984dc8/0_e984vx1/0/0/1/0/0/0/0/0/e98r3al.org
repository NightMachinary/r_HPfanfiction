  No, Crouch Sr. referred to Voldemort as exiled, not dead
#+end_quote

Not going to argue about this, don't have the book with me.

#+begin_quote
  They knew the whole story according to Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

You do understand what a joke is, don't you? When Dumbledore says that line, he's joking. It's dry humour.

#+begin_quote
  No no no, this is in the Hog's Head well before Voldemort's return is known
#+end_quote

This is after Harry declares that Voldemort is back, after the Ministry and their media outlets launch a smear campaign against him and send a stooge to their school to ensure that Harry's lies aren't allowed to take root.

#+begin_quote
  Their school had been, prior to OoTP, on the receiving end of many direct threats (Basilisks, Dementors, dragons,etc.)
#+end_quote

Of those things, the only real threat was the basilisk. The dementors were sent there to guard the school, and the dragons are part of a tournament - the students watch the task from far away. That's hardly a /threat/ to a school.

#+begin_quote
  Neville knew about it
#+end_quote

Neville knew about it because he tried to stop them from leaving on their nightly jaunt and got cursed for his troubles. You could say that the trio eventually explained their reasons to him afterwards, since they're not complete assholes.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was being literal
#+end_quote

Not this again. That was dry humour. Not Dumbledore being literal.

#+begin_quote
  And Hannah's reaction isn't that difficult to understand. It might have been something she didn't believe
#+end_quote

Because rumours are generally unreliable even in the situation that they're true.
