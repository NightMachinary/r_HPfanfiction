  he mentions that Jr. and Bella and co. were known to have been searching for the " present whereabouts of [their] exiled master

This means that Bellatrix and co thought/believed that their master wasn't dead, merely exiled. It does not, however, mean that Crouch Sr shared or agreed with their thoughts.

  then the school would think Harry just killed Quirrell as opposed to stopping someone possessed by Voldemort
#+end_quote

Sure, they could think that an otherwise normal eleven year old is capable of killing. Or they could use their brains just think that Harry stopped Quirrel from stealing something by sheer chance, and Quirrel was immediately apprehended and sent to prison.

You said it yourself - that's OoTP, when Voldemort's resurrection has been outed. The public outcry following Harry's declaration and his (and Albus') character assassinations are what happened after they said that a dead dark lord came back to life.

Also, Hannah Abbott's reaction is quite telling. The fact that her eyes were as wide as saucers is a very good indicator that the part about the Stone and the persons involved were completely new to her, an otherwise completely ordinary student (average joe).
