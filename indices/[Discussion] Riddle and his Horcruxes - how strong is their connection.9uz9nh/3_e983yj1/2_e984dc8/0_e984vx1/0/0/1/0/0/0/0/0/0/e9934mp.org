  You do understand what a joke is, don't you? When Dumbledore says that line, he's joking. It's dry humour.
#+end_quote

Except that Neville later confirms this in OoTP. The point of the joke is that there are no well kept secrets among Hogwarts students.

#+begin_quote
  This is after Harry declares that Voldemort is back, after the Ministry and their media outlets launch a smear campaign against him and send a stooge to their school to ensure that Harry's lies aren't allowed to take root.
#+end_quote

You referred to Voldemort's existence as having been outed, it had not been outed until the end of OoTP. So no, it didn't occur afterwards. Their declarations that Voldemort was back were kept out of the papers by the Ministry, only the students heard it and few took it seriously.

#+begin_quote
  Of those things, the only real threat was the basilisk. The dementors were sent there to guard the school, and the dragons are part of a tournament - the students watch the task from far away. That's hardly a threat to a school.
#+end_quote

That is absurd, even Dumbledore warned the students to do everything in their power to not make the Dementors come to them as they wouldn't hear excuses nor show mercy.

#+begin_quote
  Neville knew about it because he tried to stop them from leaving on their nightly jaunt and got cursed for his troubles.
#+end_quote

He didn't know what they were doing. In fact, in the scene all they say is they had to do something important.

#+begin_quote
  Not this again. That was dry humour. Not Dumbledore being literal.
#+end_quote

You can ignore OoTP but then that's a silly way to go about things. You are literally ignoring the most direct confirmation that the student body knowing it was not a joke because... nothing. You're simply saying "No".

#+begin_quote
  Because rumours are generally unreliable even in the situation that they're true.
#+end_quote

What kind of admission is this? If Hannah heard the rumor and then later was reminded about it and considered it now as possibly being true, that just shows (as Neville already proved) that the whole school knew what happened. Hell, they all knew Slytherin's monster was about but only a few knew (some from the ghosts) that Harry slayed it with Gryffindor's sword.
