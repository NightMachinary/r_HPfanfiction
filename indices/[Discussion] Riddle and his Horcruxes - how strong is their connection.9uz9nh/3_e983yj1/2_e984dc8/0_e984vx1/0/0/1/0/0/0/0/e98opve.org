  This means that Bellatrix and co thought/believed that their master wasn't dead, merely exiled. It does not, however, mean that Crouch Sr shared or agreed with their thoughts.

No, Crouch Sr. referred to Voldemort as exiled, not dead. There's no way to read that scene as him randomly speaking to the assumptions of Death Eaters. There was no corpse of Voldemort's so far as any material has stated.

  Sure, they could think that an otherwise normal eleven year old is capable of killing. Or they could use their brains just think that Harry stopped Quirrel from stealing something by sheer chance, and Quirrel was immediately apprehended and sent to prison.

No one thought Quirrel was sent to prison. They knew the whole story according to Dumbledore.

  You said it yourself - that's OoTP, when Voldemort's resurrection has been outed. The public outcry following Harry's declaration and his (and Albus') character assassinations are what happened after they said that a dead dark lord came back to life.

No no no, this is in the Hog's Head well before Voldemort's return is known. As stated near the beginning of that book, almost no one outside the Order knew anything substantial had happened. And Hannah's reaction isn't that difficult to understand. It might have been something she didn't believe or had even just forgotten. After all, it's not like she went up against Voldemort and saw him. Their school had been, prior to OoTP, on the receiving end of many direct threats (Basilisks, Dementors, dragons,etc.) besides one she never saw. And though you don't want to admit it, that Neville knew about it proves Dumbledore was being literal. The whole school knew everything that happened there; Neville had been put in a Body Bind so he didn't know anything from experience.
