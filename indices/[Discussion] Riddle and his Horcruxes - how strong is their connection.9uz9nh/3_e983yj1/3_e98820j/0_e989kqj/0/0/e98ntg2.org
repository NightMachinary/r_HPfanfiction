I was talking about the conversation between Riddle and Harry, where he coerces the truth about how Harry survived him twice out of him. Not the graveyard part.

Explain to me why that part is illustrated at all, since the reader already knows how he survived. If Voldemort already knew, then there is no need for the author to write a sequence where Voldemort is told how or why such a thing happened.
