Because Diary Riddle didn't yet know how Harry survived, he didn't have memories of what his original self did after he made the Horcrux. But Diary Riddle did know that the sacrificial protection magic was a type of powerful magic, he makes that clear. The point of the scene is to show Riddle's consistent interest in understanding and overcoming anything that stands in his way. Hence his monologuing while Harry is dying.
