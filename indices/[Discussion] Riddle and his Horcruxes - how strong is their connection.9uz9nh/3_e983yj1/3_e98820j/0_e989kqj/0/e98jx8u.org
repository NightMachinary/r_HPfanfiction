There's nothing in the explanation that indicates anything about Voldemrot getting knowledge from the Horcrux. The explanation had two obvious purposes: They explained why Voldemort's supporters (and the man himself) hadn't gotten Harry yet (he's protected at Number 4), and they give a foundation for Voldemort's desire for and success at achieving immortality. Voldemort already knew about the enchantment's existence as a type of magic in his teen years (that's why Diary Riddle knew of it). The issue was, as Dumbeldore said, he always underestimated that kind of magic and hence (as Voldemort himself said), he overlooked it being cast when he decided to kill Lily who he swore to keep alive. Even Diary Riddle had to have Harry explain what magic allowed him to survive, but he immediately knows what kind of magic Harry is talking about ("You're mother died for you, that is powerful protection").
