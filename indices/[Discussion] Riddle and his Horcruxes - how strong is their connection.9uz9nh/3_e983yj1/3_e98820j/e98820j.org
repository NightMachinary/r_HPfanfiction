Um, no he didn't. The fact that Diary Riddle knew that the magic existed indicates the older Voldemort knew it as well. Not because Voldemort got the knowledge from the Horcrux, nothing says that. But because he'd obviously read about the obscure magical effect while in school even if he didn't recognize that he caused the effect to manifest when he killed Lily. As Dumbledore said, Voldemort had long since knew about the existence of love magic but he always underestimated it and didn't consider it, hence his defeats.
