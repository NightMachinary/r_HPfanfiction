Canon[books only, no twitter addends] information of horcruxes is quite vague.\\
And Voldemort seems to realize that Harry was after the horcruxes because of the Gringotts break-in. In essence, they are totally off the gird, homing beacons like anchors which don't let his soul pass ahead. He isn't aware of their status through any telepathic links. Other than say Harry and Nagini which are passive.\\
It might be possible that Voldemort had this connection before Halloween 1991, and that night might've caused the connections with horcruxes to block out from him.

If you're planning on writing a fic, go with whatever you feel suits the story.
