This is fanfiction! Canon or fanon, movie or book doesn't really matter, it's just a bunch of puzzle pieces to fit together for whatever story you have in your mind.

That is one of the things I like about fanfic, canon is what you need it to be. And there is such a large pool to draw from! Want to make a crack fic based on one of her tweets? go ahead. A line from one of the movies is the start of your canon divergence fic? awesome! Need to discard book 6 to make your fic work? Fair enough.

If elements from both the movies and the books are needed in your mind, then go for it!
