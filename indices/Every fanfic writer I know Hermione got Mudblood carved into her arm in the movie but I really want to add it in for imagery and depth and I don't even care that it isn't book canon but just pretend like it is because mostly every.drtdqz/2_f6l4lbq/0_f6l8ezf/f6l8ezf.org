Was about to say, never heard anyone complain about authors mixing book and movie canon... It's fanfiction. Next he is going to complain about authors describing characters and locations like they were shown in the movie and not how JKR described them in the books...

Also, am I just reading very different stories than OP? Because in the hundreds of millions of words of HP fanfiction I have read in the past 20 years, I don't think the carved arm was mentioned once. At least not that I can remember. And he makes it sound like its a very common trope.
