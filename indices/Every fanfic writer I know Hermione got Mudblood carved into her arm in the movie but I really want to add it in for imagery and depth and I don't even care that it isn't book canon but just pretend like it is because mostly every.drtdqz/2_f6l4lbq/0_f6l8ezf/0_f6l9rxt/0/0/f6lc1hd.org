Only thing I have on the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11344172/1/][Magic Through the Gate]] an okay stargate crossover that was cut short (author finished it up before it really started because of some flames). Hermione gets a magical tattoo to cover it up.

No others come to mind right now, but I can give a general picture of what I read so you can compare. I mostly read Harmony stories, and I would say it comes up fairly often in angsty (and not so angsty) post war stories, and also a bunch in year seven rewrites.
