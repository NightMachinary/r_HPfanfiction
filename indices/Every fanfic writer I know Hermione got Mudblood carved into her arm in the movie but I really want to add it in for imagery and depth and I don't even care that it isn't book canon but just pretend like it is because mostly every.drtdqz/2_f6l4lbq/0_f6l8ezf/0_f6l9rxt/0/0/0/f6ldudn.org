Well, I do read a lot of Harmony. But angst and rewrites are things I try to avoid at all costs, so maybe thats where the difference lies.

And thanks for the fic, sounds interesting and I thought my recent crossover binge had exhausted the crossover section at ffnet but hadn't stumbled over this one yet. Even if it got cut short and is only ok, I will give it a read to extend the binge.
