I mean realistically, the movies did that sort of thing because the Cruciatus Curse is (1) a bit over the line in terms of how its described in the books to show explicitly in movies (you never hear the sort of crazed, agonized screams described in the books) and (2) actually not very visual as spells go and since movies are /visual/ medium this means the writers and director need find some way to better illustrate the torture.

You could also be a bit more tasteless and say its part of the whole sadomasochism-aspect of Bellatrix (or dominatrix if you prefer) that was highlighted in the books but really blown up in the movies. There is also something to be said that, at least in the movies, the entire concept of blood supremacy, classicism, and elitist-snobbery is forced to take a back seat to more visual depictions of "the bad guys" (ex. black cloaks with pointy hats that look suspiciously like KKK outfits, the shape/color of all the bad characters wands, flying dementors with cryokinetic abilities not seen in the books, etc.).

Carving 'Mudblood' is an easy way, both in the movies and fanfiction, to remind people, "oh yeah, these people are also racist, and not just murdering psychopaths and cowards," rather than explaining it through characterization or world-building which take time and planning.
