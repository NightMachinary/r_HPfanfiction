[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4838629/1][Not Quite A Maia]] is pretty good. Fic's taken off FF.Net, but it's still up on Fictionhunt. In this story it's not Harry who goes to Middle-Earth, but Neville. And Molly Weasley. It's a little goofy, but I really like how it presents the contrast between HP magic and LOTR magic: HP magic is quicker, easier and flashier, and HP wizards use it a lot more freely, so they come across as hugely powerful to the Middle-Earth people. However. LOTR magic is on the whole stronger; it takes longer and is harder to build up properly, but when it strikes it strikes HARD.
