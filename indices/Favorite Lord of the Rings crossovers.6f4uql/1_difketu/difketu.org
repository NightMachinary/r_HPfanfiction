This one with fem!MoD!Harry is awesome: linkffn(10131514)

This one with fem!teenager!Harry is awesome too (I especially liked the running gag where oblivious middle-earthers kept assuming she's a boy because of the wizard robes): linkffn(10055643)

There's also this HP-Hobbit crossover with male-turned-fem!Harry: linkffn(11154214)

I really like fem!Harry fics too for some reason. It's so hard to filter out the ones that are done well though
