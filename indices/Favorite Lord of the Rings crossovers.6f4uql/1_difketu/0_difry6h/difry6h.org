I was reading back to the beginning and then it got to Harry apparating and it broke it's self for me. That's the hardest part of lotr crossovers where Harry keeps all of his abilities. If he is in the know about needing to destroy the ring, he has the ability to do so, and then people would have to get creative with plot.
