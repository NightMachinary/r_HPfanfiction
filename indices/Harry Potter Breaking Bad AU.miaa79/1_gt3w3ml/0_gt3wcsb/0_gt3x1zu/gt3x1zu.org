I mean Snape-Tom relationship can work better as a Walter-Gus than James-Tom... Also Snape-Harry instead of James-Draco.

A loose adaptation can do wonders here, and avoids BB rehash.

Dumbledore, old codger Salamanca, leading the crazy clan of the trafficking Weasleys against the more pompous DE... Kingsley and Scrimgeour tying to catch either of the clans...Fudge taking bribes from Lucius. Hinny complicating things for Snape-Tom relationship. You can have Hermione getting caught in all of it... Sort of like skyler. Instead of the trapped wife... Hermione can be a proper citizen who was at the wrong place and the wrong time and now needs to side with the Weasleys (Ron) to avoid getting herself in trouble with the Ministry.
