I think it's a rather interesting concept and could actually work but James is no Walter White. Remus would fit much better and his relationship with a Jesse in Draco (which I love) would probably go some excellent places. The only problem is I don't really see Remus losing himself the way that Walter does unless you go for a werewolf type of thing with his personality like Jekyll and Hyde. James would work better as his former friend who stayed with the company and is raking in the dough. Sirius as Hank would also work and with Tonk Remus' wife that's the family connection.

Tom Riddle is perfect as Gus there is no other character who could be as bad and as charming.

I think Lucius being Walter is another possibility a little more difficult to pull off with Harry as his Jesse. I think Narcissa could be a great Skylar. Also Ted and Andromeda Tonks as Hank and Marie would be perfect.
