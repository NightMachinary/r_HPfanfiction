now I want to see that a timeline where vernon is an aspiring stand up comic.

he actually liked harry's father in this timeline because James potter had so many wacky stories from his school days.

Vernon looked Gruffly at a young harry who had just asked about his parents 'I did not know your parents well, but they had a great sense of humour' Harry looked shocked uncle vernon who watchs tv and complains about the delivery of the comedians on it thought his parents where funny.

I picture vernon acting like a fan watching sports complaining about how the sports man is behaving but only with comedy. "Should have left a bigger pause before the punchline'' '' that Joke was too safe and predictable'' ''this carlin guy is great, wish he was on tv more''
