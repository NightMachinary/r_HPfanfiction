Also its like saying its plagiarism when someone uses tempus as a time spell and point me as a locating spell in fanfiction. These arent event canon spells and point me just points the tru north. Or harry time travelling in certain fanfics. Thoughts are similar but they are not necessarily plagiarism. Why cant people think at certain times the same idea?
