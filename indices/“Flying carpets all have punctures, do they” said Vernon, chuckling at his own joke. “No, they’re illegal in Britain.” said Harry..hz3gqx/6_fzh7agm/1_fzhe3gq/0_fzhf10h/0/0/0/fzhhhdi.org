  “Flying carpets all have punctures, do they?” said Vernon, chuckling at his own joke.

  “No, they're illegal in Britain.” said Harry.

  Vernon snorted back a laugh involuntarily, while an expression of mild horror appeared on his face at the realization that he had found something his freak nephew said amusing.

The line from Sarah1281's fanfic

  "Funny way to get to wizards' school, the train. Magic Carpets all got punctures, have they?"

  "No, but they're illegal in Britain, and I doubt they'd trust us to go straight to school and not let ourselves be seen if we each had one. Not to mention how expensive it would be..."

Clearly it's a 1:1 identical quote.

You do realize this sort of thing crops up a /lot/ in this fandom? There are over 800,000 /Harry Potter/ fanfics on Fanfiction.net alone. For just about every idea that can be had, someone is bound to have thought of it before.

Nearly every prompt that gets any attention on this sub will have fanfic recs because someone already had the idea and wrote it, probably several times.
