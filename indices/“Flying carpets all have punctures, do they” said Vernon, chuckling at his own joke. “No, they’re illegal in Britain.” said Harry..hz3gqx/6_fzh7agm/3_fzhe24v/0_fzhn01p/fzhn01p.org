I found the quote in question and recounted it in [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hz3gqx/flying_carpets_all_have_punctures_do_they_said/fzhhhdi/][this comment]]. I didn't remember it when I posted this prompt, but it's similar, at least on the outset. I was almost entirely focused on the second part with Vernon reacting to Harry's comment. The only thing I was actually copying were the first 5 words, from the original book of /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone./
