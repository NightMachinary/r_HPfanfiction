I hadn't head about separation of powers before I started following American politics. I wouldn't worry about it.

In addition to the excellent points [[/u/Taure]] made, the Wizengamot simply has too many members to be purely judicial. iirc, Bones, Umbridge and Fudge voted in Harry's court case, which wouldn't make any sense if there were a strict separation of powers.
