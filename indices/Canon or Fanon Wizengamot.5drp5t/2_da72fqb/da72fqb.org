  I was told multiple times to clearly separate the legislative and judiciary powers of the Wizengamot.

If your community is in the tens of thousands, this makes some sense -- a judge is too busy judging and a mayor is too busy maying for it to be reasonable for the same person to serve as both. If it's two thousand people, the mayor would probably handle most judicial matters, with important stuff going before the full town council.

The House of Lords was a judicial body until 2009. Before 1948, the House of Lords was the only court that could try a peer. So that suggestion of separation was, I think, an Americanism. But in the US, Congress handles trials for sitting presidents, and in a less formal manner it can expel members.
