The Wizengamot having powers beyond the judicial is based on a number of inferences. It's not canon but it is more than fanon (i.e. it is part of many people's "headcanon", elements of the world they consider part of canon but without conclusive evidence).

The place to start is OotP, where we see Fudge removed from office before the end of his term. This implies that there is a body, other than the electorate in general, that has primacy over the office of the Minister. This is then further supported by the Pottermore page on Minister for Magic, which also mentions Ministers being removed from power.

The next clue is to contrast CoS and OotP. In OotP, all legislation is called a Decree and seems to come directly from the office of the Minister for Magic. See also the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery. However, in CoS we hear about the Muggle Protection /Act/. The use of two different words, degree and act, suggests two different forms of legislation. Decrees are passed by the Minister (i.e. the executive). It is unknown who passes Acts.

It should be noted that in British constitutional tradition, an Act is one of the only two forms of primary legislation (the other being an Order in Council). The executive branch does write a lot of secondary or delegated legislation called statutory instruments, however. So a comparison immediately seems clear: there is a legislative body which can pass Acts, which are primary legislation, and the executive can pass Decrees, which are secondary legislation. Secondary legislation is called delegated legislation because it is generally made pursuant to an empowering Act which authorises the executive to write legislation on a particular matter within certain limits.

So to summarise: there is a body with primacy over the Minister for Magic, and further there is a type of legislation other than that which we see the Minister passing. The Wizengamot seems to be the obvious body to attribute these powers to. Indeed, the only alternative would seem to be the ICW (which we also know has at least once removed a Minister from power).

As for the separation of powers issue, I would encourage you to consider the British constitutional tradition on this matter. The Wizengamot is based, at least in name, on the Witenagemot, a Saxon proto-Parliament that was a gathering of the Kingdom's nobility to advise the king of the day. They had no clearly defined powers and certainly no concept of separation of powers. Their authority stemmed from the fact that together they represented all the most powerful and influential people of the land, and that gave them the ability to weigh in on whatever matter they were called to discuss.

Similarly, Parliament never really had any concept of separation of powers until very recently. In the early days of Parliament, it was similar to the Witengamot in its relative informality and role relative to the King. Over time Parliament evolved into a legislative institution (with the Crown as the executive) but it was also a judicial institution. Until 2009, the House of Lords (one of the two chambers of Parliament) was not only the upper chamber of the legislature, it was also the highest court of appeal (or rather, a subcommittee of the House of Lords was).

I don't think it would be a good idea to bring strict and formal separation of powers into wizarding Britain. Firstly because it feels out of place in the British context - almost American. Secondly because it feels out of place in the wizarding context - too formal and possessing to much clarity. Thirdly because it robs you of the ability to write a Ministry which has lots of obscure little rules and conventions each of which are based on a bit of juicy history that you can tell us about.
