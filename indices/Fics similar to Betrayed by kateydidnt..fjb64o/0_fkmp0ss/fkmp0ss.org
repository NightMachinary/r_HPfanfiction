Man, this fic is weird. I have "I think I liked it?" written down on my fanfic spreadsheet.

Try some of sheriff1985's stuff, particularly Snake Bites. I think the general tone was pretty similar, a bit lighter in general. But maybe I'm only remembering that they both heavily feature school presentations. It's also better written imo.

linkffn(Muggle at Large) has similarly weird juxtapositions of random things, completely OC story though.

One of the first fanfics I read (before I started keeping track) had Ginny permanently ill in a nursing home after a Quidditch accident or something - I don't remember the title or genre at all but they felt similar in tone iirc.
