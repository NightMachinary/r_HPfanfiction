I mean, there's a question of how often potioneering changes. Perhaps frequently, but the level at which students need doesn't really change all that much if at all. Or consider also that a lot of progress made in potioneering might be all concealed as trade secrets. Alternatively, Slughorn might just be rather fond of the textbook, and thinks it's one of the best around, even with modern changes, and would rather just explain the changes then switch books (it's a bit like using a book written by Euler for math; old but still good).
