Based on Slughorn's personality, it doesn't seem unreasonable for him to repeat his lesson plans, so he has more time to spend planning dinner parties and accepting invitations to pro Quidditch games.

In fanfic author fanon, Slughorn has been using the same lesson plans since the days of Tom Riddle. Because every other Riddle-era fic I read usually has some form of competitive brewing lesson and an introduction to Amortentia.
