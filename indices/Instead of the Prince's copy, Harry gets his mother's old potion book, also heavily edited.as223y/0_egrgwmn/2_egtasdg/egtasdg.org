I mean, the wizarding world is kinda slow to change things, books seem to change with new professors and New Years.

Also, my mom has been teaching for 30+ years and has used the same textbook for more than half of that because the newer ones aren't as good. They have worse examples, the wrong pacing, they're missing information that integral for how she teaches. Sometimes an older book is exactly what you need, free of whatever dad is sweeping the industry at the time.

Slughorn has just been thrown bodily out of retirement and probably hasn't been keeping up with school level textbooks, given his Mastery, so he likely dusted off his old lesson plans, found where his old books were stored and got to work!
