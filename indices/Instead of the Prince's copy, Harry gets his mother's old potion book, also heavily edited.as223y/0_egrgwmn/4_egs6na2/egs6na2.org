This is very strange - many textbooks do print out revised editions every few years and have schools prescribe those newer versions, but the core part of the books won't change.

Senior high school students were learning integral and differential calculus 30 years back, and they're still learning it today. Why would they change that? Same goes for physics - classical mechanics (Newtonian) is taught in schools, even though we have more complete theories. In fact, schools will just teach the basics of classical mechanics, and not even go into Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics (unless maybe the student is in an advanced course) , even though they're the "complete" version.
