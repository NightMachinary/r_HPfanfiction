It's an interesting premise. You'd lose the mystery aspect of the Half Blooded Prince but you'd have some really nice moments of Harry realising it's his mother's book. The emotional attachment he form to that book would be interesting to explore and if I remember correctly Lily was a charms badass as well so it stands to reason she would have written something like that in her book too.

I'd love to read something based on this of it exists.
