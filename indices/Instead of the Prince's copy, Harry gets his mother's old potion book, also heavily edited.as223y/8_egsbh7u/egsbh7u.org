What an exciting prompt! I can see Lily having created her own charms where instead Snape was busy creating his own hexes/curses since she was said to have a talent for it. I bet Snape and Lily could've spent time together inventing their own spells before they fell-out in fifth year, and remnants of Snape's approach to spellmaking maybe making its way into Lily's?

Oh, there's so much! And she was also known for her snark too, wasn't she? Where Snape was more scathing with his comments, maybe Lily was more sarcastic in her commentry. It would be so cute to see Harry laugh at his mom's jokes.

Then the same way we're hinted that the HBP is Snape, I think in DH when Harry finds Lily's letter to Padfoot it said he wrote one of his letters the same way? I wonder how else her edition of the book might hint at her identity, I can maybe see a few ways... gosh, the possibilities... the story potential! This really is a fantastic prompt you have here, Hellstrike.
