1. I'd like to think she'd try and be mad, but when she sees how happy he is she'll do that “open and close my mouth silently while I figure out what to say” thing, huff, turn away, and mutter something about how she's happy he's taking potions seriously.

2. Definitely. Pissing off Lily seems like an unholy combination of a literally firey redhead, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and the three things all wise men fear; the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.

3. James and Sirius show up at her dorm room door (‘cause if anyone can get past the no-boys ward, it'd be Remus' intellect, James' desire to see Lily more, and Sirius' desire in general) and start giving her a spiel like a missionary how made their first conversion and a teen finally able to gossip after years away from their friends! They've got a massive notebook they got on a recon mission to muggle London to learn more about muggles, and therefor Lily's upbringing, and it's chock full of pranks and spells and potions geared towards Sevvy in particular and Slytherins in general.
