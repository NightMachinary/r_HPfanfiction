1. The "Who is the Half-Blood Prince?" is a stupid, pointless subplot which could entirely be removed.
2. I don't think Hermione would throw as much of a stink over Harry using it. She'd still call it cheating, but she'd understand that he wants to feel closer to his mother.
3. Harry could use some other spell in the bathroom scene. /Expelliarmus/ has served him well against Voldemort, why not Draco as well?
4. Harry would let Ron use the book too and Ron wouldn't degrade on his previous signs of maturity. They'd both be doing well in Potions.
5. Lily would probably have hexes to use against "traitorous little liars like Snivellus."
6. James would probably help her in the potions/hexes ideas, since his father was a Potions Master, and it might hint to their romantic development.
7. Less OOC for the sake of plot.

Overall a much better idea than glorifying Snape. It's actually one I've been toying with myself.
