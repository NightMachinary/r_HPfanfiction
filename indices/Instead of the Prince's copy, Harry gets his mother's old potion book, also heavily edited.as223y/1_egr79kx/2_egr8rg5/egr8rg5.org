So Harry takes down Draco with a Stunner, and Dumbledore and Snape have no excuse to cover the incident up, which leads to Draco getting sent to Azkaban for attempting to use an unforgivable on Harry. And we are spared the shitty "Draco totally isn't as bad as he was for years - let's forget all the people he hurt, he's going to be redeemed" plot.
