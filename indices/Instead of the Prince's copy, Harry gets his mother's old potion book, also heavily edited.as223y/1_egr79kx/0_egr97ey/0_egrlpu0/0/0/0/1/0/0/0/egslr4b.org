Ugh love this analysis of Hermione and I think you have a great point, also many forget that Hermione pretty much had no friends when they first started Hogwarts and most likely didn't in the muggle world (look how easy it was for her to leave it behind). I also think that part of her character is that she listens to the 'qualified' people and the people who have more experience and know more things...I mean look at Lockhart it took her ages to concede that he actually didn't know what he was doing. The only time she went against and authority figure was Umbridge and that was because Umbridge had given them a book that Hermione didn't believe was going to teach them to the best of their abilities so she found a way around that. I believe this has everything to do with Hermione's childhood and how she likely relied on books for everything so the second a book that comes around that is not an official copy she distrusts it.

Also difference between book Hermione and movie Hermione is that she's incredibly insensitive to other peoples emotions in the book...to the point that Ron is normally the one who is actually the trios emotional support person. Wether it is Lilys book or Snapes she would still say that Harry is only using it for sentimental reasons and she would still dislike it and the advantage it gives harry over her.

*edit - she also went against the school rules on many occasions so my entire argument may be a bit of a moot point lol
