That's an instance of FIGHTING AGAINST unfairness. Umbridge was leading up to a totalitarian reign and wanted all the students under her control, thereby unfairly keeping them from getting the skills and knowledge they needed.

And after all, she knew from personal experience that Harry DID have a talent for Defence Against the Dark Arts. This wasn't someone showing her up without having earned it through hard work; this extra-curricular activity did in no way threaten her status as Top of the Class.... quite the contrary; it made her status as a brilliant witch even clearer because SHE got to do a lot of fancy organizing and using clever spells.

She wouldn't see that as unfair, because one, it was HER doing it; two, she was using trusted and verified sources; and three, the members of the DA were putting in actual work and PRACTICING.

I don't even see how you could compare the two.
