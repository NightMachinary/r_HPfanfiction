Poorly-written? Nah, can't agree. I think Hermione's reaction is very believable and fits her character perfectly.

(Besides, your first two emphasisted parts are said by/referring to GINNY, not Hermione. It's GINNY who is angry about Harry obeying orders that someone wrote in a book, which makes sense because of her experiences with Riddle's diary... which Harry is quick to point out that this isn't anything like that.)

While Hermione does value learning for learning's sake, she isn't a cold, detached intellectual... nor is she a particularly scientific-minded or imaginative person. Hermione's actually very closed-minded (which is why she doesn't get along with Luna), and she distrusts "unofficial" information sources and things that haven't been properly verified.

There's also the fact that Hermione HATES unfairness. People having unfair advantages really irks her, and with the textbook here, Harry does have what she sees as an unfair advantage... what's worse is that he has an unfair advantage over HER. Hermione is used to being the top of the class, and all of a sudden Harry (whom she KNOWS not to be a Potions prodigy) surpasses her thanks to some dodgy written instructions in a book. He doesn't even UNDERSTAND the instructions, he just FOLLOWS them. He's become the top of the class, surpassing HER, without having done anything to earn it. SHE'S had to work hard, do all her homework, spend an ungodly amount of time studying. She's WORKED for success. Now Harry just follows some extra instructions on a whim and ends up doing better than her without actually putting in any work, and she's MIFFED about it.

So when Ginny brings up Riddle's diary, Hermione is all too happy to take the opportunity to spread doubt that the instructions are on the level. This isn't about intellectual curiosity, it's about Hermione feeling unfairly surpassed.

I don't call that poorly-written, I call that three-dimensional.
