To try to rescue the characterization...

Hermione has a huge amount of respect for authority. Contradicting the authority's instructions is anathema to her earlier character, and while she's changed her attitudes toward personal and political authorities, she still has similar instincts about academic authorities.

She's also seen time and again, thanks to Neville, that Bad Things happen when you don't follow instructions with potions.

So she's not keen on following the hand-written notes, and doubly not keen on experimenting in potions. It might go just fine 90% of the time, and then sometimes the note-taker wrote something down carelessly that doesn't reflect what actually worked for them, and then it's off to the infirmary with tentacles growing in your lungs.
