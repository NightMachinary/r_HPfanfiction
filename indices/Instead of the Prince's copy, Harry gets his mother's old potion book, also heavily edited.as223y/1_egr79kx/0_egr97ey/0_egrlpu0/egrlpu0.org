Well, with /This book is the property of Lily Evans/ written on the inside cover, there's no mystery as to who the book's previous owner is, so that entire "I must identify the Half-Blood Prince" thread is absent.

The question remains whether Hermione would remain stubbornly opposed to following those notations as opposed to continuing to follow Libatius Borage's original instructions as she did in the book. I personally lean towards the latter, though I think there might be good arguments for either viewpoint.
