Voldemort's origin story is a shitty "Mystery" since all Harry does is listening to tales from Dumbledore and then asking Slughorn for the one thing Dumbledore doesn't know already. And the "Who is the HBP" mystery is just a "oh, feel sorry for the poor child-abusing Death Eater" vehicle - worthless. Which leaves Draco, a mystery which would have been solved quickly if Ron and Hermione hadn't been acting completely OOC instead of IC.
