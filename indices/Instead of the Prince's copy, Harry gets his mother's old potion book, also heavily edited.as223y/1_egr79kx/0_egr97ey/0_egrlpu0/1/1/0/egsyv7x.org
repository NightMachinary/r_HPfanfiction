Isn't that an American thing? Because, at least here in Germany, Arabs and Turks using racial slurs for themselves isn't stopping anyone else from using them. Nor does it make them more socially acceptable in polite company when the primary driving force is a rapper who is famous for the "I fuck your mother slang", songs like "Gangbang" and countless songs about assault, rape and theft. You can even make the same argument for artists like NWA and DMX in the US.

If you really want some mystery in that regard, blood to mud transfiguration. Seems like something the Death Eaters would use and not the ruthless side of Lily.
