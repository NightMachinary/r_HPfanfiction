The thing is, Harry Potter is primarily a mystery series in a magical setting. Whereas the early books have only a single major mystery (who's trying to steal the grubby package, who's the Heir, etc) HPB steps it up with three main mysteries: what's Voldemort's origin story, what is Draco up to, and who is the Half Blood Prince.

Removing that mystery would require either a greater focus on the other two, hiding Lily's ownership (simply having her initial it LE could work) or inventing a non canon mystery that the book is a key part of.
