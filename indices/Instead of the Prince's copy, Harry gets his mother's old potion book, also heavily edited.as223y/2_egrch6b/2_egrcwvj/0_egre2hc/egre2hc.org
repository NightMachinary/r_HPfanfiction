Not saying there was necessarily anything /wrong/ per se with Harry's decision in the bathroom - as I agree it was a legitimate case of self-defense. But I still think using a spell when you have /no idea what it actually does/ is a stupid idea. Nor am I saying that it's not something that'd be useful in combat.

I was really speaking in terms of the kind of mindset one would have to have to come up with a spell like this at /fifteen years old/. Let me elaborate a bit on my thought process there: /Sectumsempra/ is explicitly established as a Dark spell: it is identified in /Deathly Hallows/ as the spell Snape used which severed George's ear(accidentally, I'll allow), and it is mentioned that the ear cannot be grown back due to having been cursed off(a characteristic of Dark Magic).

For a 15-year-old to deliberately create a Dark spell designed to cut your opponent open would require IMO a real desire to inflict pain greater than what I would consider typical of a kid that age - to say nothing of an interest in Dark Magic that goes beyond the theoretical or the interest in self-defense.

So if we accept the premise suggested by OP that Harry finds Lily's old book instead of Snape's, there is absolutely /no way/ that Lily(who strongly criticized Snape's association with Mulciber and his defense of the latter's use of Dark Magic on a classmate) would have come up with a spell like /Sectumsempra/ - which is the main point I was trying to get across.
