It sounds like a useful combat spell tbh. Not worse than taking a good ol sword and going to town on magical Nazis, Jack Churchill fashion. Perhaps not useful against the average Hogwarts prankster, but against a Death Eater it is one of the better spells to choose. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the spell selection in the bathroom fight. Self-defence covers any amount of force as long as it is proportionate to what you are attacked with (at least in most legal systems). And against an unforgivable, it is appropriate to resort to any amount of force. I mean, look at the Longbottoms if you want to see its effects.

The one loss is Muffliato. That one is dead useful.
