Well, let's take a look, shall we?

- /Sectumsempra/: Yeah, that's definitely something only a kid with an unhealthy fascination with Dark Magic, or someone who really wants to /hurt/ people, would come up with. Lily is neither, so we can definitely say that one would not be in her book.
- /Levicorpus/: A spell that lets you suspend someone in mid-air as if they're being held up by the ankle. Eh...I dunno, that's a little bully-ish, doesn't seem like something Lily would come up with either, so let's remove that one. If anything, if not Snape I can see James or Sirius coming up with something like this.
- /Liberacorpus/: Counter-spell for /Levicorpus/. If we remove one, we have to remove the other
- /Muffliato/: Much more practical little spell, one that lets one have a quiet conversation unnoticed. I could see Lily coming up with that in case she didn't want to be overheard, though I'd imagine she wouldn't be using it in class
- An unidentified Hex that causes the target's toenails to grow alarmingly fast. A little spiteful, but I could see perhaps Lily coming up with that one if there was a particular student who was the bane of her existence, like James was to Snape or, a generation later, Malfoy to Harry. Hell, I wouldn't put it past Lily to hit James with it as payback for him bullying Snape.
- +An also unidentified spell+*EDIT:* */Langlock/* - *a spell* that caused the target's tongue to get stuck to the roof of their mouth. Bit mischievous, not particularly bullying or dark, and again something I can totally see her using on say, James or Sirius to shut them up.

So some of the spells might also have been something she'd have come up with, others not. That being said, let's set aside the Prince's spells.

Lily was established as particularly brilliant in Potions, so she's someone whom I can totally see scribbling notes for improvements to Potions recipes/instructions that she might have come up with. And she's definitely not the type to give herself a pompous little nickname, so she would have signed the book in her own name. Either way, all of a sudden Harry's the best in his year in Potions, with the added bonus that instead of being some anonymous "Half-Blood Prince", the help he is receiving is from his own late mother, in a way. This is going to be /huge/ in terms of how it affects his character and his attitude towards the book, I think.

Finally, the bathroom confrontation with Malfoy. Instead of Harry stupidly using a spell he found scrawled in his Potions book when he has absolutely no idea what it does, he falls back on his pre-existing arsenal of spells. This means the likeliest counters will be /Stupefy/ or /Expelliarmus/...frankly, I'm leaning towards the latter. So instead of carving Malfoy open, he either Stuns or, more likely, Disarms him. And here we have Malfoy, who was about to use an *Unforgivable Curse*, duly Disarmed. Enter another teacher, Malfoy is expelled and probably sent to join his father in Azkaban, because even Snape's not thick enough to try to cover for Malfoy attempting to murder a classmate for no reason.

With Malfoy foiled before he's able to mend the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement, no Death Eaters can enter Hogwarts. For the same reason, there is in all likelihood no need to get the Order involved at Hogwarts, so Bill isn't mauled by Greyback, since neither of them is present. For that matter, the former DA gang probably don't get too involved either.

This leaves Snape the unenviable task of obeying Dumbledore's orders and killing him, forcing him to go on the run /immediately/. Also, nobody sets Hagrid's hut on fire.

Oh, and last but not least: /"This book is the property of Lily Evans"/ on the inside cover? Hermione's got nothing she can say to that, so her objections to the mysterious "Half-Blood Prince" and her determination to identify him(or her) become nonexistent.

I may just steal this idea for when/if I get 'round to actually writing this HP fanfic I've been trying to write for the better part of two years...
