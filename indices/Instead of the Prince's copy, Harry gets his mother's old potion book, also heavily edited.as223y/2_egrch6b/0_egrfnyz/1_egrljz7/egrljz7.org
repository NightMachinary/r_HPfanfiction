It's mentioned that Ron has trouble deciphering the notations in the book, while Hermione rather stubbornly refuses to use it at all, IIRC. YMMV on whether Hermione would still do so if the identity of the book's original owner were known though. As for Ron, I suppose it's 50/50 whether the same issue would be present - depends on Lily's handwriting.
