Ah, heck, I'll write it.

--------------

Harry and Ron muttered thanks to Slughorn's offer to lend them some old textbooks. There were a half dozen copies of /Advanced Potions Making/ in the cupboard. Ron grabbed the nearest one while Harry selected a copy near the back, in the corner.

"Right then, well Harry and Rupert, was it?" Slughorn smiled jovially, looking all the more like a walrus. "We have four potions here, all of which you will be studying throughout your N.E.W.T. year."

--------------

/Draught of Living Death/ Harry opened his textbook and began to read the instructions. All around him, the room was filling with blue smoke. Out the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy looking more engaged in his potion than Harry could remember.

Harry squinted at his book. Whoever had owned it before him had written in the margins, though in usually in a lighter color of ink. It took a little getting used to, but it wasn't that difficult to differentiate between the instructions and the original owner's notes.

Harry began chopping his Sopophorous beans when he noticed one of the notes read "Crush with edge of blade for more juice." Cautiously, he pressed the flat of his blade against the bean. Juice splurged out and it took him by such surprise

"What are you doing?" Hermione hissed. Her own beans were chopped neatly, but barely half as much juice had been produced.

"Crush the bean, it'll work better."

"No! That's not what the instructions say!"

"Oy!" Ron snapped in a voice barely above a whisper. "Keep it down, I'm trying to concentrate. These Vaderian roots have to be perfect squares!" Ron's potion was black as tar and even thicker, judging from how his stirring tool appeared to be cemented in place.

"Here," Ernie passed Ron a small tool Harry didn't recognize. It looked vaguely like a pair of scissors. "This is what I use whenever I have to chop something in a specific shape."

"Stop it! That's cheating!" Hermione's face was growing red with fury.

"Eyes on your own stations, now." Slughorn chortled. He smiled at Harry's potion, grimaced at Ron's and gave Ernie's a brief, polite nod.

Harry looked further in the instructions, and noted a second alteration from the previous owner. Instead of seven counter-clockwise stirs, the previous owner had written "five counter, one clock, one counter."

Curious, Harry wondered if it would work. The advice on crushing the beans had worked quite well. He did as he was told--the potion paled to a light purple, very nearly matching the book's instructions of lilac.

"How?!" Hermione's voice shook with frustration--her potion was still dark purple. Ernie's potion was navy, the ideal stage of the halfway point and Ron, thanks to Ernie's cutting tool, had managed to stir his potion to a smooth consistency, though it was nowhere near .

"Let me see now, let me see." Slughorn

"Excellent, Harry! Excellent! Why, this potion, it reminds me very much of your mother! Ah, sweet Lily. The number of times I saw her practice potions in here. Always experimenting!"

"Mudblood lucky she didn't blow herself up, more's the pity" Malfoy muttered.

"I heard that!" Slughorn whipped around, far more quickly than Harry could have expected. "Twenty points from Slytherin! I will not have any student, past or present, be disparaged in such a matter Malfoy. You've been warned."

--------------

"Harry, that was cheating and you know it! You should turn that book in!"

"Are you mental? It was great!"

"I don't see what the big deal is," Ron shrugged. "So Harry beat you one time Hermione, and if the potion is better, I don't see why that's bad."

"Am I the only one who values doing the work myself?!"

"While that is a virtue, Hermione, I'd advise caution not to let pride get in the way," Ernie said cooly. "Ron needed help, and I assisted."

"How long have you been standing there?"

"Since we left Slughorn's class. I wouldn't recommend following alternative instructions Harry, since it can be dangerous, but a classroom is probably the safest place to do so."

"Well, this conversation is private!"

"Oy," Ron interrupted. "Ernie works at our table too. What if Harry was standing next to him instead of me? Then he would have noticed Harry following those other instructions anyway."

"Who owned the book anyway Harry? If they're a practiced potioneer, then Slughorn might want to know about those alterations."

Harry looked over his shoulder to make sure they weren't being followed by Malfoy or any of the other Slytherins, and quickly opened the book to the inside cover. The previous owner has written, in what was clearly their very neatest handwriting:

"/This book is the property of Lily Evans./"

"...Mum?"
