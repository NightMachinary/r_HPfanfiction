Oh, remember?

In /Half-Blood Prince,/ the students have to stand four to a desk. Harry, Ron, and Hermione share a desk with Ernie, who is the only Hufflepuff in the entire class.

As for his personality, while Ernie is pompous, he's also justifiably proud of his grades, which he earned through studying eight or nine hours a day.

Ernie also strikes me as someone who isn't completely opposed to following alternate instructions, since in an attempt to outshine Harry he once tried to invent a potion from scratch. It wound up curdling into a dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron.
