Thank you! It was actually an awesome day, I got to go to a pain clinic to learn about why my body is constantly freaking out, which is just so amazing, because not many health professionals like talking about pain because we know so little about it; but I'm exhausted and I'll probably pay for it with at least two months of my life stuck in bed so, lol, thinking is hard.

But look, I found the fic!
