I remember really liking this so well done!

This post got me thinking about a topic that's posted a lot on this sub and [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. The basic question is which character's perspective would you want to read the 7 books from. I've always argued that for obvious reasons no other character could maintain 7 books of interesting story without completely making up new storylines. But there are several characters who have enough of a story to carry a few books. Dumbledore and Snape are clear choices and they could probably cover 3 books. But I really think Ginny is one of the small number of other characters who could carry several books (Chamber of Secret, Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows) so I'm generally a big fan of these types of stories.
