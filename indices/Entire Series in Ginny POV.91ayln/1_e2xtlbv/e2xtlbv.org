I read the story some time ago, and I enjoyed it. However, it's a bit confusing when chapters are added in the middle of a completed story. I didn't re-read the story each time you've inserted a new chapter, especially when the new chapter was about the time Ginny was with Michael and Dean. I'll definitely read the story again someday.
