i'm pretty sure on the muggle scale of standard of living, the weasleys are middle class but probably on the lower side. wizards definitely have a much better standard of living because of magic. they probably don't have to worry about paying for utilities and it seems implied that molly and arthur magically made the house have more rooms. so on the wizard scale of income/standard of living, they only people poorer than them were the gaunts (at least the weasley house was clean), lupin and probably other werewolves
