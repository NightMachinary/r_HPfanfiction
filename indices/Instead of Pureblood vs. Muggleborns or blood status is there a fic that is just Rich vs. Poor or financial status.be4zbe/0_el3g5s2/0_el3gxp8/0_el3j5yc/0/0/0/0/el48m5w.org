It's left ambiguous in the books, sadly. Hagrid says Harry's name is on the rolls and they the gold is in the bank. Harry said Vernon wasn't going to pay and Hagrid said "didja think you parents didn't leave you anything?" and talks about going to the bank. I guess the case could be made either way lol.
