I interpreted that as Hagrid meaning that Harry will be able to afford Potions ingredients, books, and assorted other equipment (telescopes, gloves, robes, etc.), which are explicitly /not/ covered by Hogwarts. Hogwarts doesn't charge tuition. I think Vernon assumes that it does, and doesn't really consider or care about why Harry's able to attend.
