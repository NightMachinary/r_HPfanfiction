I believe the Weasleys /are/ poor. We see it several time in the books (like when they all wear second hand clothes, or when Ron use his brother old wand even if it's not really consistant with the wand lore Rowling said and his brother got a freaking new owl at the same time).\\
It's just that, they are magical. Magical don't really have the same needs as us:\\
The family own the burrow so no rent.\\
They don't use electricity and get water by magic so no bills.\\
The story never been really clear on this but unless the Potter familly paid 7 years worth of tuitions when he was born (without knowing if he was not a squib, if he was going to continue after his OWL or even if he would not want to go to another school), then Hogwarts doesn't have any (or paid by Ministry, which would explain why they can appoint a teacher when the school fail some standarts).\\
Even the food doesn't cost much considering that they have a garden and that, even if you can't create food, you can multiply it. One potato is enough to feed them for weeks.\\
The only unavoidable expenses they have is for the education of their children, and for stuff like brooms. The problem is that we don't really have a clear idea of the prices of these products. We just know that a familly considered "poor" is able to buy several middle end products, and that only something extremely wealthy (even rich) can buy 7 high end of these product to furnish a team. For all we know, every magical familly is able to easily purchass at least one broom by member since it's one of their basic method of travel.

PS: already said by someone else. But Bagman "gifted" Arthur the tickets after he helped him, and the tent was lent by a friend. The only expenses he had during the World Cup was for the camping spot and for the foods so not so much (and whatever his children bought once there but they paid with their pocket money).
