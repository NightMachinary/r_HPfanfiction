Didn't Bagman give them the tickets for the World Cup?

He borrowed the tents, or they were gifted to him from someone at the office. Many supplies can be conjured.

That's not me saying they're /poor/ (their food expenses have to be pretty decent, though fortunately the times that there's seven children actually in the house is basically Hogwarts holidays only) but they almost certainly have to watch their money pretty closely.
