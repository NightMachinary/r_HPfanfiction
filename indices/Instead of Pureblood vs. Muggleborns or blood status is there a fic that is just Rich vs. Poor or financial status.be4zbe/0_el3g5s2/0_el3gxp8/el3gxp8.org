Ok, so hear me out. I don't think that the Weasleys are all /that/ poor. The main perspectives we get on their wealth are from (1) Harry, who comes from a relatively wealthy family, with 4 people in it. (2) Hermione, an only child, whose parents are both dentists. (3) Draco, an only child of old money.

They have seven (!) children, basically all of whom are actively involved in athletics at a good private school. Ok sure they're not buying top quality shit, but anyone who's been into sports know that none of that mess comes free.

There is never a shortage of food. Don't tell me that people can magic up their food. That's not consistent with the stories of very poor wizard families. They could afford to get to the World Cup Match. Hear me out again: this isn't about the tickets, which got comped. It's that Arthur paid for all his kids, plus Harry, plus Hermione, and didn't blink. This means accommodations, food, and any and all supplies for all of â€˜em without a second thought.

I'm not saying they're wealthy! Not by any stretch. Molly is for sure a hard working lady who makes things from scratch, thereby removing the need to buy a lot of what they have. I'd say they're like those catholic families where there's like 5 kids, and the parents send them all to catholic school for all elementary and middle school, go on a road trip twice a year (once in summer, once in spring), and all though there's hand me downs, nothing is dirty or bad quality.
