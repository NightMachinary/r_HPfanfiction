  If everyone treats the character as if they are perfect, that's a Sue. Failure or success has little to do with it as long as the character makes some (somewhat) impactful mistakes (Harry with Sirius, Hermione with Malfoy).

Even if everyone treats the Sue prospect as perfect, if she's up against tall odds, she's not a Mary Sue. If she's struggling, she's not a Sue. Plenty of characters are universally beloved in-universe, but the struggle they undergo to accomplish their goals separate them from Suedom.

Ender Wiggin. Aang. Harry, for the first and sixth books. All the same thing.
