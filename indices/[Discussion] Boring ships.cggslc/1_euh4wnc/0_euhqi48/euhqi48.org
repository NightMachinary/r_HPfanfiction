Mary Sues are only defined by their opposition. If she is capable of losing and it actually feels like she might be in danger of doing so, then she's not a Mary Sue.

Damsel in distress is a more prickly subject, but if a girl is shown to be competent (which doesn't even have to be in combat), then she's not necessarily a damsel in distress, especially if she wasn't captured because of her tie to a male hero or if she's able to put up a fight/mess with her kidnapper/escape imprisonment.
