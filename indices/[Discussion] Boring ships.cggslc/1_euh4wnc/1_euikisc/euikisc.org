I always put it like this, if Harry never has a original or Interesting Idea it's not a good story, If his SO could already do the plan she made up for Harry this rendering Harry useless then she is a Mary Sue and it's not a Good story.

The Mary/Gary Sue feeling comes from the idea that your Main Characters defining ability that makes them not the average chump can be replicated or worst your Main Characters defining ability is All of the Abilities. Fanon Hermione leans into this with her not only being better than Harry in everything but also doing his Homework and Writing his Essays and Harry is really a 4th year in 7th year classes who can barely keep up with his class.
