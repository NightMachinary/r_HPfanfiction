His explanation about the Patronus has a logic hole. He says that the dementors are drawn to emotion but then claims that a Patronus drives them off by manifesting positive emotions. By his explanation, it would be dementor bait, not repellent.

And his method with the bogart was very questionable. Say one of the children had been molested or abused and suddenly their tormentor manifests in front of their peers. Or imagine they watched one too many documentaries about WWI and suddenly the class room is full with mustard gas. Or burning napalm after too much Apocalypse Now.

I mean, compared to the others he was a good teacher, no question, but that says more about the incompetence of the rest than about him.
