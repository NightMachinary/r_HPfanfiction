Harry/Ginny rarely comes without Ron/Hermione and the Big Weasley family. I have honestly given up on the pairing due to the common ways it is written.

I came looking for HP fanfics because I wanted a better/more in-depth version of Harry/Ginny. And I am still looking because I find R/Hr as convincing as two children atop each other in a long coat and find the behaviour of Mrs Weasley absolutely appealing (to Sirius in OotP, to Hermione in GoF, the lack of action against the Dursleys despite claiming she was worried in CoS and knowing that he got no food later on).

I have yet to read a single H/G fic which has no big Weasley family, no Ron/Hermione, no Lupin/Tonks and no Death Eater revisionism, and I have been looking for years. The best I have found was H/G/Hr smut, and that doesn't really fit the bill. Gimme that postwar ass-kicking power-couple without anything else weighing them down. Or them being a force to be reckoned with in book five and beyond.
