There's a difference between Mary Sue and Damsel, it's not even a thin line. Hermione is more often than not turned into a Mary Sue or exposition machine and not her own character with her own personality in fanfiction, same goes with Daphne Greengrass. Hell, most of the time Harry becomes a Gary Stu in those fics as well.

Calling out bad writing is not misogyny.
