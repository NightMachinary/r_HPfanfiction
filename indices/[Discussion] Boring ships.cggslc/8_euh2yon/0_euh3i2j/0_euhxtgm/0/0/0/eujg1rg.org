Lmfao, the majority of what Ginny did prior to book 6 (mainly book 5) centered around Harry. Hell, she apparently spoke to Tom Riddle about Harry often. The majority of what she did in books 6 and 7 centered around Harry. And she wasn't around that much for anyone to enjoy an arc.

Idc enough about Hermione to argue that she was barely out of character.
