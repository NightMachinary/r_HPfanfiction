We see her as the only cheerful Order member. She has a carefree attitude in general but can apply herself and is reasonably smart since she became an Auror (which requires very good OWL grades). Given that she is an Order member, we can also tell that she is of decent character since she is fighting to protect people from Voldemort and by doing so goes against her boss.

Granted, Tonks is not much of a character in terms of impact, but we can extrapolate quite a lot from what the books say on her.
