Hermione went from "let's lead Umbridge into the forbidden forest so that a giant can squash her - now the Centaurs want to run a train on her? How /unfortunate/" to "Malfoy is not a Death Eater, lalalala, I can't hear you". Tonks went from "The only cheerful person despite Voldemort's return" to "moping mess who pines after a man unworthy of a free newspaper subscription" and Ginny went from "strong female side character with big balls" to "love interest who does absolutely nothing". I'd say each of those was a character assassination.
