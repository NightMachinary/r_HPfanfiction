I tend to not like ships that have a character who we barely know. Someone with only a name (I suppose Daphne could be a good example) can be anyone the author wants them to be and they'll be someone else in a different story. It's kind of sad because a name only character could also be handled well, even that they tend to be some form of wish fulfilment. Which works rarely because everyone has so different wishes.
