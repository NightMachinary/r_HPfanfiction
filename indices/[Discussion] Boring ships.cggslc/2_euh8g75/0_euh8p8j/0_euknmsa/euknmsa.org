The little I read het romances, H/Hr way of writing Hermione makes me wonder if the writers chose her because she's easier to make to an ideal than Ginny is. Sometimes Ginny even gets bashed in those stories to make Hermione look even better. She's this "traditional woman", but maybe with more intelligence than the cliche. I don't claim it's all like that since I don't read it so much, but it is the feeling I get.
