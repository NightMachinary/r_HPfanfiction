Harry/Hermione. Like another person said, it always seems to hijack the plot and make it all about their relationship. And I find romance stories boring. And on top of that, they always butcher Hermione's character into this flat idea of a person. She's all smarts, morals, and pushiness (written as love or something), with little else to make her actually likeable.

I've run into way too many fics that had interesting premises but then forgot about them in favour of the H/Hr ship. No wonder I've grown to like Hermione less and less as I've read more fanfiction.
