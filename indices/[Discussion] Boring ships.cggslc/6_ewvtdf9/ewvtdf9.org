Honestly its when its not really built on with the relationship shown in a way that makes you think oh ya I see these two getting along.

Its ok if it starts out as a couple but just show them be a couple.

Not just the challenges to them hooking up or staying together. Not that you have to show all the dates they go on or anything. It can be all the actiony stuff. But have the adversity be challenges they face together not just challenges to their relationship.

Honestly i will accept any ship as long as you make it work in story even if i hate the idea of it in canon.
