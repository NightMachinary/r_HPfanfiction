Oh ya that's definetly a issue for me. I usually hate ships where the dynanic is one person teaches other to not be a dick and then the romance happens.

Like its fine if say character A has development on their own maybe even inspired by character B but character B isnt like actively holding their hand through this. A changes on their own accord and then B falls for them thats fine.

But if its like B has to fix A to make them into a decent person and then the romance happens its a turn off for me
