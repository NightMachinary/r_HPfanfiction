I mean to be fair alot of the time i do feel like people write kinda short hand for romance. Doing drastic things for each other before a proper relationship is really established. Which makes it feel disconnrcted from human behavior even if said humans are more impulsive

Which makes sense in a short movie but if you have the time to develop the relationship over essentially a novel you dont need shorthand. You can build it up like you would with a friendship.
