Harmony and Haphne is like two robots attempting to simulate human affection. Who would want to spend such a long amount of time with someone who agrees with you on everything and only ever talks about how much they wuv you ?

The reason I love Ron/Hermione is becuase they're able to play off each other. Being paired with Harry almost always sedates Hermione;being paired with Ron helps stimulate her mind becuase he doesn't see her as a goddess and is perfectly willing to point out her flaws while caring about her at the same time
