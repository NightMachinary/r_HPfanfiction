Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny.

The first usually makes the story about the romance when it wasn't about that initially. Good example: A Marauder's Plan. I take umbrage with a lot in that story, but the worst thing is how it went from a Harry/Sirius story to Harry worrying about Hermione and her feelings for chapters on end.

H/Hr stories typically dumb him down significantly and turn him into a bitch. Suddenly Hermione can beat him in a duel, play Quidditch, produce a patronus, becomes an overall likable character. Harry's talents are lessened. He's losing duels and can't hold onto his wand. She huffs and he folds.

I enjoy that little bit of Harry/Ginny in the books (I'm not big on romance), but the sole purpose of her character was to be a perfect mate for Harry, so this doesn't translate well to fanfics that have her as a central character. In the books, she accepts and understands everything about him and that makes for a boring romance fic. They also tend to be written as perfect.
