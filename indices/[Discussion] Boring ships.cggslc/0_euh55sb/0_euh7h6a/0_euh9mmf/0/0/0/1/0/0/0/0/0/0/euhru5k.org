Yeah, I am saying nobody started off with academic knowledge of the subject. Aside from maybe hearing a potion's name once or twice, I don't think that a pureblood would have any knowledge that wouldn't have been smoothed out by the end of a Muggleborn's first year.

And he's a benevolent racist. Not the kind that actively dislikes or sabotages Muggleborns, but the kind that just doesn't expect as much from them. He's clearly open to the idea of a talented Muggleborn. Maybe prejudiced would be a better word. It's less harmful and more offensive (though you might have something like the subtle discouragement women in STEM fields face).
