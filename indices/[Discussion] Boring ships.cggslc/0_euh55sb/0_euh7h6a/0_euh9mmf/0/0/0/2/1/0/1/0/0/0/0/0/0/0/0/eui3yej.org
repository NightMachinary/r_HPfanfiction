Rowling did, in the year 2000. Also on Pottermore.

By that logic, Flitwick isn't a Ravenclaw and Sprout isn't a Hufflepuff.

Did Harry not access other common rooms, and this is Voldemort we are talking about.

I'm stating whitewashing the house isn't good. These fics tend to make canon bigoted characters like Parkinson "good" and that isn't right.

Slughorn and Mrs. Tonks are good yes. But most of the children were awful. Most of the adults were too.

Hell, Daphne Greengrass is a part of Parkinson's posse in canon. You know, the girl who wanted to give up Harry to Lord Voldemort.
