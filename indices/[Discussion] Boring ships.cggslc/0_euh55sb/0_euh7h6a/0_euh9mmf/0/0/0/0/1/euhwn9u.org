  This is such a small fraction of the total Slytherin population

Not one Slytherin student asked to stay and fight. No one objected to being thrown out. Not a single one. That says a lot about that house. We also have no Slytherin stand up for a non-Death Eater at any point in the series. No one calls out Malfoy on his actions. No one goes to talk to Harry.

Also, Umbridge, arguably the evilest character in the series (as she is the one who does Voldemort's mass deportations WITH GLEE), was sorted there and she was not a Death Eater.
