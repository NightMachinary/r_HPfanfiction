I mean, I'd be aboard the first plane out of Heathrow the day after his return, but apparently crossing borders is beyond the ability of wizards. Just look at Edward Tonks, Dean and all the others who did not use their instant teleportation to get out of the country. Hell, it would have been smart to base the Horcrux hunt out of France or the Low Countries, but that's another debate.

But the point stands, not one Slytherin did anything ever, not when Malfoy called for racial purges at 12, not when he was a bastard about buckbeak or during GoF. No one stood up.
