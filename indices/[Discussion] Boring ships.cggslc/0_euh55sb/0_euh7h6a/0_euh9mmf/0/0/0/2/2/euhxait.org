Right now, we know of Narcissa (neutral at best, pretty much unknown), Andromeda (decent), Bellatrix (evil), Walburga (evil), Sirius (good), Regulus (evil, but quit over his slave suffering), Orion (put up with Walburga, so not good), the parents of the Black sisters (who did not stand up for Andromeda as far as we know). Everyone else is a name only at best, and that does not make them good. There was an environment which bread the likes of Walburga and Bellatrix, and that did not come out of nowhere.
