Do the books EVER say Hagrid was a Gryffindor? I don't recall them doing so, if I'm wrong, please tell me WHERE the say so. In CoS Tom Riddle, Slytherin Prefect, finds Hagrid with Aragog in Hagrid's Dorm Room. If said dorm room is not in Slytherin how did a Slytherin Prefect get into them? If a third-year Hagrid was not a Slytherin, why would Riddle know his first name and how would he learn about Aragog?

You are moving the goalposts: other people are saying not every Slytherin was bigoted, you say that example isn't good enough, that's a side character. They/we are not whitewashing the house, we're pointing out that it has good people in it, and it is not an inherently evil house. Also, there are plenty of not Slytherin bigots.
