As far as I remember in The Changeling most of the Slytherin students where still pricks with the only ones being different the ones that Ginny regularly interacted with. I think this would be similar to canon just in the opposite. Harry doesn't interact with that many people at all in the books and the only Slytherins that he spends any time with are Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. The only Slytherins that get any time spent on them apart from that are generally Death Eaters. This is such a small fraction of the total Slytherin population. I believe that all of the others are basically normal people who aren't going to go out of there way to fight Harry or otherwise be a dickhead.
