Hagrid was literally lying though. He knew at the time that Sirius was a Gryffindor and also Voldemort's right-hand man. Your only back up that Hagrid isn't a Slytherin is JKR said so in an interview. She also said the last word in the books was going to be 'scar', so we know she can be wrong. The books give evidence that Hagrid dormed in the same house as Riddle, and never once mention his house. What's in the books is canon. Everything else is up for debate.
