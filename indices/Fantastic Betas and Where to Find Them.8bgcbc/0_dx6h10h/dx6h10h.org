Wow. First off, congrats on 5000 reviews. If you want, I can help out with grammar and spelling. I'm currently on holiday right now and will be for the next 7/8 days or so, and don't have access to a laptop, which I prefer using, but I'm interested, and if you wish so, you can send me part of a document to look over and see if you're happy with that? Just reply to this comment if you're willing to give me a try?
