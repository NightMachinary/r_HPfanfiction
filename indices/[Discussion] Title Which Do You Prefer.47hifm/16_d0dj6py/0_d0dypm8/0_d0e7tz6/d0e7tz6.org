Its appropriate to promote your first chapter (or set of chapters, basically whatever you publish at first). After that, avoid *new* promotions except at major milestones: you finished a school year in a multi year fic, you completed the story, etc.

Its would be fine to post a comment in your original promotion when you have completed chapters if you wish, though most of the time people that care would have just followed your story.

We like to support the authors in our community, but we don't want the feed flooded with self promotions. Keep that in mind and you should be fine.
