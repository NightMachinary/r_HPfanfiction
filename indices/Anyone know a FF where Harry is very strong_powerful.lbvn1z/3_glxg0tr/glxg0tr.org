[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]], a complete story, has Harry take on some non-human abilities and some physical changes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could][The Little Veela That Could]], again, a complete story, has the first chapter end with the statement:

Don't worry, he gets better, and its *not* a do-over fic, no time travel involved.
