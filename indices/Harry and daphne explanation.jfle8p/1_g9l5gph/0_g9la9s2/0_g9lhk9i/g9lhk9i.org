That's why I said "as far as we know." But maybe it would have been more accurate to say that she's the Slytherin girl in Harry's year who isn't known to be awful or unattractive. I didn't realize that the fact that she was in Slytherin didn't come from the books though. Although I think the fact that she was never mentioned in the DA does make it reasonable, though not guaranteed, to assume she was in Slytherin.
