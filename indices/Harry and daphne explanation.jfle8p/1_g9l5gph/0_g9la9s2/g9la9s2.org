  Canonically, she is just a Slytherin girl in Harry's year who, as far as we know, is not awful (Pansy) or unattractive (Millicent Bulstrode)

Actually we don't know anything like that. She is mentioned in whole heptalogy just once (Order of the Phoenix, chap. 30, O.W.L.S.):

  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and /Daphne Greengrass/. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

That's it. She is never mentioned anywhere else. Nobody ever mentioned her looks or behaviour. Yes, she is never mentioned among the Draco Malfoy's group, but that's all we can say.
