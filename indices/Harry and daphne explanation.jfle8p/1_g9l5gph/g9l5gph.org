Canonically, she is just a Slytherin girl in Harry's year who, as far as we know, is not awful (Pansy) or unattractive (Millicent Bulstrode). "Less canon" sources like Pottermore also tell us that the Greengrasses are one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and that her sister Astoria eventually married Draco.

Beyond that, she's a completely blank slate for authors to work with. And the idea of Harry getting together with a Slytherin is one a lot of people are interested in for a variety of reasons. And she is usually the best option for those stories.
