Oh one of them comes from a Wrong boy who lived Universe (the Slytherin or Ravenclaw) and has a superiority complex.

The Hufflepuff was the Neville of that universe and grew up cowardly and not the boy who lived he is generally helpful but when it comes to betrail he is unforgiving. He killed Nagini in the Final Battle and is the magically most powerful out of the Harry's but hides it out of fear of the others. He wants the Harry that they are raising to be braver than him and have more confidence.

Depending on whoever was not the WBWL

The Slytherin was a Sudo dark lord who had no problem killing and selling out his "friends" killed both Dumbledore and Voldemort is and thinks of himself as a god amongst men because of that but is the magically second weakest of the group. His only friend in his universe was Snape and he has to come to terms that this universe Snape hates the little Potter. He wants the little Potter to grow up to rule magical Brittan like the god that he is.

The Ravenclaw Harry was the heir of basically all of the Houses of Hogwarts and took all of the titles of the Deatheaters he imprisoned Dumledor after the manipulative old goat's plan to make him a Puppet of the greater good backfired. As the Heir/Lord of all the houses, he was the most Magically powerful person in his own universe but is the weakest of the Harry's but knows the most about Magic he can't use half of the magic he was used to he also doesn't like to share his knowledge with others. He wants young Harry to basically be a mini-me and pull of the same thing he did back home.

The Griffindor Harry is a carbon copy of the Original Harry that just wanted for Harry to grow up loved by those around him and to not live with the Dursleys. He is the magically Second most Powerful. He trusts very easily but is not influenced by those around him He is also the only one that has any Baby experience because he raised Teddy in his own universe for a year before he executed his time-travel plan. He doesn't like his fame and is hesitant to use his magic to harm others and lives by the stun and disarm rule of Dumbledore. As previously mentioned he wants Harry to grow up loved and to prevent him from living through the same hardships he had to go through.

The power difference between the Harrys is due to the Magic levels in the separate universes the universe they all traveled to has an even higher Magic concentration than Hufflepuff Harry's universe therefore everyone is more Powerful here than back home.

Hufflepuff Harry is about as strong as Dumbledore In this Universe. Griffindor Harry is around as Powerful as Hermione or Mcgonegal or Snape here. Slytherin Harry is around as powerful as Ron here (which he takes as a personal insult). Ravenclaw Harry compares to Crabbe and Goyle put together (so still significantly lower than the rest)

Baby Harry is about as powerful as the other Harrys put together chaos ensues once he reaches his schooling age because by then only Griffindor and Hufflepuff Harry can compare to him in Magic power he also isn't the Heir to any other houses than Potter and later Black.

Have fun
