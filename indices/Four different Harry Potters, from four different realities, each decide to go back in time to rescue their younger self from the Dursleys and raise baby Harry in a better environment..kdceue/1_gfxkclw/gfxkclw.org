Okay, the chaos about raising Harry between the four of them would be funny enough. But what if there were other things that changed in the different universes too. Like, after they figured the basics out, Gryffindor Harry says: "We have to free Sirius."

And it turns out the Potters weren't all betrayed by Pettigrew.

In one universe it was actually Sirius who betrayed them - because he was actually the spy (maybe taking the dark mark to save his little brother, because in that universe the abuse of their mother bound them together instead of driving them apart) and in another universe it was Remus who betrayed them (maybe because after everyone already though he was a traitor and to be sold out to the ministry he run to the werewolfes for help). In one universe there was actually a evil!Dumbledore who tried to only use Harry and even enhanced the abusive ways of the Dursleys to break him. Now they have the problem to figure out who is an ally and who is a danger for little Harry.
