How about, the four Harrys are:\\
Gryffindor: Dragon Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay]].\\
Slytherin: Elf-raised Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To The Waters and The Wild]].\\
Ravenclaw: Seer Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4966520/1/The-Inner-Eye-of-Harry-Potter][The Inner Eye of Harry Potter]].\\
Hufflepuff: Lazy Harry from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]].\\
 \\
So, a slightly-odd all-loving overpowered Harry, a Harry who consults the spirits for direction on everything, a Harry who puts a phenomenal amount of work into being lazy, and a Harry who's pretty normal aside from being a dragon (and is rather bemused by the whole thing).
