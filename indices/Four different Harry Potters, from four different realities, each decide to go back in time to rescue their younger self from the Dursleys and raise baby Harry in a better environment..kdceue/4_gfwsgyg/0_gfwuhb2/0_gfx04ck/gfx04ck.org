However, despite Slytherin!Harry being called a dark wizard, it turns out he was more along the lines of morally ambiguous and the whole 'dark' thing about him was that he was fine with using some really messed up spells and dirty tactics, but he draws the lines at actually hurting innocents.

Gryffindor!Harry, on the other hand, seems to be off somewhere most of the time and former death eaters and not quite yet deatheaters are going missing. Turns out that he's torturing them in a small prison complex he built just to keep them alive and contained, but he only uses spells and objects that are deemed as 'not dark'.

Also Ravenclaw!Harry is experimenting with some real shady shit. Hufflepuff!Harry just has a weed garden in his suitcase.

Moral of the story kids, evil isn't always what it seems to be, even when it claims to be simple.
