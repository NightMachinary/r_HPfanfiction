Time Travel is my favorite trope for Snape/Hermione. A few of my favorites are:

linkffn(An Unwritten Future by Aurette)

linkffn(For All Intents and Purposes by rhiannonofthemoon)

linkffn(Thirty-One Days by keelhaulrose)

linkffn(Fade to Grey by marianne le fay)

linkffn(Second Time Around by Witch Nova) <-Snape is deaged in the present so not a true time turner fic

The grand daddy Time Travel fic is linkffn(Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh). I only thought this fic was only okay as it dragged on way too long for me (it's 555k words long).

With Pride of Time, the author wrote a new story that is a split from Pride that is called linkffn(Divide of Time by Anubis Ankh) where I believe Hermione stays in the past (I haven't read it).
