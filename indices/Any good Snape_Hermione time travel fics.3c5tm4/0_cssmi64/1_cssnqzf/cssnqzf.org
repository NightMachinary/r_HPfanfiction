I recently read Pride of Time and Divide of Time for the first time. I highly recommend both. Hermione stays in the past in both. The difference is in one she catches up to her timeline and re-assimilates herself into it, where she left off. The second she doesn't and goes "missing" from her original timeline. The way she does so is interesting, so I won't spoil it, but OP - read these two! Totally worth it.

Edit: I've also read the fics by Aurette and keelhaulrose. They're two of my fave authors, so check those out too.
