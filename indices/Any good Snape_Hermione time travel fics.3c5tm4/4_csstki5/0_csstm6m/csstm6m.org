  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Ancient and Noble House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.
