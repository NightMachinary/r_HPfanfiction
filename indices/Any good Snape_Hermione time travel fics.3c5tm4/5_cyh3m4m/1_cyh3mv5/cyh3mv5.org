  Each morning Hermione wakes in either 1997 or 1977. She has Severus Snape as a friend, and it all seems like a dream until Professor Snape tells her to stay away from his 1977 self. The teen version of Severus is becoming much too interested in Hermione for the Professor's liking and the relationship means consequences in the present as well.

  For Hermione it happened 5 minutes ago, but for Severus almost two decades have passed.

  Hermione and Harry have the chance to change the world, though things aren't always what they seem. It is a time turner story but give it a chance. Also a HG SS ship. A bit a/u all things considered. Chapter 34 is up!

  After the 2nd Wizarding War, Hermione works as an apprentice at Hogwarts where Severus is still the Potions Master. She performs a time-turner experiment using Severus in the demonstration, and things go horribly wrong. Follow the pair as they arrive in various times, in unfamiliar roles, and try in vain to come back home while learning about each other and their true feelings.

  He wanted to rip her apart. He wanted to tear the knowing smile from her face and swallow it whole. Each night Severus spent in the library with the new Gryffindor was a night he had to restrain himself. She was a fool for straying from her pack.
