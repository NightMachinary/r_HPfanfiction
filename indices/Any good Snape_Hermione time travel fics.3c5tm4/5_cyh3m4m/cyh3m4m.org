Every fic that [[/u/Dimplz]] recommended are great, although I personally /adore/ Pride of Time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2872305/1/The-Library]]) has a brief ship of RLHG, but that doesn't last. It also has a sequel, which is incomplete.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/176923]]) is a oneshot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9234232/1/Do-You-Have-The-Time]]) has Hermione going back-and-forth through two time periods.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596014/1/Time-s-Fool]]) is unique in that both Severus and Hermione travel to the past and live through major history events.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3135350/1/This-Is-The-Way-The-World-Ends]]) has both Harry and Hermione going back in time.
