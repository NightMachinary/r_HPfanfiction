Its pretty much how you said it. Its going to be a group AMA, and if you're still interested in being a part of it (Because I'd love to have you since your stories were actually one of the first I ever read on FFN), drop a comment on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5evxyt/author_ama_announcement/][this post]].

We have 2 more spots empty, and I'm taking submissions from that post.
