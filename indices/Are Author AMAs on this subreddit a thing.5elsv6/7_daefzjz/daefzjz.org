Yeah, it could be a group AMA even. Like, several authors could sign up/volunteer to answer questions several days before the AMA. Then people could post a bunch of questions in a designated thread and various authors could come in and go through and answer stuff.

There could be 'general' questions for any of the authors to answer, and author specific questions.

I'd be game for answering stuff if anyone actually gave a crap. Not sure anyone would.
