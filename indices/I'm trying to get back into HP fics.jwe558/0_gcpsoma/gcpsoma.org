Fandoms are about much more than their creators. I love the world of Star Trek, despite the fact that Gene Rodenberry's treatment of women was...problematic...as well as several other things I won't get into. But Star Trek is about much more than Roddenberry, and the fandom has transcended a lot of the original flaws of the work. In fact, instead of statically accepting the vision of its creator, the Star Trek fandom opened up several moral and intellectual dialogues, some of which still rage today. And I daresay that this not only made the fandom better, but it made the people in the fandom better by engaging them in truly considering the issues from different perspectives, regardless of their ultimate conclusions.

Creators send their vision out into the world, but what truly breathes the life into that vision is the fans' /engagement/ with the source material. JKR created the vision for Harry Potter, but it's we, the fans, who determine and shape the Harry Potter world via our engagement in it.

I know many people are disappointed by some of JKR's views and don't want to engage with the Potter world anymore. That's their right, but I do think it's a shame.

Anyway, welcome back to the fandom. I'm glad to have you.

To your specific request, I wish I could make a recommendation, but my jam is more het and slash. But I know there are plenty of great fics out there with what you're looking for, which just goes to prove that JKR is not the absolute ruler of this fandom! We don't have to listen to whatever edicts she is handing down from her imagined throne. ðŸ˜‰
