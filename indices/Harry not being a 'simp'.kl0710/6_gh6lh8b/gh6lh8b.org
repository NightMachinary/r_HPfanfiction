I hate harry Hermione fics where they are paired before Hogwarts like commonly millions of people live in UK. It can't be just magic or soulmate thingy that they are like bumping and connecting and harry is taken in by Grangers or Grangers are super cool muggle parents who are not even portrayed properly in books.
