Because it simply isn't. Even if you decided every single time Harry had feelings for Hermione and either doesn't act on them or significant time passed until he finally does so counts as being a â€˜simp' (which is a fucking stupid term, btw), that still doesn't make up 'a significant portion'. Hell, it happens just as much in the other direction. Not to mention, almost uniformly the feelings are mutual towards the person doing the pining.

Harry isn't Snape.
