Since my exposure to Harmony is through Robst fics where Hermione and Harry are the power couple from the start to the end who fight against manipulative Dumbledore, then, yes, this simp Harry the way you described it above is kinda new to me. Not that I like Robst fics; even if something seems "new" in one, eventually you see that it really just followed the same formula as his other fics. If you've read one, you've read them all.
