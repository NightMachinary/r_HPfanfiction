  Every single one of those fics has Harry so goddamn obsessed with Hermione he treats her words as gospel, with Hermione being so controlling the fic would get brigaded by Tumblr if the genders were reversed.

I'm looking at the first page after sorting by favs, and I'm kind of confused how you reached that conclusion. 10 of the 25 stories are by Robst, who is infamous for having Hermione be a one-dimensional damsel in distress who only exists to fawn over OP!Harry. /What We're Fighting For, The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time, With You by My Side, When Fate Intervened, A Different Professor, Rebirth of the Founders,/ and /Reboot/ have also been similarly criticized, and I've never seen someone criticize the power dynamics in /The Reclamation of Black Magic, Harry McGonagall, Escape, The Last Casualties,/ or /Sympathetic Properties/. /Weary Wizard, The End and the Beginning, Hermione's Brilliant Idea/ are really the only ones that have the power dynamics shifted in Hermione's favor. That means Hermione has a whopping total of 3 stories on the front page where what you're saying is true, while Harry has 17. No offense, but I hardly think Tumblr would brigade those fanfics if the genders were reversed.
