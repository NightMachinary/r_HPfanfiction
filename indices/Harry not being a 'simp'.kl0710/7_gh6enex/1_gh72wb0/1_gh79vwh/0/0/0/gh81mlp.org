I don't get why Harmony shippers are so... weird most of the time. Hermione is a rather simple, upper class good-girl type character if you compare her to more or less any other girl in both canon and fanon. If it wasn't for the magic, looking over Hermione's character you'd expect her to attend bible class voluntarily. I'm definitely not saying that she has a lack of personality, because she's a decently interesting character on her own, but her fandom really doesn't seem fitting for her personality. This whole radical 'can do no wrong and you're not allowed to criticize' thing is something I'd expect of people stanning Voldemort, not Hermione, but even those guys are surprisingly chill about it.
