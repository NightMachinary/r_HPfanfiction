There's a one shot that I cannot remember the name of which plays with this.

Hermione rejects Harry's advances post war due to personal trauma. Leaves Britain entirely for many years only to come back and tell a now estranged Harry she's ready to start something. A rather nonplussed Harry then introduces Hermione to his wife, Gabrielle.

Hermione is shocked that Harry didn't wait for her. Harry doesn't think much about it at all as they have a baby on the way.
