That was truly awful.

Pointless, "happy ending" changes, heavy Ron/Weasley bashing, a Hermione that acted like she'd been kicked in the head, recovered, then been kicked in the head again and came out brain-damaged as a result, and pointless porn -- /especially/ at the end.

Who wrote that? A 13 year old?

Still, the idea of Hermione or another woman realizing that she lost out in the end is strangely delicious -- it's just the execution here was shit.
