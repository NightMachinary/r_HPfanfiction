Harry/hermione isn't my fav pairing but I think I've read quite a few. Have never come across a 'simp' fic (although this could be bc I stop reading at the first sign of being too far out of character.) Actually, I used to prefer the pairing but got sick of how many fics had the most boring "fated" sort of getting-together moment. A lot of the times it's extremely unrealistic and jarring - or the characters are way, way too young for their actions and how they are portrayed (sometimes written in a disturbing way that must be written by either an actual eleven year old or an actual pedophile and I don't care to know which). I've come to loathe the sort of hermione that falls into harry's arms and swears undying love at first kiss. Or any fic that mentions Ron's crush on Hermione to then use him as a cheap villain.
