I'm with you on this one.

If I understand correctly, the story's reasoning is that Hermione loves Harry deeply and doesn't want to hurt him, so she can't be with him. But her relationship with Krum doesn't have any deeper meaning, so it's fine. I think it's nonsense, but you can find this kind of logic in romantic fiction (not just fanfiction).
