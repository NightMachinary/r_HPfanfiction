Not a fic, but something I wrote a while ago fits...

Happy Birthday to me!\\
Happy Birthday to me!\\
Happy Birthday Lord Voldemort...\\
Mommy, why'd you leave me?

All my followers knew:\\
Those disloyal---I slew.\\
After /one/ bit of bad luck,\\
They were suddenly few.

How old am I now?\\
How old am I now?\\
Do my shadow years count?\\
I'll count them... somehow.
