I've just headcannoned that Dumbledore seduced Grindelwald and stole the wand while "defeating him" in the process to earn its loyalty. Then he created the story of his duel and implanted memories and used a few compulsions on the nearest wizards to spread the tale of his victory.

Not to say Albus wasn't a capable wizard, just to say it should have been impossible to beat Grindelwald if Grindelwald had the Elder Wand and dueled him seriously.
