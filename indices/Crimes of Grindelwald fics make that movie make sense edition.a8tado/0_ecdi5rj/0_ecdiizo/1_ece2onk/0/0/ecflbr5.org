In the original series ownership of the Elder Wand has changed without the previous owner dying or losing magically.

- Grindelwald -> defeated by Dumbledore and imprisoned for decades
- Dumbledore -> disarmed by Draco via Expelliarmus
- Draco -> disarmed by Harry Potter physically grabbing a different wand out of his hands

My verdict: The Elder Wand is a plot sensitive object that behaves however the writer(s) need it to at any given moment.
