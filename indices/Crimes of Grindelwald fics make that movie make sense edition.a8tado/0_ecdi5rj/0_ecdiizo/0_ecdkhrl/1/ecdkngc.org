Yeah you can handwave the Dumbledore thing and I understand why they changed the clothing for the movie even if I don't like it. I struggle to believe that mcgonnagal is that age but it's totally possible that umbrage got her data wrong which is where I got my guesstimate of her age from. It's just a bit messy hence my request for fics :)
