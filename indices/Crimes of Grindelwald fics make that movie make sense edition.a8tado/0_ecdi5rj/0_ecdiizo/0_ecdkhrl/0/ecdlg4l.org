  we don't actually know how old she is in canon iirc

Even if you don't consider /Pottermore/ canon (and I think most people do, at least loosely), we actually do --- or, well, we don't know how old /she/ is, but we're told how long she's been teaching at Hogwarts at one point in /Order of the Phoenix/.

  movie choice because why wear silly looking robes when everyone can look like a smartly dressed model for vogue?
#+end_quote

That explains why they made this choice, but it doesn't make it any less of a plot-hole in-universe. Of course, on that score, really the best anyone can do is throw one's hands up in the air and accept that it's just one detail of the film that really can't be canon --- otherwise we'd have to assume a random massive shift in clothing habits in the Wizarding World between the 1920's and 1990's.
