I suppose I didn't really use the right word, more discrepancies in canon, like the presence of McGonnagal, Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of transfiguration, the clothing, Tina disarming Grindewald technically making her master of the elder wand, unbreakeable curse scars, and just some small nitpicking things. I'm choosing to believe that the whole things about credence will be explained in the next movie in a way that makes it possible for him to be the age he is because that's very timeline-breaking but I'm not labelling that a plot hole because it's obviously meant to be a mystery until the next movie.
