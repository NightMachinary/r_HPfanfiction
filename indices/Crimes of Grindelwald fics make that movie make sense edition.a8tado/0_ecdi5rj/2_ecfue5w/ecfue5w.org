Not necessarily plot holes per say, but the lestrange plot was convoluted and not explained super well. Why were they going to America again, I think they mentioned it but don't really remember. And why did Leta quickly go back to Britain rather than stay in America. Why did they drop off the fake lestrange, whom everyone but leta thought was real, at an orphanage rather than the half elf lady raise him as seemed to be the original plan.

Also what was up with the magical fire dragon. How did it know who to burn and who not too, but even beyond that if we just assume Grindelwald was controlling that, why did it try to destroy all of Paris when he left. That doesn't seem like it would be useful at this point for Grindelwald's cause.
