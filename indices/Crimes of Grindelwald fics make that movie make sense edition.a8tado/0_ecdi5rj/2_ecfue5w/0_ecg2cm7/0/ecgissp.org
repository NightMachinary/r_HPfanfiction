It could be Fiendfyre, but I thought Fiendfyre would burn anything it touched, not allow anything to walk through it. Though it has never been explained in detail so I guess retconing it to not burning what the caster doesn't want to burn is possible.

However had Flamel not been there to tell everyone they needed to contain it, I don't know that they would have been able to, so counting on then to do so seems like a bit of a risk.
