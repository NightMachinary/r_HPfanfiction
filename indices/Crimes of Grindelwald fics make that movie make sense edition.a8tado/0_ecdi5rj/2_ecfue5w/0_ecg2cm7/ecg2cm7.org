The fire looked like Fiendfyre to me. Grindelwald should be strong enough to control it as long as he is there and he can be fairly certain, that the aurors can keep it in check afterwards.

I feel like the whole Lestrange plot is filled with Grindelwalds lies, so we might have to wait for the series to continue for more answers.
