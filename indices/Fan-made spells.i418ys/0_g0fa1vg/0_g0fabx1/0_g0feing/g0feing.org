I'm not good with names so maybe you can change those as you see fit XD

Aero : Cast a blast of wind - much like incendio does for fire.

Clousto : Makes targets finger/toe nails grow really fast.

Cluthe: Gives the target leg cramps /charlie horse in muscles.

Bonscy: Allows you to bond two untouching items together, such that if you move one the other moves in the same way despite the distance between them. i.e. Pick up a pencil on your desk and one on your friends desk moves the same way.

Ventriliquo : Allows you to cast your voice as if coming from the direction your wand is aimed.

Elmekia : small lightning blast that can pass through protego shields.

Otium: stasis charm. Preserves current status of an item. Cast on potions/food to keep them at proper temperatures/ stop potions from mixing if you have to leave.

Illusio : projects a silent image from your mind. ~hologram

Harmic: Alters vibrations between two objects such that they can occupy the same space without interfering with one another. could hide an object perfectly within a rock, or even cast on a person to have them walk through walls.

Perceptio: increase/decrease perception of time.
