Here are some nasty ones from my doc of spells

Perfora corporis- "perforate the body", fires several piercing attacks aimed to puncture vital organs.

Excorio carnes- "peel the flesh", flaying curse.

Conturbatio- "panic/disaster", causes mass hysteria, confusion and impending sense of doom. Best result when cast in crowded area.
