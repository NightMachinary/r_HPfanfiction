Thanks so much. I think it's a combination of fluff and light hurt comfort.

The more I write of a competent adult helping, the more I feel bad for canon Harry. He really only had Hermione and Ron to help him through most of the books and even though Sirius was trying to help he had so many limits on what he could do because of his situation.

I've written most of the fourth year, so that should go to my beta next month, I have year back from my beta and I'm doing one last pass before I start posting.

Essentially this is an AU where James' last name is Snow instead of Potter.

Basically, what happened is Rachel and Harry originally started out as two different characters when I was writing this fic, but as I was drafting it I realized they were occupying the same space in the story so I merged them. I decided to keep the name Snow as an homage to a teacher who saved my life. She's passed on now, but I like to remember her in any way that I can.
