I caught up on the latest chapter just half an hour ago, and it was great! I must admit, a Harry that actually has a competent adult to depend on (and does so) was quite cathartic to read.

Plus, I'd just finished a fairly intense fic before I found these, so it was nice reading a calmer, fluffier (does this count as fluff? ...I'm pretty sure it does) fic afterwards.

I have to ask though: /why/ change her surname from Potter to Snow? Was it for the sake of the title? Is there a hint I missed somewhere? It's been driving me crazy. (Not so much the name change itself, but the fact that I might be missing a plot point/implication somewhere.)

Anyway, it's very well written and excellently paced, so I'm really glad to see that there is this much written that has yet to be posted.
