linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) thou is summund!!

Come thine fic that tends on tropes done in a different way!. Thrill me here and fill me from the crown to toetop full of adventure and mystery! Make thick thine excitement, stop up access and passage to 1978, that Harry should visit thine time with a new adventure in his heart.

Bring me laughter and pain and daring and pirates. For this fic is one none others shall surpass.

I give you my troth, this is a fic fit for the kindles of the gods.
