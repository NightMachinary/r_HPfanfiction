Not a spoiler for you but a spoiler for others The Squib Trial at the start was weirdly tense. Abs death properly killed me. I had to put my phone down and take a second. I completely adored the Pirates. Everything about the Azkaban Prison break was fucking brilliant.

I'm so glad you enjoyed it!!! Its my favorite fic. I cannot believe you read it after a rec written in Shakespeare ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ thanks for giving it a go!
