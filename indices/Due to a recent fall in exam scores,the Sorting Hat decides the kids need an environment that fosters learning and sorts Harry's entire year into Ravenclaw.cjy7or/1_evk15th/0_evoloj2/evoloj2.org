The whole house bullying Harry, and Sprout kind of encouraging it, doesn't exactly scream great learning environment and I normally love Hufflepuff.

Honestly, if you leave aside Luna getting bullied Flitwick seems by far the best professor & head of house. And I say this as someone who likes most of the professor characters....

Snape: ex-criminal who belonged to a hate group (Dumbledore never goes "gee, I wonder if this will make any muggleborns uncomfortable in his class") who basically bullies children.

Minerva: thinks it is absolutely fine to send a bunch of children in the night into a place called the "Forbidden Forest." Should be looking out for her kids---but does nothing about the fact that Harry is clearly too skinny and wearing rags. Let's kids be ostracized and vastly overreacts with her punishments.

Sprout: the whole GOF mess.
