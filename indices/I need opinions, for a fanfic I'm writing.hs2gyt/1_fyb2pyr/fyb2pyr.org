Go and write your story, but be sure to have written enough of it (meaning the best would be all) before you publish it, because writing negative character as your main persona is extremely difficult. C S Lewis wrote somewhere that The Screwtape Letters are so short mainly because he just couldn't stand to write Screwtape character any more, because the disgust would choke him.
