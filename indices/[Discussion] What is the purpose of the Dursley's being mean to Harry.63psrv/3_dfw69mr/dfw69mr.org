Here's the thing. Wizarding Britain is stuck in the freaking stone ages. As long as they're not actively murder-ating Harry, the wizarding world won't do dick all to his legal guardians exercising their rights to discipline their child. Period. They won't get involved.

The thing about CPS is that parents lie. Frequently. As long as there's no outward signs of physical abuse (bruising, cuts, malnutrition) CPS won't do anything. I've had adopted friends who tell stories of their adoptive parents telling them that their birth mother was a whore, a drug dealer, and died of overdose. (It surfaced yeeeeeears later, that the mother had died of cancer. Cancer. Something that would have been VERY HELPFUL to tell someone, so that they know to tell their doctor about family history, both for her and her kids.) That because the birth mother was trash, that so is she. She wasn't allowed to have any freedoms at all, and had to do ridiculous amounts of chores. Her adopted mother showed up at the trial of her abusive ex husband to TESTIFY AGAINST HER. The judge took away her baby.

One thing that JK Rowling knows all too keenly is poverty, and what happens to children of poor people. If you haven't met such petty, nasty, small-minded people, I pray that you continue to live in ignorance of it. Whether or not it's a trope, or whatever, I think a big part of it is JK Rowling putting a story out there where all the adults seem to think a child is fine with his legal guardians, and that nasty disgusting abuses that don't leave marks can go on behind closed doors.

Again, this hits a little close to home, because I've seen how shitty adults can be towards children, so I apologise if I'm coming off as curt or rude. It's not at all my intention! I am happy you brought up this topic to discuss, because it's a well worded, well thought out post for sure.
