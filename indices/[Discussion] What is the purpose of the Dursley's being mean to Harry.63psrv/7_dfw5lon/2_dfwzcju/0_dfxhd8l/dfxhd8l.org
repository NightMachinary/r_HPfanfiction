Was what happened in the books absolutely awful, and did it show the Dursleys to be awful people? Yes, and it was certainly abusive. It was never my intent to claim otherwise.

My claim is that the government authorities would not have gotten involved unless there was /substantial/ evidence of repeated physical abuse, which is not present in canon. Lethargy is the nature of bureaucracy, unless shocked into movement. The emotional and the mental abuse he underwent probably wouldn't make the cut.

I believe the 'forcing him to get worse grades' is a fanfiction trope - I don't remember that being discussed in the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone, where most of the other abuse is discussed. I could be quite wrong about that, though, so please correct me if I am.
