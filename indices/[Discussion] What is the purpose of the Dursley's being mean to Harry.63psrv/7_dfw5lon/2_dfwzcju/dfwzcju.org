You're right that fanfiction exaggerates the abuse, but its all still abuse. Locking him in a cupboard is abuse. Especially if he goes without food while in there. Locking him in the bedroom was abuse. Refering to him as "boy" and "freak" is psychological abuse. Excessive chores is abuse. Attempting to keep him from going to school is a form of neglect called educational neglect and is also considered abuse. Forcing him to get worse grades than his cousin at the risk of being punished is also education neglect, and therefore abuse.

I hate when people downplay what happened in the books as not that bad. If Harry was a real kid, the Dursleys would be arrested. Fanfics go overboard, that's true, but the books are awful when you see them through the eyes of an adult.
