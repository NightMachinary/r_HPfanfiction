Yes, it would change Harry's life and time at Hogwarts. Not much, but some. Major events would probably not have changed.

Why was it done? It was done to create conflict in the early chapters and give the reader a tangible target for dislike (later replaced by Malfoy and Snape). It generates sympathy for the protagonist that makes it more likely for the reader to continue reading past the opening chapters.

Vernon Dursley does indeed have a grudge against wizards (in particular, James Potter). By all accounts, Vernon might have been even slightly more rotten then Petunia.

Keep in mind, fanfiction GREATLY exaggerates the abuse that Harry underwent at the hands of the Dursleys; it's an unfortunate trope. I can't think of anything in canon that they did that would have allowed the British equivalent of CPS ( I don't even know if they have a national agency for that) to get involved, at least by most standards. Locking a child up for extended periods of time does not, as far as I know, merit the involvement of government services, so long as that child is otherwise provided for.
