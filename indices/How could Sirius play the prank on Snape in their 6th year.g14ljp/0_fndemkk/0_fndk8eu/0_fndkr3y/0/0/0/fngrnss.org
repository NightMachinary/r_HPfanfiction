Yeah I find that so interesting, I read a lot of fanfic about the prank and the marauders all hate Sirius for ages but depending on the time frame it seems to me they probably moved on quite quickly - however, I wouldn't be suprised if Remus held some resentment about it deep down, to me he seems the type to just internalise things instead of conflict or maybe he just loved having friends he was willing to forgive anything because jk Rowling said he was a â€˜ lonely boy' growing up
