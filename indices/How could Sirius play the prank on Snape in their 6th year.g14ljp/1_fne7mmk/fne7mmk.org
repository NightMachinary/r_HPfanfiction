We only know 2 things about this prank, it happened when Sirius was 16 (since Snape say that he was capable of murder at that age), and it happened before Snape memory.

Since we know that Sirius was born in November 1959 (though not sure it's clearly said in canon) and that the OWL happen around May or June, we can determine that the even happened between these 2 dates. Personally, I would say it was either in February or March 1975 (Lily was fed up with Snape story about Lupin so it could not be too fresh when they split up).
