I dont know the legality of it all but people do commissions. A few years ago, I saw someone on Tumblr who has a six month waiting list and since their commissioned works take precedence over their own WIPs, she's telling people if they want another chapter, they have to pay for it...and people were. A few blogs I followed had KoFi, buy someone a coffee, and they would submit a prompt and the prompt would usually be written as a drabble or one-shot

my understanding from a few threads i read is that is that it's legal to take money for fanfic commissions, because they're just paying for your time/expertise in writing them. This is similar to how fan artists take commissions. BUT it's illegal to "sell" a fanfic to multiple people - ie, you write the fic/chapter, then people pay to see it/for you to post it.
