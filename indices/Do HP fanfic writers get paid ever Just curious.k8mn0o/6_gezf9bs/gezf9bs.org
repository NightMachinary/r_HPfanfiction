Ao3 makes a point of mentioning they are a non-profit site but i see some authors linking a Patreon in their notes section not exactly saying 'give me money' but its there if people were inclined to.

Also I see people saying 'this was a commission' a lot these days money is involved behind the scenes but you are not directly allowed to ask for payment you have to be Weasley (pun intended) about it. Like people are paying you because they like you not for your actual work haha
