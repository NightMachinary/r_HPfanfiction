Are you certain? I thought that it was the opposite, that JKR had a history of going after fanfic writers. So many fics set in the Harry Potter universe or that use the characters start with a disclaimer that no $ is being made off the work (I have seen lots that are semi-serious appeals directly to JKR). I have never seen these same sorts of disclaimers or appeals in any other fandoms that I read fic from. However, these are older HP fics (5+ years old) on FFN - maybe she's loosened up?
