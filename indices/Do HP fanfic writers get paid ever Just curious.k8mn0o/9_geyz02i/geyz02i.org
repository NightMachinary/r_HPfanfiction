Ok. To everyone saying that it's illegal to get paid for, and a gray area to write.

Ms. Rowling (the person who owns the copyrights to HP) said that as long as no one charged for it, it was fine. This makes writing it fine. Can't argue with the copyright holder. And, if you don't charge for it, you can make money off it. Ads and such.
