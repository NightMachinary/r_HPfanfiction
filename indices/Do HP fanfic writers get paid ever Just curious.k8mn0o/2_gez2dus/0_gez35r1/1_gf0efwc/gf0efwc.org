While fanfics authors can't be (legally) paid for their fics (even though they can be "supported" by Patreon or other means), the more "serious" authors usually use fanfics to hone their skill. It's not very rare for the most talented one to have publised their own books on the side, sometimes even a reworked version of their fanfics (50 shades of gray beinh the best known example).
