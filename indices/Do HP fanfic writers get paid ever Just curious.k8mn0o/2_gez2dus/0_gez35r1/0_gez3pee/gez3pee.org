I know what you mean. There are a few authors I would give a few bucks to, because their stories are so hauntingly lovely and thought provoking and you know they must have sank so many hours into producing something like that.

However, in my experience the Venn diagram between these authors and the ones with Patreon accounts almost never overlap, so... 🤷🏻‍♀️
