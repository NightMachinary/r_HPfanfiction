Yes and no. I don't think you can be paid directly for a specific fanfiction, but fanfic authors have been known to solicit funds for Patreon accounts and the like. That way, you're not buying a specific story, just supporting them so that they can concentrate on their “art”.

It was kind of distasteful for me, but I guess they earned enough to make it worth their while. Just be warned that for those that go this route, they have to churn out popular mass-market fanfic to appeal to as many people as possible. They're no longer an artist, they're an assembly line.

Again, not my thing, but I try not to judge if it's legal.
