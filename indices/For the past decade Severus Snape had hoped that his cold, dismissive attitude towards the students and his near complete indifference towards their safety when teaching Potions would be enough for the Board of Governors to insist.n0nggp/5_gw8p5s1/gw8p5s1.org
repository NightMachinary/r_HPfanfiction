I've seen some ideas floated that teaching at Hogwarts involves a magically binding contract of sorts.

It would be an interesting Grey!Voldemort Good Manipulative!Dumbledore kind of setting if Hogwarts, and all other magical schools, are a trap for the powerful. Dumbledore and Armando Dippet knew that the Ministry needed to be destroyed, so they refused to allow Riddle to teach at Hogwarts because it would bind him with oaths and obligations he could never break. Riddle was a genius, but he was still an orphan in the muggle world, he didn't understand what they were doing because he had no context, he wasn't of pure blood so he had no chance of knowing the secret history of the magical world. He thought Dippet and Dumbledore were jilting him, when in reality they were trying to save him and give him permission to wage his war.

Now Snape is enslaved, just like every other truly powerful witch or wizard with the strength of one of the Lords of old. He teaches during the day, and drinks every night, and regrets everything.

And when Snape realizes that Dumbledore is trying to manipulate Harry Potter into staying away from the magical world and distrusting all of it's authority figures, he realizes that the best way to apologize for what he did to James and his betrayal of Lily would be to help.

So he does everything he can to make their powerful, but FREE and UNBOUND, son, absolutely */hate/* his time at Hogwarts. He can't let the golden wonder and joy of magic that sang to him when he first saw the school be the siren call that leads Harry to his doom.

Harry will hate him. Harry will hate Albus. Harry will hate them all.

Good. It's for the best. He can hate us all as a free man.

And then the International Confederation of Wizards brings the goblet to the school. And Severus Snape knows true terror for the first time since he saw the unbound might of a werewolf as a teenager. Because he knows what the goblet can do. He and Albus both know.

And Harry's name comes out of the goblet. And it feels like the world is ending, because the boy has been caught, he's been bound at last. Those pathetic, sniveling, greedy, cowardly, thrice-damned, pencil necked, simpering sons of inbred whores got him. They got Lily's son, they caught the last thing James, who he grudgingly came to respect, left behind in this world.

He had failed at everything, and now he failed at this, too.

But then Voldemort, reborn from a cauldron in a graveyard, wants to have a little chat with Harry Potter.

And everything changes.
