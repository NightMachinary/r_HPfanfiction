Having a tiger mum sucks ... I'have experienced it firsthand. But when you are in an environment where every single parent does this it became normalised where in western culture this would be widely condemned as abuse. But tiger mums do still love their children by the Chinese saying 打是爱骂是疼 which translate to basically use the rod to love the child and scold him to love him etc. It is a thing that should be changed but would probably not due to Asian culture. I have seen some who became very successful and some who gets broken by this type of parenting so it mainly depends on the child. In my opinion this type of parenting would be much more beneficial for Harry as children under the age of ten needs to have the discipline and drilled to be hardworking at everything he does to meet the challenges that Morty poses to him.
