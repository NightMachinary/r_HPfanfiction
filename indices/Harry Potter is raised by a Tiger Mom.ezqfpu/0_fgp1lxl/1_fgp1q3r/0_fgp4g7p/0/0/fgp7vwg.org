What you copied from Wikipedia is the essence of psychological abuse by the parents. I don't want to say that all those "tiger moms" do it on purpose, but it is definitely abuse. The way you want the question to be understood, indicates that this way of upbringing is acceptable, which it is not. Especially because most of those parents do not act like that because of their children's potential but want to project their children's future accomplishments onto themselves.

Whether it is a cultural thing or not, it is cruel and can definitely be labeled as abuse.
