I'd actually really want to read this. It sounds really fascinating. Honestly, it makes me crave a story where the dursleys are a full on "Tiger Household" and Harry is like the sterotypical top student from an anime, (Super smart and athletic with the odd sprinkle of emotional dysfunction) and He maintains that attitude throughout his life. I can picture Harry and Dudley being really close brothers in this setting with Dudley being a five man band style big strong emotional guy while Harry is the laser focused lean smart dude, while Vernon is a caring but somewhat distant stern father that nonethless fervently desires the best for his children and Petunia is (as the prompt says) a tiger Mom. Super stern and no nonsense when it comes to mischief and messing around, but super supportive whenever the boys do well and always pushing them beyond their limits.

The sort of thing where if anyone insulted Petunia in front of Harry or Dudley they would totally demand an instant apology (on pain of a beatdown) but at teh same time if someone insults Petunia to her face then the boys will just make sure any and all bystanders out of handbag range cause they know that their Momma doesn't take crap from anyone and could take on the gods themselves with her purse of ultimate doom.
