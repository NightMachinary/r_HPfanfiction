  Harry Potter was 'defeated' by Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts and awakens in another dimension - one where prejudice is law and the Dark Lord reigns supreme. With no way to return, Harry tries to find his place in a world far different from his own. When familiar faces don new roles, will Harry succeed in fitting in, or will he always remain a stranger?
