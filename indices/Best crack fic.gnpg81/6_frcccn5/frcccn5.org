I don;'t think it was /meant/ to be crack, but "The Student in Question" was fun back when I was a wee thing and shipped SS/HG (shut up). The sequel (prequel? uh) was fun too.\\
Can't link, sadly, as ff.net is blocked at work (its literally the only site ive seen blocked what the actual fuck? LOL )

there was also another one on ao3 that i tripped over months ago where the Twins break into Dumbledores office and confund the sorting hat. Harry and Draco end up in Hufflepuff, Ron and Milliicent Bulstrode become pals in Ravenclaw, I /think/ Susan takes either Crabbe or Goyle under her wing in Gryfindor.\\
And then it happens again next year.\\
Wish I remembered what it was called. :(
