I really enjoyed linkffn(12794018).

EDIT: Whoops, I realized after the fact that my recommendation doesn't fit your ask, because you're looking for stories where they don't end up together in the end. The story I recommended is a canon-compliant telling of Remus and Tonks' love story, which means that Lupin spends a lot of time rejecting Tonks (and briefly running away from her while she's pregnant) but they ultimately end up together. It's from his POV, so it's obviously a Lupin-sympathetic story.
