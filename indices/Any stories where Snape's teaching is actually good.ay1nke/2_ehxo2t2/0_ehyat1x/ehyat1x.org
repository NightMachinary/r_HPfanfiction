It's not really canon to say that, out of all the classes we see it's not like JKR describes all the classes, she really only goes into detail when something of relevance happens. Snakes class was probably more like a chem class with labs and since that's when all the accidents and brewing happens that's the only time she writes it. In fact, the first potions class Harry ever takes points towards Snape lecturing as a basis before brewing and then criticizing their work. Sure, he's still a massive dick when he does it but its a deeply integrated fanon concept to say that's all he does. And that's ignoring the fact that reading for homework along with numerous essays they complain about also points towards it being a respectable class just with an incredibly mean and biased professor.
