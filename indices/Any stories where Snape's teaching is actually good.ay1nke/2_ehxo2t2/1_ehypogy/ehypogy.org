Canonically they do get theoretical knowledge- IIRC we see the main characters complaining about having to write essays for Potions class, which implies that there is /some/ theoretical background that they're expected to understand, even if it's all on the application side. There are entire books on single charms, it wouldn't be odd for there to be a similar level of material available for potions. As the readers, we just don't get the specifics.
