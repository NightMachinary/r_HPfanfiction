Prince of Slytherin runs with the OWLs and NEWTs being literally the same as what he does in class. The exams are "here is instruction, now make potion," so his teaching style essentially mimics that. The potions made within the class can have volatile effects, but nothing we see isn't quickly fixed with magic. You can learn the techniques by rote and succeed in the standardized exams, which are structured in a similar manner. Learning about interactions, creating new potions and whatnot is upper level stuff for 7th year students and not actually covered in the NEWT, which is still rote creation of complex potions. This is mostly explained when Marcus asks Snape if he can take the NEWT level potions class and Snape claims that it's unnecessary if he just wants the certification from the exam.

Think of it like real life chemistry- chem students in high school learn about functional groups, naming, some stoich and math, and some basics about acids/bases and titration and whatnot. It's all rote memorization. They do some fairly limited experiments to give them broad exposure to certain topics. But learning about /why/ certain interactions happen, the theory of making new compounds from scratch, some of the more complex physics and math isn't covered until college level chemistry. And there's so much more to tackle with stuff like computational chemistry, high throughput assays, entire subfields like Physical Chem and Biochem, which are very unlikely to be mentioned at all in high school level chemistry even though those are critical to "real" chemists.

The mobile game also shows his teaching differently, but that's not exactly a high degree of canonicity.
