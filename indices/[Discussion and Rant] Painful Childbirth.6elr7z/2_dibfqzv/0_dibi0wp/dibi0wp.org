Hell, just cast that space-expansion charm on the woman's reproductive system and the baby would just slide right out.

Actually, now that I think about it, they could hypothetically cast that on the uterus during the pregnancy to keep their slim figures even while pregnant. Infinite room for the baby to grow as well.
