Like someone else said, epidurals aren't always foolproof.

For starters, there's all the contractions you have to deal with before you get the epidural. With my first, I had to walk the halls to progress further before they'd give me the epidural. I remember developing homicidal feelings towards that nurse. But I walked, squeezing my husband's hand until I thought I might break it, and after about an hour the epidural was in and I felt nothing but pressure. Even when pushing, I didn't feel much.

With my second, I was /miserable/. I didn't walk, but I did bend over a lot with the bed as support during contractions, and also sat on a birthing ball. I got to a point where it was just too much, but I hadn't progressed enough yet for the epidural, so I got IV pain meds. That took the edge off a bit, but not a lot.

At my hospital (not sure if it's a growing trend throughout the US or not) they changed up the epidurals a bit. It's a different dosage, and they put them in a bit higher. So I still had the pressure, but when it came time to push I felt a lot more, thus making it much more effective. I only pushed for 12 minutes.

Never cursed my husband though. But I was a little annoyed that with both I never had enough time to watch a movie.
