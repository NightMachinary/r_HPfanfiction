Well I'd not surprised if backwards Magical Society has never heard of an Epidural, but their healing capabilities seem quite advanced, I'd expect them to offer something with similar effects.

This is actually the field where I'd expect their superiority complex to stem from. In my headcanon problems with childbirth (like the mother dying) are unheard of in magical society.
