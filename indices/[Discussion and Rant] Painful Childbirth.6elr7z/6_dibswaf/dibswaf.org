That's interesting, because I mentioned an epidural procedure in one of my stories, but it was a muggleborn lamenting the fact that wizards didn't have one. I figure as with so many things, wizards are big time traditionalists. They might give you pain relieving potions, but at least my own experience with that kind of thing leads me to believe that pain relief only takes the edge off of such things (though I've only had rocks, not babies). I imagine that wizards and witches probably do have something to help with childbirth, but that doesn't automatically make it pleasant. Even C-Sections and epidurals are still loaded with problems as you mentioned.
