It probably happens to some people, because whatever you choose you are likely to find /someone/ doing it no matter how unlikely it is. So it likely happened at least once.

That said, all in all I think that outside of exceptions it's just a common literary trope, most likely stemming from the fact that for one people might find it funny (well, well played it can be) and for two at least in USA c-sections are fairly prevalent so people might very well have over time gotten used to the idea that normal childbirth is unbearably painful no matter what (because common sense says people wouldn't get their bodies cut for no reason ... which actually is what happens at least sometimes).
