A few things - firstly, your wife was lucky. Epidurals don't always eliminate all pain though they do heavily reduce it. I agree that it is likely that there are magical equivalents to epidurals.

But secondly, and most importantly, you've touched on something quite complex and that is different cultural attitudes to childbirth. I'm going to be long and boring here - my university dissertation was on traditional childbirth practices.

You're right that in modern China, c-sections are completely considered the norm. Childbirth is heavily medicialised, with a move away from traditional and natural practices and a heavy emphasis of doctors over midwives. In the US, c-sections and epidurals are also at an unusually high rate, but not as high as China, Singapore, etc. Amusingly, one of my participants from Singapore said she was having a c-section and choosing not to breastfeed because that's how they do it in the west. One of my British participants was going full hippy natural because "that's how they do it in Asia."

In European countries, particularly here in Britain, there is a greater emphasis on midwife led childbirth. While obviously epidurals are available, many mothers report a social pressure to "experience" Childbirth naturally, though like your wife they often quickly change their mind. However doctors and c-sections only occur if there's a problem, unless you go private, but there's a bit of a stigma against it.

Even the position women go into varies from culture to culture. British and American fanfic writers have the screaming, angry woman on her back, husband gripping her hand and healer between her legs. The World Health Organisation is very clear that this is a dangerous position for the woman to five birth in. It was developed as part of the medicalisation of Childbirth to give doctors better access, but makes things harder and more painful for the woman. They recommend squatting or on all fours, as was the historic norm. But most people writing fanfic won't have experienced that - they'll have seen birth in films, or maybe even educational videos - but the position is still the same. In addition, historically pain in Childbirth is associated with the punishment of Eve, so there's an assumption that women SHOULD suffer and that the purest births are painful and traumatic - it feeds into the idea of the self sacrificing mother after all. From a western perspective, it quickly becomes clear why women start to compete over who had the most natural, longest birth, to the point where they may even shun women who had elective c-sections. There are positives and negatives to both attitudes and all in between.

For fanfic writers, especially ones who write about Childbirth, the romanticised version of a traumatic birth with bloody sheets is probably all they have seen on TV, and it immediately turns their female character into a good mother. Logically we know this is ridiculous - by that point it's not like there's any choice in the matter - but it's become so expected that women go through agony that if they didn't, it would seem like they weren't doing it properly.
