That's really interesting. I remember that Rowling said at one point, that wizards can heal any common injuries and only hve poblems with magically inflicted ones. I never thought about it, but childbirth does belong in the former category.

My headcanon was always that the mothers magic goes a little crazy during pregnancy, due to an instinctual need to protect the child, thus making it hard or downright impossible to magically intefere with it.
