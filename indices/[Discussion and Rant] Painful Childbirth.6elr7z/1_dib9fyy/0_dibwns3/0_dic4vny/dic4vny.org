I'm with this, to some extent. Healers would probably be reticent to use spells or ingested potions on the mother, since the effect might also include the baby. There may be some salves appropriate to lubricating the exit procedure, and I could see an equivalent of the epidural being some tightly-targeted spell; a Torpeo to numb the spine below a certain point.

I think it's worth noting that midwives were accused of being witches around the time of the Statute of Secrecy being implemented. I'm thinking about a way to work that into a story somehow.
