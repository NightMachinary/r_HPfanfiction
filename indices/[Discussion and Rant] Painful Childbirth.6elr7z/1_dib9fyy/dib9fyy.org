My headcanon is that childbirth is equally simplified by magic as healing a bone, for example. Its basically "Oh, shit, my water broke" a quick trip through the Floo and an hour later you leave St. Mungos with a baby in one hand and some potions to get your intestines back in place in the other - all without any pain or possible complications.
