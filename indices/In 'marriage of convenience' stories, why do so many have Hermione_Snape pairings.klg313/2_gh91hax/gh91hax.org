It's just the easiest, quickest way to get these two characters together, since they are so different in age and positions in life.

The HGSS ones I read usually age Hermione up a bit (/using the time turner explanation of her 3rd year of classes)/ or the fanfic doesn't have them do anything explicit and just implies they get together finally after she graduates /(they have a love of the minds or deep friendship until she graduates)/. They also usually make Snape even younger than he already is, so that the age gap narrows even further. Keep in mind, that the actor who plays Snape is a TON older than book!Snape, so don't let that color your vision.

I like Hermione with Snape faaaar more than Lily because we just don't know that much about Lily. Lily feels like a Original Character to me in any fanfic because we don't know anything about her from canon. I generally don't like reading Original Characters, I like to read about Canon characters and see how the author expands them further. Hermione is the "best" canon character because (A) she's very smart and so is Snape and (B) there just aren't a lot of female characters to choose from in Harry Potter. Narcissa Malfoy or Mcgonagall are the only other females that are possibly intelligent enough to handle Snape, who aren't batshit crazy (Bellatrix). I also HATE that Hermione ended up with Ron. I didn't really like her with Harry either. Hermione is sooo smart. I always thought she would end up with a nice Ravenclaw, not the two dunces of Gryffindor. Snape is plenty intelligent enough for Hermione once you take care of the age gap issue a bit and the teacher/student issue. No, it's not canon and will never be canon, but it's a hell of a lot of FUN in the hands of a talented writer.
