  I appreciate your thoughtful response, and also think Hermione could do better than Ron. Book Snape is in his 30s, and with a lot of the marriage law fics I see the female character being 17...still a little too old. Though I think that's better than Hermione/Lucius...at least it's not her classmate's asshole father.

  I just have a hard time considering Snape actually hooking up with someone. I guess it's also him being described as greasy-haired, yellow toothed, and an asshole. So I guess I could try the 'love of the mind' stories as you put it.

  I may check those fics out. I also thought fanfiction was stupid until two months ago and since then have positively gorged on them. *Shrugs*
