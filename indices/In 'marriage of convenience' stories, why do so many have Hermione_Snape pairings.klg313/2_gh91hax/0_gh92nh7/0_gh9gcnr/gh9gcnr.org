It's definitely "love of the mind", aka the more in love you fall with someone, the more physically attractive they become. This happens a TON in real life. We females are often guided more by our emotion than the physical aspects. Also, a lot of these fics downplay those characteristics by saying it was all from Harry's POV. AKA Harry isn't attracted to guys and therefore would view Snape in the harshest light possible, unlike female students. There's also scenarios where Snape is depressed, but he gets more cheerful once he has a friend (hint Hermione awww! ;) haha) and he starts to clean himself up and doesn't look so bad afterwards

The biggest reason I think these fics were written is because of Alan Rickman. He's much better looking than book!Snape and has been voted as having the sexiest voice in history (by women). If anyone else had played Snape, I don't know if he would be as popular. When I'm reading these fanfics I'm imagining a young Alan Rickman -> go watch /Sense and Sensibility (1995)/ for a Young Alan with a velvety voice. ;) [[https://youtu.be/clTG6sYtJig?t=70]]
