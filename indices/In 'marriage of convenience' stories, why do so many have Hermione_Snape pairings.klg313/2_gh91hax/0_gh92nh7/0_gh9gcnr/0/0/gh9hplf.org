oh 100% on the Tom Felton thing. If you want people to hate your villains, you can't hire pretty people to play them LOL.

I've never been very interested in Draco myself, but he often shows up in my Snape fanfics and I usually end up liking him, although never as much as Snape. I also enjoy fanfics where Harry gets to be competent and intelligent, as long as he doesn't feel too OOC while doing so. Still Canon!Harry, just less of a dumbass, usually because Snape or Hermione is helping him out and Harry actually LISTENS to them.
