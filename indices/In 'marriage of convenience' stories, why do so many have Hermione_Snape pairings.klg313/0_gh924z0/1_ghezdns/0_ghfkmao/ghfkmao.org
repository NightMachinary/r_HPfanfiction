I have been hyperbolic in my comment (OP was only asking about marriage of convenience stories), and I apologize for insulting writers whose work I have loved. There are plenty of stories that work without the "forced interaction" (like you said: often post-war, definitely post graduation). I am now quite curious about your stories. They seem to be exactly the kind I like. :)
