I keep coming back to this comment afraid to upvote it because I was really on board with it until I paused and went "wait that ain't right" at

  That's why most Hermione/Snape stories include a forced marriage, or another situation...

and then went "HOL UP" at

  Because even the craziest shippers can't think of why they would even get them together on their own.

I have read (and written!) plenty of SSHG where they are not forced together. Especially the fluffy post-war romances where both of them have matured and and can appreciate each other a little more just for who they are.

Hell just last week I published a fic where the only point you might say they are "forced" is that Minerva tells Severus she expects him to give Hermione real advice about her apprenticeship with Slughorn if she asks for it. They manage to develop a friendly professional relationship as they deal with the aftermath in the 6 months following the war. He falls for her like a ton of bricks, but he's patient about waiting for her to be ready for more.

I've gotten some comments that this story is a fresh take, but it's certainly not /unique/ in the elements that make SSHG work as a ship. It's a lot of the same stuff you mentioned in your comment -- the not-so-sociable intellectuals with moments of light and dark who might complement each other well. Which is why ultimately I did upvote your comment. It's not entirely accurate, IMHO, but it certainly tries to add to the discussion, with only one nasty comment about the "craziest shippers" and our ability to make it work.
