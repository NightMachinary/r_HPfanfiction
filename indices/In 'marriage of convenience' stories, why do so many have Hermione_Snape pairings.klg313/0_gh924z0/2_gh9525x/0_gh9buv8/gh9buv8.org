Of the top of my head some spells have been implied to be her creation, or something she came up and not just read about: the flame in a jar (that she used to burn Snape's clothes), the Point Me spell, that spell to make the coins match each other for the DA (inspired by the Dark Mark), that mean curse on the DA sign-in list, her beaded bag with the undetectable extension charm...

As for the unsociable part, Hermione didn't make any friend for the first month, and didn't gained many more friends after Harry, Ron and their circle of friends. She doesn't even seem to get along with her dorm-mates. She's not anti-social, as in hiding in a corner. She knows people names and such, but in the books she's not as emotionally and socially aware as in the movies. She does seem to be someone who if given the choice between staying home with a boring book or going to a fun party, would pick the book every time. She'd be one of those introvert people who have been thriving with social distancing and lockdown.
