  I see your points. I can see Hermione be willing to overcome preconceptions to date a Slytherin or...idk...Zacharias smith. But a MOC makes the most sense for connecting the two.

  Does Hermione make up spells? Is she unsociable? I don't see her as unsociable, often bossy and annoying, but not the type to hide in a corner.
