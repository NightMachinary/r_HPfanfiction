The thing with this ship is that, both Snape and Hermione come up as smart, with an interest in academia rather than sport, a talent for making up spells, not very sociable, they both have a muggle background, one chose the dark side with moments of lights and the other the light side with moments of darkness. They are like a Ying and Yang couple, sufficiently similar yet different that they could make a strong durable couple, they complement each other well. That said, there is the 20 year gap, the teacher/student relationship, and the fact that Snape is an arsehole. That's why most Hermione/Snape stories include a forced marriage, or another situation where they have no other choice than to spend lots of time together. Because even the craziest shippers can't think of why they would even get them together on their own. Once they are together, the story just get momentum, but it's starting them that is an issue.

Hence the Marriage Law sub-genre. I can't remember where it's from, but I think it was a challenge on When I Kissed The Teacher Forum: the ministry sees the birth rate getting low, and forces any adult witch and wizards to get married within the year...
