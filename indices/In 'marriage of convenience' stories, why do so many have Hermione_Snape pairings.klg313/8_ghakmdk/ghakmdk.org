Another view: I often see fanfics as a way of therapeutical writing. People get into FF (and especially HP Universe) because it's a fantasy world were you create whatever you like and fit รก character in there which you also can just create how you like it. Those stories often come with problems, plots and twists that involve the real-life writers life. Writing is a way of solving and bringing problems in perspective. SSHG + forced marriage is something .... That just happens so often. A relationship or even marriage of two people not working out with each other comes up VERY often in this world. The FF could work as a problem solver for people watching their parents getting divorced - in SSHG, they surely argue with each other but at the end they will always find a way to deal with each other, even fall in love with. Could work for someone describing their own marriage, their own relationships were they Sohle can't escape and hope for a romantic ending.Hermione does represent somehow who is capable of someone who could take care of something of she wanted too. .. something motherly, something that Snape always needed from his traumatic past. Although Hermione often seems far away from emotions or empathetic- she has something that I could take for motherly. The way she cares for the boys in the trip for instance, thinks for them in case they get in trouble again. Reliable! Knows everything when you ask! Snape would need an anchor like that.

TLTR; therapeutical writing! Projecting your own problems into a fantasy story. Hermione has motherly vibes and Snape is not the typical guy for emotions, so he would choose someone who is more into rational thinking.
