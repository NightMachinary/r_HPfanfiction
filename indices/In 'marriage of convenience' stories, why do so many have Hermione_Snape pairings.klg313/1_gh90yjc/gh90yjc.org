One of the original MLC Challenges was in 2003 with the Snape/Hermione group WIKTT. It's a /very/ old trope for this /very/ popular ship from one of the /golden ages/ of the ship.

If you want a couple of good ones, two of my favorites are by miamadwyn:

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit]], Snape and Hermione are both Hogwarts professors who get married for the financial incentive. They are buddies. It's funny. If you like /banter/ you gotta read it.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/457318/chapters/787129][The Disillusion Law]], we jump to close to the ending of the implemented marriage law, where Snape is a total jerk (and everyone tells her so), and Hermione gets the damn thing repealed. It might not be your cup of tea since you want a /kind/ Snape but it does have a HEA.
