I've never liked the ship either, but I've read one or two popular ones to see what it's about. It really just seems like a way to romanticize Snape and give him a happy ending. And I think they choose hermione because she's smart, so she'll at least keep him interested in that regard, and because there's a sort of parallel with her and Lily. And also because just like Harry is pretty much an OC in fics, Hermione is the canon character that gets turned into an OC when the plot requires a female OC. (Which is a shame, really. I'd love to see all the drama that Lavender or Parvati would drudge up if they were forced to marry Snape or Sirius or Lucius Malfoy. Or god forbid, Luna fucking Lovegood. It would be beautiful chaos)

Like I said, I don't really agree with the ship either, but I think that's usually why.
