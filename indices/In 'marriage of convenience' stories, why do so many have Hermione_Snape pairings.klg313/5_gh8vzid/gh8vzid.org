Kind of unrelated, but I read a cheating Romione this week where Ron raised the kids while Hermione focused on work and her "friend"... it had no bashing and Ron just wanted to keep the kids, so that was nice. Until it's revealed the friend was effing Snape. It wasn't really important but it felt so weird to have Snape telling Ron off for easily giving up the love of his life. Kind of ruined it. I don't know about those marriages fics because I stay far from them, but at least in this one the appeal was on both being smart and working on research together.
