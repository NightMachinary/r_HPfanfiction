I'll throw out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]]. It's very rough in places, and cranks up the "abused by Dursleys" pretty high. Harry definitely gets control over his powers at an early age, and uses them to his advantage, so it fits the bill in that department. The development of Harry's character in this one is a personal favorite - ruthless, but not heartless. Relatable and flawed but incredibly tough.
