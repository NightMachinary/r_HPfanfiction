My bad about the Blacks' Princess, sorry---kinda managed to miss the “Harry” part in your request. For the time when you'll be checking it, I'll advise making your way through the first several chapters, because they are not that good. It gets better later on.

  Sacrifices... I read about 1/2 of it a while back. I don't remember why I stopped reading it.

It has some parts that wouldn't hurt to trim down, it also has a lot of soul-searching and slash. It's likely that you got bored of sifting through some of these parts and fishing out the good ones.
