See [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][HP & the Dark's Rise]] (203,172 & Complete). /(spoilers)/ Although I'd warn that 1. the story starts degrading after Harry makes his choice, and 2. you'll have to treat the text like a rough draft because of the amount of spelling mistakes in it.

  ◆ Harry is able to control his powers at a young age, ◆ is cunning enough to utilize them to his advantage. ◆ Dark!Harry is fine ◆ no Psychopath!Harry. Unless it's really well-written.

I'd recommend

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] | Words: 194,707; Published: 1/3/2013 and Complete,

   - [dark!Harry] [manipulative!Harry] [Hufflepuff Harry]

2. +[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]+ | Words^{T} : 384,990; Updated: ~20 days ago

   - [dark protagonist] [ruthless protagonist] [OC protagonist] [story has sex contamination]

3. [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]] | Words^{T} : ~3KK and Complete

   - Harry's magic is dark here, but Dark≠Evil in this story. Harry also often tries to keep the higher moral grounds, which may render this arc useless for your request.
