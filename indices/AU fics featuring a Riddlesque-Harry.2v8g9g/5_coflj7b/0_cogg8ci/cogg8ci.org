  The legacy
#+end_quote

Do you remember the writer's name? A cursory search for 'the legacy harry potter fanfiction' turned up the following:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8346742/1/The-Potter-Legacy][The Potter Legacy]]

  Lily and James survived that night at Godrics Hollow and Harry and his boy-who-lived brother Ed along with them. Harry is going to show the world that the Potters are not the lightest family by living out the true legacy of the Potters. Darker Harry, not super evil or anything, James/Ed bashing most likely also weasly and draco bashing. Harry will be strong deal. M for safety

It seems to sort of fit my request, but it is somewhat poorly written.
