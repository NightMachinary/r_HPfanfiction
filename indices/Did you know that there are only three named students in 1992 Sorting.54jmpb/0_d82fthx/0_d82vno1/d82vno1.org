Fuck people who hate OCs. They assume any OC is a mary sue. I am sick and fucking tired of people whining about OCs. I was reading a story where every character was rejiggered to be used---friend!griphook was the most egregious---and i reviewed it saying they would never be able to expand as a writer if they can't learn that the "canon" characters they write are so out of character they ARE original characters!
