Its got a crapton of not terrible harry potter wrecking shit in the marvel universe. Hes overpowered as heck, but as far as i can tell, its a superman type of overpowered rather than a marty stu type op. there is wish fulfillment, but also evil characters we see that are doing shit that keeps the story tense enough to be interestibg. It toes the line with power for sure though. Of course, harry potter magic is broke asf anyways.

the chapters are long as heck, the story is long as heck, but its not a chore to read when you are looking to spend that much time reading anyways.

As a wish fulfillment fic, its pretty easy to follow, and generally a good chill read to spend a good few weeks just going through the content. Sure, theres plot, but its about as important as the rest of the stuff.

I enjoy catching up with the story when i have a weekend with nothing to do but read an easy to follow wish fullfilment fic.
