Well after Harry arrives from the Phantom Zone and meets the Fantastic Four, he teaches at the Xavier's mutant school for a bit. He doesn't like Xavier's or Magneto's solution to the mutant problem so he sets off on his own third path, hence the title. He goes at this from multiple angles. He gets rich and gains influence by creating a company that sells some magical healing stuff, but only to countries favorable to mutants. He also forms a group of superheroes that defends the Earth from threats and uses the visibility of mutants from his group to further his cause. He teams up with Doctor Doom and Mr. Fantastic and hires Carol Danvers to help with planetary defense against the Kree empire. There are a lot of different plot threads woven throughout the narrative. Utilizing tons of various characters that the Marvel universe has to offer. Harry also gets in a polyamorous relationship with Ororo, Jean Grey, Emma Frost and eventually Hela (comic Hela). There's a whole Asgardian plot happening with the Shadows Above All (I think that's their name) controlling the Asgardians towards Ragnarok. And a bunch of other stuff, the fic is almost 1.6 million words, there are almost too many plot threads to name but the author is somehow able to keep track of them all.

I just really like how the author is able to combine all the various elements of Marvel comics together coherently. Like I have only ever seen the MCU and some of the other movies, never read the comics, and it is relatively easy for me to follow and introduces parts of the Marvel universe I was never aware of. Off the top of my head, the fic has included elements of Fantastic Four, mutant, Hellfire Club, Kree, Savage Land, Sinister, Selene Gallio, Shield and Sword, Asgardians, and Doctor Strange. The relationship stuff is also well written and as realistic as a relationship between 4 or 5 people can be. It is not a harem fic. I just think this fic as a whole is amazing, and it is still being updated too with massive chapters.
