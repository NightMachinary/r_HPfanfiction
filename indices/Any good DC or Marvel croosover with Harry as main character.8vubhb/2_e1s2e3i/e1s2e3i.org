Well it was unfortunately never finished (and the guy posting said it was missing only one chapter) and is a bit of a crackfic but I still loved "Terminal Justice" which is a HP/DC crossover (with elements from the Justice League (Unlimited) animated series (and if you know the series well you can clearly see the references). It's a sequel (not from the original author though) to Make a Wish (from Rorschach's Blot) in the Mr Black Fanfiction Universe linkffn(11965672)
