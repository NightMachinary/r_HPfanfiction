I tried to not have any repeats from the others listed, but here is the list I gathered.

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of DC crossovers, but a couple are:

- Heroes Stick Together: linkao3(9580523)
- Robins, Sparrows, and other Gotham Dwelling Songbirds: linkao3(10116155)

In the Marvel category, there's a lot more to choose from:

- Mistletoe - complete: linkao3(6915793)
- Transliterations*: linkao3(1047766)
- No Single Road but This One - complete: linkao3(3613548)
- That Blue Voodo Alien That You Do (Please Stop, Begs Harry): linkao3(11907681)
- Turned Around in Time: linkao3(3898957)

*Transliterations by Shuu-M (Lyzaander) is my favorite on this list, but needs an AO3 account to read; the author had issues with FF comments. Unfortunately, when they made the transfer from FF to AO3, they choose to only upload some of the chapters they had written.
