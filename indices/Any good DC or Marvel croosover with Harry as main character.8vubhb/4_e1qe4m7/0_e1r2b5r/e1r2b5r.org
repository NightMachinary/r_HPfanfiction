I find Avengers: Battleground to be quite bad.

The author switches between present and past tense throughout the /entire/ fic, despite how many complaints they've gotten about it. I believe the author has acknowledged this themselves, yet they continue doing it.

There are /numerous/ phrases and outright paragraphs that get repeated. Harry rants to Nick Fury about muggles killing wizards like 5 different times, and each time, Nick Fury asks the same damn questions. It's as though the author completely forgets that he already wrote this part.

I also don't think the story actually diverges at all. Despite Harry's extraordinary abilities, such as repairing all of New York's damage with a single spell, he still isn't capable of changing events and we get the stations of canon throughout it.

I'm honestly very surprised it's gotten as many followers as it has.
