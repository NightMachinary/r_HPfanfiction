In linkffn(The Power of the Potters by RockIll), the Australian cadet branch of the family grabs Harry and educates him.

In linkffn(The Potter Family Grimoire by Disobediencewriter), Harry buys a book.

I haven't read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Potter Family Grimoire by IamZerokun) yet, but it sounds like it fits the bill.
