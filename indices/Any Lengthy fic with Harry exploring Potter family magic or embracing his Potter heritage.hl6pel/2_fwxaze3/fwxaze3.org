Well you could try Faery Heroes by Silently Watches. It's a Harry/Hermione/Luna fic where Santa on behalf of the Winter Queen send the three of them back in time and to a parallel dimension to defeat Voldemort. Harry finds that the Potter Magic was Wards and that past Potters used to use this power to rob purebloods. They embrace this and proceed to go after deatheaters to lessen their power so they aren't as useful to Voldemort.
