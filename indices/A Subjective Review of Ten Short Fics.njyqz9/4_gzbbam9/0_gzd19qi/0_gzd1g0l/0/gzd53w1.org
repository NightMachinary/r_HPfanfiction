I literally read it two weeks ago, I know exactly what you're talking about. It's that Addams-esque comedy routine about the Black family being degenerates. Not the best way to tackle the topic, definitely one of the weakest points in the fic, but there is a difference between writing characters doing questionable shit and the author condoning it.
