Oh man, this was a fun read. I'm always fascinated by the tastes of other people. Especially because I love timetravel stories as well, although rarely have I found a closed loop one that I liked. I have read so many, I think at one stage it almost affected me personally because I got so jealous of the opportunity to go back in time and change things and fixated on what I would do if I woke up tomorrow and it was the year 2000. It was almost unhealthy.

Not being into anime or JRPGs at all, I'm not sure H the Mage is for me but you definitely caught my attention with Negligentia. I don't think I knew any of the fics you reviewed and that's always cool
