Upvote for the helpful reviews - easy to understand and helpful to pick out what I might try reading.

But OMG “grimderp”!!!! This one word is what I will hold on to for a long while. I generally /hate/ grimdark stories... except where I don't, and I could never say what the distinction was. Now I know thanks to you. Thank you!

“Grimderp” is exactly what I can't tolerate. It is such a relief to have this in conscience awareness rather than some sort of subconscious minefield.
