  This is going all the way back to Voldemorts 6th year at Hogwarts. What happens if he found a girl just like him that was transferring to Hogwarts and came to live in the same orphanage as him. Read as Voldemort takes over the wizarding world with his true love by his side. Dark winning. Mature content. Wont follow all the books. Voldemort/OC
