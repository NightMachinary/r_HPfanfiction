Alright. But again... what you might see as flaws, others might not. Ive read plenty of things others have trashed but I have enjoyed, and things that others enjoyed, that I hated. It happens.

But also, if you want to give opinions thats fine, but since I said I had "not read it", you should of at least put a spoiler tag or notice in your reply.
