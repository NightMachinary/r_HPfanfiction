Ughh, can't get past the first chapter. Smirking, Slytherin God Harry with all the girls dropping their panties for him. The worst parts of the neglected Harry trope also with a James who thinks Harry is a fucking retard and poor, annoying Lily who just wants to reconcile. IMO, not even good enough writing to be a guilty pleasure.
