Why stick to just one factor?

Very few real events have a singular cause. Most come about through a combination of multiple contributing factors. Even in a battle that looks like one particular action brought victory or defeat, if you look you'll find that this outcome was only possible because of everything else that had happened to bring things to that point.

In a yet-to-be-published chapter of one of my fics, Harry wins through a combination of several factors: He trained hard (category 2) in a crossover element (category 4-ish), but also benefitted from prior experience due to the nature of his de-scarcruxing. Voldemort's hubris also played a major role; he started out the duel more focused on showiness and sadism, wasting a lot of magic and tiring himself out way more than necessary before he finally started to switch to less flashy but more efficient and practical spells and tactics. Even then, Harry was still slowly losing and only won by choosing to accept a probably-fatal hit in order to deal a killing blow in return.

Honestly, any or all factors/categories can work, but the key is to make the victory feel /earned./ Much of the objection to the canon version is that Harry really didn't win that final duel with Voldemort, he just provided an opportunity for the Deux ex Machina to do its thing. Nothing about Harry's character, abilities, or actions played any role in the final duel, save possibly indirectly.

The heroes' victory or villain's defeat should come about at least partly as a result of their traits and actions. Heroes win because of their bravery, determination, friendship, etc.; villains lose because of their cruelty, hubris, untrustworthiness, etc..
