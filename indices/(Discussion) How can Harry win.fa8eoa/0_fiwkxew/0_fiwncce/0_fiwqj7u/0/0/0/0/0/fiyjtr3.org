True, but the fact that the duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald is regarded as having been quite something and Dumbledore's victory incredible (especially as Grindelwald had the elder wand), suggests that they were both skilled, knowedgeable, and powerful duelists.

As another person has already commented, Voldemort held his own, and even toyed with Dumbledore while his opponent wielded the elder wand. I think that we can draw some fairly obvious conclusions from this.
