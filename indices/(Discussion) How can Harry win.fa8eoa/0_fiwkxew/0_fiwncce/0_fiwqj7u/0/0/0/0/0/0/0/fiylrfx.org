I always ifnd the 'Voldemort is more powerful that Grindelwald' thing interesting.

I think that politically, he was less influential because he was solely focussed on Britain whereas Grindelwald afected all of Europe (and beyond?). In contrast, Vodlemort had more power in and of himself and probably could have surpassed Grindelwald in other resepects had Dumbledore taken as long to engage him as he did with Grindelwald.
