You're right, I always get into discussions about things like that even though I know I'm wrong. This is because there are two things that really bother me in the cannon and Fannon Dumbledore is considered Merlin reincarnated even though he is in his 12th decade and having worked in 2 full time jobs (I think they are) and one that is part time for some years and working to keep the world of politics to the side of the light and the second thing is that Voldemort is considered a Dark Lord more dangerous than Grindelwald.
