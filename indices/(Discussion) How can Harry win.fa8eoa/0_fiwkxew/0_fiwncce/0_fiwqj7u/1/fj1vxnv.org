Well, I think that it's pretty obvious that Voldemort/Tom Morvolo Riddle should have been a genius. He was already pretty sly and cunning at a young age since he was able to manipulate Slughorn and the Grey Lady into telling him pretty precious knowledge.\\
He was also the leader of a bunch of members of very old pureblood families that all of themselves to be the top of humanity. So my guess is that Voldy didn't only manage to get their loyalty by just sweet-talking, he must have shown them that he is a powerful leader. No weak, talentless goon like Fudge who can manage to look important and powerful, but is weak in reality can control a bunch of psychopaths that love torturing, rape, and killing in their free time.

Dumbledore was the only realistic opponent for Voldemort - in my opinion. Harry Potter shouldn't have had a chance at all. I mean he didn't know any strong spells besides the most basic ones that 90% of the population know about. Voldemort studied the Dark Arts all his life, an aspect of magic not only knows for being evil but also powerful. He loosing vs. Harry as he did in cannon was just silly.

However, most of the stuff in cannon was silly, it is a children's book after all and the author would have lost a lot of readers by making it overly complicated and realistic to satisfy the more mature audience.

Anyway, my point is that cannon Harry was way too weak. He shouldn't have been able to beat Voldy. Idk, but I feel that Voldemort had been dumbed down a lot. It was mentioned that Voldy was supposed to be one of the most terrifying dark lords in recent history. He had the knowledge, the power, followers, experience, immortality, but he was still beaten by a bunch of school kids... feels a bit cheap.
