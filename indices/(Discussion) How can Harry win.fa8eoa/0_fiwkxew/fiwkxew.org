While I do appreciate to read about epic duels (like the one between Voldemort and Dumbledore in canon), I have some troubles about the Magic is Might option.

While Harry is a rather gifted student (especially in Defense, and in survival I guess), Voldemort is supposed to be a genius, like the most talented student who went to Hogwarts since Dumbledore, if not beyond.\\
I'm pretty sure that, in a duel with Voldemort (without "Love Protection" or "Wand Ownership" powers used in canon) the only difference between canon Harry and one that training H24 during all his childhood is that the trained one will be murdered in 30 seconds rather than 10. Not to mention that the one that say that "Dumbledore should have trained Harry rather than letting him with the Dursley" seem to forget what a walking mess the protagonist would be if he had only trained to fight all his life (I imagine a young version of Moody even more trigger, or I guess wand happy who is expelled from Hogwarts during his 1st week after murdering his housemates because "They were probably Voldemort' spies").\\
I enjoy it when the might does not only come from training though (Time traveler Harry who truly had time to train, reincarnation of a founder or Merlin . . .).

As for a way to win :

6) Betrayal. Through some planing (either of Dumbledore of Harry), and the habit of Voldemort of abusing his followers, they (or at least some of them) decide to betray him. Voldemort takes a drink only to fall, poisoned. Several Death Eater simultanously raise their wands and try to take him one. May work or not but at least he is weakened enough for the good guys to finish the job.
