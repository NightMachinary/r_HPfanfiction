I don't think the canon option would have worked, realistically. Or I suppose, you could keep the theme of Dumbledore maneuvering the entire country to subtly lead them to defeat Voldemort, but the way canon showed it? I doubt it would work.

Honestly, I think the most realistic and likeliest to succeed is the option of having adults that are more than incompetent idiots and/or comic relief, and they actually do what they are supposed to do while the kids are left out of it as much as possible. Including Harry.

In terms of personal preference, Im a sucker for a good fight too, I'd definitely pick option 2, magic is might.
