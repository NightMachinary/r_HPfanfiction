1. You are not alone, Harry. The power of love represents itself through his charisma with which he coordinates group of people more skilled than himself, and they all as a group defeat Tom Riddle & co. See linkffn(11916243) for an example.

Option 2. (super!Harry) I detest, because it runs straight into The Problem of Peter Pevensie. In the finale of the first book from The Chronicles of Narnia series, we should believe that thirteen year old (magically slightly grown older) boy defeated in the fair battle the mightiest of all witches of the superhuman size. It is barely possible to do it in the book, where the suspense of unbelief is more simple, but when they tried to make a film from the Narnia Chronicles, the result is a pure disaster: thirteen year old boy fighting adult warrioress just looks ridiculous, whatever film magic you apply (similarly, it turned impossible to make a good film Aslan ... whatever they tried he looks still like a overgrown plush toy). It usually leads to adding some completely non-canonical super!Magic making Harry into super!Harry with complete destruction of the character of HP universe. If you want to write the Marvel Universe fanfiction, you know where to find it.
