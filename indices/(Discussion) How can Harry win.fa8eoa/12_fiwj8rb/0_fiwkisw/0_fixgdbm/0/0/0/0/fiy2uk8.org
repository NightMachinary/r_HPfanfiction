To me, the OP's inclusion of 'loopholes' is already outside of that definition without any implying. To quote OP:

#+begin_quote
  Loopholes. These are stories where Voldemort is "killed" by Harry, but really defeated by someone else to fulfill the requirements of the Prophecy.
#+end_quote

That's fairly explicit in Harry not being the real one to defeat Voldemort.

I would say that Harry + his friends making a strategy that doesn't revolve around the prophecy - or executing one made by Dumbledore - would be Harry winning, even if he's not the only one facing down Voldemort in the end... or even if he weren't the main one to do so.

Eg, if Harry and his friends are tasked by Dumbledore to go deal with the last horcrux while Voldemort + Dumbledore are having a big flashy duel, Harry would still be defeating Voldemort by doing so, even if 90% of the real duelling/fighting against the dark wizard was being handled by Dumbledore.
