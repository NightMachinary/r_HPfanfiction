Only if it takes the prophecy at face value. It's not a loophole to use proper planning - it's strategy.

To me, 'loophole' implies that the prophecy and fate is real and set up in a way that Harry has to be the one to do so, and so it'd be finding loopholes within those hard limits. Compared to one where it's fake/not important, in which case there's nothing to find holes in.
