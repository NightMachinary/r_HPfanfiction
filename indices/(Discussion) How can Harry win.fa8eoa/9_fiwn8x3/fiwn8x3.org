I like magic is might where Harry isn't the next Dumbledore/Voldemort, but just really good at DADA. So he's still getting A's and EE's for poitons, herbology, charms and the likes and is just talented in his field like Snape was rewriting the book in his sixth year.

With him being as good as Voldemort and Dumbledore in fights or him being good enough that luck actually has influence.
