3/4. Just destroy his current body with a sniper, it will allow Harry to grow up and learn enough to finish the job.

Many people dismiss this as Mugglewanking, but there's nothing in canon that suggest Wizards have the skills to block supersonic projectiles, much less detect/react in time. We also know that creating a new body isn't easy, so keeping Voldemort as a wraith is a comparably easy way to keep the world safe.
