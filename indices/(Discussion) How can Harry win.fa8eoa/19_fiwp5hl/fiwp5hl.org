Loopholes are my favourites for sure. I remember a story with Voldemort being slowly slashed to pieces during a truly prepared battle, Harry was basicly baiting him during that and then Voldemort died by Harry's hand as in two most trusted people he called his right and left hands.

Also I would really like a mixed ending where horcruxes are really powerful device but only if you make only one. Voldemort would be basicly defeated by his own magic. Maybe you lose part of your power with each destroyed horcrux and then Harry duels a near squib Voldemort. Maybe you lose part of your power and it leads to a Death Eaters Civil war. Or maybe when horcruxes actually posses someone it just makes that person a new dark wizard but not exactly your ally. The last one would probably be a mix of Death Pride and DP&SW in that subject and I think I would love it.
