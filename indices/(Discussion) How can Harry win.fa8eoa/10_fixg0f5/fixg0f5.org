The description you give of 'Magic is might' is very tough to do in a satisfying way, I think - you need to have a good plot and writing ability to justify having Harry power up so quickly without feeling bad.

I prefer the approach of Harry being powerful/competent, but obviously not /as/ powerful as Voldemort and Dumbledore - and thus, having to rely on more than just himself. That is to say, instead of /just/ Harry crushing Voldemort, it would be Harry + his friends defeating Voldemort + his followers, and involving some sort of cleverer plot than just raw magical ability.

But more generally, it'll depend on the fic. One focused on relationships, romance, or humor doesn't need to have a great final showdown with Voldemort - loopholes, luck, or canon would work fine there, because it's not the focus of the story. One with Voldemort as the center of the main plot, however, does need a satisfying resolution. And although it's /possible/ to do that with super powerful Harry, I don't think it's the best default option.

Plus, epic magical battles are more fun if Harry isn't so powerful as to easily win, right?
