A mix of loopholes/deus ex machina and some planning. Dumbledore dealt with a dark lord in Grindelwald already, so if Harry can't outfight him then attempt to outsmart him. Dumbledore knew that Voldemort had returned already but unfortunately the Order didn't do much aside from get killed in DH.

Winning by luck doesn't feel right. Voldemort could've countered the Elder Wand allegiance by using his Yew wand or summon Bellatrix or another fallen Death Eater's wand and start killing everyone.
