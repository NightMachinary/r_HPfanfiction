It was mostly luck and plot armour that Voldemort was defeated. Voldemort acknowledges Lily's sacrifice at the graveyard as ancient magic and makes the point of touching Harry to prove it. Then he makes the tactical mistake of offering Harry to surrender, making the same mistake twice.

And even though Voldemort's spells lacked their usual potentcy, when Bellatrix died he was still able to blast McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn back. So when Harry starts his monologue all he had to do was pull out his Yew wand or summon Bellatrix's wand and start cutting people down. If Kingsley, McGonagall and Slughorn were still beaten despite Harry's sacrifice, then the rest of Hogwarts can be beaten too.
