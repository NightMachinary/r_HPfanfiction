Don't forget that the blood connection, Harry as a Horcrux, mastery of the elder wand, and Harry's willing sacrifice also extended Harry's sacrificial protection to his friends. Voldemort's spells lacked potency against Harry's friends. We saw this as silencing and body-binding charms wore off despite the fact they were cast by Voldemort.

It was partially luck, but planning and Harry's good character as well as the elder wand allowed Harry to win which honestly makes far more sense than Harry simply training.
