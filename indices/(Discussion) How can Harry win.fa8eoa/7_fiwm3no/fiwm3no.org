I like a combination of "magic is might" and "deus ex machina".

That is: I want my protagonist to exhibit high competence, at least by the end of the story. This is a prerequisite of my respecting the character, and I will generally fail to identify with a protagonist who does not meet this requirement. The result of the protagonist's lack of competence is that (at best) I lose interest in the story or (at worst) I am actively rooting for the hero to lose because I feel like they do not deserve to win.

However, "magic is might" is not enough. This is for two reasons:

Firstly, it's not enough within the established elements of the HP story. Even if you write Harry as playing in the same magical genius ballpark as Dumbledore and Voldemort, you have two problems: (1) Voldemort has a lot more experience and (2) within the "magical genius" ballpark, Voldemort is said to be the top of the scale.

Secondly, it's not enough within the requirements of telling a satisfying story. "Harry was stronger so he won" is not the kind of ending which readers go away from feeling satisfied. There needs to be some element of the unexpected in the climax to a story, as well as the very real risk of loss.

This is why in TOHF I considered it so important to have Harry lose a duel to Voldemort, even with access to all of Dumbledore's magical abilities. I wanted to make it clear that (a) Voldemort was stronger than Dumbledore, so inheriting Dumbledore's abilities is not an instant win, (b) unless Harry introduces something new to the equation, he would likely lose the war.

The "something new" - the element which surprises the reader - can I suppose be referred to as "deus ex machina". I'm not too fond of using that phrase though, because it is associated with something coming out of nowhere. That is also unsatisfying. A satisfying surprise is one which is foreshadowed and in retrospect makes sense.
