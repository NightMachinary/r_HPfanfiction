Personally I quite like the idea behind how Voldemort is defeated in canon in theory. In so many ways, it is love and Tom's inability to understand it that defeats him. It is love that causes Narcissa to lie. It is love that motivates Snape. It is love for his friends and family that causes Harry to sacrifice himself. Etc etc.

But at the same time it is unsatisfying because Dumbledore's plan is bonkers. What if Harry had managed to kill Nagini at Godric's Hollow? How was Snape supposed to respond to Dumbledore's instructions? What if Ron didn't return on that particular day? What if Ron disarmed Malfoy? What if Harry was too late to get Snape's memories? Too many things fall into place conveniently for seemingly no reason other than the plot.

While I do enjoy the occasional Harry is a powerful mage kind of storyline that pits him against Voldemort, it is unrealistic to a fault. I do like stories where there is a lot of political maneuvering behind the scenes that helps defeat Voldemort's movement, even though even that is unrealistic considering the Ministry falls first. I guess what I prefer is something that keeps to the spirit of canon in that it is not the intelligence and power of Harry that defeats Tom but his ability to understand magics that Tom pays no attention to, like house elves, to be able to accept death rather than try to defeat it, to be able to love and be loved so deeply and things like that. But at the same time to also have the agency to do these things, not to be pulled like a puppet on others' strings.

I found the ending of Importance of Intent pretty satisfying for example.
