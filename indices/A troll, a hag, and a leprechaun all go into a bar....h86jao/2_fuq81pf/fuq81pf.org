The bartender looks nervous, but puts out some glasses and asks, "What'll yeh have?"

The leprechaun responds, "A whiskey for me. The troll'll have a spot of gin with stabilizing potion, and for her, a bloody mary with blood replenisher."

"They're both getting potions? Nothin fer you?"

"Well, the troll's actually a lad turned into a troll. The hag's a witch with a blood curse, says she'll turn em both back once he's caught her so many unicorns to eat that she's shittin rainbows."

"And you?"

"Me?" says the leprechaun, sipping from his whiskey. "I'm a real leprechaun. Just waitin on her chamberpot."
