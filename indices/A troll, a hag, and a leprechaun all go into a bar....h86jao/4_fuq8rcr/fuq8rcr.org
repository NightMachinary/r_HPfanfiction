October 31, 1981

A troll a hag and a leprechaun walk into a bar they came across while traveling trying to have a fun Halloween

The leprechaun, being of small body, ordered a butter beer. The hag ordered pickled toads and the troll ordered a full barrel of firewhisky.

They were an unusual bunch, but had all met long ago as colleagues in their chosen profession, and started a business crafting and selling vases together. They were roaming the country looking for large clay deposits, as nobody wanted to sell clay to them.

As they merrily are and drank, a new person entered the bar: a hotheaded wizard named Dirk, famous in the town for his dueling skills. Immediately spying the odd trio, he snuck up to them trying to attack the troll before any damage could be done.

The moment Dirk stepped up with his wand drawn, the troll (feeling threatened) backhanded Dirk into the wall where fell dead on the spot.

The trio hastily exited the bar never to be seen again. When the bartender came to his wits, he shouted to the town: “Dirk Lloyd has been killed by a hairy potter!”

Edit: it's pretty bad ik but I had a hard time coming up with any puns or any interactions between the three
