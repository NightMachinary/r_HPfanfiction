"Three Irish Whiskeys, and ya better be Dublin 'em!" the Leprechaun called out. The Troll and Hag stood back while he downed all 6 jiggers himself.

"That's an awful lot for a little fellow, what's the occasion?"

"The day I've had, you wouldn't believe it! Starts off with a little girl who comes up to me pot o' gold and tries to take it! Well, I tell her to leave it be and I'll give her three wishes.

She starts smirking and says 'Ha, and Mafilda said I was being a swot for getting such good marks in History of Magic. Wish I could see that hag's face when she hears I caught a Leprechaun!'

Well, I brought Mafilda right then and there, turned her into a Hag! Ha, the look on that kid's face. She starts blubbering and says 'Oh no! I shouldn't have gotten an Outstanding; I wish I'd gotten a Troll instead!'

Ya know, I couldn't let that one go, so I summoned up big ol' mountain Troll, just for her. She's panicking now, and I'm feeling fine. Until she says

'Oh, I shouldn't have looked for the gold. I wish YOU had made those wishes instead of me!'"
