To make it short : No

For a little longer answer : I do not think Rowling bashed any character, lot alone a feminine one. There are some character than can be treated a little . . .harsher than others, but all of them seem to be men (later books Ron, probably influenced by movie though I would not call it bash, or Peter Petigrew who is way more weak and useless than someone than outwitted Sirius and the whole Order should be).

Also, I'm trying hard to remember, but I just can't think of any feminine character who are bashed in the fic. Hermione is loved by the narration (Rowling did admit that she was a bit of a self insert), Bellatrix or Molly have both their moments, but never fall into bashing. The closest thing to a bashed character would be Umbridge, but she was written to just be evil and hated, and I still don't consider it at bashing (she would have needed to completely suck at everything she does to be that, and even if she is one of the worst teacher Harry had, she still managed to do what she came for, out Dumbledore, hurt Harry and "rule" Hogwarts for the ministry).

I remember some people complaining that Harry Potter is sexist, because the few women in power we see do not have any family, but I never thought it was an issue, mainly because the male in power we see also do not have a family (the only "powerful" character we see with his family mentioned is Crouch, and it's mainly to point he completely failed the education of his son who joined a terrorist group and was abandoned by him).

Finally, maybe the "fem bashing" you are talking is about the fact that Harry Potter only have a few "feminine" characters, who are not treated thte best way? Well if it's that I think it's completely wrong. Just because Lavender was not treated as a godess who just charmed Harry with how feminine she was does not mean it's fem bashing. The reader see the story from Harry point of view, and he happens to not be the most interested by "girly" thing like make up. The only female member of the Trio, Hermione, is also a bookish girl who is not really interested by things like that (though spending 6 or 7 hours getting ready to a freaking ball seem feminine to me), so it's not a main aspect of the story. But not getting a lot of screen time does not equal bashing. Lavender did play a role in the story as a "rival" of Hermione for Ron, and yeah she did not handle her relation the best way possible (things like the "won won" jewelry just seem gaudy), but it was just a girl trying to hard and she still pulled her part in the story with her "sacrifice" during Hogwarts battle.
