The only one who I remember bash Lavender was the jealous and bookworm Hermione.. so I don't think we can say even that much, since it fitted her nerdy character.

Honestly, this is pure nonsense, shit is getting to a point in which every character in a story must act as the perfect human being with the absolutely perfect morals of a 24th century startrek human or authors get accused of being this or that..

People nowadays get offended if you breath with the wrong side of your nose for gods sake.. so much fucking nonsense and hypocrisy.
