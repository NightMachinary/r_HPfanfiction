Yea, that was kind of the point I was trying to make. All we get in the books are subjective descriptions out of other characters POV.

I really don't know what this thread, and others like it are about, because using a characters POV and including their own view of the world and eventual prejudices to convey information about another character is a fundamental part of any story ever written.

Would be pretty fuckin boring without it, because then the reader would not have to think about what they read. They could just take all the information at face value instead of having to take the character that says something into account too.

EDIT: Yea downvote me and keep getting upset about there being characters with different views of the world lol. Holy fuck how retarded.
