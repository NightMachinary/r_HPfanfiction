Yeah hermione is very important.

But she does have a very "not like other girls" element to her.

Id argue Umrbidges largest problem is that Rowling made her an ugly toad.

Okay let me explain. I like thr movie version more. Why? B3cause she looks like your grandmother she looks like a kind old lady. Then she opens her mouth.

In the book Harry can tell she is unpleasant by looking at her.

In the movie she is unpleasant but she looks normal and to me that works much more as well. She is normal at least for me.

Rowling portrays bigotry as this corruption and it is a bad thing but I like the movie more because sometimes nice people and pleasant people are just a bunch of bigots and it sucks.

She looks like that nice church lady then she opens her mouth and she just called you the f-slur.

That's why I dont much care for her portrayal in the book.

Shes just too ugly sure she acts contemptable but it just felt off.

But the movie made me loathe her as I know people like her ive met and interacted with people like her.

And it feels real because bigotry in real life doesnt just come from ugly people it regularly comes from the mouth of pleasant and attractive people.

She is a kind old lady in appearance but hides a sinister bigot below.

The book makes her monstrous in appearance which to me.just removes the menace.
