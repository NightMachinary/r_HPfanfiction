Feel the same way. JKR was a new author and wanted to appeal to a large audience, so she wrote using the well testes tropes for the gente.

Nothing wrong, of course, but things get increasingly hard to pull off as the series progresses and the way she, a female adult, writers a teenager male is affected by such decision, which of course makes some readers read Harry as possibly a Bissexual, de to him "crushing" on Cedric for instante.

(This happens too with male authors writing female characters sometimes and is not a negative bias associated with fender in most cases, but simply a flaw.)
