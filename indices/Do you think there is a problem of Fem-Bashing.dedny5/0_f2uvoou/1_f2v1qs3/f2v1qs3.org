I woudn't put Umbridge as the exampe of being girlish. Her character is supposed to be unsettling, that evil can live in all form, even in someone that's very unlikely. If we don't know from Harry's narrative that Umbridge has a toad-like face, we won't suspect that Umbridge could be evil. After all, she had a girly voice and she liked pink and cats. Other character that could be as non-threatening as Umbridge (supposed to be) is a child, but HP is not an anime and JKR can't do that.

Also, Hermione isn't just a sidekick. Harry's adventure would be very different without Hermione being there. I actually liked what JKR did to Hermione. A female character in a MC team usually become [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart][the heart]] and/or the love interest. However, Hermione isn't one of those and JKR gave the heart and love interest to a Weasley, Hermione became the brain instead. Her role as writer insert is problematic, but overall she's a good female character.

I agree with the other example. Ginny is only there during and after OotP to serve as a love interest. McGonagall doesn't affect the plot. Bellatrix is the only female DH, though it could be sexism in the DE. Lavender, Parvati, and Fleur is mocked for being girlish. Most ministry employees (that Harry met) are male.

However, I won't really put a lot a lot of thought into this. Harry Potter is written in the late 90s with children as a target audience. JKR simply did the classic trope and doesn't really put a lot of thought into it. The MC is a white male with his two white sidekick and his male rival, adults are useless. abuse is simply brused off, etc. By the time it HP becomes YA, a lot of things are already written and it's too popular to do something controversial.
