Hard maybe. Fleur, Lavender, and Umbridge (yes) are the most girlish. One could say this is Harry, but Harry isn't the only one to mock divination nor is the biggest offender. There's also Fleur being the one unable to handle the grindylows and her overall place in the tournament. Umbridge, the villain, loves pink and is a simpering woman.

And all this does bleed into fan fiction. Though, Fleur is made more subservient and, much like in HBP and DH, whatever talent and life she had is gone.

Also, the last time I did a read through I think I came to the conclusion that JKR made Hermione, the admitted self-insert, an "I'm not like other girls" girl.

I will say that she does her female characters no favors overall.

Lily's story revolves around Harry, James, and Snape. Ginny's sole existence is for Harry. McGonagall, Bellatrix, Umbridge, and Hermione are sidekicks. Two women, Amelia Bones and Millicent Bagnold, who would have had a lot of power and be independent of men disappeared or died. Was Narcissa ever mentioned without mentioning a man? Hell even Winky's story was about men and she just disappeared after GoF.
