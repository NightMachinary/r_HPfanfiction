There's more of a Slytherin and Purebloods bashing in my opinion. I guess that rather than being 'bashed' it could be argued that emales in Harry Potter are too passive and lack more agency; with most powerful witches being 'under' a Wizard (Lestrange/Voldemort, Minerva/Albus, Amelia/Cornelius), but does that hold under scrutiny? The minister is a fool, a disgrace of a man and even grater disgrace as a leader; the great Albus Dumbledore is largely impotent to take any real action against know terrorists deeply entrenched into Wizarding Britain, and is largely passive himself; Sirius is a largely vulnerable and tired man that also is impotent to change the circumstances; i don't think Snape needs explaining; and most of the Purebloods show that support Voldemort are a rather.. unsightly and undignified group. As a reflection of Jk decision to have a male Main Character, the narrative itself tend to focus largely on males, and while that open it's own can of worms, that would be another point.
