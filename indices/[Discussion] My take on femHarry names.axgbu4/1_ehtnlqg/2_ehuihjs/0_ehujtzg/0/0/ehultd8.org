I'm not ignoring them, I'm using stronger examples to argue my point. Harry's classmates have more normal names because Rowling wants to make the story as relatable as possible, so she limited the truly exceptional names to one, Draco. There's yet another name comment on their first train ride, when Ron laughs at Draco's name. Even among those others you've mentioned, there's a difference between Gregory (/not/ Greg), Vincent, Daphne, and Harry.

I'm a little confused as to what you're arguing, honestly. Do you really not believe that Rowling intended to make a clear difference between “magical” names and “normal” names?
