  Do you really not believe that Rowling intended to make a clear difference between “magical” names and “normal” names?

No, I don't believe it. For older generations maybe, but the change is very obvious in younger generations, since even Death Eater spawns have the same normal anglicized names (with the exception of Draco Malfoy). Ironically, the top Muggleborn in the story has a very old pureblood sounding name.
