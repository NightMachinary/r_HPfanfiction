Yeah, in my opinion the most important thing is for the name to sound /normal./ Petunia comments on this at the beginning of the series (“Nasty, common, name, if you ask me”) and there's a clear contrast drawn between Harry and the types of names favored by purebloods. Giving her an exceptional name implies a very different thought process for James and Lily.
