I recommend [[http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2010/4/the-generational-sweet-spot-or-why-your-parents-have-such-bad-taste][this post]] about baby names. Names seem to follow a cycle of 4 generations in popularity, so it could be that Petunia thinks Harry is nasty and common precisely because it's a name of their parents' and grandparents' generations, which, as the writer says, sounds "boring" and "old." From this perspective, matching the pattern in the naming trends is a good way to go.
