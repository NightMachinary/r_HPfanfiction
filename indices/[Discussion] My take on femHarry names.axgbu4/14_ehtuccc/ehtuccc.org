In one of my favorite Fem!Harry fics ever, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5372018/chapters/12406760][Tea Cures All Ills]] The author changes Harry's name to Hero, which I think is pretty interesting. I also really like the idea of her being named Lily after her mother, that has some great angst opportunities.
