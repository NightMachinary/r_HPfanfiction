My personal preference for Fem!Harry is Holly, both because it sounds the most similar to Harry and because it matches her wand. Even though it didn't appear in the top 100 at all until 1983, that sounds like exactly the kind of thing JKR would do.

(Also for similarity reasons, I would use Daisy for a Fem!Dudley or a second Dursley child. That probably would have been unique enough for Petunia at the time based on the chart.)
