  Fem!Harry is a Potter, not an Evans.

And Draco is a Malfoy, not a Black. What does it matter that fem!Harry isn't an Evans? Are the Potters banned from using flower names? Does Lily lose naming right because she married James?

We don't even know what Lily's parents were called, so we can't know whether it's an Evans tradition or if it's just passed down matrilineally in Lily's family.
