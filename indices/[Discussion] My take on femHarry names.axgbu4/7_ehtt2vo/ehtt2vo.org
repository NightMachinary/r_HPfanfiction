Harriet is bad, only as it is read as 'Harry-et', rather than the actual pronounciation.

Harriet (or Harriot/Harriott) is however, quite an old fashioned British name, and while Harry is a shortening and casualising of another traditional, old fashioned name (Harold), Harriet doesn't lend itself to shortening as well.

A good alternative that both fits the old fashioned orgin if Harry's name, and the shortening/casualising of it, would be Harleen/Harley, but that probably wouldn't be popular for obvious reasons.

I think it's all pronounciation any way, if Harriet was read correctly ([[https://youtu.be/1fz1QAds9Wo]]) it wouldn't be much of an issue.

Side note, Hermes (pronounced Her-mees) and Veronica are best names for a genderbent Hermione or Ron, and no one can tell me otherwise.
