No see you're kinda missing the point. I'm not saying Prospero is common, I'm saying Prospero isn't unique. Oberon/Auberon is actually unique (not Shakespeare's creation, but still only ever used to define the king of fairies in late medieval myth afaik), but Prospero like Leontes and Hermione are simply foreign (and outdated) names.
