If Hermione's parents named her, well... /Hermione/ then I'm pretty sure they wouldn't go with something as common as "Hermes" if she were a boy, they would most certainly stick with their Shakespearean theme and go with Leontes as the natural opposite to Hermione from The Winter's Tale or some other unique Shakespearean name like Oberon or Prospero.
