I hate the flower names, like I get that Lily and Petunia were named after flowers, but whose to say that their mom was? Or their grandmother or whoever else? I honestly don't see Lily or Petunia using a flower name for their female child, if they were to have one.

I like the name Sophia or Elizabeth for a female Harry. Elizabeth, you can shorten in a couple of different ways, and they both roll off the tongue nicely.

I hate Harriet, because it's just such a cheap pull to Harry, oh her name can be shortened to Harry! I also don't like Rose or Iris for a female Harry, just doesn't fit.

If I have to use a name like a type of flower or whatever, I don't mind Holly, but even that is just kind same-y or whatever.

But then again you don't want a crazy name like Primrose or something, pretty name, but just wouldn't fit a female Harry Potter (imo)

I have a rather unique name that I hate, I hate it because my mom decided to name my two sisters normal names, and gave me the odd one. So I could see someone like Hermione hate her name, but not want it shortened or anything, but would want to name her children somewhat normal names. (Maybe that's why they chose Rose and Hugo for their kids names). While Hugo is different enough, it's still kind of normal enough as well).

I tend to stick with Sophia or Elizabeth myself, when naming a female Harry, when I first started writing female Harry, I used Holly; but now, it's a nice name, but I just don't like it for a female Harry.
