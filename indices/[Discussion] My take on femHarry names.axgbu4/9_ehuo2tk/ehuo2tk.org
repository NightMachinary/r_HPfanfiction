Throwing my hat in the ring here... when I briefly wrote a fem!Harry, I called her Harriet, and I don't really see the problem with it? Sure, it's not the prettiest name out there--- but neither is Harry, in all honesty. I prefer it to the flower names, which feel painfully clich√© to me, or anything frilly and ornate that never would've occurred to the Potters.
