Oh man, I HATE Holly--- probably because it was used in this fic Child of Grace, which has the most unbearable fem!Harry I've ever read. I guess this is an agree-to-disagree kind of thing, everyone's name preferences are different. I just mostly feel like when people are afraid of using a regular/common name for a character, that's a big warning sign for the character being a Sue. (â€˜Hadrian Potter' can die in a fire.)
