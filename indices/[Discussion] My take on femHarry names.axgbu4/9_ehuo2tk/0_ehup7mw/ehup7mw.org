I don't know, to me personally; Harriet just seems to be a cheap pull to Harry, if you want to make it kind of close to Harry, but not exactly; at least do Holly. That's kind of a weak pull as well, but it's better then Harriet (imo). And I'm not hating the name Harriet, it's... fine, but it just makes James and Lily seem like lazy naming parents.
