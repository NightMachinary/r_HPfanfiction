Why thank you for asking. I went through my FFN favorites, and this is what I came up with. You've probably read most/all of these, but /shrug/

linkffn(9860311) is my pick for best fic, period. A Long Journey Home has everything you could want in a fic except for a regular update schedule. I don't want to say any details about it because I don't want to ruin anything or put my own slant on anything.

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus is this incredible surrealist comedy that still has phenomenal dramatic moments. There's a line later in the story that I love so much that I have to share it. To set the scene, two characters who know each other intimately begin to fight,

  It seemed to be about far more than their words, far more than Morgan, and maybe even far more than each other. No, both literally and metaphorically, Morgan imagined that they were seeking to destroy, in this one rage and hate filled moment, everything they loathed within themselves.

I don't want anyone to interpret what I'm about to say as putting any authors down, because there are so many amazing people who write in this community and I couldn't do a hundredth as good a job if I tried (and even worse I've never actually tried), but the writing in this story is on another level. Surrealism and comedy are so hard to actually do well, but this works for me completely. It isn't something you find often, and the fact that it's free on the internet for all of us is frankly astounding.

linkffn(12713828) Victoria Potter is one of those fics where you read it and you're like, this is the apotheosis of so many concepts that have been floating around in this community. I'm so glad to have finally found someone (this subreddit's very own Taure, in fact) who can do pull this off. That probably sounds like I'm saying it's unoriginal, which couldn't be further from the truth. The only reason this one isn't listed first is because there are two other astoundingly great fics in the same category.

linkffn(11197701) Yule Ball Panic is the start of a three part story. I haven't read it in a long time, but from what I remember it's a really charming story about love. That isn't to say that there isn't a plot, just that the key theme is love.

linkffn(4916690) I'm sort of hesitant to recommend Holly Evans and the Spiral Path because even though I really enjoyed it, it's insanely sexual as it goes forward, and a lot of really dark things happen. Like if I described the events I'm thinking of you almost certainly wouldn't read it. A great deal of it is told as Holly writing in a journal that McGonagall gives her to communicate with her half brother Harry Potter (who is living in seclusion and can't take visitors) as a way to be closer to each other. I get that that isn't really fem!Harry story per se, but I'm counting it because Harry isn't there, and Holly is at Hogwarts, friends with Hermione, the whole nine yards.

Honorable mention: Even though it's a canon-compliant fic set in America years after the books ended featuring none of the original cast rather than a fem!Harry story, I can't help but recommend Alexandra Quick because it's really great, and the protagonist is my favorite brand of plucky heroine. linkffn(3964606) Alexandra Quick is actually the first fan fiction that I read (well, technically HPMoR was the first, but I don't count that because I read it in spite of the fact that it was fan fiction, not because of it), and I think it still holds up. JKR's version of America kinda blows in comparison to AQ's, in my opinion anyway.
