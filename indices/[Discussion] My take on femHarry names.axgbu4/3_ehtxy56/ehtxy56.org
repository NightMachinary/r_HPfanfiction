While I do tend to like the flower names of fem!Harry, for the sake of discussion I'll say that we really don't have any reason to believe that the Evans family had a naming tradition at all. Flower names for girls are common and a pair of parents deciding to give their childrens' names a theme doesn't mean it's a tradition. For example, I know of three siblings with names all starting with "J" but that wasn't tradition, just the parents' choice. The Evanses were just your average muggle family too.

That said, according to the canon-ish Pottermore, James Potter's grandfather was called Henry but went by Harry so if there is any naming tradition at work then it's likely on James's side which would lend fem!Harry to be called Iolanthe, Euphemia, Dorea, or after an unnamed Potter relative.

But all three of those women married into the family and we don't have examples of any Potter daughters to go off of. The names of modern day Potter sons we have are Henry, James, and Harry, Fleamont not counting as he was named for his grandmother's maiden name.

If fem!Harry's name is based on tradition then it would be a name with similar origin to one of those, and wizarding families in general appear to have a tradition regarding middle names. Firstborns are named after their parent (Sirius Orion, Harry James, William Arthur, Ginevra Molly, Albus Percival) however there are exceptions (Tom Marvolo, Fleur Isabelle, Remus John) so it is likely that fem!Harry's middle name would be Lily.

Personally, I like the name Iolanthe, however unlikely it is to be used. It's both a Potter ancestor name and a flower name and it can be shortened to just first two syllables which would be pronounced like "Aya"

I read one where her name was Mary Jane Potter, Mary seeming like a Potter-ish name but then Mary Jane turning it into not quite a flower name, but at least a plant, and the implication was funny.

Holly is good too. Similar to Harry but different enough that it doesn't make Lily and James seem like lazy baby namers:

"We'll name him Harry."

"And if it's a girl?"

"...Harriet."

The names tend to influence how I read the character too, with female variations on "Harry" reading more as being the same character we know, but as a girl, while names more distant to that read more as "Lily and James had a daughter instead of Harry."

Both of those have their strengths.

I really like etymology and name discussion.
