I like when Fem!Harry is given a flower name to follow the fanon Evans women convention. I feel like it adds a bit of character to Lily that we see nearly none of in the books. From the little we see of her she was a very confident and assertive woman, but less than five years later her only child has his (notoriously egotistical) father's name as his middle name and first name following the royal-ish first name trend of his father's family.
