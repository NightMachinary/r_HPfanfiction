I always found Harriet to be just lazy -- basically Harry modified to fit a female.

For some reason, Violet is stuck in my headcanon as Lily's mother (unsure if she has a canon name), probably originates in some fic featuring her prominently. This makes it a rather likely fem!Harry name if I was trying to not just select the first name that pops into my head but try to consider the actual ramifications (IIRC the Evans parents dies around 1978-1979, making it plausible for Lily and James to name their offspring to honor them).

When I think "fem!Harry name", my first go-to is always Rose Lily Potter. Yeah, a flower name, I'm boring like that.
