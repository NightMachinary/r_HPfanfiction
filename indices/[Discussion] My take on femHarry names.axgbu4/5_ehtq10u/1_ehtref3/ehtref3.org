It's been around since 2011. linkffn(6893492)

I'd say it originated in HP crossover fics where Harry needs a different name to fit in with the characters of the cast, where "Harry" sticks out when everyone else is "Sayuri-san" or "Ellesmira". Obviously, the authors of those fics don't care about retaining the spirit, tone, and characterization of the original, which is why it doesn't matter to them that Harry always imagined himself to be "Just Harry", and cared more about having a family than being famous and cool.

From crossovers, it was watered down to fantasy AU's where creature inheritances exist, and down to your everyday genderflip AU's.
