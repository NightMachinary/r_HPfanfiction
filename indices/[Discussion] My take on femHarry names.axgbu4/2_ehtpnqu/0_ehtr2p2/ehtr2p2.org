I too found Victoria Potter to be a breath of fresh air, haha.

That is kind of the core problem with fanfiction as a community. Something original that's read by a lot of people has its unique elements stripped out and dumped into the trope sludge and then people with no actual ideas for their stories just vomit the tropes into countless interchangeable fics until we're all sick of them. The problem is figuring out who predates the trope swarm, and figuring out who may be using a trope but is doing it artfully or for a good reason.

To be realistic, I think that's exactly what happened with Harriet, even though I do think that it was a bad and lazy choice the very first time someone did it.
