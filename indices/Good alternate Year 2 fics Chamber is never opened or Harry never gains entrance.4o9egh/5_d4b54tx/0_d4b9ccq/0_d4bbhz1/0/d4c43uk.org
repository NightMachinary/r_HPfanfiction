For what it's worth I would argue that this story has the makings of what could be a very interesting plot line. I would concede that it can be clich√© at times, but I think the author at least has an idea about where they want to take it. I personally like how it doesn't just follow the books. You also have to look at it from the perspective in the books themselves they go and try to get Lockhart to help. I've read so many fanfiction over the years that to be honest it is stories like this that I find the most refreshing. They don't just follow the books. Yes it has cheesy moments. I still defend that it should at least be given a shot.
