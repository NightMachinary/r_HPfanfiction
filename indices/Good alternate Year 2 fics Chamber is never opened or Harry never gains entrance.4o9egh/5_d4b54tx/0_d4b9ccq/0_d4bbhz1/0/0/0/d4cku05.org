I think that it just depends on the author. I don't know how much you have read, but so far there is a redemption of sorts for Ron. If you haven't read this story then don't drag on it. Personally I have problems with Ron, but that is not to say I don't like him. He very much is a real person. This story sort of talks about how he is a real person. No it's not point blank said, but I don't think it needs to be.

I think it is fair to be tired of authors getting rid of Ron to bring in their own characters, but I don't really think that is happening here. I think that it could use some work and that it has its moments, but overall I think it has promise.
