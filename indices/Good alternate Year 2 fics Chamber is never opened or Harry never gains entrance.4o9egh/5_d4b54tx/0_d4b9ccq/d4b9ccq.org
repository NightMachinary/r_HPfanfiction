I stopped reading right after the first few paragraphs when Ron wanted to go to Lockhart and then freaked out and cursed at Harry when Harrry said they should go to a different professor. Cue the twins stepping in and telling Harry Ron can't handle pressure etc. etc.

Sounds like a standard "I hate Ron so I'll get rid of him right away" plot.
