The title turned me off initially because I thought it's just another 'Lord Potter' drivel, but the story greatly exceeds my expectation.

Years 2-3 are already very different, the author clearly follows a logical progression of the story instead of slavishly adhering to canon stations, which I greatly appreciate.
