I know a few stories like this, I am trying to remember them but plots blur after a while.

Delicate - linkffn(2926255) - A misunderstanding and drama between the family in the beginning but they work things out and still treat each as family.

Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift - linkffn(7969757) - Another story where Harry isn't with Ginny but the family is supportive.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A well thought out and interesting world-building story that also delves more into the magical culture. It does start out Ginny and Harry but they end up breaking up yet the family is still supportive.

There are more but I can't think of them at the top of my head.
