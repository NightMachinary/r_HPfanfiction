I gotchu linkffn(9406877) it's a few chapters in where it shows up. Harry is bi but romance isn't the focus, and honestly it's mostly about family and friendships. Also has Parseltongue that actually serves a purpose in the story instead of being a house trunk locking mechanism. And where Harry has titles but he hates them because of responsabilities. And actually interesting OCs. Honestly it has a lot of cool things going.
