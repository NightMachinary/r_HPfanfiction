I always find it hilarious in this fic that Harry finds out his mom's not dead, has had a body for the last few years, yet hasn't contacted him, instead choosing to fuck Snape and have his babies, and his reaction is basically, 'eh'.

Spoilers for those who haven't read it yet and want to discover on their own.
