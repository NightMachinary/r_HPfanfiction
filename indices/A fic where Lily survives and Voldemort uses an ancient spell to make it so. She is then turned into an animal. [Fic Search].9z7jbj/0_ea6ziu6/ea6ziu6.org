linkffn(Obscura Nox Animae)

I was 80-ish percent through it before I dropped it because nothing ever happens. It's just a slog to work through.

I mean I get it's character- and not plot-focused, but that were a lot of words to say "Lily got eventually turned into a human, fought a bit with Severus, and absolutely did nothing except hide in a room."
