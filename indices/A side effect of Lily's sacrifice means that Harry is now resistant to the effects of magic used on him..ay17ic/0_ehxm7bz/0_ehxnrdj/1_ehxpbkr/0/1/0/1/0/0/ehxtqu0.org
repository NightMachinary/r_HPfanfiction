Right, I had forgotten that Voldy put a Full Body Bind on Neville that he broke out of in DH.

So yes, it does appear that the magic invoked by Lily's sacrifice for Harry, and then Harry himself for everyone else, does confer a degree of resistance to spells along the lines of what the prompt suggests - at least /in the specific case of spells cast by Voldemort/

Whether this applies to spells cast by others or not is less clear. However, it /is/ mentioned in OotP that Harry was */the only one in their DA Class the previous year/* who could fully throw off the Imperius Curse, so I suppose it is possible that this protection could be more general.
