I think it's mentioned in passing that the spell broke with Dumbledore's death, but since the books are from Harry's point of view, this could be just his theory on the subject.

That being said, I don't believe there's any confirmed example of someone breaking out of such a spell through sheer force of will. Neville, of course, was immobilized in this manner by Hermione in /PS/, but there's no mention of how he was freed from it - whether on his own or someone helped him. I feel the latter is more likely.
