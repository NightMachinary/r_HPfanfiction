I'm not sure what you mean. You said it doesn't make sense that the spell would break with Dumbledore's death.

This is because Harry's protection is working for their benefit. I also wasn't arguing that these spells can't be broken, but rather that Harry definitely didn't break the body bind by Dumbledore by himself. That's all.
