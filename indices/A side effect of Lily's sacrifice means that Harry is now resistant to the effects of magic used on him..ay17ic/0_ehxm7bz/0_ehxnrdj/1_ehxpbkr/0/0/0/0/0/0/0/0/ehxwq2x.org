Harry did not break the body-bind through sheer willpower or magic of his own. There's nothing that suggests he broke it alone. The timing of its breaking, however, highly implies it was Dumbledore's death that did it --- or that Dumbledore wandlessly cancelled it right before the Killing Curse hit him.

Either way, Harry is not responsible for the body-bind breaking.
