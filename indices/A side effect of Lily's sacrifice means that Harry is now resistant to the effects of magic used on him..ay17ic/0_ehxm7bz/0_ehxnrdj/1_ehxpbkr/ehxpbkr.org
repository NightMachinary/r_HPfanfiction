Off the top of my head, I remember Dumbledore putting him in a body-bind and Lockhart vanishing every bone in his arm.

Now, what would be funny is if the spell Lockhart cast at his hand was a real one and it was Lily's protection that changed the spell due to Harry's own freak out. Perhaps even the obliviate Lockhart cast would have worked even with Ron's broken wand if not for Lily's sacrifice?
