You are not wrong that she uses a lot of potions, but spells do have their place in canon. There are many healing spells, even minor ones, that are referenced in canon. That however, is largely irrelevant. Even if we take the fanon approach of "no spells, all potions" for the actual healing, there are still things like diagnostic charms that are critical to the overall process. If the diagnostic charm fails, or worse simply doesn't detect everything, then Pomfrey may well give Harry potions. But she may not give him enough, or worse, the wrong one entirely due to an inaccurate diagnosis. Regardless of whether the spells do the actual healing or not, this still royally ducks Harry over in the medicine department.

Edit: also, potions are magical too, what makes you think magical resistance of this nature would only affect spells cast with a wand? Magic is magic regardless of the source. This would probably turn Skelegro into "Splintergro"
