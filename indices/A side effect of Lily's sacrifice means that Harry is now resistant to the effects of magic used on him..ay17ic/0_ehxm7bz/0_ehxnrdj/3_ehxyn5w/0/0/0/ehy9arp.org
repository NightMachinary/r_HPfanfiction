I would assume the potions wouldn't work as well at the “normal” dosage amounts. That's something that happens in the real world too and usually a higher dosage or something is given and the patient doesn't experience the side effects associated with the high dosages.

I'd assume dosage is similar between all students? We see that on otc medications all the time and/or it's based on weight. A vanished bone is a vanished bone - doesn't require much of a spell to diagnose that. Maybe the healing hurts less or properly knocks out patients for anyone not-Harry?

I do wonder...if her spells do work properly, why isn't he getting nutrient potions and whatnot? Is he just not as abused in the books? (And by not as abused, I meant in comparison to the abused Harry fics)
