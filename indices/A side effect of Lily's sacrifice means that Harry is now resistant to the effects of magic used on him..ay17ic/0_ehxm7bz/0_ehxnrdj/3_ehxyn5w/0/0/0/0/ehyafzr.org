Possibly, and as for the abuse, fanfic authors go to extremes when it comes to that. The abuse he suffers in the books is for most part psychological and emotional. He is certainly at least partially malnourished and likely suffers the consequences of that in how short he is. But the physical side of his abuse, while still abhorrent, is very minor. The psychological and emotional ramifications of, for instance, being referred to as "freak" as the primary form of address are far worse. Though without doubt the most insidious abuse of harry is the near Pavlovian conditioning he underwent in regards to academics. (In the books he is punished whenever he gets better grades than Dudley, something that is not at all helped by Hermione's near enabling behaviour of letting him use her notes and correcting his answers) which likely resulted in his permanently performing poorly on written assignments, homework, and anything other than practical work. He clearly pays attention and is capable.of studying, as evidenced by the fact that he knew enough DADA to teach despite (as Umbridge rightly said) having extremely inconsistent instruction in the subject. Any one of the abuses Harry suffered at the Dursleys is enough to subtly wreck someone's life, all of them together? Best case scenario Harry should have been a complete wreck and unable to function in society. Worst case, another Voldemort.

People don't exactly exaggerate Harry's abuse, but they do get the specific type and effect wrong consistently.
