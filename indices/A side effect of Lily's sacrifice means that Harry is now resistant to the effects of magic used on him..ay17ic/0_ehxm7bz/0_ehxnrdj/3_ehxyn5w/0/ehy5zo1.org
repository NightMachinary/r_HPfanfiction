I'll admit I haven't read any of the books since they originally came out, but I always remembered Harry drinking potions? Iirc even in the second book she said she could've healed it with a spell had Lockhart not vanished every bone in his arm.

I only remembered her using spells in fanfics, particularly the ones where Harry finds out he's heirs to everything great and Dumbledore sucks.
