To be fair, I think the only spells he actually gets hit with in canon are unforgivables.

He never actually has a full on duel like he does in fanon, for all that he's supposed to be really good in defense. It's usually his friends who get cursed.

You could make the argument that this is true because he can throw off the imperius and is still able to fight even after being crucio'd which is so bad it can drive people insane with prolonged exposure. And he survived two killing curses....
