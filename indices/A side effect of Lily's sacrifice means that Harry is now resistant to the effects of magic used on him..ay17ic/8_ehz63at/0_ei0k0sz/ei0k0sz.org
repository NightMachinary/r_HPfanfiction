I think it was because Lily was actually given a choice to live and she refused to save her son.

Voldemort has 0 empathy so he would have just killed every member of a family he atacked previously.

That means no matter how many mothers would be willing to die for their sons/daughters, Voldemort wouldn't have given them the choice to live anyways.

So my theory holds that its because Snape begged him to spare Lily (and Voldemort actually tried to) that Lily's sacrifice counted as willingly dying.

We can also go the route of Fate, and the prophecy existing made the magic so Harry would survive and fullfil it.
