Liches' bodies grow back automatically near their phylactery, I believe.

I don't think it's as simple as a manufactured body, since it was a raw and bleeding baby, identical to the portion of his soul that was in Harry's scar that appear in Kings Cross station.

You'd think if he knew that as soon as he died this would happen, he'd have a ritual all set up and ready to go so he could get back on his feet.

Voldemort was stuck as a disembodied spirit for 13 years (give or take) until he got his first body back. Which he was desperate to do. Why on earth would he not use a lesser ritual for now to return him to his previous form? Especially since he didn't know about the blood protection until 11 years into the game?
