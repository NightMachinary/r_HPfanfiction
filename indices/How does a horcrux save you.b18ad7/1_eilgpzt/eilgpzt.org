It's a Phylactery. It Anchors your Soul. In Harry Potter you don't die unless your Soul passes on. Which is why Voldemort would live until all of his Anchors were gone. Voldemort is basically a very minor Lich, the difference being he still has a Soul.

If Voldemort put his whole soul into one Horcrux, he'd have gone Lichmode. As it was, he was "Less than the meanest ghost" so he needed to rely on possession and a follower in order to get his body back, but his Soul was anchored.
