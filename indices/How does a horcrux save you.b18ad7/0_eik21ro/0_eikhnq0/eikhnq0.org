I think a really important question/distinction is what happens when your body /isn't/ completely obliterated, as Voldemort's was.

So canon Voldemort was a disembodied spirit, who had to arrange for an entirely new body. That's a pretty difficult task, to say the least.

But what if it had been otherwise? If Voldemort's body had died, but was mostly undamaged? Could he have flown right back in? Maybe he'd have to have done some emergency magic to repair the death-causing damage, or to stop, er, decomposition, but it probably wouldn't have taken a decade and an obscure ritual.
