A few reasons that occur to me:

- Lack of loyal followers. By the time GoF rolled around, the only followers Voldie had that he still trusted were Barty Crouch Jr and Wormtail. Wait 20-30 years for Dumbledore to die off and they might be caught, disillusioned (in spirit, not the spell kind), or decide they're better off turning him in in exchange for leniency.
- If he's concerned about Harry still being a threat, better to try and take him out while he's a child and not experienced.
- Voldemort pretended he wasn't afraid of Dumbledore. It was just bad luck that got him killed the first time, so he'll just be a bit more careful this time around and steamroll his enemies properly.
