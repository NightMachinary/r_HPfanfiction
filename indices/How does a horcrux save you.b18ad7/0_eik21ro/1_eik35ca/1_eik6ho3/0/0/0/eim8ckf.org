Wormtail was not a moron. He was a snivelling and shallow man who became an animagus at a young age, successfully faked his own death by using a curse powerful enough to blow up an entire street, managed to locate his master despite not even knowing which country he was occupying.

Voldemort had 14 long years to figure out ways to regain his mortal form, and was well acquainted with the dark arts. He probably didn't make these two ways from scratch. If his plan involved this exact ritual in these exact circumstances, then he'd have a cauldron, some random enemy blood, Bellatrix's toe, and his father's dust ready and waiting in the same spot together with a possessable monkey waiting nearby.
