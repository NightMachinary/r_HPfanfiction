My whole point is this: the preexistence of horcruxes mean there has to be a way that everyone else who successfully used them to come back to life. Voldemort didn't have anything like that set up at all for his backfiring killing curse, which leads me to believe that something different happened after it backfired than would have happened if he died any other way.

He took extensive precautions if he were to suffer a mortal wound (making five horcruxes) and yet didn't bother even thinking of how he'd get back on his feet if he suffered a mortal blow?
