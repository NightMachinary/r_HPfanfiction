  I interpreted that as the state of having part of your soul infused in an object.

Slughorn was talking about the person making the Horcrux. That death would be preferable to subsisting as a barely existing thing that would have a cursed afterlife.

  If he had to invent a whole new spell/potion/ritual thing after he was vanquished then surely it was not an expected result of being 'killed'.

That's my point. Given his overwhelmingly power and ability, he wasn't expecting to be killed. The Horcruxes were insurance in case he was. But it's clear he didn't have everything together at that point, as he hadn't even finished making Horcruxes yet. Not only was his attempted murder of Harry supposed to be used to make a new Horcrux, Nagini was made after he had a temporary body, right? To me, these indicate a plan still being set up, so in essence you're kind of right that he wasn't prepared, but he was building up to being so
