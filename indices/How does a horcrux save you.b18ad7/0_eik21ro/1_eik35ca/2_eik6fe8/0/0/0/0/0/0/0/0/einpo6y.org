Based on what Voldemort said, either no such method existed or the Resurrection Potion he used was that method. I don't think theres any suggestion that his state after being 'killed' was odd to him. He doesn't ever indicate it was not as expected, he thought it proved his work had been a success. And based on what Slughorn said, I think it's clear being a wraith is the undesirable existence referred to.
