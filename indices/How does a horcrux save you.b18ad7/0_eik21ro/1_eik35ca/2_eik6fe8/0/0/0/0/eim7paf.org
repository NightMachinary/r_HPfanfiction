I didn't say he did it before he lost his body. I'm saying the Horcruxes we're insurance, he likely never expected anyone would manage to kill him. Especially before he even managed to conquer one country. He wasn't prepared to need them so soon, I assume. But that was the point in making them: just in case.

And becoming a wraith is what is supposed to happen to a Horcrux bearer whose body is brought to death. That was what Slughorn was saying when he reacted negatively to Riddle's questioning, saying (paraphrase) "Who would want to exist in that state? Dying would be preferable". Even that aside, he seemed to regard it as expected.
