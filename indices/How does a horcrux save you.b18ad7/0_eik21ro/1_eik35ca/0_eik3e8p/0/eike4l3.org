Eh, I can blame him just fine. It's an obvious step to make sure that you will be revived, but none of his followers had any clue that he even had such contingencies in place.

He definitely should have had a follower, known only to him, hidden away in some other country under an unbreakable vow to revive him. He had a horcrux for over 40 years before his first death. Plenty of time.
