Are there actually some reverse-WBWL stories, where everybody thinks it is Harry, but it is actually somebody else (most likely Neville)?

After years of struggling being in the centre of the magical war, he is suddenly unimportant person on the edge attention, dealing only with Qudditch, homework and girls. And surprisingly, Ginny still sticks to him, not because he is BWL, but she finds out he is genuinenly a great guy.
