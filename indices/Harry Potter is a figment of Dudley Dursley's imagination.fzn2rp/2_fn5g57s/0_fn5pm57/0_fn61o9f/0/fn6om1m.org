Great! now we can end with Dudley fantasizing about the Battle of Howgarts and the apotheosic moment of Harry defeating Voldermort (Vernon's evil personification) only to leave a happily and fulfilling life (Married to a teen crush, having good children, a succesful career, good friends and long-lasting fame).....while in reality he's now an older man, fat, still depress, lonely, no wife, no kids, working on a depressive job...........
