So the dementor attack in little whinging had Harry defend him, then there was Figg (what does her presence mean? Perhaps she's a concerned neighbor who found him out there?) and afterwards, his father punished him for it.

You could pull an amazingly fucked-up scene with that - Dudley goes out into the field to do something final, argues with himself a bit, all the while a tiny part of his mind (Harry) tells him to hold on and stop. Then, Figg walks by, sees it and pulls him out of it. She brings him home, where Vernon is angry at him for it.
