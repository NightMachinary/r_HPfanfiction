The zoo represents feeling trapped. The snake is trapped in it's enclosure, just like Dudley is trapped in unhealthy home situation. Harry, a fragment of Dudley's personality, can literally talk to snakes, which means Dudley can empathise with their situation (and also project on captive animals, because this Dudley really likes projection). The ability to talk to snakes also sets Harry apart from his peers, representing Dudley's fear of being different, of being a freak his parents would hate. Dudley falling into snake's enclosure could be metaphorical, or it could be an actual accident with Dudley breaking the glass/pushing it into the enclosure (he was tapping and leaning on it in canon) and later being punished for it by being locked in his room. Possibly both.
