Was the one you read "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11866019/1/The-Labor-of-Light-Yagami][The Labor of Light Yagami]]" by any chance? If so, that author has many crossovers with that same fem!Harry in different universes. I particularly love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12160753/1/The-Wasteland][her HP/LOTR crossover]] in which the Ring has a mind of its own. Unfortunately it's the kind of spinoff that requires knowledge of the main fic to enjoy, so I'm usually hesitant to recommend it.
