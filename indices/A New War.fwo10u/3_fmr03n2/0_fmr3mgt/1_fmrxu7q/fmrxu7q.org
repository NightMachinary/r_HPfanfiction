  It is a great fic though

The fic in general was really well written and I enjoyed the whole cat and mouse aspect of the work. Just like canon however, I enjoyed everything except the epilogue. Unlike canon, which was an ending I could at least feel ambivalent about, the epilogue of Hallows and Pathos left me with a really bitter taste in my mouth.

PS: Thanks for reminding me of the name! :)
