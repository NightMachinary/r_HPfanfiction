There was actually a fic similar to this where UnspeakableChief!Hermione believed that she could harness the Hallow's energy to cure magical ailments and so she tries to hunt down Harry and force him to give up the Hallows. Can't remember the name, unfortunately, but hopefully somebody here remembers it.
