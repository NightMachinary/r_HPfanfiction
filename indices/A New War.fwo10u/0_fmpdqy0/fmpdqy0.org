I wonder where Harry and Ron would fall. Probably with Neville and Luna. It would make a really interesting sub plot of them having difficulty going against their friend and in Ron's case his wife. They would probably take the children and go into hiding either at Hogwarts or put up Fidelius Charms on a new hide out. They would be on a mad race to find the source before others and try to put it under fidelius and obliviate it from the secret keeper or make an unbreakable vow to never under any circumstance let it's location be known to another person or creature.
