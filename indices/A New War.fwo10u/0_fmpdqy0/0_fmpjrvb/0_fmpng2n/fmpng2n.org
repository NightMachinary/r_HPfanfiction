I don't think so. He would have faith in Hermione not to abuse it but he knows very well how easy it is for the Ministry to abuse it's authority as he has seen people become it's victims (Hagrid, Sirius, Buckbeak) and has himself been a victim of the Ministry. He is also prudent enough to think of the ramifications when he was 17 as shown by his actions regarding the Hollows and has been an Auror for than 2 decades.

He would probably have arguments with Hermione trying his best to make her reconsider and Hermione would do her best to make him see the benifits of her course of actions.

Another layer would be that Harry has led the aurors for a good while. He has fought alongside them and lead them. He would be highly respected, admired and liked which would make it really difficult for the Ministry to go against him with it's superior numbers as the Aurors would be reluctant and suspicious about going against Harry and many might retire or secretly defect and be a spy for him.

On the flip side Harry would not try to make it a public matter to prevent causing public disturbance to prevent increase in crimes and to save Hermione's reputation. He would try not to bring his comrades in the matter so that the Aurors would still be there to protect the public. They would be only asked to help if he needed it.

This would lead to it being a small team of Hermione and her most trusted trying to hunt for the Source while also trying to capture the others. They would not be fugitives officially as declaring them so would be risky as they have a lot of influence due to their positions.

It would be really interesting to see it.
