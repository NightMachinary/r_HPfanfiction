Yeah there's a lot of room for characters struggling with divided loyalties here. Harry would have helped build the Ministry as it currently is, is that enough to make him trust it with this power?

The 'children' are also an area for interesting stories here. They would be mostly grown by this point and would be making their own choices for where to place their loyalty.
