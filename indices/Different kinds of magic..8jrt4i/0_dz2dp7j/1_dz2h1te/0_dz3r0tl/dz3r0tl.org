If I were going to invent a Linux spell system, hrm...

A complex ritual compiles a spell into a usable template that is then stored in the casters mindscape. Supplying mana to the spellform (template) activates it.

Imagine a room with runic script running everywhere. When the caster completes it all the runes seem to glow and then flow from the walls into the casters head leaving the entire room bare of any runes.

Spellforms don't require a wand to use but there is no customization to a compiled form. It always does exactly what the ritual was designed for. Pragmatic but not artful.

The strength of a linux wizard is how many spellforms his mind can hold and how versatile his ritual making skills are for producing spells with variable effects.
