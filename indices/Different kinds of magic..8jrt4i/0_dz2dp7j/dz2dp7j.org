I've always liked the idea that wand magic is like the Windows OS of magic. That there are all kinds of ways to use magic but wands are the most user friendly and widely used and thus also becomes the most developed system with the widest selection of spells that others have made.

Sure you can use another OS but "programs" aren't cross compatible. Less usage = less collective man hours invested on a societal level = less developed. Not necessarily worse or not as powerful, just less researched.
