Not the full extent of your request, but my old favorite of Azkaban yarns, linkffn(Dementors by Myranya), does have everyone at Hogwarts /not/ turning on Hermione when she's sent to Azkaban, /and/ her being sent to Azkaban because she actually used an Unforgivable on another wizard (though the wizard in question was a Death Eater and the story treats it as a "end justifies the means" situation).
