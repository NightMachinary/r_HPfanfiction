linkao3(32436069) I just discovered the above fic (series technically) and holy shit there is so much in it that would be beyond epic in film. Honestly this series gives me more emotion and chills than the actual books did.

Not getting the bot to work it's called the Accidental Animagus and can be found on either AO3 or fanfic.net
