What I wish for is JK Rowling went to WB and pointed to the Fanfiction community. And we got a series, one season for one fanfic that is complete.

Kinda like a Netflix series.

For example A BLACK Comedy would have a full series, 10 or 12 episodes and is produced by the creator(if they are available) and actual directors.

And each season has different actors for the same characters. And maybe we can have a Unatoned season where Radcliff comes back one more time.

I wish this would actually happen.
