Many Northumbrian stories: linkao3(1857084;1623053), AFTER FINALLY FINISHING linkao3(3068435) (of course, skip over first four chapters), actually stories involving brothers Creevies would be lovely short films (particularly linkao3(1709177) and linkao3(8468188)), all crime stories, linkao3(7155281) would be a nice historic short flick. I really believe that he writes with film scenes rolling in front of him (morning in the tent on the elevated platform with Harry and Lavender Brown sitting in front of it).

Talking about historical films, of course, linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia).
