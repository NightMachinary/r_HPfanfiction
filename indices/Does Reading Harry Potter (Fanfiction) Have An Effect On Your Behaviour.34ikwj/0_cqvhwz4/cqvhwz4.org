I'm too lazy to look up links at work, but there is sufficient data to support that the Harry Potter books themselves practically shaped a generation. The kids who grew up with HP are more likely to be tolerant of other religions/nationalities/ethnicities/sexual orientations, and there was some research that found a correlation between voting for Obama and being an HP fan. It's pretty interesting stuff. And then of course there's the Harry Potter Alliance, which is a non-profit organization that fights for Human Rights all over the world. I'm pretty active in that community, and it's one of my favorite parts of being an HP fan.

As for fanfiction, I would say that readers in general are more accepting of Slash pairings even if they don't read it...you know, exposure theory and all.
