I'm extremely interested in politics, and if I made a political HP fic, I would make that clear from the beginning in order to avoid people being turned off later. In general, though, I like fics that get a bit political, as long as it doesn't involve irrelevant irl things.

As for behavioral changes, my catchphrase is "I hate everything," which I got from "So You've Decided to be Evil," my favorite crackfic ever. I've also caught myself unironically saying "Merlin's beard," but that was only once.
