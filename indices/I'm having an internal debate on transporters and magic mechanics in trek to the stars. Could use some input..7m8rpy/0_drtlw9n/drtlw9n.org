Imagine if all the magic spells and effects and such were enacted by spirits that followed you around. When you flick a wand with a spell in mind, the spirit living in the wand translates your intent for others to bring about. Normally when apparating, a wizard opens an aperture between here and there, and the spirits go with him. When a transporter moves him, the spirits aren't included, and it takes a little while for them to figure out where he's gone off to. The wand and other enchanted items do what they can because they're attached to the hardware.

Lumos would work, as would the Cloak.
