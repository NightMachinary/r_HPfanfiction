I mean, it certainly seems that every student fits in the Hogwarts Express at once considering that they ride that train to school. Harry, Hermione, and Ron often had ample room for more people in their compartments and given spatial expansion and other magic, I have no doubt wizards could turn the Hogwarts Express into a completely self-sustaining environment. Of course, it begs the question, why'd they'd choose the Hogwarts Express instead of a building or something else. The snowpiercer didn't make sense, already, before adding in magic that makes an environmental failure a non-issue.
