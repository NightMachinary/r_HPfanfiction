Ok so I looked it up and it says that the express can hold up to 336 passengers. Assuming that there are at most 35 students from each year that would be about 245 students. That's without accounting for floor and apparition. Keep in mind that the train stops in Hogsmeade, a place where families can easily apparate or floor into. So I'm sure there is enough space. I don't know how to answer your other questions though. I am limited to research.
