I want to add [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]] to this list. I absolutely loved this one, but I read it before creating an AO3 account so I couldn't find it to recommend it earlier. Some lovely people on this sub were willing and able to assist me. This fic is both (mostly) epilogue compliant and Drarry! I think the less you know the more you'll like it, but I'll put a brief summary under a spoiler tag if you don't want to enter blind. Harry is sleepwalking through life with his epilogue kids. He helps someone who "repays" him by dropping him into a universe where he and Draco are together.
