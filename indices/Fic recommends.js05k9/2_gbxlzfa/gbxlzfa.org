I've been training my whole life for this moment. I'll make several comments because my total post is too long.

Post-Hogwarts

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. They are complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face.... It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20636933/chapters/49004756][Making Do]] is a story of a miserable, broken man who is forced to reckon with a world he never anticipated living long enough to see. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad Says"]] is an EWE. Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there. I thought the writing could tend a bit towards the melodramatic, but I also stayed up until 1:45 a.m. reading it all in one go, so I kinda have to recommend it :-P It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]], the consequences of Malfoy's petty act of revenge force him to actually engage with the world around him. Trust me. He hates it too. It is complete.
- In a similar vein, Draco acts the fool and gets himself stuck in a Groundhog Day situation in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]]. If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the second result. Very good. It is complete.
- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series is touching. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive. It is complete.
- Practically everyone has read this, but I would be remiss if I didn't include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. It is almost universally beloved for its wit and originality. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is a very popular fic on this site. Honestly, the "ooh, I'm so dark for doing morally grey things" bit kinda wears on me, but I read it and enjoyed it well enough that I think it's worth a rec. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]], Harry is training to be a Healer and rotating through departments. He ends up in Chemical Dependence (basically rehab). An old rival is currently running the department and Harry is forced to face old wounds. It is complete
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]] is the polar opposite of the last one. This is a dark mystery wherein Harry is trying to find his wife's killer. It is complete.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- Edited to add: In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]], Harry gets a glimpse of a world where he made different choices. It is Drarry and epilogue-compliant. Complete

Etc.

- This is by the author of a very famous fic, A Black Comedy (recommendation in the following section). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] is almost like a series of one-shots wherein Harry pops across dimensions killing Voldemorts as he goes. It's a crackfic and, like nonjon's more famous work, can be a bit... problematic at times, but is still generally a good read. It is generally but not exclusively set in Harry's Hogwarts Years, so I put it in the etc. section.
- Difficult to place this one ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]) in time. Harry made a bargain with Time to defeat Voldemort. Every time he dies, he jumps back to the summer Sirius died. I gobbled it up the first time I read through, but is less good on the reread. That said, it definitely picks up from the first few chapters. The author has recently completed the sequel.

To find these, I went through my old favorites and read history on both FFN and AO3. Here are a few that I bookmarked/favorited but don't remember too much of the story.
