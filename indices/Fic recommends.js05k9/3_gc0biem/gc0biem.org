Here are some of my favourite longer fics that haven't already been mentioned:

linkffn(Exile by bennybear)

linkffn(The Daring Win by Lomonaaeren)

linkffn(A Very Secret Diary by schlangengift)

linkffn(Blackpool by The Divine Comedian)

And a Handmaid's Tale crossover. To skip the Handmaid's Tale part of you're not a fan of that show/book, start at chapter 26 for a fantastic tale of guerrilla warfare and moral conflict around dark curses, prisoner interrogation and spies.
