I've been training my whole life for this moment. I'll make several comments because my total post is too long.

Fics set during Marauders' Time

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It is complete and has a sequel

During Harry's Hogwarts Years

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is an AU wherein Sirius never went to Azkaban (for reasons explained in-text). Harry spends his days going to Sirius' bookshop until Sirius discovers canon-level abuse and steals Harry away. There are consequences. Sadly, the author is unfinished, but they got up to year 3, so I think it's still worth a read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]] is another one that's probably abandoned but worth reading anyway. In this one, Lockhart accidentally crosses paths with Sirius on November 1st, 1981. Recognizing the PR opportunity, Lockhart decides to raise Harry and obliviates Sirius.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25925863/chapters/63012685][Realizations]] was one of the first fics that got me in the fandom. The author dropped it ten years ago and is coming back to it this year and reworking it. It was originally published between book 5 and 6. WIP
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned). It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is a Snape/Harry mentor story. I like this one because Snape is still a bastard, but he's not the kind of bastard that can watch a kid get abused (canon levels) and do nothing. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- In the world of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][Grey Space]], students get Hogwarts letters at 14. I honestly think that the less you know the better. I love the writing style and it has my favorite kind of magic: homespun rituals (like Life Skills Outside the Curriculum). It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is complete. In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right. Harry has to be crafty. He can't rely on his power to win.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][The Accidental Animagus]] universe is still being updated. Harry escapes the Dursleys with accidental magic and ends up at the Grangers. Frequently recommended. The author has a great expansion on the Magical World.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778006/1/Smoke-and-Mirrors][Smoke and Mirrors]] in ages, but I remember genuinely enjoying it. Basically, Harry is a street kid who grows up in Muggle gangs. (complete)
- I know this one is hella famous and even more controversial, but if you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], you should give it a try. If you don't like it by, say, chapter ten, then it's not for you. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] is a crackfic wherein Harry is very nearly a squib. He has to be cunning to get by. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is a little aged, tbh. The author hasn't updated in a few years, but true love lasts a lifetime. This is a bit of a rough read, but all the worst stuff is in the first chapter. Basically, the Dursleys turned Harry against magic and he kind of has a house elf mentality.
- I loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12959277/1/Paradox][Paradox]]. It's got stabby Hermione from an alternate universe, dimension hopping to a universe where Grindelwald rules, and an engaging plot. What else could you want? It is complete.
- Edit to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]: Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys, forcing an impromptu visit supervised by Snape. How will Snape react to seeing Harry's treatment by the Dursleys? In ways that are not out of character but also not super dickish. Complete with one sequel complete and another in the works.
- Edited to add: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge. COMPLETE.
- Edited to add: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. I'm embarrassed I didn't include this before, probably because it's just so well known. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
- Edited to add: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Definitely recommend this one.
