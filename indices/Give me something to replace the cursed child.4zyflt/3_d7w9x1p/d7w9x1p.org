I second Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time. And its sequel that's in progress, extremely long chapter (averaging 15k), a very very accurate depiction of all characters involved and a switch between Albus and Ginny POV (or Harry and Scorpius in the sequel) that makes it even better. Frankly one of the most well-written fic I've read in a long time ! Oh and the Cursed Child compliance does not impact the story (although I don't mind it at all, but some of you still do ;) ), it gives a really deep background for character interactions !
