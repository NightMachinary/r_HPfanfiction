Depending for your resurrection on minons who've clearly already failed you quite spectacularly already seems to me to be second-rate villainy.

If you /have/ to have a horcrux, you keep it securely locked away in a secret vault with the spare clone body or an easily-possessed golem or whatever's within the magical art of the possible for a resurrection that doesn't depend on someone else helping you.
