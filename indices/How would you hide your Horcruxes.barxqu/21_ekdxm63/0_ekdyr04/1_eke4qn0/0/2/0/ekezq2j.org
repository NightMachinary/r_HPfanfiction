I honnestly don't understand why Voldemort was so dismissive of Wormtail. I mean when you think about it, the guy is quite competent.

- He managed to be a spy for several month, and even gave Voldemort the location of the Potter, he can't be help responsible for the whole "Boy-Who-Lived" thing that followed.

- He tricked a powerful wizard into taking the blame for his crime, and even to make people think he is dead.- While living 12 years as a rat is definitively a fail, (why did he not just left to Australia or whatever and started a new life as Piere Pivert or whatever?), he still managed to hide in plain sight and probably managed to give Voldemort some interesting information when he came back.- He found Voldemort. The good guys seeked him and failed, the bad guys maybe tried and failed (not to sure about that), but he did it. And he even captured a Ministry worker on the way which led to GoF plan.- He resurected Voldemort, he did the ritual. Voldemort may has Harry's blood, but he is his flesh.

Having a follower like this is a win in my book (especially if he is only one in many).

So, why Pettigrew may not be as talented than a Bellatrix or a Snape, he still showed some true talent and cuning. And I don't understand why Voldemort relegated him to a post of servant for Snape (except if he is still crossed with the secret keeper things but other did as bad, like Lucius and it still took more faillure to really loose his place).
