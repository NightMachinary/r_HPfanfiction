You guys are all forgetting the point of horcruxes. It's not enough that they chain your soul to the mortal plane. If your main body dies, your only chance is for someone to get close enough to one of your horcruxes to be possessed. It's useless if you put a horcrux in space, as no one will be able to reach it then to bring you back. The best place, in my opinion, would be on an object that is in common use while able to have access to the news, as well as being indispensable so that it doesn't get thrown away. With these restrictions, there is really only one object that fulfills these conditions. Rita Skeeter's Quill
