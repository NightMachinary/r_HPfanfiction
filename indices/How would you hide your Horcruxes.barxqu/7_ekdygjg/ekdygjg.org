It really depends on what's required for your horcrux to help bring you back and what are the requirements of a horcrux vessel. If it can be anything (or even just anything with sufficient volume/surface area) and merely needs to exist, then probably the best thing to do would be to enchant a random brick, throw a dart at a world map, go to where it lands and install/insert the brick into a building or something.

No connections to you at all. You might have to spend a little more effort in making it unfindable by magic, but there ya go, though the HP verse seems to be pretty sparse on 'find it' divination magics. Even the "point me" spell, cannonically, only points north and not to whatever you want.
