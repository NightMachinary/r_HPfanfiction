Umm how about a random rock and throw it into the ocean if I don't want anyone to ever find my immortality.

Or on a space probe. (edit; didn't see you had put your computer in space, at least you got that part acceptable)

These is no reason to believe magic on the scale of preserving your soul wont interfere with electronics, especially as delicate as a supercomputer. Also super computers are only good tech for maybe the next 20 years so unless your horcrux can update itself with new technology it'd be obsolete quickly.
