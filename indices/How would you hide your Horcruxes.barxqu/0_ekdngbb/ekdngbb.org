Seriously, they were invented at /least/ back in Herpo the Foul's day (which is a long way back, he also invented the Basilisk, and Pliny the Elder included them in his /Natural History/ in the 1st Century) and in all the time from that day to this we haven't been completely subjugated by an immortal Dark Lord?

Clearly the wretched things don't work as advertised, and the modern-day exponent of the practise is no great advertisement for the side effects. The cognitive degradation /alone/ is a deal-breaker.
