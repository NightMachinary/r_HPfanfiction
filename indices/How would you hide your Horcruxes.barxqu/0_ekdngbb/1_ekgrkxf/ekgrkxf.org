This.

Horcruxes are more trouble than they're worth, even without taking into account having to murder someone to make one (suppose you have an enemy you hate; as a wizard or witch the rules of society already have a shaky grip on you at best, unless you let them).

If I were a Rowling-style wizard, I'd study human transfiguration as my discipline of choice to try for prolonging my life. This (along with very effective magical medicine when things go wrong physically) is my head canon for why some of the characters who aren't deep into the Dark Arts and don't take the Flamels' +Elixir+ Spice of Life ^{Dune or not, the Spice must flow!}, such as the Dumbledore bros, are long-lived and a lot more vigorous in their golden years, than any human being has business being.
