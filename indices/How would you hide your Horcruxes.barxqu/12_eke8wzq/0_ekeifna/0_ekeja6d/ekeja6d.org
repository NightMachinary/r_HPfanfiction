I know its never stated

but call it a headcanon but I feel for the horcrux ritual to work, the vessel must have some meaning to you

we know wizards have made them before and they all died so I think the reason is to make a horcrux you must put your soul into something that has some meaning to you meaning that people trying to kill you could work it based on that
