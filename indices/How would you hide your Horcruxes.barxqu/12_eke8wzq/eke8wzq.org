HAHAH YOU FOOL LIKE I SHALL FALL FOR THIS TRAP MY SECRETS ARE MINE

but honestly, I always assumed that to enchant a Horcrux the object must have some meaning to you

So seven objects, one of which I will use magic to put inside the body of a loyal follower on a rib cage

my follower would unknowingly hide the horcrux for the rest of his day and when he dies it will rest in his grave
