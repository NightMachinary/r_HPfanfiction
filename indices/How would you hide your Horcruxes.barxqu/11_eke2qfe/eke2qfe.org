I'd make mine a penny, go to a random town, and put it in a fountain. It either ends up surrounded by countless pennies, in some random thiefs pocket to never be spent, and it's an entirely different currency that most magical people who aren't Muggle born, can't seem to understand!

Although I'm a Hufflepuff, so let's face it, this isn't happening XD
