Use a rock and throw it in the Atlantic, as @smellinawin said. But @ConsiderableHat is definitely onto something, those things dont work as advertised, clearly. They dont affect aging for starters, which should be a big red flag in the first place. And Voldie is a clear example that they mess with your mind in a nasty way. Maybe Herpo realized he messed up after he made one and created the Basilisk in order to destroy his Horcrux and finally die.
