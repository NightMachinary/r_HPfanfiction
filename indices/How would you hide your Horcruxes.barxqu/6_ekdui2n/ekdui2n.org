Hm, depends I guess.

Either something innocuous that I could keep on my person that would never raise suspicion. Maybe a horcruxified hairtie? Or one of these contraception-chips that are implanted under the skin? A dental crown maybe?

Or something that can be used for self defense, a bit of hurcrux-induced selfawareness will probably enhance it's potency - Tommy had a nice idea with Nagini there. Maybe a selfaware bodyguard-drone once the technology has matured to a point where they are actually useful?

Sadly we don't know what exactly was required to restore Voldemort to a fully functional body (and what different ways there would have been), because you could double-porpuse one of these requirements and also use it as a horcux - less exposure to danger that way and it can be more efficiently guarded. Also, its a failsafe: If your way back to a body is destroyed anyway, an eternity as wraith seems like unneccessary torture. Personally I'd prefer death over that. That is why, while all those ideas about dumping a rock into the ocean etc. are certainly effective, they are no option for me. There are worse things than death after all, and if the hideout it too good for even me to retrieve the Horcrux, I might sentence myself to an eternity of suffering without a way out.
