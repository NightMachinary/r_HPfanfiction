I'm a hardcore Dramione shipper, so I have plenty of suggestions. As mentioned above, The Fallout by everythursday is excellent.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=832][Finders]] by everythursday is also a phenomenal read. It's darker and has a scary, haunted sort of feel.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732710/1/Silencio][Silencio]] by Akashathekitty is one of my personal favorites. The author has begun writing a sequel... and trust me, after reading that story, you'll be aching for more.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/The-Bracelet][The Bracelet]] by Akashathekitty is also a noteworthy read. It's rather lengthy, but it's definitely worth the time.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] by Bex-Chan is an excellent read. It's a WIP but the author is good with consistently updating.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172243/1/Broken][Broken]] by inadaze22 is a angsty and mature Dramione fic, and I haven't been able to read it without crying. It's well-written though.

And [[http://dramione.org/][Hawthorne and Vine]] is a wonderful source for all things Dramione. [[http://www.grangerenchanted.com/enchant/][Granger Enchanted]] is a great website for any fanfiction featuring Hermione.

Enjoy!
