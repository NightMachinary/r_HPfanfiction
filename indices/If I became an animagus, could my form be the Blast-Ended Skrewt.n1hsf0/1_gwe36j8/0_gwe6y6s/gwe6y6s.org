Maybe after they came into existence the possibility of an animagus form or patronus came into being at the same time. So McGonagall couldn't have become one, but anyone trying to become an animagi after Hagrid creates them might.

I wonder if extinct animals are a possibility then. Could someone have a T-rex patronus? Or a plesiosaur? Mastodon? Whatever that weird squirrel thing Scrat is supposed to be?
