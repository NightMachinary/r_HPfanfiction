Yes, Voldemort is specifically referred to by JKR as the "master soul". Even if he wasn't, however, I think it would be implied. The fact that the horcruxes act as anchors for Voldemort but do not anchor each other, and the fact that Voldemort's soul does not anchor the soul fragments in the horcruxes, demonstrates that the relationship between the horcrux and Voldemort is very much a subservient one.
