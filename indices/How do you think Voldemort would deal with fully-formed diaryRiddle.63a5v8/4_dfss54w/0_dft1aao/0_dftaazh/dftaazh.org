Is that true, though? I thought the fact that they're basically impervious to destruction except from the two most caustic substances in existence implied that they DO anchor each other. Just the fact that the horcruxes are intrinsically tied to physical objects means that destroying the object destroys the horcrux.

The soul pieces themselves obviously still exist after the destruction of the horcrux. That's implied when Harry (as per Dumbledore) encourages Riddle to repent during the final battle, so as to mend his soul. That would be an exercise in futility if the soul pieces were totally destroyed.
