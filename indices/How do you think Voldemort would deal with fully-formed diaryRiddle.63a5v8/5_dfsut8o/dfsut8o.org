I never knew I wanted to read a fic with Diary!Riddle fighting Voldemort.

Not necessarily as a good guy, because you can only change him so much. Maybe something like Harry vs Voldemort vs Diary!Riddle.

Maybe I should toy with this idea a bit more and write it.

I'm sure somebody must have written this but I never read Ginny-centric stuff so...

I'm rambling.
