I think that a slightly saner version of Voldemort would see Diary Riddle as a couple things. First, another potential, easy body. Second, as a powerful lieutenant that he can more or less trust to act in their best interest (at least for a while). And last, as a rival that he will eventually have to put down, or as an heir he can groom.

At least if I were writing it, Voldemort would use his two halves to divide and conquer his foes in the short term. He would try to achieve at least the conquest of Britain, but then both halves would turn on each other. Their can only be one Voldemort on the throne, and both would try to make sure that was them.
