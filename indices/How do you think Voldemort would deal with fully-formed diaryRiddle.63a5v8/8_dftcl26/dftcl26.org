When you think about it, Diariddle has the biggest part of Tom's soul. I think it would be very interesting to see them face each other for superiority over the other, and Voldie having difficulties because he has less soul, but also Tom having difficulties because he has more. Don't know if that's very clear but I'm suddenly getting an urge to write !!
