I've read a few where Riddle opposed / destroyed the insane Voldemort, but not really one where they cooperated. I think they would cooperate if both are sane. As for them destroying themselves, I'm sure Voldemort would rather feed the Horcruxes Draught of living death than destroy a portion of his own soul.
