I'm sure Voldemort would never kill a piece of his soul knowingly.

In CoS, Riddle showed loyalty to Voldemort, the man he would become. He asked Harry how he was defeated and despite having no knowledge of the prophecy, made it his goal to kill Harry.

I think that is enough proof that Tom and Voldemort would never become enemies.
