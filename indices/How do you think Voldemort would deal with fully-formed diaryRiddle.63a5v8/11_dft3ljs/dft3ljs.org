As someone already pointed out, Diary Riddle would be another horcrux. Voldemort can control his horcux with relative ease. The only interesting thing would be if the author allowed for Diary Riddle to actively fight the possession. If not, then Diary Riddle would probably be the best servant Voldemort could hope for - 100% controllable and already in the mindset that made Voldemort who he is.

In any case, I think Voldemort would treat him like he treats Nagini. He keeps them close, but controlled.
