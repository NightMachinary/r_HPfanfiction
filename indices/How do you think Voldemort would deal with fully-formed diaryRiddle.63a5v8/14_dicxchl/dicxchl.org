An interesting theory I read somewhere is that Voldemort /meant/ for his Diary self to eventually become corporeal, and would have had this younger self (for whom everything about his Hogwarts year is still fresh memories) become Headmaster of Hogwarts. The process, however, would only have started /after/ the total takeover of Britain, a plan that Lucius Malfoy completely mucked up when releasing the Diary in Second Year. Presumably, Diary Riddle would also fulfill Voldemort's dream of teaching Defense Agains the Dark Arts. All this would allow for Voldie to keep a direct handle on Hogwarts without having to personally give it all his time, which would be quite precious when he's the world leader.
