Well I guess my theory was that werewolves were started at one point way in the past with a wolf animagus who was cursed. The curse twisted the animagus form to being tied much closer to the human and forced transformation (maybe permanently since it was the first werewolf). A form of rabies could become the reason for transmission to others. And since other humans weren't inherently wolf in spirit/personality it caused the transformation to become painful because the wolf was taking over the other spirit form to force transformation and stayed. Also, some people have the inherent wolf spirit they would be more inclined to being a werewolf (Fenrir Grayback?) Lots of possibilities but that's kinda the top of my list.
