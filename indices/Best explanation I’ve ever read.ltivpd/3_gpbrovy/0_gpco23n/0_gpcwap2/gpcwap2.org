I've seen that sort of thing hinted at before ("The wolf was close to the surface, because it was near the full moon"), but something about the idea of a connection between a werewolf and a wolf soul doesn't feel right to me.

Would a wolf animagus have a connection to a wolf soul? In that case, you have to come up with an explanation for why the effects of having a wolf soul or a connection to one are different for a werewolf and a wolf animagus, because the werewolf transformation is described as difficult and painful. I don't know what canon says about the animagus transformation, but I've seen stories in which the animagus transformation doesn't hurt at all, and other stories in which it hurts the first time or first few times you transform, and after that it's not a problem.

I suppose you could posit that going through animagus training appeases the "wolf spirit," while having the connection forced onto you offends it (or something), but I think that leads into the question of the origin of werewolves and why there aren't other types of weres corresponding to other animal forms, or at least, why we don't see them. I think it would be hard to avoid becoming a were-mosquito, if they existed.

I have read stories (not HP fanfiction) with other types of weres - besides the Anita Blake books, which went overboard with various types of weres, I've read stories with characters who were werewomen and weredachshunds before.

On the other hand, if a wolf animagus does /not/ have a connection to a wolf soul, then how do they (and other animagi) learn how to handle their animal forms? How do they acquire the instincts of their form, or do they?

I suppose it all comes down to a matter of what kind of handwaving explanation fits your head canon.
