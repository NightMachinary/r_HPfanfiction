It seems to be from Su's POV though or rather third person following Su. I was wondering about something like that, but from the POV of someone who isn't the self insert. Like a Harry's POV tale of Su Li's self insert. Or Hermione's POV while a Peggy Sue Harry takes over in X-year. Going more for the canon character trying to solve the mysterious abrupt personality change/replacement, and further assuming that the SI or PS is trying to keep it a secret from everyone.

<EDIT2> okay, yes. The parts from Harry's POV are what I was looking for. So, this, minus the Su Li POV parts.
