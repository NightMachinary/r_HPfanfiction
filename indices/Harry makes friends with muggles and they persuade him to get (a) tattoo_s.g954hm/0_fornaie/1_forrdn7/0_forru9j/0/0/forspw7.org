It's not 'all wizards bad and poor muggles', I'm not sure why you jumped to that conclusion. The muggle group in question is presented as /very/ bad as well - their tactics are pretty dark, and the lengths to which they go to are not at all put in a good light. (For instance, capturing weak wizards and experimenting on them to find out their capabilities is not presented as a good thing).

Some of it is somewhat explainable (for instance, having your memory wiped by a wizard would be a pretty intrusive thing, if you discovered it again), and the isolation by wizards is also put as a selfish act in some sense (eg, potions and spells that could cure diseases being withheld because of it).

The extent of 'all wizards bad' would be that it looks at some of the ways wizards intrinsically look down upon Muggles, or don't even think about them, and paints that in a bad way - but it's more portrayed as cultural overlooking than anything else.
