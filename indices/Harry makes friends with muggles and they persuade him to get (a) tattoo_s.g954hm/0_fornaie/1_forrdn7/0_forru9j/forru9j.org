Define 'muggle wank'.

It does involve a group of muggles that's trying to uncover what's happening in the wizarding world, but for them it's heavily pieced together after being obliviated and stumbling across failsafes that the wizards overlooked. They are also a danger to wizards, but more on the flip side of the normal way it's looked at - by taking wizards by surprise, it's the main/only way in which they're a threat. It's a pretty balanced view of things - but if your threshold for muggle-wank is pretty low, then it might go past it.

It does have a pretty strong subplot of this muggle organization exposing the magical world, and Harry seems to be set on a course of trying to make both worlds integrate in some way - so if those aren't what you're looking for, it's probably not a great idea.
