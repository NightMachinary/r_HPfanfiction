A good 65 or so, but that's only my app-less fics that I haven't caught up on, such as the ones in space battles and sufficient velocity.

I have 687 fics in my fan fiction reader app, which is for fan fiction.net only and another huge chunk of fics in my subscribed to list on sv, sb, ao3 and royal road.
