I mainly use my desktop to search for fanfics to read. I have about 20-30 tabs open on chrome at any given point. I use an extension that allows me to download them as an Epub that I then use to read on either my phone or tablet. Keep all my fanfics in folders on my computer and google drives for access on my devices. Convenient for reading when traveling and feels more natural.
