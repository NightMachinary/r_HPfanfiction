Up until recently, I had nearly 500 tabs open on my iPhone. Not all of them were fanfiction, but I'd say the vast majority were fanfiction-related (either the fanfiction itself, pages of search results for a specific tag I liked, an author's page, etc.). I liked keeping them open in case I was in the mood for x tag again.

This was the case until a few days ago, when I accidentally hit a button that apparently closes all tabs open in Safari on an iPhone. I was really upset about it for a couple of hours because I also had some manga tabs open. I've since learned AO3 has features built in for what I was doing, so I'll probably never get that many tabs open again.
