Well, I closed one right before I came here, so 14.

I often have more open than that, but periodically I copy all the URLs into a text file for later. Then I end up opening more tabs that I eventually add to that URL list when I close them....

My URL list currently has (goes to count)... 104 fics, 52 author pages, and 30 rec lists.
