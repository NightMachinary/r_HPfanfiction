Only 9. I keep pretty meticulous track on a Google doc of what I've read (and when), what I'm reading, and what I'm planning to read, which, in conjunction with my being pretty picky and quick-to-decide with choosing what fics I read to completion and what fics I drop, helps keep that number of tabs dedicated to fanfiction under control despite the (to be frank, disturbingly) large amount of fanfic I consume regularly.
