I mean, the whole premise of bashing is that it isn't believable. That's why it's so relative - for some people, it's totally believable that Ron would abandon Harry when he didn't get Hermione or Harry refused to share his incredible amounts of wealth or befriended too many Slytherins, or whatever else. For others, it's basically unbelievable that Ron wouldn't be the loyal-est of loyal friends and a total tactical genius.

If you want to bash him, think about what you dislike most about him, what his most negative traits are, then work out ways for them to become more prominent in his character. If you want him to descend to that point (as some of your other comments seem to indicate), then work out your end goal and work backwards.

For example, you seem to want Ron to be hyper-against Slytherins. So, you start there and work backwards. What would get him to that point? Did he give a Slytherin a chance and have them betray him? Did one of them drive a wedge between him and Harry in a way that he picked up on? If you want to do anything believably, you need to have reasons for that thing to happen, and it needs to have verisimilitude (internal logic). You need to set up rules that the thing then obeys, so you have Ron disliking traitors and dishonesty, then Slytherins being that in a way that hurts Ron directly, thus pushing him in a direction that leads to him being hyper-against Slytherins.

If you want him to be irredeemable to your readers, give him something irredeemable to do. Though even that's no guarantee - this is a fandom that sees Snape, Voldemort, and Draco redeemed quite regularly, after all. But yeah, have him kill Hedwig or verbally abuse Harry for being abused or get angry and suspicious of someone then have him Imperio them to reveal their secrets or something.

Basically, think about what you'd hate someone for doing and get Ron to a place where he thinks doing that is perfectly justified. That's how you turn someone into a villain believably. Chart their Fall.
