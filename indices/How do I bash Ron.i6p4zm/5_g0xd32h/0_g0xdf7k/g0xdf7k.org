Ron isn't going to be evil. He's going to be jealous of Harry and very set in his beliefs, not to mention supremely loyal to Dumbledore. Ron won't agree with Harry's choices in life. They can't be friends anymore because of it. And they don't mesh anymore. Harry has changed too much over the summer, and Ron is going to be clouded with jealousy after he sees how powerful Harry has gotten.
