Ron and Harry will drift apart, but it will be on bad terms. They'll become more or less enemies. Ron will be jealous of Harry and feel "betrayed" by him, and Dumbledore will try to convince Ron to befriend Harry again. The circumstances won't allow them to ONLY drift apart. Ron will become an antagonist while thinking that he's in the right. So maybe it's not straight-up bashing.
