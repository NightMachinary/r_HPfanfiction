I'm not gonna do that. Don't worry. I figured I'd more or less use Ron's bad traits, and have Harry not forgive him for betraying him twice now. And considering Harry is going to change a lot in this fic, Ron and he won't have any more similarities. I'm fairly certain you've grown out of friendships, and it's like that in my fic. Ron and Harry don't mesh anymore, and considering Ron doesn't agree with Harry acting and consorting with Slytherins, their friendship is going to fall apart very quickly, and Harry is going to have to accept that. Actually, I'm going to use that as a part of Harry's character arc. He needs to accept that he can't go back to who he used to be and that he has changed.
