It's Tomarry.

And before you go batshit, I'm trying my damned hardest to make sure the relationship doesn't come off as abusive or one-sided. But, the fact is, Tom Riddle is very misguided. He never really had an adult mentor in his life. And the Horcruxes affected him quite a bit. I want him to reform, so to speak, but he won't really be perfect. Though I'll make sure that the isn't a megalomaniac or a serial killer. It will take some time, so I'll probably tag the fic as slow burn while Tom and Harry become friends. And they will be friends at first. Harry would be a good influence on Tom, and Tom will teach Harry.
