I'm writing a dark harry fic with the dark side being the good guys and dark magic not being evil. Though the dark still needs to realise that killing muggleborns isn't a good idea. With that plot in mind, I doubt Ron can accept Harry. And I don't want him to. At least one of Harry's friends need to betray him with this new plot in mind. I'm not deleting all of Ron's good traits, but it is clear that he is very stubborn and set in his beliefs, so he likely won't change. And considering Harry will not hesitate to torture people when they deserve it in my fic (though that would take some character development), Ron really, really won't agree with Harry's new ideals.
