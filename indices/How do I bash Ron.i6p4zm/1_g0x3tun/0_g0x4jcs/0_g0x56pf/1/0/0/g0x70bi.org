That is the truth. And Ron isn't a bad person. But he wouldn't agree with the path that Harry is going on. Harry is a dark wizard in my fic, and dark magic isn't actually evil. But Ron is too stubborn to get that. And he won't agree with Harry's changing personality or his new friends. Harry is maturing, he's getting more powerful. And Ron is getting jealous. They're growing apart. You aren't still friends with people you knew at 11, are you? It wouldn't be likely.
