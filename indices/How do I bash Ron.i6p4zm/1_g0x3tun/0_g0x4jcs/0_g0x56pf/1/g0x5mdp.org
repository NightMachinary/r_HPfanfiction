The story I'm planning is set in fifth year when, as far as Ron knows, all Slytherins are rotten. And considering that Harry spent the summer with try Malfoys (Harry finds out his bio dad is Regulus in this one), Ron really doesn't agree with Harry's new choice in friends. So I doubt he'll come crawling back to Harry. And even if he does, Harry wouldn't forgive him. Ron already betrayed Harry during the tournament, and he's proved that he's a fair-weather friend. Harry wouldn't want Ron to be his friend again, whether Ron is "evil" or not.
