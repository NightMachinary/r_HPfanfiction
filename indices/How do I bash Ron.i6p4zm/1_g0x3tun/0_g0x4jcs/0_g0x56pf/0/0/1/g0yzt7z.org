All you do is shit all over people for changing canon, or not supporting canon ships, all the time. Just go join the circle jerk at [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] if it means so much to you.

You think you're somehow witty and hip because you sarcastically attack anyone whose ideas don't meet your specifications of what a fanfiction based off a /children's series about wizards/ should be. If it matters so much to you, go re-read canon for the 700th time. But you can fuck right off with your backhanded insults against people who come here for help with or to share their creativity.
