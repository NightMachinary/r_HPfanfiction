This isn't even Haphne. Let me give you the fic summary:

It was quite a shock for Harry Potter to learn who he was. And it was even more of a shock for him to learn that the Malfoys could be civil, even downright kind to him, and, somehow, he doesn't hate it. Now if only he could get rid of these pesky feelings for a certain dark lord...

--------------

Now, I get you might hate it. But I don't give a fuck. I'm writing a slow burn Tomarry fic where Harry finds out he is the son of Regulus Black. And if you don't like that. So fucking what. I don't care. There are plenty of people that do.
