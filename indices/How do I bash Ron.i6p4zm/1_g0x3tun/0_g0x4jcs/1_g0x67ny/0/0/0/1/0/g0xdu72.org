Maybe. But Harry has changed a LOT over the summer. Ron won't be able to counterbalance that. And Hermione is going to be on Ron's side for a bit until Harry gets it into her noggin on why he's changed so much. When you provide Hermione with hard facts and evidence, she'll take it seriously. She'll mature, and she'll be less condescending. Harry won't stay friends with her if she doesn't change. All the characters in my fic will mature and change at least a little bit. I want it to be believable.
