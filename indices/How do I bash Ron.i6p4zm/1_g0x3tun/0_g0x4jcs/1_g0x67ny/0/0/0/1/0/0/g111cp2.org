First of all - english isn't my mother tongue so: Sorry if anything sounds akward or has grammar issues.

To your Question: Hermione (at least wonderfully flawed book Hermione) is much more stubborn about her opinion than Ron ever was! She is socially akward and isn't very good with feelings - or empathy. She literally used the death of Lavanders bunny for analysing why Divination is bullshit, she doesn't get why Ron is hurt by losing his pet and that's only book three. Don't begin with how she treats Luna or other people who don't fit in her worldview, or Harry and Ron when she's jealous in Book 6. I love Hermione - she IS a great friend for Harry, she does anything for the boys and her other friends - but she often doesn't get social norms when she is proven wrong. That's part of her characters charm.

Rons greatest flaw is his jealousy and his feeling that he isn't good enough - but most of the time that makes him timid or nervous (see book 5&6 - him as a keeper) and not agressive.\\
If you really want to write a believable fanfic, in which Ron grews appart from Hermione and Harry and not only the usual bad tropes, you should make it about small things. People grew appart all the time. But in fanfictions (especially when Ron is concerned) people tend to make a big drama out of it. Like - suddenly Ron is a really shitty friend, which is bullshit.

There are only two times in the books were Ron is a bad friend - and one of them is influenced by a Horcrux and partially Harrys fault who mocks Ron for being concerned for his family which is the tipping point for Rons leaving. The other time is in book 4 - and we all know that. But it's part of them growing up. Hermione is a bad friend in book 3 when she disregards Ron for missing his pet. Ron is a bad friend in book 4 when he is jealous about Harry being in the tournament and later for Hermione dating Krum. Harry is a bad friend in book 5 when he constantly takes his anger out on Ron and Hermione. They all have their growing moments in three different books.

If you want to make it believable - don't bash Ron. Don't make him the bad guy. Let them grew appart silently. Give them different interests - give Ron actually interests and character motivations that make sense and don't make him a bully or a shallow asshole.

You critisise that Ron is a Dumbledore sycophant, but Hermione gets it? Thats also not In-Character. It is actually Hermione who is much more a believer of Dumbledore than Ron. Ron at least has doubts about him during the Horcrux-Hunt while Hermione never has that moment. Ron also critisises Dumbledore a lot because of Snape while Hermione has fate in Snape only because of Dumbledore - even after everything he did. She is also the one who remembers Harry about his Horcruxmission from Dumbledore while Harry is all for hunting the DH. Not that she is false in believing in Dumbledore concerning this points - but my point ist: she is much more a believer than Ron. So if you want Hermione to break from Dumbledore, you need really a good reason - and a reason, why Ron doesn't believe Harry before her other than "he is a sycophant". Because In-Character Ron is much less a believer of Dumbledore than Hermione. Ron actually goes to his parents if he isn't sure about something. And even then he asks questions.

Sure - you can also take the easy way - Dumbledore is a manipulative asshole, Ron is dumb, Hermione is Harrys only true friend. But honestly: There are tons of that kind of fanfiction out there. And most people who have actually taste click away the moment they read "manipulative-dumbledore" or "Weasley-Bashing". Because 99% of this fanfictions are over the top, have nothing to do with the characters we all fell in love with and most of the time bad writing in general.\\
If you want to write a good story: Give your characters - the good and the bad ones - believable reasons for their actions. Think about the original characters - those of the books, not the tropes we know from various fanfictions or the short-cuts from the movies. Think about why they do things. And then use this knowledge to develope them from there. As fanfiction writers we are allowed to write characters who are "Out of character" - but there must be a journey to reach that point. You can't just say: that is it now, no debate. You must give your readers the opportunity to develope with your characters. And it must stay believeable. Ron won't suddenly start to be an asshole to the friends he was ready to die for multiple times. (Book 1: Chess Game; Book 2: trying to save Hermione and find the heir; following Harry into the woods; Book 3: Standing on a broken leg between Harry and Sirius; Book 5: Following Harry to the Ministry; Book 6: Defending Hogwarts with the DA; Book 7: 7 Potters, joining Harry for the Horcrux-Hunt; jumping in a lake in the middle of winter to save Harry; taking on Bella when Hermione is tortured etc.) Don't fall for tropes. Think for yourself!
