No. I don't even have pets. But Ron's character just rubs me the wrong way. He always insults Hermione, and he has no appreciation for books or knowledge. And considering how he treats Hermione, he'd hate me as well. My younger self was a mini-Hermione Granger before I knew who she was. I was condescending, bossy, a know-it-all---the works. And finally, FINALLY, when someone told me what I was doing wrong (It was only a few months ago, actually), I started fixing it. But it's been a long road. And I don't really like Ron much because of this. Hermione deserves better than being with someone who she can't even talk about her interests with. Ron wouldn't understand. He doesn't understand. And considering Harry is changing a lot, Ron won't understand him anymore. They'll grow apart, and Ron will change for the worse. He'd let his jealousy cloud his judgement, and Dumbledore manipulating him won't help. So I'll probably use Ron as a metaphor for what jealousy can do to a friendship.

Gaaaah. I'm thinking too much into a fanfiction. But I don't give a fuck.
