Imagine an asshole in real life. Now remove his pleasant traits, stick on over exaggerated poor eating habits, add some plot points about stealing or jealousy and then slap the name Ron on the character. Make sure the character has no complexity and is only a caricature.

Or take cues from the hundreds of Ron bashing fics out there. I hear fics styled after Robst gets tons of views from well-read fanfiction readers. It's usually harder to /not/ bash a character than to bash one.
