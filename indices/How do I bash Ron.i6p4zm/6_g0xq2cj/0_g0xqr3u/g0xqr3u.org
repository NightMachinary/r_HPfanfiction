Hahaha. No. I'm demisexual. I'm pretty much unable to tell if someone is good looking unless they're drop-dead gorgeous. And even then it's iffy. Also, I don't give a fuck if Draco is rich or not.

I don't really like Ron's character much. Also, here are some of my replies from other comments:

Harry is changing a lot, Ron won't understand him anymore. They'll grow apart, and Ron will change for the worse. He'd let his jealousy cloud his judgement, and Dumbledore manipulating him won't help. So I'll probably use Ron as a metaphor for what jealousy can do to a friendship.

And:

I figured I'd more or less use Ron's bad traits, and have Harry not forgive him for betraying him twice now. And considering Harry is going to change a lot in this fic, Ron and he won't have any more similarities. I'm fairly certain you've grown out of friendships, and it's like that in my fic. Ron and Harry don't mesh anymore, and considering Ron doesn't agree with Harry acting and consorting with Slytherins, their friendship is going to fall apart very quickly, and Harry is going to have to accept that. Actually, I'm going to use that as a part of Harry's character arc. He needs to accept that he can't go back to who he used to be and that he has changed.
