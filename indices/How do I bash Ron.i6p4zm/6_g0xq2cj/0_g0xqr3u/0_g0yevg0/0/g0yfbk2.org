Ron betrayed Harry. He's also jealous of him and doesn't understand why Harry hates being the boy-who-lived. Ron is lazy and would probably have failed without Hermione's help. He was also biased against Slytherins. He held a blind loyalty towards Dumbledore. He only ever saw things in black and white. He had horrible table manners. He's oblivious. He doesn't appreciate Hermione as much as he should have. Their relationship seems very toxic, especially considering how often they fight. They're not at all similar, and I don't understand how they're still together.
