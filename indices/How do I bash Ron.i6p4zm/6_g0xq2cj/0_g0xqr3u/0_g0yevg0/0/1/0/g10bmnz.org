Okay. Fine. Yeah. But in my fic, the dark side is...they're trying to help. Sort of. In my fic, dark magic isn't outright evil. But Ron doesn't understand that. As far as he is concerned, it is. And Harry is turning evil. No matter what Harry has to say. And you do have to admit, having someone else's food get on your face on a daily basis is frustrating. Especially considering Harry is getting lessons on how to keep that from happening.
