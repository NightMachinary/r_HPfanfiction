Table manners are important to me when it concerns food potentially falling on my face. Normally, I don't give a fuck, but I don't eat like a slob.

My fic is set in fifth year, and Ron is very immature currently. He's also very jealous of Harry right now. During the summer, Harry got a lot more powerful and now acts more Slytherin-like and is really starting to grow up. Ron is jealous of Harry's newfound intelligence, and he hates being second to homework and studying. Ron's bad traits are very likely to come out during this time. And Harry is, quite frankly, tired of Ron's bullshit. Harry's still angry that Ron and Hermione didn't send him owls, he thinks more and more about how Ron betrayed him during the tournament, and Ron's manners and utter disregard and hatred of wizarding traditions is the icing on the cake. Harry won't take it anymore.
