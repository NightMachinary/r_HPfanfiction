In my fic, Harry is supposed to find out that he's the son of Regulus Black. Harry ends up staying with the Malfoys for the summer, but no one knows that he's Harry Potter. At all. Harry ends up befriending Voldemort and is a very good influence. So much so that Voldy takes back a couple of his Horcruxes and regains himself. It's also a Tomarry fic. There are a lot of extra parts that make it unique, but the story I'm writing is not going to be done to death. The storyline is different from what I normally find.
