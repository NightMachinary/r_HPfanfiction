  Ron betrayed Harry.
#+end_quote

My best friend did that to me. Twice. I forgave him both times. Does that make him a bad person for doing that or me a bad person for forgiving him?

#+begin_quote
  He only ever saw things in black and white.
#+end_quote

So do I. How is that a bad thing?

#+begin_quote
  He's oblivious.
#+end_quote

Again, so am I. Am I a bad person?

#+begin_quote
  He had horrible table manners.
#+end_quote

That is such a minor thing, I don't understand why you needed to highlight it. Are table manners /that/ important to you?

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't appreciate Hermione as much as he should have. Their relationship seems very toxic, especially considering how often they fight. They're not at all similar, and I don't understand how they're still together.

We don't see every interaction they have. Remember, they are constantly interacting over an entire school year; the amount of time we are collectively with them in each book is probably less than a day. What are there interactions like in that remaining time? We don't really know, so it's up to the imagination, but it isn't certain that it's bad. It could also be that we only ever see them at their absolute worst moments, and most of the time their interactions make their romance more understandable. That's just one downside of storytelling.

As to how they're still together... well, there was a 19 /year/ gap between Voldie kicking it and the epilogue. People tend to change quite significantly over two decades. Teenagers grow up (oh, and remember that we really see Ron almost exclusive as a teenager, and then remember how shit teenagers are... I wouldn't judge a person entirely based on how they acted as a teen), people mature, and personalities change.

It really isn't hard to understand how two people could stay together when we really know /so very little/ about how they interact and have a two decade blank space.
