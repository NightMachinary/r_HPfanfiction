In this fic, I prefer Hermione. It's not that I hate Ron, it's that he won't understand why Harry is changing so much. I need him to be one of the people who don't understand Harry and his new ideals. Hermione, though, would understand if she was given hard, proven facts. That's just her personality. And everyone knows that Ron is as stubborn as a bull. Maybe Ron will stay by Harry in other fics I write, but, in this one, he's going to be a bad guy.
