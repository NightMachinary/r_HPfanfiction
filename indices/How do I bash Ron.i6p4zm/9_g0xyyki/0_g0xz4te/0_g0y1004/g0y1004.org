I honestly don't even need him to be super well developed, I just want him to be able to actually string a few sentences, even insults together, and have more comebacks then "but they're slimy Slytherins." If it's a rivalry, he has to occasionally one up Harry. In canon Draco is cleverer than Harry with the fake duel and iirc he broke Harry's nose at the beginning of HBP. Even in Quidditch they are typically neck and neck. I think one of the things that a lot of Slytherin Harry with Ron bashing fics do wrong is have Ron lose every single encounter, even verbal sparring matches. There's no tension in those encounters because we already know that whatever happens Ron will come out looking like a clown.
