So I don't necessarily mind bashing, but try not to make it annoying. If Ron is prejudiced against Slytherins that's fine, but don't have him constantly repeat "slimy Slytherins" or "baby death eaters."

Additionally, I would prefer that he has a more flushed out, personal, reason for disliking Slytherins or finding them unreadable. Perhaps his uncle's were friends with a Slytherin that turned traitor resulting in the ambush that killed them.

If he is supposed to be your 'Draco Malfoy' make sure he has some amount of substance even if it's not immediately clear. Maybe contrast him with a happy to be bashed Gryffindor like McLaggen.
