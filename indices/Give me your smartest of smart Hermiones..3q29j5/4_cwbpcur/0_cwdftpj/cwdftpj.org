  obligatory mention of methods of rationality -- smart hermione though she's not the main character
#+end_quote

It's not that she's not the main character. To expand on what I'd posted earlier, she gets an upgrade to her ability to learn and use magic and to get better grades, but it doesn't seem to ever translate into actual consequential impressive feats and victories through smarts. Does it matter how how smart she is if she her smarts have no effect whatsoever on anything of importance in the story?

So, HPMOR's smart Hermione is, in fact, "numbers on the stat sheet", to use OP's phrasing.
