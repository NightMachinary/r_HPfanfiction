  hmm. sort of. to an extent that's a failing of hpmor.

I think that Hermione in general was mishandled by HPMOR. I get that she was meant to be a foil for Harry --- intelligence without rationality --- and with Dumbledore, Quirrel, and Harry and his Dark Side around, there is only so much agency that a character without their advantages of experience and other factors can have. But, it would have been nice to show her actually learning some of what Quirrel and Harry had to teach --- maybe actually surprising one of the Big Three once in a while with something other than her Moral Fortitude.

Speaking of her Moral Fortitude, while all characters got tweaked relative to canon --- some more so than others --- one of the tweaks for Hermione was to erase /her/ dark and ruthless side (which I happen to have outlined in response to another post on this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3q29j5/give_me_your_smartest_of_smart_hermiones/]]).

The only arc where she had any initiative is the inane Self-Actualization arc, and even that turned out to be the Big Three being playful.

At the end, when all is said and done, when two of the Big Three are gone, and Hermione gets an unearned powerup that gives her a lot of freedom of action, what's the first thing she does? Why, she [[/spoiler][effectively pledges herself into the service of the third one]], before she even knows the whole story of what happened.

  if there were ever a sequel i bet that failing would be rectified.

Did LessWrong ever so much as hint at a sequel? My sense is that the story has been very much wrapped up.

This is especially in light of the reveals at the end that [[/spoiler][Dumbledore brought about the whole thing by blindly following prophecies --- and there aren't any more left]].

And, even if such a sequel were written, I doubt that it would be rectified; consider that [[/spoiler][she's pledged to basically be Harry's minion, standing by him and all, and do note that Harry's Unbreakable Vow does not balance that, since it only gives her veto power over potentially world-destroying things Harry might try]].
