agree on all counts

no sequel, a small epilogue forthcoming. what i meant was that hermione is pretty clearly set up to wield power in the unexplored future magical britain of hpmor.

i was disappointed by plot points in the final chapter, although it was well written and interesting as usual. it did short shrift to hermione.

further, it's hard to explain exactly why. and given 650000 words, yudkowsky should have been able to fit in more of her growth and agency. one possible excuse: it was his first ever effort writing fiction of appreciable length. not to mention how difficult i personally find it to write female characters; i can't very well blame him.
