  what i meant was that hermione is pretty clearly set up to wield power in the unexplored future magical britain of hpmor.

That's the trouble, though; she is set up to wield it as a delegate, not as a principal. [[/spoiler][She surrenders that power to Harry, by swearing to trust in him and stand by him, so really, it's Harry wielding twice the power. If, hypothetically, they ever have a serious disagreement over something that isn't potentially world-destroying and fail to reconcile, her oath, if binding, binds her to yield. I guess that if the next thing out of Harry's mouth were something like "I do not accept your oath," both the characters and the scene could be redeemed --- Hermione almost made a dumb if understandable mistake, and friends don't let friends do that]].

As it is, she implicitly acknowledges that her judgment will never be as good as Harry's, no matter what. Now, remember their first meeting, when she challenged Harry over who should lead the project to scientifically understand magic? Funny how she evolved from that...

Anyway, I am sorry, this is getting OT, and it's mostly my fault.
