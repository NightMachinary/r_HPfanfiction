  a psychopath in ACA

A psychopath? She's trying very hard not to become a Dark Lady! It's her greatest fear, as confirmed by a boggart! It's not her fault that she has to terrify Draco into becoming her minion in order to keep his father at bay --- she even helps him get one over Harry Potter, and if she doesn't teach her fellow Muggleborns that fear is more reliable than love and encourage them to learn how to inspire fear in their enemies, who will?
