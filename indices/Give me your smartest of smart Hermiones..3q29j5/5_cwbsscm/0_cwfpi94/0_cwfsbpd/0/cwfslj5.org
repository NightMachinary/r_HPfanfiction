Everything in that post is literally true, even if I was rather whimsical in phrasing it. Yes, Hermione is descending into darkness, but she is not a psychopath. Rather, her Sorting creates problems for her whose solutions require greater and greater moral compromises, and those solutions beget more problems yet, which beget more compromises. I've seen the author compare his approach to this fic to /Breaking Bad/, the TV series.
