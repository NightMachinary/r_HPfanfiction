Just off the top of my head, canon Hermione casually lied to McGonagall after the Troll Incident; set Snape on fire a few weeks later; proposed to and executed a plan to brew a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients (that she stole herself, IIRC), in a plan to kidnap and impersonate three of her classmates; kindapped and blackmailed a reporter; started a paramilitary organization in a school, disfiguring (possibly irreversibly) a fellow student for betraying it; manipulated a female teacher into being abducted by centaurs --- while likely being familiar with the Greek mythology about just what centaurs do to female captives; assaulted Ron for dating another girl, and then hexed a student to help Ron get on the Quiddich team; rewrote her parents' lives to send them to Australia; and didn't disapprove of Harry's use of the Unforgivables. A good argument could also be made that she tried to trick House-Elves into freeing themselves, though we only have Harry's interpretation of events on that.

Don't let fanon mislead you. When Hermione feels justified, she is more ruthless than Harry, Ron, and Draco combined --- and unlike Draco, she isn't half-hearted about it, and does it of her own initiative, rather than being threatened into doing it. And, the only time that she actually showed any remorse about what she'd done was with her parents.
