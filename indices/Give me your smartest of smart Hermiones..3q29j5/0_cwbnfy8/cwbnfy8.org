In Potterverse, a character's intelligence can affect the story in two ways:

1. Character's capacity for and rate of learning, developing, and performing complex magic, including learning magic from books.
2. Character's general decision making, ability to plan, anticipate other people's behavior, find solutions to problems, etc..

Item 2 doesn't mean that an intelligent character has to be always right, but even the /mistakes/ that character makes must be the sort of mistakes an intelligent person would make, which are often the sort that someone less so wouldn't. A good canon example of that is SPEW: Hermione's intelligence was one of the necessary conditions for being informed about Muggle history of slavery and making the connection between that and the House-Elves, as well as researching Wizards' writings on the subject and critically analyzing them; but she lacked the necessary experience (and emotional intelligence?) to figure out what to do about the situation, so she fumbled it. But, other characters never even had the /opportunity/ to fumble it in the first place, because they weren't even thinking about the big picture with respect to the House-Elves.

So, canon gives us quite a lot of both items. Brilliant!Hermione fics that try to get at (2) are much harder to write than those that stop at (1), because it's easy to write "/X/ cast spell /Y/ and /Z/ happened", but it's much harder to actually consider how a highly intelligent character (often more so than the author --- with no offense intended to the hypothetical author) would think and act, and what mistakes they would make. It's telling that, IMO, LessWrong's narrative in HPMOR did both (1) and (2) for Harry but only (1) for Hermione.

With that rant out of the way, here are fics that I think pull off both (1) and (2) well:

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew)

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)

- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss)

- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge)

- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin)

- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa)

- Off-FF.net: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]]: In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

These pull off (1) well and (2) somewhat well (or at least don't emphasize it as much):

- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)

- linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser)

- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen)

- linkffn(Compund Interest by Cillit Bang Bang)

- Off-FF.net: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Couldson Eagle]]: What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

I'll add more as I remember them.
