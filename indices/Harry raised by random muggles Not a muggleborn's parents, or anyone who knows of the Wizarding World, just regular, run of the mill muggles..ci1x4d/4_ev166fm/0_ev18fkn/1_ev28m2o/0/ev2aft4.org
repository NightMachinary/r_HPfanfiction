Search up some Noodlehammer threads for the full explanation, but it's basically a case of a decent writer using his work/characters as a mouthpiece for personal views. Like H.P. Lovecraft.

I agree with [[/u/Imumybuddy][u/Imumybuddy]] 's view:

He's a divisive author, predominantly for rampant Islamaphobia and general hatred directed towards religion, among other things.

I tried reading his stories, but For Love of Magic quickly went from standard, independent Harry, to a sex-crazed maniac with a severe superiority complex.

The writing itself is good, but the characters read like they're the adult version of a horny, angry teenagers daydreams.
