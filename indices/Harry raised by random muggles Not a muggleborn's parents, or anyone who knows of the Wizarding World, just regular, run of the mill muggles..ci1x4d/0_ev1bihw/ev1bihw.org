I vaguely remember a story where he was raised by a muggle woman named Natalie? She became famous for defeating Bellatrix with a frying pan. She did marry a muggleborn later though, and Harry met other muggleborn kids and magical people pre-Hogwarts. Probably not what you want exactly, but if you're interested I'll go find it.
