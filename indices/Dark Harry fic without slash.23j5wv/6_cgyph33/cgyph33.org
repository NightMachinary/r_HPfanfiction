[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] involves Harry learning plenty of dark magic, but he doesn't become evil (or at least hasn't yet). It's one of the better Harry/Fleur stories out there (probably top 2), and is still being actively updated.

Word of warning: get through the first 5 chapters. Seriously. The first chapter is outright bad. The the next four get progressively better. At chapter 6 and 7, there is a /gigantic/ jump in quality. As if the writer had just taken and passed several college English courses, and had also acquired several betas.
