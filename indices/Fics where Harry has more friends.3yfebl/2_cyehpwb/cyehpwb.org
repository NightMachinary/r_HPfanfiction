[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/][Hogwarts' Dawn]] is the first that comes to mind. It is incomplete (but hopefully still a WIP). It features a time abusing Harry who hires the Weasley twins as life coaches.

On the lighter side, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]]. Humorous and complete, but may feel crackish at times. Involves quite a large cast of characters. It utilizes some tropes, but not in overtrod ways.
