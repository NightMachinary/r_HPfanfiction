Funny too. I usually dislike Sue Harry, where he's amazingly powerful for no good reason--though I love a well-written Peggy Sue story. But here, it makes sense for Harry to be so strong and stand-offish. Moody and Kingsley have raised him for war and Wizarding Uganda has a totally different mind-set about how to harness magic.
