Well, there's /The Butterfly Effect./

Due to circumstances unforeseen, Harry Potter is taken by Hagrid away from the Dursleys and to Sirius Black. With Black under arrest, Alastor Moody sees the writing on the wall, and asks a young Auror named Kingsley Shacklebolt to raise Harry and help him prepare for the war that is sure to come.

Harry makes friends with the old crowd of familiar faces, plus a couple of Original Characters. At the current point in story, his squad consists of /eight/ students. While not the best grammatically, this is still a surprisngly good fic with a Stronger Harry that actually makes sense.
