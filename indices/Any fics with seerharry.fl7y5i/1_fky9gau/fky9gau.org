Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky It's a Harry/Tom fanfic were Harry is a seer and it's amazing. Harry has a hard time differentiating between his visions in the story because so many different realities are being projected towards him. For example he sees the reality in which Voldemort kills him but on the other hand in his own reality Tom and him are friends and so things start to become blurred after a while.
