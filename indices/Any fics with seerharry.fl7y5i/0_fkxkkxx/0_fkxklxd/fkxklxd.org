  It wasn't until she was eleven that Harriet Potter learned magic was real. It will be years more before she'll learn that she is more than a witch. Daughter of Loki Harriet's heritage is a mix of three races. A witch, a Jotunn, and a goddess all, her blood is special. Voldemort has no idea what he's getting himself into using this particular enemy's blood for his resurrection.
