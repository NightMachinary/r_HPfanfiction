Ah on the legality we could argue that the ministry was in exile and that all laws passed by Puis Thickness Administration ans tenure are illegal and never happened. And so the laws prohibiting the unforgivables were still in effect. How justify their arrest of those using the unforgivables for that period that weren't in Azkaban before ? The victory rule cannot go ad Infinitum. And the Death Eathers imprisonnement is based on these laws as the membership of a terrorist group does not exist in wizarding Law !
