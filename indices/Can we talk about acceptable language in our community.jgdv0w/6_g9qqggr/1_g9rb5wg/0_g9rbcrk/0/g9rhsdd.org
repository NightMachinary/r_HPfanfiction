Yeah, actually, because our society would see it as “punching up”. Like the boy did something cool to get a hot older woman, when in reality the woman groomed him. It would more likely be overlooked by other adults and children, dismissed even, regardless of whether the boy shared with the intention of asking for help. Trust me, it's still completely effed up and problematic.
