Yes - because patriarchal structures socialise people into very rigid gender expectations that are harmful to all genders.

Specifically, when it comes to sex, our culture perpetuates the idea that women are sexual objects, while men are sexual subjects.

Men are viewed as the actors in sexual encounters, and women are not. Thus, it is portrayed as mad to talk of women sexually exploiting or assaulting men, in the same way it would be portrayed as mad to talk of a bed or lamp sexually exploiting or assaulting a man.

Similarly, as the other commenter has said, men are expected to be hyper-sexual beings. Virility and sexual appetite are virtually synonymous with being masculine, hence suggesting that a boy or young man be unwillingly to participate in a (heterosexual) sexual encounter is seen as a flaw.

This is why when news breaks of statutory rape by female teachers of male students, comments inevitably crop up by (often) older men saying that the kid is "lucky", and "living every guy's fantasy", and how they'd "have loved it" if it was them.

It's a mistake to think that patriarchy is harmful only to women and girls. It hurts all humans by restricting their freedoms of self-exploration and expression.
