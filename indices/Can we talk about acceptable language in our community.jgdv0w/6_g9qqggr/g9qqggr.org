There's a weird disconnect for me, here, because I flitch at the idea of reading most underage female character and overage male character fics. However, I don't have that same reaction when the script is flipped.

Honks is probably one of my favorite ships.

Regardless, though, I'm not sure how I feel on the topic as a whole. I don't think reading fanfiction where two intimately-linked characters with a significant age gap necessarily makes you prone to pedophilia anymore than a story about Harry murderhobo'ing every bad guy in Britain makes someone prone to murder.

It's important to note that these types of fics should /not/ be posted here, however, regardless of anyone's opinion. It's against the rules of this subreddit and against the rules of Reddit as a whole. If the moderation team let it slide, we'd be on the fast track to having the subreddit banned. That's just how it goes.

I don't think we should be using the word pedophile to describe someone who likes these fics, though. No matter how solid your argument that the writing is describing grooming characteristics, it's still /fiction/. Violent video games do not make people violent.
