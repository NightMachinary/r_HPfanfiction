  That doesn't mean lesser things don't matter or are good

The person you were originally replying to said that honks is one of their favorite ships, which implies that their reaction to those types of ships is that they don't matter or are good. You were saying that's logical because one is worse than the other.

If you disagree with the person you were replying to about that type of thing being good, you were unclear about it.
