  It's not logical.

I suggest you read your own link and then what I actually wrote. Carefully.

As per their definition, I'm not suggesting that one doesn't matter because other is worse. I'm explaining why the comment is reacting more to one then the other, because one /is/ worse. It's normal /and/ logical to have stronger reaction to worse things. That doesn't mean lesser things don't matter or are good as you incorrectly inferred from my comment.

And no, I was pretty clear as I quoted exactly what I was replying to. Any good/bad attribute you deduce from it is on you, I was only explaining the difference not where the scale starts.
