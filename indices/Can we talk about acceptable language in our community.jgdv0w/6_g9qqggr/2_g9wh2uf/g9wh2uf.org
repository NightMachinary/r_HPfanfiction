  There's a weird disconnect for me, here, because I flitch at the idea of reading most underage female character and overage male character fics. However, I don't have that same reaction when the script is flipped.

That's pretty logical tho, as consequences from the implied sex are more grave for girls than boys, so girls are perceived at a bigger disadvantage.
