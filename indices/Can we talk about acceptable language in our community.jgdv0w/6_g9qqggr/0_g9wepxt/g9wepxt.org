  I don't think we should be using the word pedophile to describe someone who likes these fics, though.

I think this is my biggest issue with the current fandom discussion of age gaps and fics containing underage characters. It just feels like a rehash of when people were calling everything abuse. It just feels like we're watering down really heavy words that have significant meaning.

It also feels like a cheap, name-calling cop-out. "Yeah well if you don't wholly agree with what I'm saying, then you're a pedophile!!!!" isn't the most conductive response to a discussion. Personally... I do not feel like "problematic" media like this is in and of itself harmful. If the issue is that young people are reading this and taking their social cues from fanfiction, then we should be doing more to stop them reading it. Stick a disclaimer on them. Make it strictly 18+ content. Address the actual issue instead of campaigning for the impossible goal of preventing people from ever writing it in the first place.

Personally, I don't particularly go for ships with age gaps. I have no interest in going out of my way to ship an adult with a minor. But, I do have some ships that fall into questionable areas. A lot of times it's about me really liking the characters and how they go together. I'm well aware that if this were a Real Life Situation things would probably go very wrong, but this is fiction! We can bend the rules all we want to say "I like these two characters together and I'll warp the entire world around them to bring them together and make them happy."

What we /really/ need to target in addition to properly labelling and flagging works is how fans interact with each other. We need to emphasize holding adult fans responsible for how they interact with younger fans and do our best to educate younger fans (and internet users in general) on dangerous signs to watch out for when communicating online. Fanfiction isn't meant to teach younger fans life lessons, and even then... like... you can't ignore the fact that kids and teens just don't know things. They don't have experience. It's not problematic fanfiction that made you a target to groomers in fandom.

It just feels people are blaming the wrong thing for an existing issue... and that getting rid of this ~problematic material~ won't actually do anything to solve the problem.
