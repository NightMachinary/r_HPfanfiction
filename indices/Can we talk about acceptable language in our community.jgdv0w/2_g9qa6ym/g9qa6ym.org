Because "think of the kids!!!!!!!"-type of outrage is easy and popular on the net and beyond, just look at how many people are foolish enough to think that Democratic bigwigs are running a (satanic, because no moral panic without some kinda religious bullshit) child abuse ring from the basement if a pizza parlor or the moral panic about that French film a while ago, so ofc fanfiction subs are gonna get their fair share of these clowns, too, bawling loud about fanfiction based on every teenage boy's fantasy (i.e. fucking a hot chick a few years older).
