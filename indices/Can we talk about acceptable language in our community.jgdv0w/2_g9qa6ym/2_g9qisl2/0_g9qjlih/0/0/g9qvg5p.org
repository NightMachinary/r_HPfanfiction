I feel like that partly comes down to a US perspective. The film wasn't seen as controversial in its native country. I feel like, as a European, Americans tend to project sexuality and objectification/power dynamics onto anything related to the body.

Mignonnes (the title 'Cuties' was a real misfire imo, it doesn't really capture the sense of the word) features girls dancing, copying the pop singers they see on tv. This happens, in countries all over the world. It was even in Mean Girls, briefly! I feel like people who are only used to seeing that in a sexual or sex-adjacent context find it harder to just see that for what it is - dancing.
