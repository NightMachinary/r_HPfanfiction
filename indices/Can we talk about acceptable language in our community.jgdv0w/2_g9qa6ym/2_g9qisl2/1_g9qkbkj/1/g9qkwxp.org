According to people who watched the film, not clips on YouTube. One reviewer might be biased: multiple ones and average people saying the same things in corroboration? Yeah, I'd say it's accurate to say it's implementation is soft-core, no matter the intention behind the film. Plus, it doesn't help that the marketing department of Netflix basically had the kids posing as fucking strippers.

Aside from 'P' being easier to write in short-hand, I often get the spelling wrong for it. So, yeah. P is just more convenient to write.

False equivalence: you can go to go down the "oh, but it's in their own homes so who cares if they're jerking off to soft-core child porn, otherwise arrest everyone for thought-crime" route, but I won't for obvious reasons. And if you need to ask why, you really need to re-examine things. Seriously.
