  if multiple, unconnected people are saying the same things and hold similar critique after watching it, there's pretty much a good chance there's something to it

But when those people were all raised in the same culture that ascribes sexuality and sexification to everything related to nudity or the body - including e.g. the very act of being nude, breastfeeding, even something like school age girls daring to /wear shorts/, then I think that has to be taken into consideration when considering how unconnected they are.
