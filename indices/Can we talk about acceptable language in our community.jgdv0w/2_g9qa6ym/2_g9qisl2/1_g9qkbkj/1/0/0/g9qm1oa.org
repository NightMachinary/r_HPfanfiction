No, if multiple, unconnected people are saying the same things and hold similar critique after watching it, there's pretty much a good chance there's something to it. The "oh, it's on the internet, don't believe it!" thing is, frankly, used to dismiss arguments and viewpoints that don't fit someone's world-view.

The poster and promotional material brought attention to it, yes, but I'm pretty sure the controversy would've still been there, just not to this extent. The marketing material shone a spotlight on it.

I write it short-hand and everyone knows what I'm talking about when I use P in a post's context. What, should I start writing Laughs Out Loud or Rolls On Floor Laughing in full, instead? Or write Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour instead of HP/FD? Stop being pedantic.

Mate, you're literally defending the stance that "oh, if they're jerking off to it in their own homes, who cares right?" to soft-core kiddie porn. That's what Cuties is. If you don't see what's wrong with that, that's on you.
