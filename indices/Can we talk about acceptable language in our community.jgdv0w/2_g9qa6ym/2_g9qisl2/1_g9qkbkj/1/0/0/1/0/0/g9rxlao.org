Automagically is a pretty old and common term. I'm honestly surprised you've never heard of it, before. It's not Harry Potter related, at all.

It's like something that happens automatically but without any real thought put into the how or why. Funnily, this means Automagically is necessarily a perspective-based term. What's automagical for me wouldn't be automagical to someone who /does/ put real thought into the related processes.
