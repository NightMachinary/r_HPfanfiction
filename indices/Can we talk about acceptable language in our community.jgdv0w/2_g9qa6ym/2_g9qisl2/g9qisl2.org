If by "French film" you mean Cuties, there was valid criticism and disgust aimed at it. Despite the director's intentions about "social-media influencing children in such ways" (or something like that?), it was pretty much soft-core kiddie porn, according to people's comments about certain scenes in the film.

I'm pretty sure more than one anonymous P was jerking off that to that shit. No idea what the fuck the people involved were thinking.
