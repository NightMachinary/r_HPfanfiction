Naive characters are fine, authors less so. Write underage romance, write whatever messed up thing you like... But then have awareness of what you're doing. It's okay to write rape, less so to have rape in your story and not understand that you do.

Freedom to do what you like comes with the responsibility to understand what you are communicating. A character can accept pedophilia, an author cannot.

If you're saying that people have been misidentified as pedophiles because of their subject matter, fair. Subject matter should not be determinative. If you're saying we can't call a spade a spade when pedophilia is naively accepted in the story, I don't agree.

Granted, I would feel someone out, writing is difficult, things can get miscommunicated. I would want to know if a reader got the impression that I accepted pedophilia.
