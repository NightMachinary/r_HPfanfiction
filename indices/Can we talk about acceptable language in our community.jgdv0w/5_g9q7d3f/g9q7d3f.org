Honestly, I completely agree. It's fiction and I don't really envision a four year old as four when the fic is from the perspective of a four year old that's actually a serial killer. However, I still don't think requests asking for smuts with age gaps are appropriate on this subreddit because of rule 8. Now, I think it's fair to have your own opinion (and I recognize this is separate from the issue of calling people pedophiles) on this rule, but the rule is in place and I do think people should abide by it.
