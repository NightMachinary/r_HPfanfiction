Okay, a few things to cover here:

1. We really need to draw a distinction between "underage" and "age gap", because a lot of people are conflating the two, and that's a problem. The issue with pedophilia is not that there is an "age gap"- its that one of the people involved is an adult and another is a child who is not old enough to consent. In the past, I have seen people who would argue that, say, a thirty year old and a forty year old is just as bad as a 20 year old and a 10 year old because its the same age gap, and that's fucking insane. It shows a complete failure to understand the importance of consent.
2. With that in mind, my view is that, theoretically, Harry/Tonks where both are adults would be fine, but Harry/Tonks where Harry is underage would be pedophilia.
3. It is perfectly legitimate for an author to write about abuse so long as they are portraying it /as/ abuse, and not excusing it, or depicting it gratuitously or for the purposes of romance/porn/titillation.
4. I have not read the thread to which the OP refers, but speaking generally, there IS a disturbing strain of pedophilia and pedophile apologism in a lot of online fanfic communities (as there is in most facets of society, to one degree or another, see the Republican Party, the Catholic Church, Hollywood, etc). It is particularly troubling given that many of those who write and read fanfic are minors themselves, and are therefore being exposed to this ugly and dangerous underbelly of fandom. It should be called out, and yet when it is, it seems that there is always a group of people that jumps up to accuse the critics of being prudes, censors, etc. I certainly hope that the moderators of this sub will push back against that bullshit, because I could not otherwise continue to post here.

Edit: Having read through the thread, and having seen that the bulk of the comments here appear to be defending, to one degree or another, pedophilia, I feel I have no choice but to terminate my participation in this sub. I don't know if this discussion is reflective of the views of the group as a whole, or simply who is being most vocal in this thread, but I cannot and will not affiliate with a sub where such views are widely accepted.
