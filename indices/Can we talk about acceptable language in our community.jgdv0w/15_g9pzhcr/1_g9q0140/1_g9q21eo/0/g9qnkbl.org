I respect your opinion that a large age gap is weird. 90 percent of the time I would agree. But in fanfiction you can take a more lenient stance on morality etc. I'm of course not advocating outright and excessive law breaking, especially when it deals with such a controversial and really awful topic matter, ie CSE, however for many (including me), fanfiction is a form of escapism. I cant say it is the same for everyone, but particularly 2 to 3 years ago when I was going through a rough patch, I clung to fanfiction as something to escape my every day problems. Sometimes that escapism does involve morally grey and sometimes morally wrong things. Would I ever consider paedophilia, sexual harassment, rape, murder, drug use, torture, etc. in my daily life? Of course not! I like to believe that I can separate what is right and wrong, and therefore read material with "wrong" situations in it. I dont want to bang on about this much longer but I will give you an extreme. On AO3 there is a series of fics about actual awful incestual paedophilia. It is bad and I feel shame admitting that I have read it. However, the fact that I read it does not mean I am a paedophile. I was curious and now I hate that I was curious. I am not saying avoid anything morally wrong, but I would say without hesitation that there is material that tackles morally wrong situations, and material that endorses and glorifies it. Those fics are an example of the latter. They are wrong. Honks to me is one of the former; it is a but "spicy" and a little morally grey, but it is exploring the dynamics of that sort of relationship. I have read many Honks fics that really develop the problems of society endorsed marriage and relationships - exploring the moral and social problems that they create. Tl;dr some fics are wrong. I wish they didnt exist but they do and it is every individual's right to dislike them and not read them. Some fics explore things that are "grey" or that bend the rules of the real world. If you can safely identify that there is a difference, I see no problem with you reading them out of curiosity or enjoyment.

Thanks for indulging my mini rant - I have thankfully never experienced any form of paedophilia irl, but I know my father dealt with many such cases during his time as a lawyer. Paedophilia is (in my opinion) the worst kind of crime - intentional paedophilia is far worse than murder to me. Please take everything I say with a pinch of salt - I am here to find some new fics and be a part of a great community. I dont often engage in these sort of conversations. Read safely!
