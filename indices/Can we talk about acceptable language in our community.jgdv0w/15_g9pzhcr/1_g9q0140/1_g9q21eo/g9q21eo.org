I seem to recall you asked not to rehash the age gap thread. I said nothing about Honks, just pointed out why there was such disdain.

That said? Stories that have an adult character twice their age or more trying to start a relationship with a pre-teen are writing about grooming. Textbook grooming, when said adult has authority over the child, like a teacher, caregiver, or religious or secular authority.

Tonks being a cop who's 7 years older than Harry, trying to ship the two while he's in school is creepy.
