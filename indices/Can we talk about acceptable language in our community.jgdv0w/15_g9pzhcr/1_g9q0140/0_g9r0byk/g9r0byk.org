Honestly, don't even bother over here. For a sub centered around reading, the reading comprehension is... disappointing, to say the least.

I was one of the people who got called "fucking disgusting", among other things, merely for pointing out that if you call everyone who ships something you don't like a pedo, it makes it harder to spot actual pedos in the community.

For the record, I ship nothing and I hardly ever read romance fics, so I wasn't even defending a ship, just explaining how the behaviour can be harmful to actual kids, not fictional characters.
