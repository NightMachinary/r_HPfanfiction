Personally my preference is towards "anything goes" - people are free to like and discuss whatever fics they like, and others are free to criticise those fics and, by extension, the people who like them.

That said, this sub has a history of not permitting "anything goes" but rather enforcing politeness - see rules 2 and 3 against hateful speech and personal attacks. So I do think there's a good argument that consistent moderation would require preventing /all/ personal insults and attacks.

All that said, I do think it's silly to infer personal traits and characteristics from the entertainment media a person chooses to consume. It's the same as the argument that video games turn people violent.
