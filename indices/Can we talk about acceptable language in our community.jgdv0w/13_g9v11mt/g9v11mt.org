I am just now seeing this when clearly it was aimed at my post about age gaps from earlier this week. No one is calling you a pedophile. I didn't call you a pedophile in my post and I didn't see anyone else make the accusation. I did say that when an adult has sex with a child (which is depicted in many fan fictions) that it is pedophilia, which is true.

Now, as someone who has literally lived that scenario in real life, I feel like I have the right to say that I am not comfortable with that. In fact, anyone can be uncomfortable with it if that is how they feel. So with that being said, I obviously do not read those types of fan fiction.

I literally posted about how unrealistic fan fiction can be with age gaps, not talking about pedophilia at all, but somehow my post became about that.

For real though, we don't need to be defending pedophilia, but I guess to each their own.
