I find such ships like Hermione, a teenage girl, being paired with, say, Lupin or Snape as creepy -- same deal with Harry with Snape and Voldemort -- because of the huge age gaps. But, do I consider the average readers/writers of such things P's? No. Terrifying fangirls, yeah, but not P's.

That is, not unless there's a subtext to the story from the author that sets off warning bells (to keep a long story short, I actually stumbled across a story in the Harry/Luna category where the author was either a P or a *very good* method actor/writer, as they self-torturedly described "Harry's" attraction to eleven year old girls in a very poetic way. Yeah, no. I closed that shit in disgust after realizing what the fuck it was and reported it. It was gone the next day after I checked to see if my report did anything. Looks like the FFn staff *do* listen, if there's the threat of law being involved).

Anyway, Americans have this weird cultural view about sex and age-gaps: most of the UK's and other countries' views would cause them to have aneurysms, lol.

For example, I was on the verge of dating this Aussie bird when I was 17 and she, 23. The only thing that stopped us from meeting up was my own shitty health and the typical long-distance issues. We eventually lost contact, but I always wonder what happened to her.

Other friends of mine met their future spouses when they were 16/17 and their future spouses, like 21/22: they've all been happily married for well over a decade now with 2.5 children.

Hell, my own mother met my dad when she was 17 and he was like 21, and they've been happily married for fucking decades and have two kids and over four dogs out of it (myself included -- the kids I mean, not the dogs, lol).

So, yeah. Tonks hitting on a 16 or 17 year old Harry or Fleur doing the same at 17 to a 14/15 Harry doesn't make me blink all that much. Hell, they're favorite ships of mine.

A 13 year old Harry being seduced by a 30-odd Rita Skeeter, for example? Yeah, *that'd* make me go "what the ever-loving fuck", as would a 14 year old Harry and a canon aged Gabrielle (since, you know, she's goddamn *8* in GoF) -- unless it's a fucked up subversion like that grim-dark fic "Playmate".

Context and cultural views. British culture and society isn't American culture and society.

No, I'm not defending P, as I'm sure some overreacting people will cry, but I /do/ criticize primarily American hypersensitivity ("They're 17! They're just a baby, just like that 11 year old-- oh wait, they turned 18 a week ago? Meh, they on the "the Hub", Instagram, or the local strip club?") towards sex and age, and that's what influences a lot of the HP fandom because the bulk of fans are Yanks.

For Christ's sake, I saw an American woman shrieking at this guy (it was one of those videos that narrates stories from Reddit) in a YouTube video comment section: he was 19, his girlfriend was 16 or 17, I think?, and they had an argument. He was asking for the best way to apologize or if he should break up with her manipulating ass. She was calling him a P/sex-offender... because of a two/three year age gap.

Yeah. sigh
