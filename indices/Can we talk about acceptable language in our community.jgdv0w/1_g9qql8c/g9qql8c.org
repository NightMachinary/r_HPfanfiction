You're not wrong.

People are too eager to score imaginary points. Fanfiction is allowed to be 'problematic', it's allowed to have age gaps and pair characters with shitty people.

You're allowed to write rape, torture, incest, child abuse, power dynamics, racism, sexcism, various phobias etc even pedophilia without being any of those things yourself.

I've written rape scenes before, they were actually pretty cathartic to write as I was sexually abused by my stepfather for several years

Just because people write about awful things doesn't make them awful. It makes them a writer.
