Intent really matters here, though. I wouldn't criticise a story for, say, featuring an adult/child relationship if said relationship is being portrayed as predatory and abusive, but I absolutely /will/ criticise a story for condoning or romanticising such a relationship.

Which, to be clear, is in no way a condemnation of you, or of anybody else who depicts awful things in their writing. I sincerely believe that /nothing/ is off limits when it comes to writing, and nobody has the right to tell you, or anybody else, how to process your trauma (I mean, maybe, like, a therapist, but I'm talkin' about random strangers on the interwebs, here).
