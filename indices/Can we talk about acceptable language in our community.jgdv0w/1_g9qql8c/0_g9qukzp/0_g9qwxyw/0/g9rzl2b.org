I wish people would extend this to other realms than just smutfic wank. I've seen some truly heinous representations of violence and torture perpetrated by protagonist characters in some of the... uh... how do I call it... blatant wish fulfillment OP fics that get recced here? It happens so much that it blends together to me. But the glorification of these actions goes completely undiscussed unless sexuality enters the equation. Even then I saw a fic where a cartoonishly bashed Severus Snape was repeatedly sexually brutalized by the protagonists, but since it was meant to be “funny” (and I guess because Snape's an asshat) nobody cared.
