I know this is a fairly well-known fic, so you've probably already heard of it, but my favourite rom/com fic is called 'Commentarius' by 'B.C Daily' ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3323816/1/Commentarius]])

It's an excellently written Jily fic, and it's unbelievably funny in parts. That being said, it's an INSANE time-dump. It's nearly 750,000 words long and it still isn't finished.
