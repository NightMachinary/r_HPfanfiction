The author, Madscientist, is probably one of my favorite from that era of Fanfiction.

The set you are talking about was his/her first works and they were written before HBP came out. I remember there being very frequent updates to War of Shadows for a long time and then Portkey did a new event (they use to do them frequently), called the Felix Felicies Competition. Harry Potter and the Circle's End was the story that he/she started writing for that competition and sort of abandoned the War of Shadows since it was not cannon anymore.

War of Shadows though was a great story and the 2 before it were fantastic as well in my opinion. Circle's End was one of the best fics I read during those years. There was a sequel but I don't think that it was ever finished. Of all the fics that I have kept up with and wanted to be finished, I wanted that one done more than any other. The way he did Harry and Hermione's powers in those stories I thought were fantastic and I thought the fight scenes were some of the best.

Moral of the story is, I followed those fics religiously and I really enjoyed everything that author wrote. But sadly War of Shadows and the sequel to Circle's End were both unfinished despite being preceded by really good work.

EDIT: I believe the sequel was called Harry Potter Beyond the Looking Glass
