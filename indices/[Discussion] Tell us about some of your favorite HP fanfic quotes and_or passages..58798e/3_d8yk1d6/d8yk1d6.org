Well, I like the entire Introduction of Ron snippet from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/12/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][An Incomplete Potter Collection]].

It's basically a snippet that takes Ron's 'all the other compartments were full' as a lie, and gives him a very good, perfectly innocent reason for saying so.
