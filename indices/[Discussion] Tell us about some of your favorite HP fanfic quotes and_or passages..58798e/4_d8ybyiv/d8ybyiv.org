linkffn(Hypocrisy by Sachita) has so many passages that left me kind of speechless. They can get a little purple prose-y at times, but I think the author has an amazing talent for descriptions. Here's a particularly beautiful passage:

"Winter had left already and spring was heavy in the air: there, in the damp mist that rose up from the bushes and shone golden in the early sunshine; here, in the quiet birdsong among the old trees.

On some days life and everyone in it choked her and she needed to get away for some time. Away from school, her responsibilities- away even from Tom- or should she say, especially from Tom? His possessiveness smothered her at times.

Minerva wandered along the half-hidden paths that led her deeper into the forest. Surrounding her was the heavy, rain-damp smell of the old oak-trees and beeches.

On a clearing, she stopped and marvelled at the patches of sunlight that lit up the mossy ground.

When she craned her neck, she found herself gazing up along the bark of gargantuan trees that must have been there long before her birth. At the tops, the little structures of the branches nearly seemed to become one with the milky blue sky.

She turned to her right and nearly gasped at the spectacle taking place right in front of her.

From the treetop down to its roots that sunk into the mossy ground the entire tree seemed to be glowing, sparkling, gleaming in the spring light. The sun's rays were caught on its orange-hued leaves, illuminating them like dancing flames caught upon the dark branches that were covered with dew drops.

The dew drops, on the other hand, gleamed like a world of rainbows captured in a myriad of glass shards. Webs crafted by miniscule artists were also made visible in an ethereal golden glow, spanning across the ground. Minerva marvelled at them and at this moment and then stepped into that magical world, closing her eyes to hold her face into the warm sunlight.

It was silent, no birdsong could be heard; only the crackling of branches and leaves, there in the sunlit solitude.

And for a moment, all was perfect.

Life was the most beautiful thing she had ever encountered."
