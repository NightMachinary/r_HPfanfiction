I've never watched that movie before, but damn that scene is mesmerizing.

Also, if you like this passage, I would definitely recommend the whole story. It has some of the most beautiful descriptions of any fanfic I've ever read, and does an amazing job at creating a realistic backstory for Tom Riddle.
