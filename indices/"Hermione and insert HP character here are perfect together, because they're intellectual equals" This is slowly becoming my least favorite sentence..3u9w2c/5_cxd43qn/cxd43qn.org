The comment wouldn't as bothersome as it is if people weren't so inclined to overestimate both Hermione and "insert HP character here"'s level of intelligence beforehand.

Of course she's clever, but not a genius - that is, not on Dumbledore or Voldemort's level. None of the male characters in her (relative) age group have been shown to exhibit that sort of spark, either.

Yes - many of us are disappointed that most of the main characters paired off early on, and it's only exacerbated by the extended lifespan of the average witch/wizard, so let's not lose sight of that.

Do you really want to see Hermione "meet her match", as it were? Write a fic and take her across the globe, or something. Let her spread her wings, and rest assured, she'll fly right into him/her. One can only take so much MisunderstoodRomantic!Snape. Or Draco, even, who is probably the intellectual equal of Harry, at best.

And Ron's sophisticated! He plays chess, lol.
