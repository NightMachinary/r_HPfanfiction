I think that we would be splitting hairs at that point... one can be a "genius" while lacking sense or reasoning at the same time. It depends on the context of the word.

But for clarity's sake: Dumbledore and /Riddle/ (maybe Grindelwald too) are in a completely different league to every other witch/wizard encountered in person during the series. No one in Hermione's generation - not even Hermione herself, as hard as that is to believe - came close.
