Thirding this, a memo to fanfic writers who like Hermione [1]: when you write Hermione as nicer, less vicious, more forgiving, more humble, more nurturing, or more sensitive relative to what we see in canon, you are /not/ helping. Rather, you are erasing a part of what makes her a strong and interesting character.
