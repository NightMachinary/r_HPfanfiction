And herein lies one of my big problems with H/Hr as a ship - that Harry is the one who must live up to the standards of the beautiful genius that is Hermione.

HERMIONE HAS CHARACTER FLAWS.

No one seems to notice that yes, she is bossy - and in the bad way, that she is often oblivious to the needs of others, that she holds grudges intensely, and that she lacks certain social skills.

Hermione is a super-awesome character. Her intelligence and passion for doing the right thing make her an incredibly effective friend (almost sibling) of Harry's, and her seriousness and work ethic help inspire Ron to improve himself, but she's not some goddess. She's human, and all the better for it.
