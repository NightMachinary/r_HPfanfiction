I like the fact that Hermione is plain and has character flaws. In fact, that's one reason why I like her character.

I like shipping her with other characters that are imperfect and not written as super sexy and perfect. One of the things I'm most irritated at are people who simply squish two characters together for no reason other than the characters saying "wow! We're so similar! Time to bone!"

On the other hand, I love reading fics where two flawed people find the similarities and affection for each other, and let's be honest, having shared interests is a huge part of falling in love or looking for a long term partner.

Also, if you take into consideration that the characters have survived a WAR, it makes a lot of sense why many marry and settle down with others who went through the same horrors as they did. Being in a conflict like that changes you and as PTSD is apparently ignored even more in the magical world, I doubt that many get much in the way of treatment for it.

Write a pairing well, and I will almost welcome the similarities. Write them poorly and I will exit your story without finishing the first chapter or reviewing.
