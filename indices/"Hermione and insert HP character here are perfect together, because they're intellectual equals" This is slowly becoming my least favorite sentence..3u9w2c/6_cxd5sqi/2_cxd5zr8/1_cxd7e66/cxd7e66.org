I think she likely always had good bone/facial structure, just bushy hair and prominent teeth that made her look goofy/geeky. I don't believe you'd suddenly become as attractive as she supposedly did for the Yule Ball just by wearing a nice dress and slicking down your hair. It's like those movie scenes where the ~nerdy girl takes off her glasses and is now beautiful, e.g. the Princess Diaries. She was attractive to begin with.
