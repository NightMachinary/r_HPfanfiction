I don't think Hermione was ever described as repulsive, just plain. Maybe slightly better after her teeth were straightened in GoF. Also, part of me thinks that she may have become somewhat attractive in HBP onwards, simply because I don't believe Cormac would have batted an eye at her if she wasn't.
