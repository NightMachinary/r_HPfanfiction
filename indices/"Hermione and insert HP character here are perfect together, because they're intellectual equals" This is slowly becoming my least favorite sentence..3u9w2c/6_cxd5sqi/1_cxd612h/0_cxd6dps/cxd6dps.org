Both you and Englishhedgehog13 misunderstood me. I'm not saying that she's ugly or objectively repulsive - I'm saying that this is how I feel towards her /character/. The way she acts is just repulsive to me. I know girls like her. They are simply not good company, and Harry plainly tells us so during all those instances where he avoids her, ignores her, lies to her and misses Ron's company. Fans just like to gloss over all those annoying tendencies of hers.
