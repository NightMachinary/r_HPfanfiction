A lot of us were taught absolute unwavering respect of the Rules. Rules are there for a reason, follow them. This is often reinforced by being bullied by those who don't follow those rules and being able to go to an authority figure and then being protected by the rules. When Hermione feels that the rules are doing more harm than good, she breaks them, but not without due consideration first. But letting a prefect drink firewhiskey where younger students could see him? There's no good reason to break that rule, besides wanting to have fun, and plenty of impressionable younger students around who could seriously hurt themselves by following that prefect's example.

I strongly identified with Hermione's need to follow rules, they're there to protect me, after all, and many times have done so. Authority figures have protected me in the past, so I respect them for that and trust that they'll continue to protect me in the future.

I can completely understand how someone from a different background could consider someone like Hermione (or me) a killjoy, but I also think it's important to recognize why someone might identify so strongly with the absolute need to follow rules as well.

Edit: Snape has a similar attitude for a similar reason. The rules are there to protect students. Any student not following the rules is endangering themselves and others. Adults often get the most angry when they are afraid for the people they are supposed to look after. Snape swore on Lily's memory to keep Harry safe. How terrifying must Harry's exploits have been to someone who truly understands the potential dangers he could stumble upon? This doesn't excuse all, or even most, of his behavior. But how terrifying must it be for a professor, acting /in loco parentis/, to catch a student out of bed after hours and realize that they truly don't know where all their charges are?
