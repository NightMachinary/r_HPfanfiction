You're comically missing the point. That example shows exactly how Hermione breaks the rules when it suits her, whatever her reason is.

I'm not holding James and Riddle as people who are attractive - this thread is about characters who fall in love with Hermione, and sadly, there are many fics where Riddle and James inexplicably do. /Fans/ find them attractive, and they were attractive in-universe. Is that so hard to understand?

Again, we came into this particular sub-discussion from the premise that Hermione's attitude annoys and alienates Harry, /which it does/. It doesn't matter whether it's justifiable or not - it's simply annoying and unattractive. People don't generally want to hang out, go have fun with someone who expects them to be "exemplary".
