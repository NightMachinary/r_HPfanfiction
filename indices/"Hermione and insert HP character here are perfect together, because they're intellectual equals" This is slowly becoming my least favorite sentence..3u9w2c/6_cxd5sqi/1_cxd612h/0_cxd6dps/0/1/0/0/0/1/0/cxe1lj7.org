I think it's at this point (or very close to it) that we reach the overarching issue: the quiet but no less uneasy schism between fans who think that Hermione carried the Trio, and those who disagree. But that's an argument for another thread ;)

It could be argued that Hermione was just looking out for her friends, or trying to instil a greater sense of social responsibility etc. But it doesn't wash, because - as you've said - Hermione was almost as fond of breaking (not even bending) the rules when it suited her. She's not only guilty of (somewhat) permanently hexing a fellow student, but false imprisonment as well! It doesn't matter who she did it to: just that she did it in the first place.

Of course, this is okay because reasons.

Either way, it all comes down to "Hermione knows best", even when it's how to have fun properly. Hate to sound like I'm bashing the character because I like her, but the way she's often glorified rankles me a little.
