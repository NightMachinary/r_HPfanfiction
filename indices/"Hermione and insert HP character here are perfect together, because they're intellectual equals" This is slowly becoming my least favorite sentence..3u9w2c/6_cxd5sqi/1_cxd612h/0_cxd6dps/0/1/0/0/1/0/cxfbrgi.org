Yes, Confounding McLaggen mid-flight is a very heroic act, not at all done simply so her boyfriend could get a position on the team.

You might see a prefect trying Firewhisky at a pub /with no younger students around/ as harmful, but I don't, and so do characters like James, Sirius and Riddle, who would never fall for such a person. Which is the point I'm trying to make in the first place - she's not an attractive character, and her attitude alienates her friends.
