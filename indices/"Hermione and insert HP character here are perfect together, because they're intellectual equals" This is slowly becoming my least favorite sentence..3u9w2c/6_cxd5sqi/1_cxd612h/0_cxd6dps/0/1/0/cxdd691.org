I'm not sure how old you are so I'm not sure what experience you are basing your opinions on but I clearly remember times when I was upset with friends for stopping me from doing something that in retrospect was stupid. Conversely I've ignored friends and done stupid things that bit me in the ass. Most times Hermione is a "killjoy" is in reality her being a good friend.
