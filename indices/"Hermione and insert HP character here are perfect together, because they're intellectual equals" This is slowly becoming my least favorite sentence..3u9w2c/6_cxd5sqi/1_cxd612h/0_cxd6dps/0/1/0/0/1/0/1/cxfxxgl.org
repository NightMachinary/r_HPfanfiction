  Confounding McLaggen mid-flight is a very heroic act, not at all done simply so her boyfriend could get a position on the team.

Well, you manage to come up with /one/ example - and since we all know that falling in love makes you do dumb things, I hardly think this goes very far in defining her character, especially given the weight of examples going in radically different directions.

  You might see a prefect trying Firewhisky at a pub with no younger students around as harmful

Obviously undeage students can come in at any time - since, you know, /they/ did. And if prefects are effectively "on duty" when in Hogsmeade, Ron's responsibility outweighed his desire to have fun with underage drinking.

  but I don't, and so do characters like James, Sirius and Riddle

Would this be the same James and Sirius whom Lily hated for so many years until they (well, James at least) drastically changed behavior to become... more responsibile? Yeah, great role models there, along with Riddle of all people.

Honestly, if you're trying to hold up pre-Lily James and Tom Riddle as people who are more "attractive" as characters and somehow preferable as friends to Lily and Hermione, there's no way that we'll ever come anywhere even remotely close to the same planet as "agreement." James was a toe-rag and Ron often wasn't much better. The fact that James had to change to court Lily rather than the other way around is quite telling, I think.
