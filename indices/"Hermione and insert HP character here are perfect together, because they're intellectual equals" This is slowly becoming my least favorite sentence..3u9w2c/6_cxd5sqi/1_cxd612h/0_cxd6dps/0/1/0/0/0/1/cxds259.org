  But letting a prefect drink firewhiskey where younger students could see him? There's no good reason to break that rule, besides wanting to have fun, and plenty of impressionable younger students around who could seriously hurt themselves by following that prefect's example.

Lol, are you serious? Ron wanted to /try/ Firewhisky in the Hog's Head, not get shitfaced in the streets of Hogsmead. There were hardly any younger students there, and even if there were, I really doubt Ron would inspire them to drink as well.

Some rules are meant to protect us, yes. Umbridge thought her rules protected students as well. But I don't care about Hermione's rule-mongering as much as the arrogance she displays when she tells others not to break minor rules, and then /breaks major rules/. Simply because it suits her. Even after her own rule-breaking backfires at her (/cough/-furry-polyjuice-/cough/). If I had a friend like that... well, we wouldn't stay friends for very long. You can justify her all you like, but in the end, her character simply comes off as unattractive - especially to those rebellious characters.
