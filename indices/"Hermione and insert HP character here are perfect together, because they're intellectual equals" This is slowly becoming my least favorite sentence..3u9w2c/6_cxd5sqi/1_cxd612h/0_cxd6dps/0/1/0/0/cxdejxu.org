I'm in my twenties. And I'm not talking about times where she tried keeping Harry out of trouble, I mean instances where she just ruins perfectly innocent fun. Like belittling Ron for wanting to try Firewhisky at the Hog's Head because "he's a prefect". She's so quick to oppose harmless rule-breaking when she doesn't profit from it - even when it means going against her friends - but when breaking the rules suits her she does it without breaking a sweat. It's utterly annoying and very unattractive. Would Sirius, James or Riddle fall in love with such a person? absolutely not.

The fact is, Harry avoids her many times simply because her attitude annoys and alienates him.
