I must see Hermione in a different light than both of you. Granted it's been awhile since I read the books, but I don't remember Hermione being so rigid. Yes she often spouts off about following rules but I don't recall her actually going to authority about them being broken. The firebolt is an obvious exception. Even with the potions book she didn't rat Harry out. She also never made any real attempt to stop Fred and George, she constrained them to a degree, but didn't ever run off to a teacher about their shenanigans. I always read her as the conservative friend who gave a token effort to follow the rules but acted as she believed was right.
