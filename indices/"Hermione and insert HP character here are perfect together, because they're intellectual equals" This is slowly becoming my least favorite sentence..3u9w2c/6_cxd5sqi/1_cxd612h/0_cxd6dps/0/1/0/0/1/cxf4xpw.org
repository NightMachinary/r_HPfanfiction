Underage drinking in front of other teens, many of whom are even younger, and when you are a figure of authority and respect? And when you are expected to be acting as a figure of authority (which I expect prefects are while in Hogsmeade)?

No, that's not "harmless rule-breaking."

Now, if Ron's /father/ offered him a sip of alcohol, and Hermione pitched a fit... that would be much more of a grey area. If it's during a Hogsmeade day and Ron's "on duty," she'd have a point. Arthur would arguably be in the wrong. If it's in the Leaky Cauldron in the summer, she might technically be right, but pushing it.

Anyway, I say ligirl is 100% correct. Hermione is more than willing to break the rules when it's important - she does so very, very early on in the first book! She sets a /professor on fire/ to save Harry! What's more, she was /wrong/ about Snape being the bad guy there! That's /not/ the behavior of someone who is slavishly devoted to rules. No, no, no, not in the least. She respects the rules more than most and is slower to break them than most, but she places things like Harry's safety above them, which is more than appropriate.

And it's no coincidence that the one time she went to the professors about something was the Firebolt. She should have talked to Harry first (friends trust each other, and didn't even try to trust that he'd listen to her), but her first priority was his safety - even more than his friendship with her.

So, no, she doesn't break rules when it merely /suits/ her, she breaks them when she finds it to be the only way to preserve a much greater value - usually Harry's safety, but sometimes the lives and safety of others. And I say that "break the rules when it's necessary to save lives" is exactly the right attitude to have.
