I feel like you have a disprportionate amount of hate for an 11-17 year old girl chracter who has been written very well. Hermione is seen to be attractive (cleans up nice, noticed by Gryffindors' resident alpha bro). Yeah she's hypocritical about rules and actions from day to day, so are most of us. Yeah she's competitive and myopic sometimes - but she's also a pretty rich character with a capacity for empathy and insight into how people feel which walks alongside her critical nature and her want to be excellent. Many people I know and consider be intellectuals have that sort of complexity.

She's bossy, she's ruthless, she's brilliant, she's insightful, she's principled, she's a lot of things. But so are we all. I like that Hermione's character has a lot of clear flaws, it's really interesting.

And as to wish-fulfillment, isn't it all wish-fulfillment of some sort? Same can be said about super!Harry fics being a male power fantasy. Or Harem fics. Or Fleur/Harry fics. Or Snarry, Harrymort, WBWL....
