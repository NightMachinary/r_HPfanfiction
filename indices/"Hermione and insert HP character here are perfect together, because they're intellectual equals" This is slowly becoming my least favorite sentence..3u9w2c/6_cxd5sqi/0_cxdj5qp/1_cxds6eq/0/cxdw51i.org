Wish-fulfillment is alright when its realistic wish-fulfillment? Man you've got to check yourself in the fantasy department. If your wish is to boink veela-draco-malfoy incessantly as a werewolf-troll version of hermione then go for it. It's all freaky and weird, I don't understand making rules about fanfiction, unless you're making rules for yourself in writing and reading.

And it's all butchering characters, you're doing that anyway. You'd best get off a high horse about purity of characterization if you're writing fanfics. Some fics come extremely close but there's always SOMETHING off that someone can point out.
