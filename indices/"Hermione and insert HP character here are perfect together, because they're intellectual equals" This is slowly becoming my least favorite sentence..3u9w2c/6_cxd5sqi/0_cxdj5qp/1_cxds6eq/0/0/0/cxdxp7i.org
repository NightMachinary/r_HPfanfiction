I was more writing to a general non-entity 'you' you rather than you you, if you get what I mean. (Oh you.)

I will always hold that fanfiction will have off characterizations, hell even canon is accused of off-characterizations. I don't doubt that you work on your characters, but these characters aren't objectively anything but figments of JK's imagination. You obviously have a very different Hermione than I do and we both have an obviously different Hermione than D/Hr shippers have. None of these are correct so to speak, and all are different degrees of plausible. There's no superior trope or ship.
