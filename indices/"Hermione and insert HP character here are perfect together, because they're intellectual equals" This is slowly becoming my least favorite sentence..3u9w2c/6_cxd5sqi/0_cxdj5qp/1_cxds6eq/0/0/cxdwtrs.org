  And it's all butchering characters, you're doing that anyway. You'd best get off a high horse about purity of characterization if you're writing fanfics.

Hold on there, Mr. Projection. When I'm writing fics I actually try very hard to keep the cast in character. And I appreciate fics that do the same. I don't see the point of using a character if you're just going to completely change its personality. Harry is the exception to the rule for me, because he has certain inherent features which make him special, and thus isn't defined by his personality.
