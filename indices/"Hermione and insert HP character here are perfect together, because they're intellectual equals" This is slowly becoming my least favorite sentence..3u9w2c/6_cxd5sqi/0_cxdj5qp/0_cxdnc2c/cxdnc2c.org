In regards to the wish-fulfillment, super!Harry fics seem to get called out more often than the reverse, these days. Not that either is appealing, but readers/authors have tended to minimise Hermione's flaws* while maximising everyone else's.

Except for Hermione-bashing fics, in which almost entirely new flaws are inserted for a multitude of silly reasons.
