Uh, yes. Tom Riddle, handsome teenage dark lord, falls in love with a homely muggleborn girl because she... does really good on her essays and stuff. Never mind the differences in mentality or anything. SHE ACED HER TEST IN ARITHMANCY. How coulD YOU NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER??!

You know what, just generally "X falls in love with Hermione" seriously bothers me. Whether it's Harry, Sirius, James, Draco, Lord Voldemort, Snape or Barty Crouch, it all seems to me like wish-fulfillment for girls, because, as a guy who had read the Harry Potter books many more times than he'd seen the movies (where she is a Mary-Sue), Hermione's character is plainly unattractive - repulsive, even. In reality, very few attractive, successful men would go for a girl like her.
