We don't know everybody in her generation. We know very little. But it also depends on how you define intellect, because Percy Weasley, for example, managed to receive perfect scores on all his /twelve OWLs/, something that Hermione did not quite managed to achieve. He also managed to climb up the ranks of the Ministry so fast that he became assistant to the Minister for Magic after /one year/. So, in some ways, I'd say he's more than her intellectual equal.
