Mmm, keeping in mind that I'm not too interested in prov envy's writing or Riddle, Riddle/anyone. I just did and... I'm still not sold.

Just a few things that were off to me:

Riddle was too forthright. Young Riddle projects himself as innocent and 'I'm just a poor boy'. (How he speaks to Dumbledore and Harry, his designated rivals, is different)

He didn't possess Hermione, at all. Is also attracted to her, inexplicably.

Salazar apologism, he also openly divulges his blood status, no longer cares about blood supremacy or anything that comprises his character.
