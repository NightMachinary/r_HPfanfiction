I have no problem with people liking or writing fanfiction that pairs Hermione with other characters. I do, however, have a problem when they try to insist that she deserves better because [Ron, canon Harry, canon Draco, etc] is not her intellectual equal. Reddit is generally very negative towards the f-word, but I'm going to go ahead and say this anyway...that's sexist bullshit. It's implying that Hermione simply cannot be allowed to be the smarter, more successful person in the relationship. The girl is EXTREMELY competitive. It's probably the main reason she was placed in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw (you know, behind bravery). I have the feeling that Canon Hermione would always be trying to one-up an "intellectual equal"...and therefore, extremely unhappy.

By all means, keep writing fanfiction with other pairings. That's the point of fanfiction. Just don't say that.
