So I missed this post at first, but I'm glad I found it. While I take a little bit of umbrage with the whole reacher/settler dynamic in any relationship (it's just... /hm/...), Hermione is very clever, and is very likely to find herself being the more intelligent partner in most - if not all - of her romantic relationships, should she choose to have them.

By and by, Harry and Ron were keen to admit that she was brilliant, and that's what made the trio so endearing. They valued each other for /who they were./ Totally agree with you on the sexism point, though I'd also say that there's a little bit of intellectual snobbery there too... at least among some of the Hermione fans (not all!).
