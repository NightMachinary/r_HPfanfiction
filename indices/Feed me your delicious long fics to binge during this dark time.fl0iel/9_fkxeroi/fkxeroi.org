linkao3(Swung by Serafim) is a really great Snape mentors Harry fic. linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) is, imo, the best characterization of Snape I've seen, and a really underrated fic. linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill) is the first in a series. I'm also going to plug my own series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It's also posted on ao3 under the same title and I'm currently on year four (200k+ words combined). It's a Slytherin trio with an emphasis on politics and world building.
