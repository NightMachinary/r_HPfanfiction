Not the person you asked, but I know the story really well.

The story asks the question how things could have turned out if Harry had reacted differently to seeing Draco crying in Myrtle's bathroom. If instead of drawing wands at each other, Harry had used this to offer protection.

Canon-Harry (married to Ginny with 3 children) gets the chance to visit that alternative universe, only to find himself living with Draco and Ginny being married to Blaise Zabini.

It is really well written, the author is amazing. I personally prefer her other series "Foundationverse" starting with Reparations and continueing with Foundations, but I can definitely see the attraction of Turn/Turnverse.

Reparations is also Draco/Harry; Harry is a healer and has to do a rotation at the rehab centre of St. Mungos. He quickly finds that the centre is run by Draco, who has a complicated history with magically enhanced drugs and potions.
