Yep this. The first half of the fic is Harry in this alternate universe then the second half is how that affects his life back in the canon (and epilogue compliant) universe

I'd add that rather than being an auror, alt universe Harry has a creative job that I won't spoil and lots of the other characters like Blaise Zabini and Neville have non canon jobs. It's one of the things I love in fics, people expanding the universe and not just sticking to the few jobs we hear about in canon.
