linkffn(Potter's Protector by mjimeyg) - Buffy crossover set in the Potterverse, first in a 4-fic series that crosses with Marvel and DC in subsequent fics, mostly light-hearted with an OP Harry, but a lot of fun. Honestly, I'm fond of everything by mjimeyg except their Firefly fics.

linkffn(Harry Crow) - Yes, I went there. It's not perfect, and it definitely bashes Dumbledore and to some degree Ron, but it also does a phenomenal job of letting the characters drive the plot and grow and develop, unlike the canon's "nobody ever changes except to go OOC in service of the plot". Also, it's one of the few written works to get me so emotionally invested that some scenes actually got my heart pounding.

linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) - Harmony, some Dumbledore bashing; Harry and Hermione flee Britain in response to a marriage law.

linkao3(Umino Iruka and the Wizarding World) - Self-promotion. A Naruto crossover set in the Potterverse without nerfing ninjas or letting them run roughshod over everything.
