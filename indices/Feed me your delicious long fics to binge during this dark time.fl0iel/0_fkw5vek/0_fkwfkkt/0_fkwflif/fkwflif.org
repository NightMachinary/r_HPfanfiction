  Hogwarts Battle School offers nothing but endless challenges for Harry Potter. Headmaster Snape is always looking over his shoulder, watching his progress intently. The enemies are endless, all keen to beat the Boy-Who-Lived. He finds few friends in the Slytherin House, save for Blaise Zabini and Tracey Davis. His fiercest competitor, Hermione Granger of Gryffindor, is a ruthless rival. An unknown darkness lurks in the background. As he starts his Third Year, Harry realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
