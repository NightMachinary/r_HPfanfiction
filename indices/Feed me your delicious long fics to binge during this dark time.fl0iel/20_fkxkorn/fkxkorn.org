Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422]]

525k words (= as long as OOTP, GOF and PS/SS together) and IMO one of the best HP fanfics out there.

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dune-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems. It goes into what it means to be family and what it means to be a parent and especially what it means to be a good, responsible father. It explores trust issues as well. Lots of funny moments on top.

I also second the rec for "Turn" by Sara's Girl, but personally I prefer "Reparations" and "Foundations" by the same author.
