I pretty much only read stories that are complete, here are 3 that all over 250K but still really interesting and well written

linkao3(The Gloriana Set) linkao3(The Eagle's Nest) Linkao3(Falling Through Time) The first two are Hermione/Draco 8th year stories. The third one is Hermione/Fred where she accidentally time travels from about 7/8months after the war is over back to a day or so after the Battle at the Ministry.
