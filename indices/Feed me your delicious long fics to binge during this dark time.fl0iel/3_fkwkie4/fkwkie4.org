Definitely the linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, the linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) series, and linkffn(Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds; Finishing the Hat; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) - actually everything from the Carnivorous Muffin, they are a very prolific writer.
