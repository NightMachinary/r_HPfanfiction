Not sure how to link from fictionpress, and not harry potter, but its a 843k word beast of a fic. Complete. Not from a fandom, all original content Premise: MC is a student at a magic school when he suddenly finds himself stuck in a timeloop. Every month the loop starts over. MC has to figure out how to stop the loop, and become powerful enough to do so as well. Oh and stop the invasion too i guess.. [[https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning]]

Besides this VERY well written fic, are you looking for only hp fics, or are crossovers welcome too? Any other fandoms you would like? Got a particular good subnautica fic or 2 you might find pleasure in :)

Edit: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930]] is one of my favorite hp fics atm :) updates every wednessday/thursday (depending on timezone)
