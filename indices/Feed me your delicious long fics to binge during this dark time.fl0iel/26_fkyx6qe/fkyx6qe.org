Late to the party so I hope I don't repost some that were already recommended.

â€‹

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

Longest one I know. Ron centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy]])

Harry/Daphne with a very sudden twist

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe]])

Crossover with MCU

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]])

One of the old ones, very AU

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes]])

Another old one going through a re-edit for some reason

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12798308/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-s-Power]])

Another one with a sudden twist (or maybe 3 or 4) but a great AU with an OC character

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/33/His-Angel]])

Sadly abandoned. A Harry/Fleur

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2460400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Burden-of-Becoming]])

One of the reasons I made a FFN account was so I could save this story. Has a sequel

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back]])

One of the few complete time travel stories

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]])

So abandoned the writer deleted their profile and this is a repost, great nonetheless

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]])

Another complete time travel story, that answers the question "Would you kill child Hitler?"

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]])

A classic. Sad and happy at the same time he got in to professional writing

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess]])

The epilogue is a story on its own

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]])

Same author as above

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived]])

My favorite pairing: Harry/FemHarry. So rare, so hard to find
