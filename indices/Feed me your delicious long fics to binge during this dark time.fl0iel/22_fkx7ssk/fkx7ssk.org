Some of my favorites that I either didn't see yet in the comments or rarely see listed here. Mostly AUs beginning at first year, generally not harry/Ginny or Hermione although a couple are multi fics including one or both of them.

Also, I almost never read post-war fics, but really enjoyed Grow Young With Me. Do what you will with that
