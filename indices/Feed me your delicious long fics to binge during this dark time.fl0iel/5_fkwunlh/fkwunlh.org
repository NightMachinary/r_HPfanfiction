There's a trilogy by greengecko: resonance(528k), revolution (397k) and resolution (787k)

I really enjoyed reading it and I think it's a pretty unique story: it is one of the few good guy Snape stories I like, there's an interesting added magic system, the story goes through the end of Hogwarts and Auror training and because the writer started in 2005 it's pretty different (though I think he did adapt some things after the last book came out to make most of the story fit canon)

Also, I don't know why but somehow this fic made me want to be a teacher with its version of Snape as a role model.
