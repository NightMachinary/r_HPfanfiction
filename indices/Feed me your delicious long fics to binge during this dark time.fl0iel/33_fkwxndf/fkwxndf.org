I'm reading it myself actually but the series (Harry Potter Everyone Lives AU) is very interesting, as Harry Parents dont die, Nevilles Parents dont get tortured etc.

These changes dont particularly change the timeline of upcoming events, so it doesnt really vary from canon in that way, but it's really good I can tell you that.
