Years 1-6 of Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" (new version). In my opinion, it is the best piece of Harry Potter fanfiction in existence. The depth he goes into with his cast of characters is absolutely staggering. Plus, the writing itself is brilliant. Year 7 is currently being written, so it's a great time to read the first 6 and get caught up. You won't regret it.
