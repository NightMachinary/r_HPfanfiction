Okay, prepare yourselves!

The Debt of Time; Hermione is transported back in time to the marauder era and grows up as James' twin sister. Possibly my favourite fanfic of all time.linkffn(10772496)

The Arithmancer (has two sequels which are also amazing); Rather than Hermione growing up as a book worm she is a math genius.linkffn(10070079)

The Green Girl; Hermione is sorted into Slytherin (Dramione)linkffn(11027125)

One Hundred and Sixty Nine; Hermione goes back in time to 169 days before James and Lily are killed to try to change things (Sirius/Hermione)linkffn(8581093)

Alternate History; Hermione is thrown into a parallel universe where things are very different.linkffn(11210783)

Those are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head but I'm sure I'll come up with more down the road!
