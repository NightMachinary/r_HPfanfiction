I just finished The Cupboard Series by Stargon

It's a full series starting at Philosopher's Stone and working through where Harry meets Hermione at Kings Cross instead of Ron. Definitely worth a read [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][*https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895*]]

I would also highly recommend his story Muggle-Raised Champion, in which the Dursley's ban Harry from going to Hogwarts but his name still comes out of the goblet of fire and he has to compete with little to no magical knowledge. It has a sequel in the works but it hasn't been updated since New Years.

What kind of fits are you into? I have a long list of Hermione centric pics that were recommended to me that I could send you, feel free to PM if interested :)
