I don't care if they are empathetic or not, they still break the laws and would have been summarily executed by any side in WWII. As for time travel to the 40s, it is utterly retarded when the time traveler chooses to waste years on Riddle when there is that chap named Hitler running around, whose Death toll is several magnitudes higher.

No matter from which angle you look at it, when Malfoy attacks Katie he still is disguising himself as civilian, not wearing distinctive insigniae and attacking civilians. That makes him an illegal combatant, who were regularly subject to summary execution (nowadays trial as war criminal). And that's completely ignoring membership of the Death Eaters (Treason), attempted murder and using an unforgivable.
