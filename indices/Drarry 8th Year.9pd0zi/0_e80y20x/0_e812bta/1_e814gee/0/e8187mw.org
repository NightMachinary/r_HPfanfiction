But they usually include time travel back to a time where she was not a batshit insane sadistic terrorist, when she was a powerful witch but otherwise pretty much a blank character. On the other hand, we know that Snape chose his shady friends over Lily, we know that Malfoy called for Genocide at age 12 and showed clear sadistic tendencies at 13. By the age of 16, Voldemort had already murdered four people. There are many parts of their canon characterisation which would prohibit the common Bellatrix scenarios (time travel, she was forced by a marriage contract or potions) to work. Most Harry/Bellatrix scenarios also diverge before she killed Sirius. Without that, there is nothing personal between them.

If you want to make the same changes to the common slash pairings, you'd need to diverge in 92 (Malfoy), 78 (Snape) or even earlier for Voldemort.
