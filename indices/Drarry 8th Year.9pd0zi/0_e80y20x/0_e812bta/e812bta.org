We have nothing against m/m in general. But in the HP fandom, ~90% of all m/m fics involve Voldemort or a Death Eater and one of their victims (like Harry). And given that they are inspired by the Third Reich, people like OP are basically asking for the magical equivalent of Anne Frank/Heinrich Himmler. It makes absolutely no sense that Harry would be attracted to the people who killed his parents, his father figure and a bunch of other people dear to him.

And it's not like Malfoy is innocent. Just in his attack on Katie he committed several war crimes, and that's not even taking the basic "attempted murder" and "terrorism" into account. So even if Harry was gay, he'd rather date Gwamp than the magical Nazis he just fought a civil war against.

Perhaps if OP asked for Harry/Terry Boot, people would be more accepting, but Malfoy, Snape, Voldemort, the Lestranges, Rookwood and Dolohov are simply a no-no from the character standpoint.
