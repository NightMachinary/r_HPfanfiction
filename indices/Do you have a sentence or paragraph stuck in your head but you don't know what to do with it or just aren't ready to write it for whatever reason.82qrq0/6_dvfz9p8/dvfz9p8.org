"Loving you has been the best, worst thing in my life!" She shouted suddenly. It caught him off guard. How the hell was he supposed to respond to that? They had literally just been talking about Quidditch of all things.

"I'm sorry, what?" He asked with bated breath. He had other things that needed doing.

"I... Ginny, I can't love you like you want me to." Harry responded, his voice a whisper.

"I hope Voldemort kills you!" She screeched in return. Harry flinched.
