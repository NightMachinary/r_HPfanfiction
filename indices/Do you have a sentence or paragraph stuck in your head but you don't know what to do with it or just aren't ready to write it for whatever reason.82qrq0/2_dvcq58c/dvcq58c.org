A lot of the time that this happens to me, it's not quite a line or paragraph, but an action by a character or, strangely enough, a song that I feel like it could be the theme song almost for a chapter in the story.

However, one that I have had in my head is supposed to be set part way through Goblet of Fire and goes something along the lines of:

  Ron stood alone at the corner of the long hallway, listening to a group of voices coming from around the corner, none of which he could put a face too. Listening he heard them shouting at the current centre of everyones ire, Harry Potter, interrogating how he cheated his way into the tournament to top all tournaments. As he stood there, listening to them call Harry a liar, a cheater and a whole host of other unpleasent discriptors, he felt his anger rising. It was true, he didn't know how Harry had got himself into the tournement, and he was angry that he didn't share it with him. But these people were standing here talking bad about his best mate, the boy who had stood by him through everything Ron had needed him for. How dare they. How DARE they! With that, Ron stepped around the corner. Harry Potter may or may not be a cheating prick, but if he was, then he was Ron's cheating prick. Anybody who wanted to do anythng about it would now have to go through him!

Or something like that at least. I've seen a lot of stories with a lot of Ron bashing, and while I can appreciate that style, I haven't seen a lot where he actually stands up to be counted on Harry's side after his initial mistake, so it's something I wanted to try.
