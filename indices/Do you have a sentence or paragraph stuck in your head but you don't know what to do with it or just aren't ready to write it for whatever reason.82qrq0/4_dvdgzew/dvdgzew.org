For me it was the idea of Harry and Hermione almost having sex, but at the last moment rolling apart and just continuing as good friends.

"She looked down their bodies then up into Harry's eyes, and bit nervously on her lower lip. Harry watched her eyes move then fixed her gaze with his own. He paused for one final moment... and then rolled away, turning onto his back to lie next to her."

That led to my story Going Muggle, which I really need to finish at some point.
