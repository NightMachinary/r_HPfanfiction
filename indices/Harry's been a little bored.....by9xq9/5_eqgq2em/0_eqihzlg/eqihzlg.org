I kinda mixed all the craziest ideas partially from my own ideas (trying to write a full length fic but it's hard) and partially inspired by other fics into this.

Basilisk breeding is done in linkffn(If looks could kill)

The rocket assisted broom appears in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), although in that fic Harry's using a much more primitive solid rocket booster instead of a bipropellant liquid engine.

Harry living at Grimmauld with Sirius instead of with the Dursleys happens in quite a few fics.
