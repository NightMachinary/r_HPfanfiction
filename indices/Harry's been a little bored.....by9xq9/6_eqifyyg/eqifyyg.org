Hey question? Just to shut everyone up, was you making it one big paragraph intentional to, as kyella14 said, give it a rambling rushed feeling. I ask, because apart from it being all one paragraph, the grammar is impeccable. I feel like soneone who can write at that quality wouldn't make such mistakes.
