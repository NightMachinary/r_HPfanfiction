This is Ice Age by ryuugi. It's on ff.net but only with a few chapters. On [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-the-dresden-files-ice-age.280474/][spacebattles]], there are more chapters, but still unfinished.

Btw, if you enjoy this, you might like the reverse set up. In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/don-dresden-founder-of-hogwarts-dresden-files-harry-potter.790927/][Don Dresden]], Harry Dresden goes back to England just after the Norman conquest. It's sort of a fusion between Dresden Files and Harry Potter. It's also still updating regularly.
