I just finished The Secret Language of Flowers and it's pretty dang good. Little heavy-handed on the "Everything is nice, but THEN EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY WAS NOT." thing, but overall real interesting. Doesn't put much effort into redeeming 'old Dray-Dray, but it does okay with not making all the racist Nazis secretly good people.

Like a Ghost in my Town is one of two Harry-Voldemort fics I've actually enjoyed. If you don't enjoy the first one, you can skip it and move straight on to the second - it's a really great sequel in that it explains most of what happened in the first book without just exposition-recapping it all.

Hogwarts Crammer has Harry not ever going to Hogwarts and all the kids going over to find him later on when the war kicks off.

And finally, Life Skills Outside the Curriculum, which is written by the same author as Language of Flowers and is markedly less Sad about everything. Homeless Harry on the streets (for a while) eventually gets joined by Draco. It's an interesting development arc for him, I gotta say.
