I have read this series, and really enjoyed it. However, it had one fairly major flaw that made it a bit of a slog to get through - no matter how the author changes Harry, it never affects canon at all. It has a lot of potential but doesn't really make use of it in my opinion. Still a good read though, and it's been a few months since I read it so it might not be as bad as I remember.
