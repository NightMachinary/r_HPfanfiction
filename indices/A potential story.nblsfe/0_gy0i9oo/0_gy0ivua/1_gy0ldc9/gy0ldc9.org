If you don't mind, I would recommend an African goddess for Hermione. I don't think anyone has ever done that and it would be nice to see what you can come up with. However, it would also be cool if she was a less known Greek goddess, most people would probably just make her an Athena reincarnate.

I don't really know anything about Celtic or Persian gods so that would be fun to see too. Whichever you choose, I'm sure it will be great.
