One difficulty with writing an African Goddess is that we have a lot less of myths and informations about them compared to the Greeks or the Egyptians (unless you are from around them I guess). Especially since there isn't one "African" religion but several that may be more or less related to each other.

Still, assuming your character retain their Canon personality, both the Ancient Greeks/ Romans and the Africans seem to have some Deities that may make an interesting mix with Hermione:

As an example, a quick search on Wikipedia gave me the name of "Gbadu" from the Dahomey mythology (current Benin), which seems to be some Goddess of Fate. I personally like the idea of Hermione hating Divination because she found out from the start that Trewalney was a fraud. The Ijo(?) people of Nigeria also seemed to have a Goddess of fate with the name of Woyengi (though she seems to be more important in their Pantheon, with Fate merely being an aspect of her).

Also, the Greek and Roman mythology propose other choices than the obvious Athena/Minerva, such as Mnémosyne/Moneta, which is the Goddess of Memory (which in my opinion would totally fit Hermione). And that's just by restricting the Gender of Gods (does Gender really matter for them? Especially after a reincarnation?).

​

Anyways, I find your idea very interesting, and I would love to read a fic like this. Using some less known religions may be hard, and may need more explanations in the test for the readers, but it could also make the story better depending of how is it treated.

As a last question (if you have ever though about it yet). Would the Trio be the only Deities or do you plan to do the same for other characters? I'm just afraid that, no matter the conflict, the balance of power may be a bit too favourable for the Trio if they are the only side with Gods on their side.
