Well, Seventh Horcrux, obviously. But apart from that, a few that I liked linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate; Make a Wish by Roscharch's Blot; Oh god not again; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; Dear Order). And everything else by nonjon is amazing as well.

I also kind of enjoyed The champion's champion, but that isn't to a lot of people's taste, and I wouldn't say it's a favourite, still fun to read though.
