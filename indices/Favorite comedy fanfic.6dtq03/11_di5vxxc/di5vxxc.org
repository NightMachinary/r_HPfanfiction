Well, outside of Seventh Horcrux (who doesn't have that on their favourite list?) and nonjon's stuff (likewise) and some other stuff that's already been recommended, I can throw in:

“Biting the Hand That Feeds You” (linkffn(10287864)), featuring hilarious pairings, hilarious ministry incompetence, /The Loremaster/, and /The Godfather/

esama's “Tumbling HP Crossovers” (linkao3(1647644)), which is basically her dumping bin for whatever ideas about HP crossed with anything she gets. It has some slash (if you want to avoid it, steer clear of the chapters where it crosses with Naruto) and some of those snippets might not be very fun, but on the average it's quite entertaining.

“Inspected By No 13” (linkffn(10485934)), wherein a bureaucrat Harry is getting through the Triwizard Tournament.
