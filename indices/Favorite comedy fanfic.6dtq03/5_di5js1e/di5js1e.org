There are only 2 comedy fanfics that consistently sent me into peels of laughter are linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot; Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB).

Make a wish has a hilarious plot line that is actually really well thought out. This is, for me, easily the best comedy fic in the fandom.

Harry the Hufflepuff seemingly started out as a funny plot bunny by the author but actually grew into a series of 3 short fics. The humor in this just works.

Other great comedy fics that are fantastic, but were not as funny as the two mentioned above: linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter by nonjon; Almost a Squib by BajaB;The Wendall the Wasn't by opalish)

Then there is a category of fics which are really great, and also very funny, but the greatness of these fics is not derived from their humor value. linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; Browncoat; Green Eyes by nonjon; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin; Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

Lastly, don't forget that canon was actually pretty damn hilarious at points.
