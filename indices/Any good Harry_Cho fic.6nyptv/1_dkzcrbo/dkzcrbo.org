Hey, I know this is a bit late, but here's a few I've found that are pretty good.

linkffn(The Seekers) It's probably the best I've read, though it's a bit short. It has a sequel that never got more than a chapter, unfortunately.

linkffn(WIZARDS DUEL) It's a complete trilogy, but I haven't finished them all yet, just book one. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/646172/1/]]

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Betrayal_of_the_Best_Kind/index/]] This one is excellent, and has a wonderful second book as well.

linkffn(The Stag and the Swan) It's a good one-shot of a better Hogsmeade date.

linkffn(Thorns To A Rose) It's not the greatest, but it's a decent story for the most part. The last few chapters felt very hasty and didn't make a ton of sense, but it was alright. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1424025/1/]]

linkffn(An Impossible Change:办不到) I haven't gotten far yet, but it seems rather promising.

Unfortunately, Harry and Cho is very rare, so it seems we have to get it where we can. If you have any good ones, regardless of length, I'd certainly appreciate a link, if it's not too much trouble.
