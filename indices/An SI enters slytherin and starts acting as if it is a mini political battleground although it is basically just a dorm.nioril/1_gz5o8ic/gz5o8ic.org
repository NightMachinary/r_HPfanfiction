I adjusted my robes and remembered everything I had read and re-read from the books on genealogy and proper forms of address before the start of term. I'd only get one shot at this...

Malfoy was sitting on the floor of the common room next to Crabbe, I walked up trying to practice the walk I had found in the book on pureblood etiquette and cleared my throat. Malfoy looked up.

'Oh, hi' he said 'is your leg okay? you're kind of limping.'

'You should go see the nurse' Crabbe piped up with a grin 'I bet it's good for skiving off a few classes'

I was shaken but rallied quickly

'Heir Malfoy' I began, 'I formally seek an alliance with you and the noble houses of Malfoy and Black, for there is much I can offer and a pact between us would be of great benefit'

Malfoy stared and then, to my surprise, he burst out laughing.

'You're hilarious!' He exclaimed, between giggles 'Anthony wasn't it?'

'Antonine Perevell Slytherin-Black'

'Well Tony, I'm Draco and this here is Vince,' He smiled and Crabbe gave me a half wave 'we're playing exploding snap why don't you sit down and jump in for a round'

I didn't understand, I was sure I had gotten the wording exactly right, maybe I had messed up the walk?

I dumbly sat down as Malfoy and Crabbe shifted around to make room for me on the carpet and idly reached for the cards as I desperately tried to figure out how I had gone wrong. I just had time to register that the card I had picked up was the 9 of staves before it exploded in my face.
