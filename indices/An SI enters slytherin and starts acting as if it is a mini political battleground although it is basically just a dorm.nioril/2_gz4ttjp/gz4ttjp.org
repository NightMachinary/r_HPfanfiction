*"Fellow Slytherins! We need to stand united against the rest of the houses. We need to have each other's backs. We need to prove the teachers that the patron saint of our house, Salazar, was not wrong to select us the purebloods as his apprentices. Yes?"*

"Professor Snape gives us points for showing up to his class. He's pretty nice and that usually helps us win the House Cup."

*"Uhm... OK. Any other questions? Yes?"*

"Who's Salazar?"

*"Salazar Slytherin, the founder of our house, the greatest wizard of all times."*

"Why was he the greatest? Did he invent any cool spells?"

"I bet he invented the Jelly-Leg Jinx and the Tongue Tying Curse."

*"Well that's not actually the point but..."*

"So then what makes him the greatest?"

*"Guys, I thought you were supposed to be cunning and ambitious."*

"Oh... so the guy is just trying to suck up for brownie points with the prefects."

*"I am not. I am trying to inspire you. To get you to be the greatest witches and wizards of your time."*

"Cool! Will you teach us how to make prank jinxes?"

*"No! I'm trying to unite you under a powerful wizard's leadership so that we can one day rule Magical Britain."*

"Why a wizard and not a witch?"

*"Because I am a wizard."*

"So you're going to teach out how to rule Magical Britain?"

*"Not by myself but together with you, my friends."*

"How can we be friends if we don't even know your name?"

*"We'll support each other. We'll create a network of allies and we will raise up in the ranks of the Ministry."*

"Dad says that the Ministry sucks."

*"Well there will always be people hating us but we will rule our world."*

"Will we get to choose who wins the Quidditch professional league?"

*"I suppose we could do that too."*

"Now you're talking. I'm going to make a law that declares the Tutshill Tornadoes champions for all eternity."

"What? The Holyhead Harpies would totally deserve that title."

"Fuck you guys! I'm going to make the Chuddley Cannons champions."

*"Guys... guys... this is not about Quidditch! This is about so much more than that..."*

"What's the point in ruling Britain if you can't make your favorite Quidditch team champion?"

*"Money... influence... power..."*

"Daddy is rich."

"My parents said they'll buy me a Firebolt."

"I'd like some money. How many galleons do you think I'll get if I sell a full collection of chocolate frog cards?"

*"Uhm... not sure. OK. I get it, your family's rich. But what about power and influence?"*

"Crabbe and Goyle are pretty strong. Not sure we could beat them."

*"Fuck this shit."*
