Darklordpotter has a billion stories like this in their library, so you should check that out. It's fairly easy to find good stories on there, and most of them fall under the categories you describe.

Off the top of my head, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. Harry isn't Slytherin, and he isn't particularly dark (though possibly more than in canon), but he is most definitely smart. It's a time-travel fic, and the main pairing is Harry x young!Bellatrix. The pairing is not too "in-your-face" though. I really recommend this one.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
