Tbh we know so little about snape. It's on purpose, really, and in this regard the books are written like a mystery novel - who he was, and what motivated him had to be a secret revealed at the end in order to have the impact it did. JKR has spoken a few times in interviews on this.

So there's lots of gaps in Snapes character that fandom has filled.

We know for sure his mum got yelled at by his dad, that she cowered and snape cowered from it too. We know his summers were spent bored at home killing flies on the ceiling like Harry. We know that he wore his mums clothes, common at the time for families of poverty. And there are a few indicators of poverty in his family home, if you're aware of mill towns in that time era in the UK.

Pottermore also indicated that snape got the belt from his dad. Where or not you consider this a valid source is up to you.

Speaking frankly, the canon is so large in its gaps of snape that fandom has come up with things that are so commonly held it can be hard to track what is and isn't canon. But we know so little. We have no idea even about what his wand was, and he is one of the few characters that we don't know this basic fact. The fics you talk about are heavily anchored in fanon expansion of snape as a character. If you don't enjoy snape as a character, as a lot of people don't, they won't be your cup of tea.
