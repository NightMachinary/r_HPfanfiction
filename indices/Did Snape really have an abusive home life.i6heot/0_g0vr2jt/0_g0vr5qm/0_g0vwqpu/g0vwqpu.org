Sorry! It's being whipped, not belted. Full quote from potter more, and I don't think it's up anymore:

His first name, Severus, has its roots in Latin, directly translating to mean ‘stern' or ‘harsh'. This was exactly the front that Snape put on as he swept down hallways like a bat and berated Harry for every wrong: a stern and harsh façade to hide what lay beneath. It was also an accurate description of the desperately lonely and unhappy childhood he had with a harsh father who didn't hold back when it came to the whip.”
