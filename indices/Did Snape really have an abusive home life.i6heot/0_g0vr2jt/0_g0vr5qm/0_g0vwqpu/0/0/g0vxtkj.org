Yeah. I choose to interpret it in the social context at the time. Mill towns were pretty destitute when Snape would have been growing up in them, and I feel like the few scenes we get are heavily coded for domestic abuse, poverty and unfortunately family violence.

The problem I sometimes have with fan content is that people take this to an extreme like extreme physical abuse, sexual abuse, etc etc. To be honest, a verbally violent home in poverty with belting or whippings - while normalised in many households before domestic violence advocacy became more normal in the 80s and 90s in the UK - is already pretty extreme. People come away from households like that very bitter, emotionally damaged, and kind of like Snape. We remove children from those homes now. It's very bad, even without the gratuitous violence piled on by some Fanfics. JKR has her own experiences with domestic violence, and I felt that her coded depiction is convincing and nuanced. From our modern perspective we can kind of understand the implications of that environment.

We also have to bear in mind that domestic violence has meant different things over different times. Snapes household probably was just seen as distastefully bad, but not call the police bad for that era. Back then you had to really batter your wife around before the boys in blue got called.
