Yeah I see what you mean - definitely down to interpretation. Given the era he grew up in, I think the vast majority of kids were beaten on occasion, it was completely normal, but similarly it could also just be read as his father being very stern.

I think he probably was, but it wouldn't have been regarded as abuse - he and Lily probably just thought of it as vaguely bad.
