I think so, though like with all abuse, fanon dials it up to 100. I think Rowling clearly enough insinuated his father was a wife beater, and also an abusive drunk father. This isn't particularly surprising as most of the father/husband figures in HP and all of J.K Rowling's books are awful abusive men. Given her own biography, father and first husband, this is understandable.

Was his dad the cartoonish figure of fanon?I highly doubt it, As someone with a drunk father who would terrorize me occasionally, but was overall nice and loving, I can only interject my own experience. I'm not even comfortable considering my experiences abuse even though logically I understand it fits the definition. Real life has layers of nuance that fiction, and more so fanfiction, often lack.
