Hmm. The closest I've ever seen to this was linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi).

He flatly refuses to compete because he doesn't want to. He's utterly unconcerned about losing his magic or anything like that because regardless of what others may think, he knows that he did not enter himself. He can't violate a magical contract because he isn't in one.

He does end up competing because someone asks him to, so it doesn't fit, but I assume that nothing would have happened to him.
