I can't remember either to be honest, so could be! I vaguely remember another fanfic where grindelwald either lost in 1945 and immediately escaped and put Dumbledore in chains or beat him originally and took his place. Either way, he took the place of albus and gloated it over him. But I still don't think it was Core Threads.
