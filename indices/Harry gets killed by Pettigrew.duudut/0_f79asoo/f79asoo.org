First of all, Dumbledore isn't going to "use" anyone. Harry was BWL because of Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's choices, and Lily's sacrifice. Rather, it'll be up to the good people of Wizarding world---including Dumbledore---to fight and defeat Voldemort and his followers.

Off the top of my head,

- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels explore Harry dying in his infancy and its consequences.
- linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) has a reincarnated!Harry who isn't BWL.
