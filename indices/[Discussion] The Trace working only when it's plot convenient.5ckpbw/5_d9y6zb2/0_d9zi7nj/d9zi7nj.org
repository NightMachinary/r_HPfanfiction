I just thought of something...in Order of the Phoenix, Tonks casts a Scourgify on Hedwig's cage, right? But Harry doesn't get a warning notice, despite that he's likely under extra scrutiny due to previously casting a Patronus that same day.

This would hold with your hypothesis that the trace triggers if a spell happens near a magical child who isn't in the company of an adult witch/wizard. Dobby wouldn't be recognized as an adult witch/wizard, nor would the dementors, but Cedric Diggory (remember he's of age), Peter Pettigrew, and possibly Voldemort, all would count as adults.
