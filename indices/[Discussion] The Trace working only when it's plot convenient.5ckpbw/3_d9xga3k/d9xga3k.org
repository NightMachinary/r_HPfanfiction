The trace only worked when it was plot convenient because... it was plot convenient.

JKR was really not that good about internal consistency - which is fine, as it gives us lots of room to expand. But when we come across stuff like the Department of Mysteries (what kind of R&D department has a /roulette room/ as a defense measure? Or not have personnel staffing it 24/7? It's a government headquarters, not a bloody office.) or the Trace choosing when and where to work (PACK!, anyone?), the answer is because it was convenient and JKR decided not to spend her time trying to pin down minutia.
