If the presence of adults overshadows underage magic and makes it ok it wouldn't have been a problem for Harry to get side-along apparated.

The only thing the presence of Death Eaters would be mean is that there would be a ton of questionable curses added to the spells cast near said underage wizard. Like the AK's and Crucios that the Death Eaters cast but no one detected for some reason. Or were the regulators ok with those spells being cast near underage wizards.

Unless of course some areas are exempt from the list because Hogwarts and the Ministry would spam them with spells as long as a single kid is visiting.

Still doesn't answer how the Graveyard was left undetected unless Voldemort put wards up.
