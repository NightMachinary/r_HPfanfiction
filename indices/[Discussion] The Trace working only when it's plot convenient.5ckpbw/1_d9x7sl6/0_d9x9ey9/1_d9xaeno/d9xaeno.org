As far as I know it was okay for Harry to be side-along apparated. They didn't do it in the OOtP to get to the trial to make a better impression, and they didn't do it in DH because Thicknesse make it an imprisonable offence.

Maybe the graveyard was detected, but they either couldn't detect the perpetrator, or they thought it was some lunatic who thought that he was following Voldemort's orders (like Fudge says about Crouch Jr.).
