  If the presence of adults overshadows underage magic and makes it ok it wouldn't have been a problem for Harry to get side-along apparated.

And if it doesn't, then the Ministry would get an alert for No. 4 Privet Drive. A squad of Death Eaters could arrive within five minutes. But by the time a human could notice the Trace going off, Harry would be at Grimmauld Place and safely within the bounds of the Fidelius Charm. At that point, they didn't believe that Apparition could be tracked (or at least, Remus Lupin didn't), but if there were a special interaction between the Trace and Apparition, they could have transported his wand separately on the idea that the Trace might affect the wand rather than the area and gone by way of Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, which would likely confuse things even further.

But their plans were crafted for drama, not common sense.
