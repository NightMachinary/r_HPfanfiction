IMHO the Trace isn't really well thought out in Canon and I always appreciate a Fic that comes up with its own rules for it as long as they are consistent. There will always be people who are super upset when something isn't strictly canon, but IMHO it's a good idea to ditch canon when you can come up with something better (Trace, Wand-Lore, romance, incompetent adults).
