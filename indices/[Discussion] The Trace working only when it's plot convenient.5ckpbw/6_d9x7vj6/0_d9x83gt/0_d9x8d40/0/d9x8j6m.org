What element of it do you think is problematic?

The Ministry would be aware that magic was cast in that area. They would have no way to link it to Tom Riddle, since they have no personally identifying information, just what spells were cast in what areas. Any curiosity about why an unknown underage wizard had happened to be in the vicinity - assuming that the two different branches of the Ministry had been in contact with each other about it - would go away when Morfin confesses that he performed all of the magic that the Ministry detected, and his wand's "spell history" backed up his confession.
