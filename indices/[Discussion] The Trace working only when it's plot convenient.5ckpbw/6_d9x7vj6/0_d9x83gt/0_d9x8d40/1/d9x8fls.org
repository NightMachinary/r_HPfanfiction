  When the magic is cast in an area known to contain only one underage wizard (i.e. a Muggleborn), they will enforce the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery against that underage wizard, assuming the magic to have been cast by that person unless they have knowledge to the contrary. When magic is cast in any other location they cannot enforce the law because they lack sufficient information.
