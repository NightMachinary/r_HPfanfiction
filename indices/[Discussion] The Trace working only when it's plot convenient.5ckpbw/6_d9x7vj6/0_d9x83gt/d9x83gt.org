  Then other commenters came up with excerpts from DH that basically contradicted with what was said in Book 6.

No, they're reconcilable, just not in a way that you like.

The Trace is a piece of magic on each wizard under 17-years-old. It detects the magic cast around that person and where it is cast. The Ministry gets a list of which spells have been detected and the location where they have been cast, but they do not get the identity of the caster, nor do they get the identity of which underage wizard the spell was detected off.

When the magic is cast in an area known to contain only one underage wizard (i.e. a Muggleborn), they will enforce the Reasonable Restriction on Underage Sorcery against that underage wizard, assuming the magic to have been cast by that person unless they have knowledge to the contrary. When magic is cast in any other location they cannot enforce the law because they lack sufficient information. They do not issue multiple enforcement notices against a person who is already pending a hearing. They do not issue enforcement notices during term-term, nor before a person has started Hogwarts.

I'm fairly sure this accounts for all canon events and explanations.
