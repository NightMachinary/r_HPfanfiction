It can't be detected who cast the spell. Only that there was magic used near an underage magical. When you have death eater casting AK and Crucio and the location is a random graveyard or secret departments in the ministry of magic you would think someone would be sent to investigate.

It seems strange that in both cases such spells weren't detected near Harry and no one accused him of them, especially since there is no way of knowing that it was near him that those spells were cast and since he wasn't in Hogwarts.
