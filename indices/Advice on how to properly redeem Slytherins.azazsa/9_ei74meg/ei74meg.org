The way I have always written redeemed Slytherins is mostly by using background characters as the new Face of Slytherin. Those that choose to be neutral and stay out of conflict, inadvertantly allowing those like Pansy, Malfoy and Flint to be the loudest and most obvious Faces of Slytherin. Honestly, the way that Pansy, Malfoy and Flint act is not at all cunning. In fact, they act pretty Gryffindor-ish. I reckon they only got into Slytherin because their families expect it of them
