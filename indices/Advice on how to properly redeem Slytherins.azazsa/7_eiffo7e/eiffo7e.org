Are we redeeming Death Eaters or Slytherins here?

Slytherins imply that we're dealing with /children/. The majority is just regurgitating things and acting like they've seen from parents, etc. All they really need is better role models/friends with a less dulled moral compass. They don't really need any redemption besides "become better people".

This is assuming we're dealing with Slytherins before the N.E.W.T. years. At that point, they become more independent and their beliefs and actions are much less prone to quick changes. They may be full Death Eaters at that point (especially 7th years), and thus need more of a "proper" redemption arc.
