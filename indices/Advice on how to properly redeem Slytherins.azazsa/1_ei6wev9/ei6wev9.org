I think it's best to use the starting point that most Slytherins don't need all that much redemption. I generally like to think that the house could roughly be divided into three groups. The vocal extremist minority, like Draco. The quiet nice minority, who don't look down on muggles or muggleborns. Then there's the quiet majority; the ones who don't really like muggles, think they're generally inferior, but are perfectly happy to just keep a separation - absolutely no interest in killing muggles.

That's not a good attitude for the house have, but it's a lot better than the uniform rabid anti-muggle attitude that I see in fics.
