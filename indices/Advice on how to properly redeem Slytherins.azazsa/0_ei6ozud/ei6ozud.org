First of all my suggestion would be to remember that the books are told from Harry's perspective, a biased narrator. With the exception of a few (Draco, Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle,) we know very little about the other Slytherins besides cheating at Quidditch and being favored by Snape. In my mind most of them aren't evil incarnate, they are simply sitting on the sidelines quietly, much like many of the other students. The very fact that Harry never mentions them in canon tells me that they are simply going about their business as students.

You are right, trying to have full on evil characters do a complete 180 in the span of a year would be difficult. Trying to convince people who don't want to follow Voldemort but have been too scared to speak up because they didn't want to be the first in Slytherin to do so is much more realistic.
