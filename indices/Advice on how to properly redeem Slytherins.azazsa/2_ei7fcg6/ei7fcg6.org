You don't have to 'redeem' the majority of Slytherins. You just have to properly frame their choices. Harry Potter is a hero, he's special, he'll do all the admirable things that we wish we would do but would probably shy away from. From his point of view not doing anything is bad. For the Slytherins, if its not broken, why fix it? Given proper context a lot of decisions make more sense even if you disagree. Why fight for what's right when it doesn't really effect you? If Hermione and the Creevey's are the most visible muggleborns would you risk your life for them or are they just too annoying to go out of your way for when you're still in school? They're annoying, you don't really care either way would you fight your housemates over it?

The first thing to to do in my opinion is to recognise they're still basically kids. Kids gang up on others and do shitty things. Kids can be really mean. I doubt everyone in Slytherin was born the sum of all evil. Slytherin is about achieving whatever you want by whatever means. If you want to get through years of a boarding school you'd best get along with your room-mates and housemates. If your roommates hold certain views strongly it is easier to go along with it if you don't care either way than it is to argue.

If a roommate of yours for the next few years came in muttering about mudbloods etc and nobody else said anything would you stop and challenge them or would you roll your eyes and change the subject?

Some of the things they did were understandable if mean. Hermione is an annoying know-it-all. Harry does get away, sometimes even rewarded for things that would get others in trouble. Hermione getting hexed probably is funny from their point of view.

Another thing to consider when working out the character of an average Slytherin is the hostility of the other houses. Gryffindor might be the loudest but in the books the other houses cheer on Gryffindor to beat Slytherin. It makes sense for them to stick together when everyone else comes in hating them. Keeping them together also means they'll be more tolerant of each other's bullshit. At least that mudblood hater will always have your back if you're getting hexed in the corridor. It all adds up to being much easier to go along with the views of others. Go with the flow and survive. When the Death Eaters took over then you can flex that power a bit, if you go along with it you don't just survive you thrive. You don't have to believe in something to use it. Slytherin as a house would embrace that more than any other.

The vast majority of the house will have done nothing 'wrong' they just probably wouldn't have put themselves in danger which, when you consider that they're just children, is understandable. Maybe you believe that they have a 'duty' of some sort to do what is 'right' but I disagree. They might have been bullies, they might have been petty but so are all school children. 99% of people regret things they did when they were young. The other 1% are either lacking in the awareness to look back or are actual saints.
