I don't understand why you're being downvoted.

"Slytherin House" doesn't particularly need to be redeemed. It's just a place that you sleep at a school full of children. Being /in/ Slytherin does not inherently mean anything is wrong with you.

Unsurprisingly, children raised by the wizard equivalent of the KKK are going to share their parent's views. This isn't an "excuse" for characters like Draco, it's just /reality/.

So I suppose the answer to "fixing" Slytherin house would be to... I dunno, force all of Hogwarts to take a competent Muggle Studies course or something. Honestly, in a society with something like the Statute of Secrecy, the fact that this course isn't mandatory and literally one of the most important classes at Hogwarts is insanity.
