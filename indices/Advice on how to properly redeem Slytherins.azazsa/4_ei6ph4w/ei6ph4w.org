Let's talk about Malfoy, since he's /the/ Slytherin of the story.

When we meet Malfoy he starts going on about his prejudices, against muggles, against Hufflepuffs, against Hagrid. This is at the center of who he is as a person. In that he judges himself superior based around looking down on everyone else. The important thing to remember about this is that Draco is 11 years old. He doesn't have any opinions he didn't get from Lucius and Narcissa. He's never met Hagrid, he's probably never spoken to a Muggle. The only thing he needs to grow as a person is to grow up without following the familiar path of his parents.

This happens in canon when he's forced into a situation he's not okay with. It allows him to see that everything he thought he knew was wrong, or at least not necessarily true. You can make this happen gradually, teenagers don't need a big reason to be a rebel.
