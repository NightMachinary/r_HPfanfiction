Show them actually struggling between what is right and what is wrong, that slow struggle that takes halfway through the fanfic is more believable, then five chapters in.

Don't make them completely good guys, but also don't make them completely bad guys. Or not all of them.

Have some of them not agree with Dumbledore and Harry, but also not want to join Voldemort, maybe because they don't want to kill, or because they don't want to risk their life or something like that.

If it's during seventh year, and the Carrows are in charge what do the Slytherins do? Do some hold their head proudly, some keep their head down? Others try to help in secret? Maybe they weren't expecting for it to be that brutal and are struggling within themselves.

Maybe have some of them still hate creatures, maybe have some of them still not like Muggleborns, but are acceptable or ignore them.

People aren't black or white in terms of morality; everyone has a little bit of grey inside of them. Show that grayness, bring it out of them. What do they do in certain situations and do differently in others?

Also remember that not every Slytherin needs redemption; but if you want a Slytherin or two or maybe a few, to get redeemed; just make sure that it is believable enough.
