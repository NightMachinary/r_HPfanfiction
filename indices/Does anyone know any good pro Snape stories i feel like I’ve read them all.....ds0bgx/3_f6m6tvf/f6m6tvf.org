linkffn(Old Habits by randomdork11; Breathe; The Carriage Held)

These are all no romance Snape fics.

If you're willing to read HG/SS, I can link a ton more.

Also there's linkffn(Darkness Visible). I probably rec this way too much but it's my absolute favorite Snape fic of all time. He does a lot of dark things, but his actions are well justified (which is why I think this fits what you're looking for).

Edit: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5843170/1/Breathe][This]] is the correct link for Breathe.
