This one: /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]) is a snape adopts Harry one, eventual OP Harry but he earns it. Gets really good in the sequels.

This one: /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) doesn't have Snape as a main character but he's portrayed positively and it has a great plot.

And of course /linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]])

These are pretty well known so def possible you've read them, but hoping there's at least one new one on there.
