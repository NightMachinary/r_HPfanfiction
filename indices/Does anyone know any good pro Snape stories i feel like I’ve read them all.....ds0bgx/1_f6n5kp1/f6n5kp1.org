You mentioned you liked Snape slash, so I thought the secret language of plants qualified. It's Remus/Snape series where they raise Harry together after rescuing him from the Dursleys. It's quite long, which is good, and it has a nice balance of emotions. The first story in the series is called the meaning of mistletoe.

My favourite Snape slash fic series has to be Fantastic Beasts though. It made me incredibly sad that Kettleburn is so rarely used. The first fic is called The DiriCawl.

I have some other Snape slash fics but they tend to be dark.
