Favoritestracker.org has a dead link to "Harry Potter and the Power Pack," so presumably the author took it down at some point. There's still an author on fanfiction.net with the same name ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2972099/hockeygoalie1992][hockeygoalie1992]]), which looks old enough to be the same author, so you can try sending them a pm and ask about the story.
