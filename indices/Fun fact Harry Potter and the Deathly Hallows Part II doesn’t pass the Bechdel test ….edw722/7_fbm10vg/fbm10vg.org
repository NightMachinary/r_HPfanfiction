This seems like a ridiculously simplistic view on film diversity. Sure Hollywood is not perfect and it certainly wasn't before, but that doesn't mean you automatically can't enjoy a movie because two women didn't have a convo that may or may not be relevant to the story. Just enjoy what movies you like.
