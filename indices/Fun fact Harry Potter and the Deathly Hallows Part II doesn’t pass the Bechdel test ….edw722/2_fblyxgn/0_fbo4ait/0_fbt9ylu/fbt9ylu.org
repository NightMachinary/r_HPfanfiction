There was a line in the Cross-Time Engineer books (not a great series or even author for the discussions here) that went something like: "I can show you how to get more food, build better cities, have more comfortable lives, /but I can't make you love your fellow man/."

That line stuck with me - engineers and researchers can only do so much, it is up to priests and politicians to improves society. That said, one would hope the freedoms and comforts provided by innovators would be harnessed by those who can to improve how we relate to one another.
