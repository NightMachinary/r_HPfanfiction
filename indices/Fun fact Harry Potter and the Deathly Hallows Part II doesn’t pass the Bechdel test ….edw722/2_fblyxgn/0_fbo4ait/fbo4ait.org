JK Rowling's general approach is that magic should be able to solve /material/ problems but not /human/ or /societal/ problems. As such, while wizarding society is depicted as materially different to the Muggle world - different consumer goods, different professions, different currency and institutions - the way the people relate to each other and how society is structured are intended to be essentially familiar to a Muggle observer.

I think this was exactly the correct approach to take: it means the books simultaneously capture the wish fulfilment element of having magic, while also keeping the characters and conflicts relatable. It also helps to make the world feel more genuine, as changes in the nature of human relationships/society will strike readers as much more odd than changes in material circumstances.

The result is that wizarding society generally reflects the real world. Sometimes this is via a magical analogue (such as blood-prejudice for racism), but often it is a direct parallel (such as the class conflict between Malfoys and Weasleys). Only very rarely does wizarding society possess a genuinely novel societal problem with no Muggle counterpart (most obviously, inter-species relations).

The way in which the sexes relate and their position in society falls into the "direct parallel" category.

For reference, here's a picture of John Major's cabinet in 1996:

I no more criticise JKR for accurately depicting gender inequality than I do for accurately depicting the reality of economic inequality as between the Malfoys and Weasleys.
