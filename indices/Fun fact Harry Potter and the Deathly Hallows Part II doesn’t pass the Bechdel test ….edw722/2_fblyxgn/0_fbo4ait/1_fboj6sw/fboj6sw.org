Did you reply to the post you meant to reply to? The setting, as I wrote above, is largely egalitarian---probably about where Muggle Britain was in the 90s, maybe even more. This post was about the major characters and events specifically in Harry Potter's story, and I don't think that anything you write pertains to that.
