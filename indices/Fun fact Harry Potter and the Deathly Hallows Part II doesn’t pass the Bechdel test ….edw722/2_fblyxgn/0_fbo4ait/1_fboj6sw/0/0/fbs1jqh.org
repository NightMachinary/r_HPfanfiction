  All of the top-tier magic users

All characters specific to Harry Potter's story (excepting Flamel, whom I had tagged with a question mark for a reason). The setting, as far as we can tell, gives wizards and witches equal educational opportunities and other opportunities to gain power (however defined). If we postulate that Dumbledore-grade genius/talent/power (however defined) has a higher probability of occurring in wizards than in witches, that would make it a part of the setting, but I don't think there is much of a case for that with a sample size this small.

Again, highest-ranked woman that appears in Harry Potter's story. In the broader setting, majority of Harry's life from birth to Battle of Hogwarts had been spent under Minister Millicent Bagnold---but he didn't know it; and depending on what you consider canon, he lived another big chunk of his life under Minister Hermione Weasley.

That show up (in Harry's life).
