I recognise the challenge of separating the lead character's experience from the setting, but I don't think the qualifications are as meaningless as you say. For example, the fact of Amelia Bones's existence contributes to the egalitarianism of the setting; but her negligible role in Harry's story contributes to the imbalance in the story.

We also get our fair share of historical references. For example, as far as we can tell, Hogwarts founders were the top-tier wizards for their time, and they were gender-balanced. More generally, top-tier wizardry is a category that simply does not exist IRL and has nothing comparable IRL. IRL, a tyrant cannot exist without followers to enforce his or her will; in Potterverse, Voldemort empowered the Death Eaters far more than the other way around. Thus, even if the author set out to mirror RL society, it is a far more arbitrary decision than the others.

The reason I had asked you if you replied to the correct post is that in a different post I /did/ speculate about what a hypothetical "egalitarian utopia" may or may not look like, and your reply would have been a very meaningful reply to that.
