The qualifications "that appear in Harry's story" or "in Harry's life" are pretty meaningless qualifications since, you know, basically everything we know about the setting is via Harry's life. If a character doesn't appear in Harry's life, they don't appear.

For example: the top-tier magic users that appear in Harry's life are also the only top-tier magic users we know of, and they are all male.

Similarly, Amelia Bones is both the highest ranking (living) female Ministry official who we know of, and the highest ranking female Ministry official in Harry's life.

Etc.

The point is that in all these categories, men dominate the top levels - magic, political power, wealth, etc. This is a faithful depiction of real life gender inequality. But what it /isn't/ is an egalitarian utopia.

To say that the HP world is egalitarian because women have the same magical potential as men is like saying the real world is egalitarian because women have the same intelligence as men. Nonetheless, men dominate society, especially in the 1990s... and similarly, in magical society, it's a very male-dominated society.

As for Bagnold, a Margaret Thatcher analogue, unless you think Thatcher being Prime Minister meant Britain had become an egalitarian society, then Bagnold's existence doesn't do much to make the world seem more egalitarian. But in any event, I think the focus of this discussion is on the society /as depicted in the books/. Of course JKR has added in a load of extra female Ministers for Magic in the "extended canon", but that doesn't suddenly make the society depicted in the books more egalitarian. If anything, it would seem to introduce a strange regression to wizarding society whereby women seem to be reducing in role.
