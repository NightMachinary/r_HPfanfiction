Fair points, all. I haven't read many stories that took place in a British school, so I don't have the same benevolent-headmaster stern-headmistress association, but there might be one for all I know. (Still doesn't preclude Fem!Grindelwald. :P) And, I agree on "default" gender of antagonists.

That said, I think that you're overstating the difficulty of convincing the reader a bit: readers generally take this sort of thing in stride and might even remember the character better. For a somewhat distant example, the character of Toph Beifong from /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ was originally conceived as a boy, before ultimately being written as a girl. I think that it's fair to say that she is a far more memorable character as a girl than she would have been as a boy. However, we don't have a way of resolving what-ifs like that, and I don't have much interest in psychoanalysing Rowling about why she did something in a certain way, so I'll happily concede that you may well be right.

Regarding Ron's brothers, I don't think they contributed to the male-ness that much, since they don't actually show up that often. However, I've focused on decisions that wouldn't radically change the storyline or the spirit of the series and didn't involve too many moving parts and, as you say, gender-swapping Ron's brothers would have been something that would have affected Ron greatly, so I omitted it.
