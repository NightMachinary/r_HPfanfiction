I'm starting to question what I said about Lucius here. If her were instead female, it might actually still be pretty good, both for the social aspect of so much wealth/influence and as a contrast to Bellatrix.

The subservience thing...it might be a way to show that it is a bad idea to be so surrendered to a madman in any form.
