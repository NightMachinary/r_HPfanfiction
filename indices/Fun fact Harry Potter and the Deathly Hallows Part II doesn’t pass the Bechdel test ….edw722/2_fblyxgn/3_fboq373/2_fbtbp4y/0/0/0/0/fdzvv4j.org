Actually, female YA is usually girl/boy/boy. The Mortal Instruments ends up having an ensemble cast, but at the very start of the series, the main "trio" is Clary (girl protagonist), Simon (supporting lead/friend), & Jace (love interest). The Infernal Devices, another Cassandra Claire series, has a much more straightfoward trio with Tessa (girl protagonist), Jem (supporting lead/friend), and Will (guy love interest).

The Hunger Games is weird in that it doesn't have a standard trio for all the books, but in the first book it would probably be Katniss (girl protagonist), Peeta (guy love interest), & Haymitch (mentor). The third book firmly establishes the YA staple of Katniss (girl protagonist), Gale (supporting lead/friend), and Peeta (guy love interest).

Twilight has Bella (girl protagonist), Edward (guy love interest), and Alice (female friend), one of the only female YA novels to do so. By the third novel though, it's settled into Bella (girl protagonist), Jacob (supporting lead/friend), and Edward (guy love interest).

I think the only "mainstream" female YA series I've read that has the girl/girl/guy trio is the Uglies series and maybe Delirium. Both have been praised for their "unusual" focus on female relationships and both /also/ have a male supporting lead outside the trio. The female friends in both turn antagonistic.

I think it's a more common trope in TV (Disney & Nick shows, Buffy), but female led works tend to lean more toward ensemble casts than male led ones do.
