I get what you are saying, I think, about going the easy route, but I take exception to some of your examples.

In the books, the Headmaster is very much softer than almost any other adult in the school, and Minerva is the Deputy Headmistress who I generally assume to be in charge of discipline and would need to appear stern regardless of gender.

Draco, if female, would change a lot. First, it would look like 'princess-bashing', something that seems gender specific and different from the generic privileged-useless-child bashing we get in the books. Also, any antagonism between the female Draco and either Ron or Harry would take on a strong sexual component due to their all going through puberty together while having such strong feelings toward each other - just see the numerous fics with Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco tags.

Ron as female could have been very workable, and quite interesting - having her be something of a rough-and-tumble sort would have added a lot to the story. I don't think we get a tomboy anywhere else in the story....maybe some of the quidditch players, but I don't remember it being explicitly presented.

Lucius is a bit tricky, to my mind. He is so subservient toward Voldemort... the way it is it shows the dangers of patriarchal systems. If female....I think it might have hurt the story from gender politics angles. Bellatrix at least seems bloodthirsty, only going along with Voldemort since he engages her in what she already likes...though I have no clarity on what she was like before Azkaban.
