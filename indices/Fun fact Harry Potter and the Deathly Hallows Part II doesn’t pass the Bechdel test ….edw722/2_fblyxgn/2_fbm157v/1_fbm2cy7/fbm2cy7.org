All my comments were about what was actually in the books. /Why/ Rowling chose to write the books as she had is a completely separate question, and a much bigger one that can be discussed at several levels, since every "Why?" question can lead to an infinite regress of causes, causes' causes, etc.. TBH, it's one that I am not very interested in discussing in this forum: in order to rise +about+ *above* amateur psychoanalysis of strangers and amateur sociological speculation, we'd have to actually take the time to look up data and study arguments of people more knowledgeable than ourselves, and that's a bigger time investment than I am willing to make in a fanfic discussion.
