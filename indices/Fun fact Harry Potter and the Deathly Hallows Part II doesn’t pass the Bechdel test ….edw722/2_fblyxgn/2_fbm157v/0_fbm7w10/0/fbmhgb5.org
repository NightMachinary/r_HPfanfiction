I agree with pretty much everything you say. In [[/u/mrcaster]]'s defence, he or she was specifically talking about the demographic associated with the /genre/, rather than any given series. IIRC, there is common wisdom that girls will read stories with male lead protagonists but boys won't read stories with female lead protagonists. I don't know how accurate it its. I didn't want to get into the whole big discussion, though.

I do wonder if HP was, in some sense, a missed opportunity to showcase an egalitarian society that has been egalitarian for literally millennia---with wands being the Great Equaliser between the sexes when it comes to capacity for labour and violence alike, and with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] that took place millennia before any Muggle society. But, of course, Rowling's setting serves the story, not the other way around, so it remains "unconsidered"...
