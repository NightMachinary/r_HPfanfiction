Not to jump in, but it does create a Problem of Mrs Weasley to an extent when Rowling positions her as simultaneously a hard-working stay at home full time mom who can also accomplish any household task by saying a single word, who can summon any item she needs into her hand, and who thanks to Floo can functionally teleport. (I don't think she ever apparates in canon and so could be potentially nerfed by omission if we assume that's because she's unable to)
