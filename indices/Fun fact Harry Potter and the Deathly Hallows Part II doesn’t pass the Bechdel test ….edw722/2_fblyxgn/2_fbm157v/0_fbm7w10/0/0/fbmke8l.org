Good point; I missed that.

As for missed opportunities...that's the beauty of fanfiction, I suppose. I'm /sure/ the idea of wands as The Great Equalizer has appeared in some fics I've read, but I have absolutely no idea which fics those might be.

(Actually, the fact that two of the four founders of the greatest wizarding school in the world were women, even during the medieval period, is good evidence for the Great Equalizer idea.)
