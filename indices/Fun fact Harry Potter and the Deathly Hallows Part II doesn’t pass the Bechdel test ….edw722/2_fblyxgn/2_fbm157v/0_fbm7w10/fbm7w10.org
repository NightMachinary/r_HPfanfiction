I also have an opinion and (like to think I) can discuss things!

+Firstly, I'm not sure if the target audience of HP is teen males. At the very least, it starts as more of a general children's series.+ (Edit: didn't address what [[/u/mrcaster][u/mrcaster]] actually said.)

Secondly, while the wizarding world may be styled after medieval times, it's also quite entwined with our modern world and addresses issues like racism rather blatantly. It certainly doesn't have to address sexism openly, but there's no reason it couldn't simply because of the knight-era inspiration.

Thirdly, I really don't think men are "toned down" in the relevant way in books targeted at teenage girls. Stereotypically, you've got Twilight, The Hunger Games, Divergent, etc. -- some of which have strong female leads, to be sure, but also have extremely strong male leads and powerful men. It might be true that books aimed at girls are less likely to be examples of unconsidered patriarchy. However, there's no reason other genres couldn't try to avoid it too. And just because something is in a genre which typically has patriarchal tropes does not excuse it from falling into them.

In fact, and this may be controversial, I'd argue the opposite: showing a world which has detrimental ideas and structures -- racism, sexism, homophobia -- without condemning them is something of a tacit endorsement. It doesn't have to be the central thesis of the story for it to be addressed. It doesn't have to be spelled out for the reader, it doesn't have to be dwelt on, it doesn't have to take someone out of the narrative; all it needs is to be slightly framed as detrimental, rather than something that just exists. What HP demonstrates is the insidious nature of these structures: they exist passively, in the background, unintentionally reinforcing the ideas. Unconsidered patriarchy.

All that said, I had never noticed everything [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] pointed out about the elements of patriarchy in HP. Whether that's an indication that I've been so exposed to blatantly male-dominated media that I didn't think about it, or that this really doesn't matter after ...well. I don't know.
