At last someone who has an opinion and the ability to hold a discussion. We are looking in a genre where the marketing target group are male teens. It's only logical that we are going to have a more strong male lead. The magicall world as portrayed by Rowling reminds a lot the kinghts' age on the times of King Arthur (since she is British that's not really eye opening), that's why a lot of the women are "trophy wives" That stay at home without real power. Also McGonagall is a strong female character that we see a lot in the movies, but of course in a more motherly way. In conclusion when you watch a fiction that appeals to male teens most of the times you will see the females toned down the opposite happens in female appealing fiction.
