I agree that the presumed marketing group is male teens - in the books too - but I do find it interesting that that was a deliberate targeting choice when by all metrics, female teens are the presumed much larger audience for book phenomenons, and teen fantasy as a genre is pretty equitable.

To deliberately target boys over girls almost makes the HP series uninentionally a period piece; a product of its time; written in a pre-Twilight world.
