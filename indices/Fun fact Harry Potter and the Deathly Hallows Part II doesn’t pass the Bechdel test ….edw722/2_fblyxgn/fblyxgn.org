I do think that it's true that while the HP setting is nominally egalitarian (and has been for longer than Muggle), the storyline pretty male-dominated when it comes to dialogue and importance to the story, even when it didn't have to be. To reuse a list I wrote a while ago,

- All of the top-tier magic users actually involved in the story, even tangentially (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grendelwald, Flamel?) are men. None of their genders are plot-relevant.
- The highest-ranked woman in the books is Amelia Bones: head of DMLE and an influential member of the Wizengamot. She shows up for one scene, then gets killed off-screen. Probably the highest-ranked woman in the books who gets meaningful screen time is /Dolores Umbrige/.
- Harry's ongoing rivals and enemies (Draco, Lucius, Snape, Voldemort)---all men. It just so happens that the Malfoys had a son, and it just so happens that it's Lucius who goes around playing politics with Dumbledore and doing DeathEatery things, while Narcissa stays home and mothers Draco. Snape's love life and rivalries are too important for the plot, so let that pass, but if it were Tamara Riddle, who is no more capable of love than Tom, what would it have changed, really?
- Ditto pretty much anyone who knew Harry's parents, including his godfather. Apparently, Lily had no female friends who bothered to show up in the story.
- More generally, when influential adult female characters do show up, they are almost always schoolteachers, love-interests, mother-figures, or some other traditionally female role. (It's telling that Molly's drive to fight Bellatrix came from her own child being threatened. Bellatrix is a deliberately 1-dimensional character who has nothing but her sadism and obsession with Voldemort.)
- Remember the Triwizard, when one of the Champions broke down and failed a Task? The same one who had previously worn impractical clothing to a confrontation with a dragon? That must have been the Champion who was entered against their will, the underage, unprepared one. No? Must have been the Hufflepuff, then. Not the Hufflepuff either?
- But, of course, there's Hermione Granger, a hard-working, competent, proactive witch. But, remember how she become friends with Harry? The most competent witch in her year was placed, through a contrived sequence of events, in a situation in which she was helpless, so that she could be rescued by the male lead and his best friend's heroics.
