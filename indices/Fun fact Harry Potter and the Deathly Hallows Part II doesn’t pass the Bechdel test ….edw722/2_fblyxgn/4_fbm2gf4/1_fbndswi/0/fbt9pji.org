No idea on the downvote, I too am baffled. Maybe someone thought it was about male-bashing rather than what was suggested, or something?

I would love to read a deep dive but I am not a good candidate for any longer term project. I get pulled in a lot of different directions over very short time periods and can't really commit to anything. Please know that this is in an effort to avoid disappointing you rather than a lack of interest.

If you do such an check, please do PM or reply to a post of mine. I think if you do something that is fair and not just bashing then a lot of people would both be interested and find it to make their experience of the books much richer.
