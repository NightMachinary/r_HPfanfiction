This is the first time I've seen the expression "unconsidered patriarchy". Thank you for introducing me to it, since it describes the situation so well. Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo can only find it in one place: [[https://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2015/02/static-vs-the-race-hustlers/][a comment on a post on a somewhat obscure blog from early 2015]]. If you don't mind my asking, are you the author, and, if not, where did you first see it?
