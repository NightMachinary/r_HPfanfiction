Reflecting a bit, my favourite HP fics tend to be those that emphasise Hermione's ruthless side and her magical competence: her capacity to unilaterally impose her will on reality and her willingness to do so when she feels that the cause is just.

This is certainly empowering for a female character---in the literal sense---but it is, simultaneously, Hermione occupying a Patriarchal position, to use your expression.
