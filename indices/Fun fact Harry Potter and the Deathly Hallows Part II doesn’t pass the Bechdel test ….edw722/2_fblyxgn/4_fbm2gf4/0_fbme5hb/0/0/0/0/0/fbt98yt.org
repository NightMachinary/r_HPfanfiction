In contrast, I like like fics where people seem to actually care about others, however they might express it, be it in understanding the people involved /as people/ (rather than as obstacles/etc) or lashing out against those who hurt their loved ones (rather than just ones toward who they have some duty or 'ownership').

Basically, Feminine aspects coming to the fore or at least deeply imbued into masculine roles.

As an aside, the last 3 comments in this discussion got downvoted? Do you have idea why? I don't think we said anything offensive and no one seems to have made a criticising comment to object to something we said. Did we trip over some sexual politics thing?
