I don't think they are exclusive.

What I was saying about unconsidered patriarchy was big-picture societal stuff. It is something that affects everyone and most aspects of culture.

When we talk about movies and other depictions, especially those that intend to portray some representation of modern reality, I think it is very important to have as thorough a representation of the reality of women's experiences as possible - not necessarily all in one film but over all the offerings.

And, in general, the more people can appreciate the real life experiences of gender issues currently the more likely we are to move toward something better for everyone. We have seen this with racism, cultures, even religions. Anytime there is some attempt at bringing new aspects of any segment of a population's lives to the attention of society in general things seem to improve, with everyone (including the people depicted) gaining a more holistic view of how people are affected.
