Interesting. In some sense, this is the opposite of what I have just posted in response to your other query---that it would be good to see more "normal" or even "mediocre" female characters in film. (To paraphrase one professor whose quote I can't find at the moment, equality will be judged not by how many extraordinary women get tenure but if as many mediocre women will get tenure as mediocre men.) I do recognise that this presumes that the positions remain as they are, and, as you say---patriarchal.

But yes, I agree that in the present context, women do bring more to the situation. Once we've had perfect equality for a few generations (i.e., not any time soon, if ever), we might be able to tease out how much of that is innate and how much is societal conditioning.
