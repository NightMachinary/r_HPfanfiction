It just seemed appropriate to the concept.

I tend to ‘go intellectual' rather than feel so I like to see people think things through. I get a bit disappointed when people hold to things or argue points based on habit and comfort rather than thinking things through.

Re Patriarchy, it has been the ‘norm' for so long that even some feminists are just ‘so-called', saying that women too can occupy Patriarchal positions. This saddens me more than I like to say.

People are starting to recognize that women bring a lot more to a situation than just being able to act like a man. “Feminine” needs to be given proper regard, not just for women as people do but also on how it effects boys/men, society, and human engagement with life and its experiences.
