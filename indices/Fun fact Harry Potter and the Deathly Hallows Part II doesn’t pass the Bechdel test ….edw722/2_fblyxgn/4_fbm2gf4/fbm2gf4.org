Hmm, given that we are now post-2012....I think I can say:

It is fun to read the HP books, especially bashing!fics, as a cautionary tale of unconsidered patriarchy - the same way I see Star Wars sometimes.

Both Dumbles and Yoda f'd things up very badly, despite having ridiculous amounts of influence and personal power.

Most of the villains and men who made bad decisions can be seen (canonically even) as suffering badly (if unconsciously) from lack of important feminine relationships (be it guidance, support, or even simple understanding).

I don't know about Star Wars, but there are women in HP who went against their own instincts because some man told them to (Minerva, Narcissa, others?) which led to bad results for themselves and those they might care about.

Given how well Bones performed in a position of significant power, and how Minerva might have done if she properly executed her position of Deputy, and Hermine and several other women showed themselves to be both able and rational in general....it might be said that it all illustrates that women should be encouraged to make their own decisions and trusted to carry responsibility when they choose it.
