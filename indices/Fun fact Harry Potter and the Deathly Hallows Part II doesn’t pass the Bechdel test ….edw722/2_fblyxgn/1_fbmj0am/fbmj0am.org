Lily didn't have no female friends, she seemingly had none at all. I assume that either she spent way too much time around Snape and therefore noone liked her (because being friends with an ugly bigot isn't great for social standing) or they're just all dead (Voldemort was supposedly winning after all) and therefore irrelevant.
