I know. Her name is only mentioned once (OotP), and I don't think she has any appearances or lines of dialogue (except maybe in a flashback or Pensieve memory, but I haven't been able to find any). Thus, I consider her a part of the setting---which is quite egalitarian---rather than a character in the story.
