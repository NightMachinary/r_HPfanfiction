"The Bechdel test, also known as the Bechdel--Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man."

The subject of the test (female characters) represent about half of the population of the planet and yet are often reduced to a single topic of discussion in fiction: their relationship with a man. If named gay Mexican women with one leg were a large percentage of the population and yet, in fiction, were reduced to discussions between themselves only about their relationship then go ahead and propose a test.

In the meantime, keep your strawman to yourself.
