So Bellatrix and molly in the final fight doesn't count? Bellatrix torturing Hermione doesn't count? Umbridge with trelawny when she was kicking her out of Hogwarts doesn't count? Umbridge with McGonagall whe see said that she is the high inquisitor doesn't count. These are all just off the top since I haven't watched the movies for at least 8 years. Just a tip for you, whatever you read on the internet isn't 100% true. Learn to think for yoursel please, we can't actually go backwards as a species. If you want to be mad at something are enough problems around us to be mad about don't be mad for all the wrong ones.
