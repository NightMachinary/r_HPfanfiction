First of all where you base off your assumption that half the population accounts for women. About the "patriarchal state of the entertainment" argument, I believe that it's so single minded that only some new gen vegan activists can even stand behind it. The need to direct your hate towards something shouldn't be coated like criticism. The fact that Hermione for example is one of the main characters? The fact that a woman wrote it? The fact that women had more impact in the plot development of the story than the men? Nah disregard all that they didn't talk enough amongst themselves. They are oppressing the women in one more fiction. Bollocks!
