It is not as simple.

This opens up huge troll-bait and maniacal posting, but....

The concept is that women can be significant in themselves or in relation to other women without making every part of their lives or interactions be about men.

It is not schoolyard 'boys are better' / 'girls are better' stuff. It goes into what it means to live and set your own direction in life.
