I am usually shocked by the lazy characterization in most films. So many characters, male or female or other, are portrayed as simple one-note constructs.

The films tends to come across as some intellectual exercise, moving pieces around, rather than something a caring person would write about actual people living through things. I guess in contrast it makes the main character or 2 seem more substantial.
