Of course, the point of this test is horribly prevalent patriarchal state of the entertainment industry. Half of the human population are women, right? So, logically, statistically half of dialogues in all films should include some woman, right? You have LotR where only film passing this test is Two Towers, where the only such dialogue is between two small girls running away to save their life and strategizing about it. That's rather poor score for ten hours of film, isn't it?
