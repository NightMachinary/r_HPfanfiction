The point of the Bechdel Test (to the extent it was meant to be a "test" for anything) is that it should be very, very easy to satisfy. I mean, aside from army movies and such, women make up the majority of the population. How hard could it be to find, in 90+ minutes worth of film, a scene with two named women talking to each other about something other than a man? Should be trivial and be found in an overwhelming majority of films, right?

The "named gay Mexican women with one leg" comparison is hyperbole at best and strawmaning at worst.

*Edit:* Added the proviso that women must be talking to /each other/, since that's in the original test and means that, say, a woman talking to a crowd that includes women doesn't count---as it shouldn't.
