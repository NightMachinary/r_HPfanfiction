So have at least two of those plot-advancing characters be women, and then the dialogue occurs naturally. It doesn't have to be an awkward, “Hi, I'm a woman and so are you and here are our names and now let's talk about our jobs for five minutes before getting back to the real plot.” There are so many films where there's one main female character and she is surrounded by men and only has plot-relevant conversations with men. It can kinda feel like that character is a token woman. It's not that hard to have two. (Although I acknowledge it can be harder when there's source material, like a movie adaptation of a book)

The Bechdel test isn't about what films are good or bad; it's a surface-level evaluation of the inclusion of female characters and the quality of their dialogue. There's a lot of good films that fail the Bechdel test. Would they have been even better films if they had passed? Maybe.
