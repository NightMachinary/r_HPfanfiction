Let's imagine 50% of the main characters in a film are men, and 50% are women. To pass the Bechdel test, two of those women need to talk... okay, sure, should be easy enough. But, they have to talk without mentioning 50% of the main, plot-relevant characters. That part is actually tricky, because talking about the plot tends to include talking about plot-relevant characters.
