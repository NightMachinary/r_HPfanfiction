I think a major impediment is that most antagonists are men, and so any discussion of plot will involve "he did <something>" or similar. (I don't know why it feels off to think of two female villains talking about a female protagonist - like backbiting or something...some cultural bias of mine I guess.)

I suppose, if we are avoiding strictly relationship-centered films, a female subordinate could be reporting to a female superior about some general events that need to be dealt with without naming a person who was causing them?
