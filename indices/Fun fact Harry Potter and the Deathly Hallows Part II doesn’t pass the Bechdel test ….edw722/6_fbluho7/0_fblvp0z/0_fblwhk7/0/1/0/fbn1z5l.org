Why do they have to be forced?

Like, if literally every Marvel film can have multiple characters who are men talk about topics that are not women (say, for example, the fucking plot maybe?) why would it be "forced" to have women appear and be relevant enough to have an actual conversation with one another that doesn't revolve around a man?

The idea that in order to achieve this, it would have to be "forced in", is the idea that it's somehow not natural for women to exist around each other in an interesting or useful fashion, and interact, unless it's about men somehow.

In the original comic that introduced the test, /Alien/ was the movie the character said was the most recent one they saw that passed it. You know, /Alien/, the beloved science fiction horror classic? There is no reason to believe a film that passes the test would have to be, or would be likely to be, a bad film.

Adding in a random scene "to pass the test" is obviously going to be detrimental if it doesn't add anything. But adding in a random scene to have two men talk would also be bad, because adding in random scenes that don't do anything is bad regardless. Yet nobody worries about people "forcing in" scenes that don't add anything to the plot when they involve two men talking about some random thing. It's almost as though writing for underrepresented groups is held to a higher standard than writing for the default, so that having a random shitty scene is a problem if it involves women talking but not (or not as much) if it involves men talking.
