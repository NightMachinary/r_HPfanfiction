Or like in /Empire Strikes Back/, the only original trilogy SW film to pass the test, where Mon Mothma and Princess Leia spoke to each other about the war effort. They both have names, and the conversation wasn't just, “So I see you have the hots for Han? Or is it Luke now? Let's figure out who your true love is!”

MM could have been written as a man or woman without changing fundamental aspects of her role in the plot. The same can be done for other movies without detriment. Easy peasy.

Edit: my point was, lots of movies have minor characters with names who can interact with main characters without it feeling forced or like a distraction from the plot. They don't even have to be “equals” to a main character to pass, they just need to not all be men.
