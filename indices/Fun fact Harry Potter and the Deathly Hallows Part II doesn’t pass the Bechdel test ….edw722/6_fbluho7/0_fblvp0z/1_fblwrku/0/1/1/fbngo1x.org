Women are the majority of the population of the Earth. Women by nature live longer than men, and human birth rate, minus medical intervention (selective abortion in certain cultures) runs 50-50.

The choice to represent women as a minority is entirely invented and not at all true-to-life - truly, /men/ are the minority.
