I grabbed the figures most easily accessible to me, and the test was mainly about Hollywood films in the first place. But fine, let's go cosmopolitan:

Jews: 0.2% of the world population.

Gay men: 2-5% of the world population (if we call a man "Gay" if he is sexually attracted primarily to other men, regardless of how he self-identifies; and yes, I am oversimplifying it).

Women: 49.6% of the world population.

No meaningful difference (except for Jews, who are even fewer percentage-wise).
