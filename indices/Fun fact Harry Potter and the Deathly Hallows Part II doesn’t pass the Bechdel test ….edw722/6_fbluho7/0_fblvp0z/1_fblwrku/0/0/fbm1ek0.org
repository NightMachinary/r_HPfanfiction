Huh, this actually brings up some good questions.

First, Jews and gay men have been represented in movies/tv/etc, sometimes as villains, sometimes as jokes, sometimes as meaningful characters worthy of respect and consideration. Same with women.

But....do you feel that womens' real life discussions are missing in their portrayal in fiction? Are there specific aspects you would like to see which have been ignored?
