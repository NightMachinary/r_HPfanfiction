Not the person you were responding to, but like... nerdy women who are just nerdy.

Most "nerdy women" in fiction are also /incredible overachievers/. See: Hermione, the girl from Percy Jackson who was better than him at everything, and in general that trope of "hypercompetent female sidekick who is there partially to make the hero look incompetent at the start, but whose story takes second place to the hero's" (Trinity from The Matrix, Wyldstyle from the Lego movie, The Wasp in Antman, Alice in The Magicians, Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy... I could go on).

But there are women who... suck at things, except they have certain interests and they're good at those things. Just like there are men who suck at things except for whatever their specialty is.

One of the BEST FEMALE CHARACTERS (TM) I have /ever/ watched in /anything/ is Entrapta from the She-Ra reboot. Not just because she's "smart" and a woman (which is the default at this point, since most trios that do ego/superego/id don't make the woman the protagonist, so it's either superego or id, and having the woman be the "emotional one" isn't just annoying but /boring/ because it has been done to death, so she ends up being the "smart one" instead. Heaven forbid you had two women in a trio...). It's that she's a.) allowed to be wrong, b.) allowed to do things that are morally bad without being painted as /irredemably evil,/(a lot of women's representation is either "this person is morally perfect and how dare you question her?" or "this woman is heartless and cruel" without any in-between) and c.) very clearly incompetent at certain things (social things, mostly, but also other things as well). She's also autistic-coded in a way that isn't insulting or shitty but actually feels well-thought-out.

She's not a hyper-competent super-person who is still relegated to the role of sidekick despite that. She's not a love interest for the protagonist or the /one guy/ who is also interested in robotics. She's allowed to be a person, and a /weird/ person at that, and have that... acknowledged. Everyone who knows Entrapta knows that she's a genius. They also know she's weird and quirky and confusing. She is the mad scientist, not the hypercompetent female assistant who has to keep track of everything because mad scientists aren't expected to have executive skills. For a villainous take on the same archetype, Dr. Bellum from the new Carmen Sandiego is done pretty well.

I would also like more representation of disabled women generally. It always seems like if you're a man and you're missing a hand, you're a cool/scary villain or a badass hero with a dark backstory. If you're a woman and you're missing a hand... you don't exist, because you lost too many hotness points or something. I can think of two notable characters who are both women and disabled (Bennett from Dollhouse and Oracle/Batgirl from Batman, post-Killing Joke). And while I love both of them, one went from being Batgirl to being a hypercompetent genius sidekick who can't do the story thing because she's stuck in a room full of computer screens; and the other appears in less than half of the episodes of one of the two seasons of the show, and is basically used to give another character trauma points. It could be better.
