First off, thank you for answering. My question was in a reply to someone but I am very interested in reading people-in-general's answers. I doubt any 1 person could cover the topic thoroughly.

So, would it be over-simplifying to say you would like to see socially awkward women?

I have four examples I would love you to comment on:

1) Leslie Winkle from Big Bang Theory. She was nerdy and not they typical 'female' represented in media. I think Chuck Lorre (show runner or something) said they stopped having her in the show because they couldn't figure out how to write her character. To be fair (sort of), they did start to make her a bit shrill toward the end of her appearances.

2) My Little Pony. I am 99% convinced that the portrayal of a variety of genuine-feeling female character types is why it became so popular with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom][Bronys]]. I think people /want/ this sort of honest variety of female representations. This included Pinkie Pie.

3) General 'nerd' shows. The women mostly seem to come across as judging the men, as if thinking "I hate having to spend time with them". Do you know of any shows where this is not the case? It always seems to me that the female is just biding her time until some knightly figure sweeps her away to a 'normal' life. The only exception is Amy Fowler from Big Bang Theory who is a bit over-awkward but in a way that can be seen as just a slight exaggeration of a normal female (within the context of the show).

Other more serious movies seem to have this too, but in sometimes less obvious ways (Gina in The Girl in the Cafe, Arlene McKinny in Pay it Forward?).
