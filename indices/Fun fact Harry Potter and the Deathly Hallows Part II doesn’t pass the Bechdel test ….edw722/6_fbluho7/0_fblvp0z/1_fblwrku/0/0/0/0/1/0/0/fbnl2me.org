  So, would it be over-simplifying to say you would like to see socially awkward women?
#+end_quote

Yes, because they don't /have/ to be socially awkward. Entrapta is a great example, but for a more socially capable one, perhaps we could use Applejack from My Little Pony? Applejack is a fairly smart, competent person /in her field/. And she's a not-so-smart, incompetent person in other fields. And... that's fine. Another good example is Rainbow Dash, when she got into reading. She has a very specific thing she loves a lot and gets very excited about that thing, but it doesn't magically make her competent in other areas. Rainbow Dash doesn't pick up a book once and then spontaneously become Twilight.

What I am concerned with is the fact that very often, because people want to make a "Strong Female Character", they write incredibly hypercompetent, broadly amazing people. Which is fine, but then somehow those people are still relegated to second fiddle, and don't have a lot of clout, and are generally treated as if they weren't an incredibly competent person. Which means a lot of female characters "feel boring" to people (because they don't grow, because what the fuck direction is left for them to grow in?) while at the same time seeming like they could just solve the story if they had to and it's weird that they don't.

I want a mixture of competent and incompetent. A character who is a specialist in some thing, very good at that thing, and... really terrible in other things. Where that's okay, and not treated as though somehow she's /supposed/ to be perfect at everything. For a good example of this done "better" and "worse", compare Book Hermione to Movie Hermione. Movie Hermione is a lot more of the "hypercompetent girl who is not the protagonist for some reason" type of character than Book Hermione, who has clear areas of incompetence (not knowing shit about magical world culture, for example, where Ron does).

1.) I like Leslie Winkle a lot, but she kind of grew stale after a while. Also the way she was written was as having some sort of superiority complex(?), which would have been fine as a general character flaw if not for the fact that the guys (especially Leonard) were so consistently inept that it seemed like she was right about her assessment. She seemed to me to be something of a wasted opportunity.

2.) I love My Little Pony, and I think it does a lot of things fantastically. Sadly, I don't think it is in a position to tackle certain issues (especially when it comes to how it treats its villains). One of the virtues of My Little Pony as a show IS that all of its protagonists (and most of the side characters we know!) /are/ a mix of competent and incompetent. They're written as /people/ with /problems/, not as "role models". That's not to say they're not nice people, or that young children seeing them as role models would necessarily be bad (none of them are evil or anything). But it is to say that they are better written than, for example, The Wasp in Ant-Man.

  1. General 'nerd' shows. The women mostly seem to come across as judging the men, as if thinking "I hate having to spend time with them".
#+end_quote

You are super on the money with this. I think "nerd shows" are one of the only places where having women be "the emotions one" is still so persistent, where men are "the brains" and women are "the heart". In superhero shows (SHIELD, Supergirl) there is usually at least one token nerd girl, but I don't know that it's a /lot/ better. In The Big Bang Theory specifically, I think one of the best characters is actually Bernadette, because she's a young mother and pharmacy PhD who is also a bit of a crazy person and incredibly hostile sometimes. It's a good take in a world where mothers are often written to be perfect and mostly there to die tragically.

If you look at The Bing Bang Theory specifically, you can see a lot in the first few seasons where basically every female character is a Straight Man in terms of their comedic role. Their job is to be normal, so that when the guys are weird, the weirdness is accentuated. Compare that to later seasons, where the female characters are also allowed to do crazy things (go to Disney World and dress as princesses) or to get wrapped up in something weird (the episode where they start fighting over whether Red Hulk could lift Thor's hammer) etc.

I don't know if this is because the writers got sick of the repetitiveness of having a good quarter-to-half of their cast being the Straight Man at all times, or if it's because general attitudes about "how funny women are" shifted in the culture during the run of the show, but either way I think it's an improvement.

  It always seems to me that the female is just biding her time until some knightly figure sweeps her away to a 'normal' life.
#+end_quote

Yeah, this is just the problem with women's agency in stories. "Men do, women are" means that many men feel like they aren't allowed to just "be", and many women feel like they're not allowed to /do/ anything unless they can do it backwards, and in heels, and while looking perfect the whole time. It's not just bad writing, real people often feel trapped by having internalized those ideas. A lot of women are scared to ask men out, even though /every straight man asked/ says that he would love it if women asked him out, because of that kind of thinking that they are supposed to just "be" and if they step out of line that would be bad.

#+begin_quote
  Do you know of any shows where this is not the case?
#+end_quote

Star Trek: Discovery, actually. Every character in DSC is a nerd on some level. So since every character needs to be physically competent and intellectually capable, what you get is differentiation by style and personality as well as skillset. None of the characters are "the strong one", they just... have specific skills (piloting/shooting/whatever) that lend themselves to specific missions. Tilly from DSC is another good nerdy female character. Being /excited/ about learning things is something I like.

The protagonist of DSC is a little bit one-note, and the first season is kind of lacking. But I think it's pretty good and the second season is a great improvement over the first.

I know nothing about the two movies at the end of your post, so I can't comment either way.
