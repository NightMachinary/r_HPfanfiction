TBH, I am not much of a movie watcher, and context matters. (See /Moonlight/, for example: if any movie wouldn't need a Bechdel Test, it's that one.)

What's missing? Maybe women as normal people? Female characters who are not in traditional female roles but are also /not/ extraordinary, who screw up as much as male characters with similar level of importance and similar consequences? Or, while every character in a typical major film is better-than-average-looking unless they are specifically intended to be ugly, deformed, or disfigured, female characters have a much higher bar than male. (The classic example in this fandom is Hermione's character played by Emma Watson, who I suspect is much more beautiful than Rowlings's mental image of Hermione when writing the books.)

It's complicated, because films need to at least somewhat relate to reality as it is, but the reality as it is is quite patriarchal today and was even more so in the past. So, for example, if you have a female soldier or officer, it is, in fact, realistic for her to be extraordinary, because in a patriarchal society, only extraordinary women join the armed forces (loosely speaking). Or, along similar lines, it's common to see an all-male team on the "bad guys'" side and an all-female or mixed-gender team on the "good guys'" side, and almost never the other way around. But, would that have its own baggage? Almost certainly.

In addition, some occupations (such as delivery) are disproportionately male in part because of differential threat of sexual harassment and assault man and women face when doing this type of work. Should a movie pretend that this is not the case for the sake of equal representation?

But, to summarise, outside of genres and subgenres collectively referred to as "chick flicks", female characters, when they show up, are considered big deal, special, in some sense representing something bigger than themselves. (This is, of course, the case in RL situations as well.) We need to make it so that it's no longer a big deal.

To quote myself from the other subthread, I do wonder if HP was, in some sense, a missed opportunity to showcase an egalitarian society that has been egalitarian for literally millennia---with wands being the Great Equaliser between the sexes when it comes to capacity for labour and violence alike, and with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] that took place millennia before any Muggle society.

Flamel is a historical figure---fine---but gender-flipping Dumbledore or Grindelwald would probably make no difference. (It helps that they're both very old by the time canon rolls around.) Gender-flipping Voldemort depends on how much the difference between the way males typically express psychopathy differs from the way females do is due to societal conditioning and how much is due to biology---AFAIK an open question.

But, I don't see why in a millennia-egalitarian society, Fem!Draco wouldn't be expected to carry on the family name, socially dominate her year in Slytherin, and get into fights with Harry Potter. Nor do I see why Florus de la Coeur couldn't put a dragon to sleep but panic when attacked by gryndilows and fail the second task; while Viktoria Krum hexes the dragon in the face, transforms herself into a shark, and asks Hermione out for the winter ball---and Hermione accepts, because she is flattered by the attention and curious, but eventually decides she prefers men.

Maybe Molly could show up in more of the Order's plans, rather than just when her own children were in jeopardy.

The trouble with speculating about these things is, of course, that we /don't/ have an example of a millennia-egalitarian society, so we have no idea how people would act there.
