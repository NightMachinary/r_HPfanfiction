I've actually never seen Limitless. That sounds awesome!

Also yeah, season 1 of DSC (to be honest, mostly the first half of season 1) is kind of... lacking. I think you could probably just start with Season 2 and you'd be fine, though it does have some important setup in Season 1.

Thanks for the recommendation and have a good whatever-time-it-is-in-your-timezone.
