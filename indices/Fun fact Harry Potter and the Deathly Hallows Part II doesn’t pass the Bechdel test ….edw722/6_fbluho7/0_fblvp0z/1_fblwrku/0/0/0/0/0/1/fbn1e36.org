You wrote a lot here, thank you for putting in the time and effort.

You raised a lot of points which I was hoping to find answers to myself.

It really seems, currently, to be a minefield when trying to portray 'normal women' or 'women in any role' in a work one hopes will be generally well-received.

I hope our societies can start to see more mature efforts and results as we tackle these issues.
