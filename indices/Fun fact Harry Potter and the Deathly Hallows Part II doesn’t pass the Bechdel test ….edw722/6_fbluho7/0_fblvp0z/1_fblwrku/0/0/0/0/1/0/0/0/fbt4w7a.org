  a mix of competent and incompetent. They're written as /people/ with /problems/, not as "role models"

I like your definition here - and looking back it seems right on for when I found characters believable as actual people.

I too liked the Disney Princesses scenes in BBT. I think the women there became far more interesting as they were fleshed out to be more than representations of some single aspect of how men sometimes perceive women; I would guess that they needed more stories and had more room to experiment as the show lasted longer and grew in popularity.

About women acting rather than being passive, do they still have "Sadie Hawkins Dance" in schools? (USA) That was all about having the girls approach the boys.

I haven't seen DSC yet. I heard so many bad reviews at the start of the first season that I never really considered watching it.

I thought of another female character from Sci-Fi, the FBI agent from Limitless (TV show). She is not 'pretty' or 'sexy' or 'shrew'. She comes across as a real agent with real family issues who just happens to be female.
