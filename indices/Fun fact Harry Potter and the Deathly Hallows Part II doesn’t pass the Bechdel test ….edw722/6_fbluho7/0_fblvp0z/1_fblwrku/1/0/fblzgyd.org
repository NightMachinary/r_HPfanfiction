When people are trying to talk about something important but they use such a half assed way about it, I just can't take them seriously. Most of the times they use wrong examples, are obnoxious and have an attitude like they just invented the wheel. Yes we have/had and will have equality issues, about men/women, skin color, money, status etc. You don't raise awareness by being a smart ass, that actually does the opposite, everyone laughs at you and the reason about you are trying to raise awareness for. That's our society and some of us try to better it without behaving like school yard kids about it because we expect the other side of the argument to respect us and to discuss with us.
