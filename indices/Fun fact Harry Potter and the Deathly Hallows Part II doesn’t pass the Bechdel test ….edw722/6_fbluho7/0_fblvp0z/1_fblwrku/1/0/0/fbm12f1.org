I thank you for and acknowledge your strong care for the issue. I hope others remember that it is the source of your comments.

And I am with you regarding people badly presenting the issue. It just muddles things up with gossip-type phrases that end up with people attacking each other and disregarding the fundamental importance of some discussions.

Still, at least they recognize that the discussion has /some/ importance even if they don't know how to engage in it productively?
