So...in the spirit of your somewhat joking tone.... your questions here open the field for so much 'behind the scenes' movie production stuff.

But, to address your main point, there have been heavy issues in society re male/female issues for many decades which remain in contention. I think you will find that after other significant social issues we will see movies/TV/books include representations of the peoples involved in those issues.

The Bechdel Test is something of a simplistic one, granted, but I think the spirit behind it has some validity.
