People are salty enough to downvote this a bunch huh? Surely we're better than [[/r/hp][r/hp]]?

I wonder if any of the other movies come close this way. I bet the first one does - the only female chars with any screentime are Hermione, McGonagall and Petunia, right?

The fun fact I always remember from the first film is that Harry doesn't cast a single spell in the entire thing.
