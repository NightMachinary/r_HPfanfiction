Well, but if the ten-hours trilogy hits the test only once in completely insignificant side scene, and two other films don't hit even the second point (two women talking to each other), then there is really something sad with the said trilogy, no matter whether it is a war film (and it isn't, in sense it isn't just about a band of brothers in trenches, where perhaps no women may be excusable).

And notice how many films from the octalogy written by a woman with a strong female lead character don't hit the second point either (and again, the last film just with one insignificant scene with a character who is actually not named in a film, so a viewer who hadn't read a book doesn't have to know she is Petunia). Isn't it sad?
