No, it's not a war film, it's a film series about a boy from a boy's perspective. Harry is participating in pretty much every conversation that's in the books, because of course he is - he's the main character. We at least hear about plenty of female/female conversations, but since Harry obviously isn't involved, they get scrapped for runtime.

Rowling didn't write the films, and out of the three main characters, there's only one female lead. If Kloves had kept Ginny in the film more, then we can conclude that Hermione and Ginny would have had more interaction.
