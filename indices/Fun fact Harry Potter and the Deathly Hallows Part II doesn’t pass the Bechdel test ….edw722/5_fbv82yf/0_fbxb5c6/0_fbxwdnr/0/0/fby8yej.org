Oh, well that's because there are like three female characters total, and none of them live in the same place. It also kind of is a war film, albeit a guerrilla one at the beginning.

It's a feminist movie, in that the female characters are independent, make their own choices and have their own struggles that actually inform the plot. Galadriel is offered the ring, and unlike Gandalf and Elrond, we literally see the process that tempts her, and her ultimate decision is more final and self-sacrificing than theirs. Arwen doesn't let her father's wishes interfere with living her life the way she wants, and willingly puts her life on the line for that belief. And obviously we have the 'I am no man' moment.

It's not so good for female /representation./ Just another way the Bechdel Test isn't the best way to measure feminism on a per-film basis.
