You're not really supposed to use the Bechdel Test to judge any one movie. It's supposed to be used as a barometer of Hollywood as a whole. If /no/ or /few/ movies pass the Bechdel Test in any given year, then shit's probably a little lopsided.

But if you're really expecting your average war movie to pass, then purely due to the subject matter it would be insanely difficult. Even plenty of otherwise female-empowering movies that serve the cause of feminism tend to miss the mark.
