Read the discussion on [[https://bechdeltest.com/view/2539/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows:_part_2/][bechdeltest.com]]. Conversation means that at least one person talks and other responds. Neither of the two passes this criterion. Perhaps the only true conversation is dialogue between Petunia and Lily in the Snape's memories. However, that's rather poor scoring, isn't it?
