I read the first 1/4 or 1/2 of that discussion. I thought there were significant points raised on both sides of the argument. I especially appreciated how some showed that women are given significant agency and importance in the movie which should be appreciated regardless of the letter of the Test.

(I don't know if the arguments devolved past that point.)
