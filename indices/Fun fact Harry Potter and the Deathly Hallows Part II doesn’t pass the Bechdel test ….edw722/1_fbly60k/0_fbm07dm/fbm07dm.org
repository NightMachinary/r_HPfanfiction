Well, originally the test was made by Allison Bechdel, a lesbian comic writer, to discuss how women in movies often don't have relationships outside of men. In that context, both of your described situations would pass the test. Honestly, the Bechdel test was never made test how feminist a movie is. In fact there are several very sexist movies that do pass the Bechdel test, such as /Weird Science/ and /Twilight/. Moreover, some movies have really good depictions of women despite failing the test, such as /Pacific Rim/ and /The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo/. The test is only supposed to point out how often women are relegated to supporting the story of a man rather than having their own personal relationships with other women.

On the other hand, think of how many movies would fail a reverse Bechdel test. Is there any movie you can think of that doesn't have two male characters having a discussion that doesn't center on a man?

So, your idea of the test is correct. It is not about how "feminist" a movie is. Rather it is only supposed to indicate women's agency and their interpersonal relationships with other women.
