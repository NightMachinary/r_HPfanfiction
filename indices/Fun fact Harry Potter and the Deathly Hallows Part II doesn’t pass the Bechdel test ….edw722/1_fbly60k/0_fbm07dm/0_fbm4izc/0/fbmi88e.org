You're right, that was a typo. And yeah, I bet a bunch of romcoms wouldn't pass the reverse, or likely the actual test either. This goes further to show the test, while it can be helpful in some instances, doesn't really tell you a lot about a movie's actual portrayal of either sex. Rather it gives you a baseline of how the movie approaches female relationships. I still find it wild though how many movies do fail the test.
