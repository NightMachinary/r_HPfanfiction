Thank you for your clear response. I feel a bit better about everything for having read it.

I was starting to think about the 'men' version of the test but didn't know how to word it to post here....I started trying to think along the lines of 2 men having a discussion that didn't involve some authority figure (actual or social) or the ideas they have which came from authority figures in the past (fathers, teachers, etc telling them what it 'means to be a man'). When the only other types of conversations I remembered were about work or hobbies I kind of ran aground on something profound (in my own mind or in general society) which I don't quite understand.
