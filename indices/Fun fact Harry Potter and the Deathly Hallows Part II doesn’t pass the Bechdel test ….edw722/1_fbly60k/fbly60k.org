So, I want to ask questions, and while I understand they might seem like trolling please understand they are honest questions.

Would two lesbian women discussing romantic feelings toward some other woman pass the test?

Would two women discussing their female boss ("The Man" in their lives) pass the test?

----------------

I sort of want the test, in spirit if not in letter, to be about women knowing and discussing about having agency over their life and choices.
