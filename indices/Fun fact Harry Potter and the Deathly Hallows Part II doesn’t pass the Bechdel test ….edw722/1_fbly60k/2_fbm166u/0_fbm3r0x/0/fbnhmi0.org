My Christian friends also hit on the depiction of sex in the Hollywood (especially) films. The question is “Is there any love relationship between married husband and wife? Is there functional working marriage described?” (I am not sure whether there is a name for it).

The point is that in the most films all romantic relationships are between unmarried couples or if they are married, their marriage is almost without exception heading towards divorce, and then we are the square one. There is almost no film (some TV shows, e.g. just finished “Madam Secretary”) where married couple would live happily together and they would just do something else than having their marriage on rocks.

To get discussion back to the HP universe. Is it really normal in British schools that no teacher is married? (Yes, later on Pottermore JKR made Professor McGonagall married and widowed), and that aside from Weasleys and paradoxically Dursleys (who both perfectly fit the above test, BTW) there is no functional married couple in whole HP universe?
