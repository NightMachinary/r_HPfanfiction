The Malfoys seem pretty functional as a couple.

But while Harry Potter does have a remarkable lack of married characters, your overall point is misplaced. There are lots of happily married couples in film and TV, they just tend not to be the main characters. This is for the same reason that we don't see lots of films about someone sitting around watching Netflix all day, or filling out paperwork (unless those are starting points for them to go on to do something else) -- audiences want interesting and unusual scenarios from their fiction, and everything that makes it into a film has to be justified in those terms.

The ordinary everyday emotions of a long happy marriage may be wholesome, but they have no dramatic interest. So either the main characters don't get involved in romance and focus on other things, or else they're in a more uncertain situation like starting a new romantic relationship or salvaging/getting out of a dysfunctional one.
