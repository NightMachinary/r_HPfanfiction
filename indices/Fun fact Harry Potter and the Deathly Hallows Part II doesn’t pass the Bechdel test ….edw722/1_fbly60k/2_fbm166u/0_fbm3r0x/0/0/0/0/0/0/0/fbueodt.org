I wasn't defending the concept, just pointing out why it happened in the first place. And I've watched I Love Lucy. Many episodes involve her realising her mistakes and crawling back to sensible Ricky. I think it's a tired sitcom trope for either partner.

Atypical has a family on the rocks and the mom cheats, but the dad is a reasonable normal EMT who's having trouble getting over the betrayal & has difficulties accepting his son. I liked him a lot more than normal sitcom dads.
