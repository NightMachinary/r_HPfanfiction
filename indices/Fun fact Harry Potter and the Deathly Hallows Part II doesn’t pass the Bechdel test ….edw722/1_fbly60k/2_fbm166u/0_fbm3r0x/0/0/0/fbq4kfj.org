Yes, I give you Malfoys, although we really don't see much (if anything, few glimpses in DH) of their interaction.

And are you married? If yes, do you really think, that the married life has no dramatic interest? Besides, I don't think every film and TV show has to be just about relationship. That married couple could do something else than caring about their relationship (although, that's drama in itself). I am still thinking about “Madam Secretary” (or “Joan of Arcadia” from the same author) ... there is a lot of drama outside of their marriage, there is a lot of drama inside of their family (even though mostly about their kids), there is even a lot of sex (well, kind of in the background, it is PG-13, but it is obvious, it is there), and still they don't fight for salvaging of their marriage all the time.
