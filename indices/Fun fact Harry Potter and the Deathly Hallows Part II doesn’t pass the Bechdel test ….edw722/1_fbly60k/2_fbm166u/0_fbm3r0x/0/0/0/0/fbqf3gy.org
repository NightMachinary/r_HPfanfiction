Thos sitcom The Goldbergs is a perfect example of this. It has large amount of humor, various tensions and things to overcome as people, family upset at each other and a solid framework.

It does not have a marriage on the rocks, instead it shows the fights and arguments married couples have in a positive light. It happens, we work through it, amends are made, and we are moving forward now.

My wife and I love that show, it's one of the few where the husband isn't useless and the wife isn't trapped in some loveless marraige.

Test for that would be really interesting, how many times is the husband portrayed are near incompetent? There are shows where they push that premise while advertising it.

Imagine this in reverse, commercials showing idiot wives while the husbands made fun of them. Not really something that makes you want to watch, so why are men and marriage free game?
