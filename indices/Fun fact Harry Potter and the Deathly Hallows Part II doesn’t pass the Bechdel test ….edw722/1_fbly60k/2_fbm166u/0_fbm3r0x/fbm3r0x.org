Thank you! That concept makes 'social' type of discussions a lot easier to navigate.

So, the Bechdel Test, however flawed, helps to at least start the conversation and consideration of the less tangible concept.

I like how in the discussion which [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] linked above people used the Test as a springboard to the more important topic. Now I have a term for what was happening and why I liked it.

Are there other codified but more nuanced 'tests' or metrics which we might apply?
