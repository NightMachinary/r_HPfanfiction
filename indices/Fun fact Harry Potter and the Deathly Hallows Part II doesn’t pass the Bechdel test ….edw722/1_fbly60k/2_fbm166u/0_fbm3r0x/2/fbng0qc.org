The wiki article on The Bechdel Test lists a number of others (& also contains a spoiler for the second Pacific Rim film which I've cut from the below quote:

  The Bechdel test has inspired others, notably feminist and antiracist critics and fans, to formulate criteria for evaluating works of fiction, in part because of the Bechdel test's limitations.[53] In interviews conducted by FiveThirtyEight, women in the film and television industry proposed many other tests that included more women, better stories, women behind the scenes, and more diversity.[56]

  The "Mako Mori test", formulated by Tumblr user "Chaila"[57] and named after the only significant female character of the 2013 film Pacific Rim, asks whether a female character has a narrative arc that is not about supporting a man's story.[53] Comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick proposed a "sexy lamp test": "If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft."[59][60]

Looking back at Harry Potter, arguably some characters fail the Mako Mori test off the bat - Fleur, Cho, even Lily would potentially fall down that rabbit hole off the bat. In terms of sexy lamps, a lot of 80s movies with plucky teen boys & their wise older mentor have them as a 3rd act motivator - and a lot of modern anime, too.
