Oh, I like these, especially the Mako Mori test! It is clearly about a female a) being a full on human character and b) showing developing through an arc as happens to actual people. If implemented it also would make for a much richer story and setting.

Heh, the sexy lamp test is funny, since it should be the most obvious thing in any work that would fail. On the not so funny side, I suppose it exists due to the prevalence, as well as all the causes that lead to, the objectification of women.
