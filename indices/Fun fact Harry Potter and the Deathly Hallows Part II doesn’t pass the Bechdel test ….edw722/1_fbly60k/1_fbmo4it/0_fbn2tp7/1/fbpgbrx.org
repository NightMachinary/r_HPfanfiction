The one show I've noticed that obviously made an effort to pass the bechdel test every (or most) episode was Star Trek Deep Space Nine. For most of the series, there's two main female characters, Kira & Dax, and a lot of episodes will start off with the two of them having a random conversation about their career or their cultures or meeting up at the bar or something about their personal lives.

I think it was in response to the criticism The Next Generation got because Troi & Dr. Crusher were overshadowed by their male colleagues and didn't have a relationship together outside of work. I was glad Deep Space Nine made an effort.

Voyager was the first Star Trek with a majority female cast, so passing the bechdel test was natural.
