That is really nice to know about DS9. It really did come across as natural there, just two people.

Voyager was....odd for me. The best female there seemed to be Jeri Ryan's character - she seemed to come on as eye candy but she made that character so real that she seemed something of a feminist icon. The others... there were there but they seemed a bit like caricatures.

(Please forgive whatever issues with my phrasing. I sooo wanted Janeway to be a better Captain and am still put out by it all.)
