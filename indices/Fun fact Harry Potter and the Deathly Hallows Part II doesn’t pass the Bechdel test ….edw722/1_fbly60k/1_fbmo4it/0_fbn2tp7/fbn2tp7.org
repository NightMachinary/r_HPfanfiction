I've always thought it peculiar why writers/directors/etc didn't take the easy way out and just have /something/ like this in every movie. Your examples show how easy it could be.

I don't know whether to think they are just trying to be as true to their story and keep it as tight as possible, or they all have some game where they try to see how much they can avoid passing the Test. I hope that it is a matter of trying to not cheapen the issue and just doing their, sometimes not-so-competent, best to portray women honestly as they see them in the story context.
