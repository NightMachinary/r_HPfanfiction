To be honest, as someone who is both a minority and a writer who has struggled writing underrepresented people, I blame it on the way that genres and tropes are so encoded in how we talk about stories and how we market them.

A lot of my own work doesn't pass the Bechdel test, and usually it's because I wasn't really trying to write in a way that felt like a snippet of a complete world.

Instead, I was going "this is the scene where the hero does this thing". "This is the scene where the villain does that thing". I was writing from the Monomyth and with a /structure/ in mind, and the fact of the matter is that a lot of sexist assumptions are built into the structure of stories, because /most/ stories were written by sexist people from within sexist societies.

E.g. - Most of my characters get along fine with their mothers but not their fathers. Why? Well... because "confrontation with the father" is a persistent trope of character development that I am aware of and have in the past tried to include in my works in a way that "confrontation with the mother"... isn't. So by default, most of my more family-focused stories will feature father-child conflict, and since I aim for 50/50 male/female protagonists, that means that 50% of my stories that have a family focus will feature father/son interactions (which would pass the reverse-Bechdel) and 50% of them will feature a father/daughter interaction (which does not pass the Bechdel test).

The answer there is, fairly obviously, to just... write more conflicts with moms. But that's hard when I realize that the only mothers I have seen in fiction who play the role of the antagonist are like... cartoonishly evil. I don't want to write a cartoonishly evil mother figure, so I have to figure one out from first principle or from historical accounts of real people, instead. It's much, much easier for me to write a misguided but ultimately well-intentioned father than it is for me to write a misguided but ultimately well-intentioned mother, because I have a dozen little archetypes for the different ways the dad could work, but I have to design the mother "from scratch" in my brain.

Ultimately, my antagonist-moms are actually /better characters/ than my antagonist-dads, because they're more /carefully written/, because I had to /actually think/ about how I wanted to write them instead of doing it from an instinct that has been honed by writing stories and consuming them. So obviously it's "worth it". But it is also /harder/ and people tend to avoid doing things that are hard.

I have a story that I am writing that is more autobiographical than usual for me. Everyone who has read it has said it feels "more authentic" than my other stuff (whatever the hell that means). But... I don't know how to sell it to people.

"Oh, it's an immigrant-fantasy-political drama about authoritarianism being ignored by people who see the nation in question as little more than a rhetorical tool in an argument they are having about themselves" tells you a general idea, but when I ask other people, they want a structure. "How does your second act end?"/ "Who is the love interest?"/etc. This story... does not have that kind of structure. It's harder for me to explain, or to pitch to people.

I think if stories weren't that commodified, and if people were pushed to write from reality instead of from archetypes, it would be far far easier to do things like pass the Bechdel Test. But because you need to have these structures, and people need to know what boxes to put characters inside of in their heads, it becomes much harder as a writer to change what should be incredibly easy things. Which is why stuff like #OwnVoices helps.

The protagonist of my "more autobiographical" novel is not... a hero. Or a villain. Or an antihero. Or an underdog. She doesn't fit the "I came into this country with fifteen cents in my pocket" immigrant narrative, and she doesn't fit the "I am a [nationality] in every way except that my parents are foreign weirdos" immigrant narrative either. She's not inspiring, she's not particularly strong or kickass. She's also not a "loser hero" who sucks at everything. She's... a person, in a situation, who has /some/ skills. I have spent probably thousands of hours in [[https://TVTropes.org][TVTropes.org]] and I don't know what tropes would actually apply to her. I'm sure there are some, since there HAVE to be some, but none come to mind. I keep not being able to tell people "oh, she's like this character, but with this". Or "Oh, she's X character meets Y character".

I can do that with my other stories. "Oh, this guy is like, if a mad scientist became a soccer-dad". "James Bond, but she's an adorable grandmother". "If Jesus was also George Washington". "What happens when you mix Danny Phantom and Buffy the Vampire Slayer". "What if Rambo, but trans?".

With a story based on much more real things, with which I have personal experience... I don't have a pitch of ten words or fewer.
