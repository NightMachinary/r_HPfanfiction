This is a nice honest evaluation of a writer's own work, thank you for sharing this. It really gives me a sense of how it is from the other side.

I know for myself that I find it easier to put time into a movie/tv/story if I can identify some tropes which give me something to 'hold on to' and provide me a framework to take in the story. I think...if we learn how to distinguish between masculine/male and feminine/female then we might get more use out of tropes which are overwhelmingly masculine/feminine without feeling that a male must be involved?

One show that had conflicts from a well-meaning but not villainous mother is Malcolm in the Middle. Her children were all boys so no test passing, but the conflicts seemed natural to mother/children.

I never saw Roseanne, but maybe some conflicts there?
