  I think...if we learn how to distinguish between masculine/male and feminine/female then we might get more use out of tropes which are overwhelmingly masculine/feminine without feeling that a male must be involved?

Maybe. Part of the problem with this kind of bias in writing is that it shows up even in the macro-structure of certain stories.

For example, look at the Hunger Games. Katniss is the Strong Powerful Female Protagonist... but also she's kind of coded masculine (she's rough, and tough, and she /hunts/ and she's emotionally closed off) and all of the bad guys are these... campy vaguely-gay-coded people who are all delicate and bright-coloured.

I think that children's shows are actually where the most progress is happening right now. The She-Ra and Carmen Sandiego reboots have been great at providing blends of feminine and masculine things, vilifying none of them, and My Little Pony probably paved the way for super-girly heroes who are still seen as kickass.

Something I would love to see is a story with a very feminine /man/ as the protagonist, in a way that isn't just making fun of him the whole time. Unless feminine men are seen as just as "legitimate" an option for a protagonist as masculine women (who are the default for Action Hero Female Protagonist), there's still going to be that subtext that being masculine is always better and being feminine is always worse. Which will hurt stories that have feminine people, men or women, in them.

I have only watched a handful of episodes of Malcolm in the Middle, I liked how she was written in the ones I watched, because she seemed to ultimately love her children while also winding up in conflict with them. I have also never watched Roseanne, so I have no idea there. BoJack Horseman's treatment of Beatrice is pretty amazing, I would recommend that show as well.
