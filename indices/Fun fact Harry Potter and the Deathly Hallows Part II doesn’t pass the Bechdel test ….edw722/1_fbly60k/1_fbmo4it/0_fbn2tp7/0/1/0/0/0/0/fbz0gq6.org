Oh yeah, Diane is a mess, but she seems more like a normal mess since she is human? For everyone else we are not sure how much of that might be some species-thing giving them tendencies to react in certain ways to modern life.

As for not a mess, or coping in healthy ways, I like Mr. Peanutbutter's view, and what about the kids in a trenchcoat - they seem to have it together?

Huh, I guess that does make Beatrice a sort of complete person. Wow, I now have a better appreciation of what the writers did with her, and can maybe get a handle on how I feel about her.

And what you said about the rest of the cast, I am starting to think it may be why I don't stop watching once I start. On the surface there is nothing positive about them, but maybe the point is that they are all shown to be human...
