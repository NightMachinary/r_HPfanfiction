You've really expressed the point clearly here. I never really considered how to make things happen, just how I see things now. I hope you and other creators can take this step. I am actually really happy by how things seems clear, and that there is may be a clear path forward after reading what you wrote here :)

I didn't see She-Ra but I liked the Carmen Sandiego reboot.

I have no chance of any objective view of Beatrice...she is just so sad and broken and...and just all of what Bojack Horseman the show portrays. She is moving to me, but in a way that makes it seem impossible for any kind of step forward for her.
