She is!

But... so are a lot of people in BoJack Horseman.

In a way, that show does what I said incredibly well, just because /every character/ is fucked up in some way. So nobody ends up in that "weirdly perfect" position (even if some people think Diane does, which in my view is just... those people not paying attention to the many ways Diane is screwed up and screws up). They all have areas of competence and areas of incompetence, and they all.... fail. Often.

Very often, women are portrayed as victims, or as "just" victims. Beatrice is a victim AND an abuser. She is sad AND cruel. She's not just not perfect, she's a terrible person. And yet, her life is so sad and broken...

I don't know, I really like that. It shows her be a /person/, even if she's a terrible person. That's good.
