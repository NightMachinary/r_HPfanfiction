  Would two women discussing their female boss ("The Man" in their lives) pass the test?

Yes.

If they are two women. And they talk to each other. And the topic is not /specifically/ a man. It passes the test.

Two women talking about shoes would pass the test. Two women talking about their uteruses would pass the test. Two women talking about a third woman, or a romantic interest who isn't a man, or a pet, or the plot, would pass the test. Two women talking about how /women shouldn't have rights/ would pass the test.

It's not actually a feminism-meter. It just... highlights the way in which "women talk to each other" is a basic truth about the world that films persistently ignore.
