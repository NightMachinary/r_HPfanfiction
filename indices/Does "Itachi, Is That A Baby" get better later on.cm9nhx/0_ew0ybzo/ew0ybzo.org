Better jokes? No not really.

But Harry does use his OP-ness in fun ways, and the Omakes and Outtakes at the end of each chapter are fun.

Towards the end, something quite significant happens, which promises to give Harry a growth arc. Unfortunately the fic ends right after that.

Edit: By 'ends', I mean that's the last chapter as of now. The fic is still ongoing.
