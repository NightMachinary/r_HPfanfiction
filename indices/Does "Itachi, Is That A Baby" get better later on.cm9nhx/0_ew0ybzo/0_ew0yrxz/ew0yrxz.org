Thanks. Sounds like I will bench this. I don't think my sanity will survive another 50 misunderstood question jokes (aka 5 chapters). Pity, really. Was quite happy that after a few weeks I had finally found a good story I hadn't read yet. But if it takes the author 100 chapters of repeating the same joke to finally make something happen that MIGHT make Harry grow up a bit, I don't think this is a fic for me.
