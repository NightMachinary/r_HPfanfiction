  Harry wasn't the only Potter displaced by the events in Godric's Hollow on Halloween 1981. Leila, Harry's twin, was also there that night. Now, headed into her sixth year, Leila finds that everything changes when she falls into the arms of Hogwarts resident Death Eater, Draco Malfoy. Fate steps in and throws her completely off course, leaving her lost along the way.
