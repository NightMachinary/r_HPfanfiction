  And it's during THIS, this most embarrassing humiliation that Snape has likely ever gone through, that he's saved by a "mudblood" in front of his extremely racist "friends", THIS is when he snaps and calls her, presumably for the first time, a calls her the dreaded racial slur.

Okay this kind of interpretation of the "Mudblood" interaction is weird to me. To me it's always been clear that this was more like a final straw or maybe just something that Lily found to be revealing about his true character. Of course Snape was agitated and blew his top, doing something that he otherwise wouldn't have done (because presumably he was trying to hide his racist nature and favorable attitude towards Voldemort from Lily).

Since I see Lily in a positive light and as a good person I assume she would have made lots of excuses for her best friend over the years, when there were rumors that he is "dark" and "evil". Can you imagine the betrayal she must have felt when she not only witnesses Snape using a racial epitaph under which Muggleborns are murdered, but uses it against her?

It's perplexing to me when people frame this situation as some kind of "political correctness" issue where the guy just made an innocent mistake and didn't really mean it.

  I've heard a lot of bullying horror stories but there aren't many things that could top that kind of embarrassment without drooping pig's blood on him during prom.

You must have been extremely sheltered. I've witnessed *much* more humiliating things in my school time (for example they forced a girl to run across the school yard in her underwear). What James did there strikes me as very typical school yard bullying. Equivalent to pulling down trousers, which is like, almost banal.

  (I'm going to completely ignore the fact that Snape was literally almost murdered by Sirius, because that doesn't technically have anything to do with James and, although James was the one who saved him, it seems fair to me that Snape would group them all in together, given how close they were)

How is that fair? It's stupid.
