You bring up some good points. Lily's actions in this regard do say a lot about her. I think there is more than meets the eye when it comes to their friendship.

With what we know about his childhood, Snape's personal experiences may have led him to dislike Muggles and feel that they are inferior. In SWM, he is in a very humiliating situation and took out his frustration about the situation by calling Lily a Mudblood. Another thing to note is that the slur may be commonly used amongst Slytherins with whom he hung out every day. While Snape calling Lily a Mudblood is reprehensible, there are other factors behind this action other than pure racism.
