Now I really want a deep analysis of her character. I honestly don't believe that Rowling has a solid personality for her like most of her present characters, she has a vague outline but she isn't as fleshed out as Harry or Hermione. For example, she shows her as forgiving in the first few memories but later refuses to hear what Snape has to say for himself. Of course, a lot of character development would have happened between her being only nine and her being sixteen, so it's not solid enough.

Lily is there to be the symbolism of perfection and she was constantly shown throughout the books to be that way. Even Petunia, who hates her, builds up on her perfection by demonstrating how jealous she is. She and James are even literally raised on a pedestal as we see in Godric's Hollow, which is very tragic, considering just how young they were we they died. However, she's human so she's obviously not perfect but a lot of people base her flaws upon Snape's memories of her as a kid so I don't think that's fair to Lily as a character since she was only eight or nine at the time. We just have so little about her that basically any overall 'good' representation of her is valid that doesn't contradict her few canon qualities. However, the obvious explanation is that Harry met people who hate James but didn't meet people who hate Lily.

Worse yet, people take her perfect imagine in canon, forgetting that she's dead and exaggerate her good qualities and not adding anything else on them, resulting in her being perfect in most interpretations as well. I'm pretty sure had we not seen Snape's Worst Memory and how savage James was, he would have been written the same as Lily and the 'perfect' guy just like she's the 'perfect' girl. That's being unfair to both of them because ridding a character of any flaw is just as bad as bashing them, in my opinion.
