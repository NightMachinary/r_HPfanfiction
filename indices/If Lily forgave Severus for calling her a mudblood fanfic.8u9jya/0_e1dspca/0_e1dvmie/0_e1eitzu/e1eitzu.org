Beyond that, even, Lily is portrayed as this perfect teenage girl who always follow the rules, but at the point where Snape calls her a Mudblood, she would've been 15/16. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I wasn't the kind of person I was then as I am now. So, it is entirely possible that Lily simply /did/ start dating James out of spite, like a rebellious phase or something.

Of course, adding on the facts that you just put down, it isn't all that unlikely that Lily had no interest in continuing her friendship with Snape, what with his beliefs.
