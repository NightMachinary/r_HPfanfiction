I'm not even entirely sure Lily is presented as perfect. It's more like we don't see her presented much. Outside of Snape's Worst Memory, we just get fond remembrances. Maybe Lily could have been stuck up (unlikely I suppose, especially if you take Lupin's movie lines). We know she would give Slughorn cheeky responses when he told her she ought to have been in Slytherin. Who knows.
