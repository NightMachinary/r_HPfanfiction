I see your point but technically we don't know anything about Lily's character outside of Snape's very biased "she was perfect" mindset and her friends in the order (Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus) who could be romanticizing someone who was overall a good person and died too young. So I wouldn't say Lily not forgiving Snape was necessarily out of character. HOWEVER, she may have forgiven him in her heart years later, and had no way or desire to contact an alleged death eater to tell him so. Or maybe she didn't have the chance to mature and forgive him. It's possible Remus trying to make peace with Snape in canon was because he got the chance to grow up and wise up, whereas Sirius had his maturity stunted by Azkaban and Lily died before she could.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling. I enjoy both Snape/Lily and James/Lily because they give more depth to Lily's character than pretty, talented, nice witch who loved her son and died young which is basically all we get from canon.
