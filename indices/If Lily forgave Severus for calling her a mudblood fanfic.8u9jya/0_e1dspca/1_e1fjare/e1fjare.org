Lily didn't drop Snape because he called her a mudblood - it was just symbolic of everything wrong with him. The dialogue makes it crystal clear that Lily had been on the verge of dropping him anyway because he wanted to be a death eater.

You'll also note, that despite the fact Lily straight up told Snape that she was dropping him because he was a death eater wannabe, he did not change his behaviour. He went straight ahead and kept on becoming a death eater.

Lily dropping Snape had nothing to do with failing to forgive him. As she said, she just accepted that they had chosen different paths. She didn't want to be friends with a death eater anymore, and Snape never made any indication that he would give up being a death eater for her. He was desperate for her to forgive him, but he wasn't that desperate.

If he hadn't called her a mudblood, their friendship would have inevitably collapsed anyway. Lily would not have put up with his political opinions, and Snape was not going to give them up for her.

  Regardless, we know for sure that James and Sirius went so far as to hoist Severus upside down and show his undergarments in public. I've heard a lot of bullying horror stories but there aren't many things that could top that kind of embarrassment without drooping pig's blood on him during prom.

Remus makes a comment in the Half Blood Prince about how everyone was using that spell on everyone else while he was at school. The bullying was certainly bad, but I don't think it is as catastrophic as you are making it out to be. I think the difference in popularity and the spectacle of it were the worst part - not the actual methods used.

  Snape was literally almost murdered by Sirius

Snape chose to sneak out at night, to go to a place where he suspected there was a werewolf. Sirius didn't 'almost murder Snape'. All Sirius did was give Snape some information that he had been trying to steal anyway.

The worst interpretation of Sirius's actions was that he gave Snape the means to almost kill himself.
