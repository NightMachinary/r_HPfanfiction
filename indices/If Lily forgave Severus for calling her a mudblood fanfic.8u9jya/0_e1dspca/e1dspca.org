I don't have a fic recommendation because SS/LP isn't a particular pairing that I search out, but I just have to comment.

It seems really out of character that Lily never forgave Severus, to me. I'm not suggesting they would have made an OTP or that Severus is somehow a better man than James - those are patently false. But they had an interesting friendship, even if the feelings weren't quite requited.

I'm not even saying that Snape necessarily /deserved/ forgiveness. Just that it seems out of character that Lily, taking his circumstance into account, couldn't find it within herself to forgive him. And not to taint the relationship between Lily and James, but the fact that she, the following year, started going out with the guy who she had up to that point literally despised and who bullied her best friend for 6 years seems... almost like spite. I'm not saying that those were her motivations at all, just that it was an interesting piece of storytelling by JKR that I'm wondering if there was more to.

As for James being a bully (shit, did my rant really end up here?), a lot of the counterarguments are:

1. Snape is obviously a biased source regarding the severity of the bullying.
2. Remus Lupin says that Snape gave as good as he got.

Now while those two statements themselves are true, I can't help but notice the hypocrisy between those two arguments being used. I'm confused as to why Remus Lupin seems so much more "unbiased" while defending a long-lost friend to his son who's having an identity crisis than Snape.

Regardless, we know for sure that James and Sirius went so far as to hoist Severus upside down and show his undergarments in public. I've heard a lot of bullying horror stories but there aren't /many/ things that could top that kind of embarrassment without drooping pig's blood on him during prom. The treatment that Snape went through was easily more than schoolyard bullying and bordering on illegality, depending on how modern Wizarding Laws are.

And it's during THIS, this most embarrassing humiliation that Snape has likely ever gone through, that he's saved by a "mudblood" in front of his extremely racist "friends", THIS is when he snaps and calls her, presumably for the first time, a calls her the dreaded racial slur.

(I'm going to completely ignore the fact that Snape was literally almost murdered by Sirius, because that doesn't technically have anything to do with James and, although James was the one who saved him, it seems fair to me that Snape would group them all in together, given how close they were)

Now, again, I cannot iterate enough that I'm not arguing that Snape /deserved/ an apology or that Lily should have given him one. I'm not arguing that this is the only time Snape ever did anything worthy of concern. I'm just saying, again, that it seems out of /Lily's/ character to have not accepted it. After years, despite his /obvious/ remorse and immediate attempts to apologize, she never forgave him. It's just... weird. For her. To me.

Then again, he did become a Death Eater, so what the fuck do I know.
