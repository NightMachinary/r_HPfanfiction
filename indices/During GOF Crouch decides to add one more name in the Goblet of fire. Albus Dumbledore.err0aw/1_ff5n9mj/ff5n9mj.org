My speculation:

1. For the first two tasks, Dumbledore uses his overwhelming magical ability to complete them in deliberately underwhelming ways and asks the judges to give him lowest possible scores.
2. For the third task, Dumbledore is the last person into the maze, where he conjures a plush chair and waits for one of the others to win.

Canon plot continues unchanged.

If you want to be more optimistic, he might observe Krum casting the Cruciatus on Fleur, put them both down, then tear his way to the end of the maze and detect the tampered-with portkey on the cup.
