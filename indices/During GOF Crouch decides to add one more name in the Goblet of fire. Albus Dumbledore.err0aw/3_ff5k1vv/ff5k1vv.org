Manipulative/Evil dumbles version (others to follow)

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

He called the weapons name and made it go to the foyer as he prepared to give his speech. It would almost sound like he was trying to help the weapon but really it would set the school against the boy like nothing else would.

Before he could start the goblet spit out another name and he felt his heart clench. This was not going to plan at all, there was no one else he wanted in this competition.

He had the Star of Eastern Europe and the Chief Auror's daughter under his control through the tournament. Add in having Diggory now firmly under his thumb and life was going great.

Looking at the name his heart truly clenched as his magic fought off a heart attack.

This was impossible, there was no way his name could have come out of the goblet. Yet he could feel the magical hooks digging him already. He was an offical competitor, blast!

Addressing the students finally he gave them some platitudes.

"The goblet has been tampered with by outside forces. All names drawn will be reviewed to determine their validity. That is all for now."

Snatching up the goblet he made his way up to his office. He closed the portal behind him leaving the two idiots Crouch and Bagman outside.

He began casting countless charms on the goblet trying to find a way to remove his name.

There! A crack he could exploit in the logic net that had been shifted by that idiot pretending to be Moody.

Twisting it he began setting up a masking line that would allow him to designate a replacement for himself.

As he held it open he summoned his book of names from its hiding place. Pulling out Malfoy's he began inserting it into the goblet.

In his haste to remove his name before th goblet could finalize the binding contract he overlooked a minor layer of the spellwork. It checked the names submitted against the names selected. Yes that's right, it checked all the names submitted against the names selected and in no way affected the names slected. It wasn't even useful like the reverse could possibly be in preventing cheating. It was an entirely useless bit of spellwork that for some reason if removed caused the whole enchantment scheme to go tits up so it had stayed.

This minor and seemingly useless piece of spellwork kicked into place when a new name was selected. Finding no name submitted it started the process again only this time it searched the previous list of names submitted.

This is where a fun fact comes into play. The Malfoy family has a long standing tradition of never using the same name twice. This means in the entire history of the Malfoy family there was only one Draco Malfoy.

In the split second it took to check this times list of names and last times the goblet had started drawing on a bit more magic than usual. Nothing noticable yet even as the amount was tiny compared to the overall amount it held control of.

When the second list failed it went back one more year looking for a Draco Malfoy.

In the span of three seconds it had searched the entire list of names ever submitted and came up empty.

Magic is weird sometimes and this time it was especially weird. Seeing as none of the names were useful anymore it began releasing them from its grasp for the first time ever.

Thousands of sheet of parchment began flooding from the goblet as Dumbledore paused his work. He had no idea what he had done to trigger that and desperately began trying to find out what.

After ejecting the names it began drawing more magic to itself desperately trying to find a submittal of the name Draco Malfoy.

Pulling on the largest and closest source it rapidly began draining Dumbledore's magic.

Dumbledore felt his magic begin to drain and was sure he had somehow missed a defensive measure on the Goblet. Surely the Goblet was finding him in the wrong and was now stripping him of his magic.

"Like hell! I'll not be taken down by a bloody cup!"

Throwing the goblet into the fireplace he cast a fiendfyre on it attempting to save himself.

That act finally triggered the goblets rules and it lashed out in its last moments.

The explosion was more felt than heard as everyone in the castle was now temporarily deaf. Crouch Sr. and Jr. were outside the door with Bagman trying to get in when the explosion happened.

None survived.

The remaining headmasters realized the goblet was destroyed and the spirits damned contract Dumbledore had tricked them into was no longer in force.

They left the shores of the UK that night and did not return.

Snape was fired within a week of McGonagall taking over. She simply didn't have time to deal with his bullshit in the wake of everything.

Binns and Trelawney had followed shortly afterwards. She had been forced to hire a new deputy as no one wanted it, and she needed a Transfiguration teacher as well as a new head of house for Gryffindor.

Harry was happy as Dumbledore had died getting his name out of the tournament. He was sad the man had died but had spoken at length about him at his funeral.

All had paid attention when he had gone on about all the times Dumbledore had treated him like the grandson he never had. How he had risked his life, and lost it, in helping Harry.

Harry was lauded as the next Dumbledore and the Minister couldn't get enough of all the good press. He had even ignored Dumbledore's orders to keep Black out of court, Dumbledore was dead so fuck him anyways Fudge needed votes.

That had won him a landslide approval rating. When Voldemort tried to return Black had shown him the popularity of succesful wartime ministers.

He had also shown him examples of unsuccessful wartime ministers that made Bagnolds drumming out seem polite in comparison.

A new law he had passed making it legal to seize funds used by terrorist had dried up any hesitancy in going after the old purebloods.

Afterall the phrase old money existed for a reason.

Using lethal force, bankrupting and executing death eaters had changed the war front drastically.

Fudge was a wartime minister for the record books. Life was great and Harry Potter-Lovegood and his wife Luna Potter-Lovegood were happy.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO
