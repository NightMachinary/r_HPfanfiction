Not the best-written survey in the world. I think it's fairly clear that this has gone up in response to the slash thread, but it doesn't look like the author has taken on board the comments contained in that thread.

For example:

#+begin_quote
  How important is it that you share dominant personality traits with the main character?
#+end_quote

A fairly common theme in the comments to the slash thread was that many readers distinguish between:

A) Characters having traits they don't have but aspire to, such as being more confident, adventurous, powerful, etc.

B) Characters having traits that they don't have and do not aspire to, such as being attracted to people they find unattractive IRL.

The question doesn't allow respondents to distinguish between these two. Someone who likes to read Harry because they want to have adventures and they're not adventurous IRL would have to answer that it is not important that the main character shares their dominant personality traits, but they may very well still find it important for the main character to share their sexuality.

Another example:

#+begin_quote
  Do you enjoy reading main characters that have different backgrounds to yourself? E.g., different ethnic background, different sexuality, different era. *
#+end_quote

This one seems deliberately engineered to make people who dislike slash look bad. The question is poorly written for two reasons:

A) It conflates all personal characteristics, assuming that they are all equally relevant to a reader's ability to identify with a PoV character. This seems designed to allow people to say "people who dislike slash are racist too!".

B) It misses the core point being made in the previous thread that it's the aversion to the object of the main character's affection which determines the aversion to slash, not aversion to the main character themselves. People repeatedly said that they dislike slash because they themselves are not attracted to men and thus derive no entertainment from a story about being attracted to men. This question seems to completely ignore that point and just reiterate the view that people who dislike slash must dislike it because they dislike empathizing with gay people.
