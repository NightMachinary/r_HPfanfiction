Well, let me put it that way: generally, stuff either asks for anatomical gender (male/female/intersex/other), or for mental gender (man/woman/non-binary/other). In this case, because it asks about both, it lacks options, and while I could have answered both of the other possible versions (intersex, though could choose female if intersex wasn't an option since that's the closer one, and for the other one woman), in this particular one I cannot, without feeling fake, choose any of the woman options because if we are being honest then I am neither cis nor trans, if exact anatomy and the exact by-the-book definition matter all that much, but rather in-between those and thus forced to choose the last option, namely other.

And being forced to choose “other” because the author of a survey/questionnaire decided to split answers like that but did not actually cover all likely options feels like being grouped with attack helicopters. I'm not going to raise a fuss about it, and the mention of attack helicopters is only to show how off-putting it feels, but yeah, that feels like nonsense.

PS. And yes, technically I do count myself as a trans woman, but that's ... really kind of not exactly it (basically, counting as a trans woman is less freaky than the full version, and I use that with full knowledge of what the word “freaky” can be taken for here) and if I'm forced to choose something in a survey when the exact state of my genitals at birth is that important then I cannot truthfully choose this option.
