I'm of two minds about this. Technically, you can probably still have all the same professors teaching, even if they're 100+ years old. But I almost feel like this is a bit of fanservice, just to have a familiar name and a known quantity. Like, it's cool that Harry's son has the same charms professor that both Harry and Harry's mother had, but is it really necessary from a literary standpoint? I feel like it's almost too /safe/. Professors don't have to work at Hogwarts until the day they die, so I think it's reasonable for them to retire, or pursue other interests, and to try and come up with other memorable replacements.
