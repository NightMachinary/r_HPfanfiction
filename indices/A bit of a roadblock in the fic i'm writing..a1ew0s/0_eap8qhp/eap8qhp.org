In the books, JKR tends to focus Harry's attention on a select few professors and kind of vaguely sketches out the rest. I suggest that you do the same -- your plot can (potentially) revolve around one or two professors. Whether you choose to make those professors canon or not is up to you. Wizards live to be well over 100, so you have a lot of wiggle room about whether Hagrid, Flitwick, Sprout, Trelawney, etc. are still there.

Making your own professors is always risky (in terms of grabbing reader interest) but it is oh so fun. Do what JKR does -- base it on the most bonkers person you've known, or the most likable, or the least likable. Think about someone in your life who can always launch you and your friends into an animated conversation (or a rant) when you talk about them, and base your character on that person.
