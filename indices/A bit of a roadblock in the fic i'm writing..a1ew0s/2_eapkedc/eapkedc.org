As [[/u/FitzDizzyspells]] reminded you, life expectancy is massively greater for wizards. Dumbledore would probably have been Headmaster for another fifty years if not for the Withering Curse, going by his predecessor. If you assume that Flitwick is in his 60's or 70's in the canon books, as I do, it's entirely plausible (indeed, very /probable/) that he would still be teaching. Same for Hagrid (unless he ages faster as a Giant, but that's unlikely since it rather seems to make him /tougher/), Sprout, etc.

You're going to have to create your own Potions, Transfiguration and Defence Professors, anyway. Unless you're very inspired for another Professor, don't make your work harder for yourself than it has to be.
