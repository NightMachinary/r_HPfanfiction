Earthbound Spook is what started my love for Gryffindor!Draco. It's probably my absolute favourite fanfic, ever. I'm not normally a fan of dimension travel, but this one isn't bad in that respect.

The Draco in the fic comes from an alternate universe where he had been sorted into Gryffindor. DH-non compliant.
