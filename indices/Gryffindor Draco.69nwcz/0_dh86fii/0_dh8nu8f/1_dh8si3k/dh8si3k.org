Basics the premise is that Sirius escapes from Azkaban when Harry is 8 and raises him in secret. The news gets out. Lucius wonders if Harry is being raised to be a new dark lord. Draco has an almost-twin, Hydrus- who plays out a typical canon malfoy (but meaner) and so Lucius basically raises Draco to be a Griffyndor so they'll be on Potters side either way. Sounds hokey when I write it out but it doesn't read that way. So Draco is from the start much more of a nice kid, but he still struggles with his identity and his relationships with his family, Gryffindor friends and old Slytherin friends. He isn't the main character necessarily but a prominent one and it's a fantastic series. Mostly canon compliant in the important bits.
