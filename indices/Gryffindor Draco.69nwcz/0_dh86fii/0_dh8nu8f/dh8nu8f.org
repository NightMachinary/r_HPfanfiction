Ooh, a story I've never heard of before.

Can you give a bit more detailed description on it?

Particular points of interest for me: its evaluation on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][canon stations,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiot balls,]] drama balls, wishful thinking, magical lore exploration, deconstruction, and duels.
