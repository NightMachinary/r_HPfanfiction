When I'm writing out notes, I use a kind of weird shorthand, so Dumbledore = Dumbles, Hermione = He/Herm, Harry = Ha/Haz/Hazza, Ron = R, Snape = Sev, Draco = Dr/Dra/Drac, Lucius = Luc/Lucy and Minerva = Min/Minnie. Those are the main ones I use from Canon, but I also have nicknames and shorthand for my OCs, so reading my initial notes would probably be confusing AF. Of course, I go through and write them up properly after I finish each section, otherwise I would forget all my shorthand and struggle to understand it.
