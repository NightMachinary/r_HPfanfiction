Haha it's not even a draft it's my notes for a draft of the notes for the first draft of my prose. And yes, I can't stand that. If an actual character in actual dialogue calls her that (I'll jump into the story and smash their face in, leave my McGonaqueen alone!) ironically, I can handle it. provided it's like once or twice total. But it's not funny for the narrator to be calling characters weird names in the actual non-dialogue parts of the fricking-fracking prose.
