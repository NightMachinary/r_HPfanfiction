I know it's not really shorthand, but for some reason my brain will see it as shorthand occasionally, so my notes are very lightly peppered with ‘Hazza'. And I'm Aussie (with a pommy editor) so everything has a nickname that ends with ‘-o' or ‘-a'. Occasionally there are ‘-ie' or ‘-y's. For example, Hazza (Harry), Bazza (Barry), Wazza (Warren), Jobbo (Jobson), Robbo (Robert/Robertson), Servo (Service/petrol station, Avo (Avocado), Arvo (Afternoon, and my editor's least favourite word ever), Maccas (McDonalds), Durry/Duzza (Cigarette), Derro (Drunkard/Junkie/Low-life), Bottle-O (Liquor store), Dunny (Toilet). That's about all I can think of for now. We're normal, I swear.
