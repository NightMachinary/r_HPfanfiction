Most of the time it just reads as edgy teens going through their 'UGH U DONT UNDERSTAND ME MOM' phase - so they project all their angsty nonsense onto fictional characters, so that they can live vicariously through the MC.

I mean, people can read what they want to read. It's hardly my place to tell people what they can or can't read or write. I'm just saying, the minute I hear that Dumbledore is secretly siphoning funds from Harry's bank account, or that Ginny is spiking Harry's Fruit Loops with wizard roofies. Or god forbid, James and Lily live and end up being abusive for no reason (??????), I close the tap so fast my index finger starts smoking. Just because Kevin stuck gum in your hair during third period, doesn't give you free reign to irrationally mudsling innocent wizards, Bethany. Go listen to some Papa Roach and chill out.

And don't even get me started on shit like calling Dumbledore, 'Dumblefuck' or something. My god. I'm not saying people who unironically say 'Moldyshorts' should be send to Guantanamo Bay - I'm just saying I wouldn't oppose the decision.
