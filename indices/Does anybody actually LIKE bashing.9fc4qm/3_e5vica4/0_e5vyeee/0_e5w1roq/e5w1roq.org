I was Brain storming a Idea on how to change the WBWL trope and what if James and Lily stayed alive they believe Charles Potter is the BWL but Harry is still their favorite subconsciously, like Harry is the one that enjoys slightly pranks, runes, Transfiguration and Charm, Playing Music, he and James share a favorite Quidditch team and playing Seekers duels against each other, Lily and Harry both play instruments and reading Muggle fiction, but Friction comes from the fact that Charles allows the adoring fans go to his head or the fact that every time they get mail he gets amazing and rare gifts from his fans and admirers and Harry gets nothing.

James and Lily have to work and that means that which ever is home at the time have to pay attention to security risk to protect Charlie and by extention Harry. Charlie gets tickets to the Appleby Arrows Game his favorite team, the family goes and Charlie is happy, later that month James comes home with tickets for the Puddlemere United game his and Harry's favorite team, but oh no Charlie's security protocol is upgraded due to a threat, looks like They can't go to the game, but hey they can listen to it on the wireless together right? Charles chooses that time to go practice flying and James needs to be there to guard him. Harry and Charlie get to study certain subjects early Lily teaches what she can and what she deems exceptable, Charles is dead set on learning jinxes and other fighting spells, while Harry is more well rounded which means Lily is forced to leave Harry alone to study in order to keep Charlie from cutting his leg off and it getting out that they abuse the Boy Who Lived.

You get small glimpse into what life would of been if Voldemort hadn't attacked Canon Harry that night when he gets that time alone with his parents but its also juxtaposed against the over selfish and self absorbed Charles who by having a twin who isn't as lauded feels he is extra special, there is one person in the world who is JUST like him and Charlie 'knows' he is better that him.
