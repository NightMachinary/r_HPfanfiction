I absolutely can't tolerate bashing Molly Weasley, because it is almost akin to bashing our own parents. She is such a warm-hearted, kind and generous soul and I don't think she has a single evil bone in her body. But it's a common enough trend in Harmony or Dramione fics to turn her into sort of a conniving bitch, desperate to see Hermione marry Ron and take over the reins of managing the Weasley household. I, on the other hand, think she is the kind of person who, if she found out that Hermione broke off her marriage with Ron to be with Harry, would still love each member of the golden trio equally.

I don't know about others, but that moment in HBP where she gave her dear brother's slightly broken watch to Harry on his seventeenth, legitimately choked me up!
