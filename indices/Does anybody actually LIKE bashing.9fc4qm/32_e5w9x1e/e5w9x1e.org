I suspect I wouldn't like it if the characters I like would be the ones who would be bashed. I do like, however, when another character asks those characters why they did what they did and they have to give their reasons. So then I can understand them better. I wonder whether those authors who bash certain characters would say they actually like them. I'd rather read discussions which analyze various characters, including their flaws, than a bashing fic.
