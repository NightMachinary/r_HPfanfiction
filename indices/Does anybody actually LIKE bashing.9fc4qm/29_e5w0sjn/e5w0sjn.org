A good story that also includes bashing of select characters can be enticing. Many times these characters closely represent or have character traits in common with people we know in real life. For example I prefer Snape/Draco/Ron Bashing, Snape is because of a teacher I knew from a different Highschool than mine, being involved with extracurricular activities that put me in contact with other schools and students outside my own also put me in contact with other teachers, this teacher much like Snape couldn't accept the thought that his students weren't as good as he thought they were, that he was biased or that he saw nothing wrong with blatantly breaking rules to get his kids a upper hand in competition. Draco reminds me of a asshole from school, who would go to any length and any level to get the upper hand, a mediocre student who is touted as smart because of who (Draco) or what (My classmate) they are. Ron reminds me of a family member, the slovenly attitude (even worst that normal Teen Boys at the time I read the books), his eating habits and manners, his flaky attitude to promises or plans.

Bashing these characters is cathartic and when blended into the story well and effectively, like Ron doesn't go and become Death Eater evil but is a drain on fun or unintentionally ruins things, Draco while not becoming a new Death Eater big bad, although that is occasionally fun, does become the thorn in Harry's side not dueling Harry every week and raping his friends but rather ruins the best times Harry has by getting him booted from the Quidditch team, getting Harry detention and then in turn being smacked down even harder each time eventually being booted from the game neutered and without praise. Have Draco be expelled after a long drawn out feud due to him attempting to go out of bounds and failing. Snape is more seeing him Slam his head into the wall in trying to do Harry in and failing, him trying to double cross Dumbledore and failing each time barely hanging on by his nails and trying again.
