I agree that characters should be more complex than they might appear, that's good writing.

I disagree that you necessarily need to hint at it or show it, that's a stylistic choice and up to the story you're trying to tell.

I definitely disagree that bashing is never so complex. Bad bashing isn't complex, or at least the author never models it as complex behind the scenes (whether they show that is up to them). But bashing is what people call bashing. And people call bashing even when the character is redeemable and consistent. Take HPMOR, people called that Ron bashing despite the fact that he was in all of, like, five scenes. But of those scenes only one of them was in a good light. The rest of them he came across as a jock (consistent with canon) or an eleven year old (consistent).

By your definition this isn't bashing. But I'm old and weary and don't want to battle the constant semantic landslide. If people call something bashing then I'll just go with how they use it.
