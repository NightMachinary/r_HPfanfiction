The problem with bashing is that it is never so complex as to just shine a light on their negative characteristics-that's not actually bashing in my opinon. Bashing takes every scene, every characteristic and turns it into a negative. Bashing is evil Dumbledore, Abusive/Death Eater Ron, Love potion dosing Ginny.

So you can have a character interact with a canon character and view them negatively-I have seen this done really well in many stories-that's not bashing. Bashing is when they are irredeemable or it's not consistent with their character and their purely to bash (having Hermione actually having cheated all along or something is bashing).

Canon hints at Draco being a coward not evil. You can have a character viewed negatively, but still make the situation more complex than it might appear.
