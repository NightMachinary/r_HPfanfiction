Bashing is what a result of when you give your story voice and personality... and take it to far. Of course, how much is too far is a matter of taste. I'm more permissive than most, so stories I like for their voice, others hate for their bashing.

Edit: Ok, having read the thread it's clear that my views are much more pro-bashing than most of y'all.

Bashing isn't about purposefully misrepresenting characters. Some people on this thread have said it is, but it isn't. People say a story bashes if the story consistently casts that character in a negative light, especially if canon didn't. People say a story bashes even if the character's characterization is completely consistent with canon.

Sometimes it's important to cast a character in a negative light. If your view point character hates jocks, then they will probably hate ron. If they hate condescension, hermoine. If they hate manipulation, dumbledore. And if they hate those people then it's a good chance that all their interactions with them will be negative. Canon does this for the first five books with Draco Malfoy. For all we know Draco likes butterflies and is a kind and dependable friend. Of course we never see that because why the hell would we?

And doing this is perfectly fine. Was canon bad because Draco was only shown as a cowardly, racist bastard? No! Sometimes bashing is important. There are tons of stories I can think of where this happens, and the world is a better place for them. It's important not to constrain the space of stories you can make just because certain characters are beloved by the fandom. Sometimes bashing is the right choice for the story. (I'd also argue that it's important to be able to characterize differently than canon, but that's a whole 'nother screed)

Ultimately, the biggest problem with bashing is that it's correlated with bad writing. Not because it makes for bad writing, but because fanfiction in general is correlated with bad writing. For many writers, fanfiction is their first work. So they characterize poorly, and their world is unrealistic. Antigonists receive a good chunk of the narrative and thus a good chunk of the bad decisions. Some people see this and call it bashing and say that it caused all the bad decisions. They're wrong.

Edit Edit:

Tying it back to my original comment, casting people in a negative light is a part of giving your story voice. Voice is taking the world that JKR and to some extent, the fanfiction writer, created and putting a spin on it. To paint the dull atoms and matter with shades of brilliant white and grungy black and good and bad and everything in between. Imagine a story without that. You get the silmarillion, except even the silmarillion didn't completely leave that out. And sometimes, the voice will paint ron bad and draco good and that's ok. The voice doesn't represent some sort of omniscient judging deity. I, for one, don't mandate all my fiction be about the exact same system of morality I have.
