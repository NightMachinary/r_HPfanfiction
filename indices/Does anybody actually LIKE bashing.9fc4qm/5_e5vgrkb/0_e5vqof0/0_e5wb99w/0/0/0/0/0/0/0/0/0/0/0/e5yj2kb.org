This happens after they rescue Harry. And logically she should have reported this, but then the question is whether she knows anything about muggle law. I believe when the child is born his birth is registered and so he becomes the citizen of that country. I doubt that Molly's family, as a family of purebloods, does this because according to the statute of secrecy they are supposed to be hidden from the muggle world. Since the muggle authorities don't know about the existance of the Weasleys or the Potters, do muggle laws apply to them? JK didn't say anything about it,so we don't know. So Molly can only know about the wizarding law, she doesn't seem to know that things such as social security or laws against child abuse exist. Arthur knows very little about muggles too, so he can't help much. If we use this logic everywhere, Cinderella's stepmother should be punished for restricting her stepdaughter's freedom. I've analyzed many books, but we never were asked to apply the British law in our analysis. That's strange.
