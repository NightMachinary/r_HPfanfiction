But what they say about Moly are minor points. Moly and Sirius were having an argument at the time and people say all sorts of things when they are angry. It doesn't mean Moly can't be a mother figure. As for Moly not rescuing Harry, she didn't promise to do that, she only said she was planning to. I see no harm in this. Moly cared for Harry when he was staying in her house, he was one of those peEople whom she saw dead when she faced her Boggart. Those arguments they give seem strange to me.
