Oh yeah, the woman who needs her underage twins to rescue a boy from being starved and locked behind bars. And then berates them for doing it.

Yeeeeap. Totally seeing it.

Apparently she's also such a great duelist that she can defeat Bellatrix LeStrange, but she rather sits at home baking cakes, watching on as her son, Hermione and Harry do all the fighting against Death Eaters. Molly is all talk.
