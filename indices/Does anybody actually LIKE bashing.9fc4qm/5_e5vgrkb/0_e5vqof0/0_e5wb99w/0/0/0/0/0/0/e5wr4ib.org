Add the time she decided to blame Sirius for getting illegally thrown into prison right in front of Harry.

Or the fact that she says that she was worried about Harry (when he first was at the Burrow) to the point where she was considering taking him away from there, but then never did something (sending food to a child who is being starved is a crime, not helping him). Do you have any idea how much that kind of broken word would fuck up an abused child IRL?
