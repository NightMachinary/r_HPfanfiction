It's all very nice but you aren't going to get anything logical by judging a children's book series using real law as a basis for it. But that's your choice. Moly only considered taking Harry away because he hadn't answered Ron's letters, not because she knew/suspected abuse. She knew there was something going on, but you can't say she knew Harry was abused. And as I've said, there was no direct promise. It would have been far worse if she had promised to take him away but hadn't done that. And she isn't his foster parent, it's the Dursleys who are responsible for this. Those complaints are from foster children who had legal guardians, so I think it's quite different.
