She had reason for concern and, for at least two weeks, was responsible for Harry (which meant that she had the legal duty to report any signs of abuse, which were clearly there since she considered rescuing him). She glossed over several instances of abuse when mentioned by her sons.

She told Harry that she cared but then actually never did so (like I said earlier, sending him food was accomplice to child abuse, not some grand act of rescue). Even if she never formulated a clear promise, she claimed that she cared but then did very little. Admittedly, the presents were a nice touch, but a good deed does not wash away a bad one.

There was a recent [[/r/AskReddit]] thread about foster parents, and one of the most lamented things from the foster children were empty words. People who were promised care but then were sent back to the system after a couple of months. I am not just pulling at straws to find some base for disliking a character, my points have a backing in reality.

  You seem to dislike every character who, in your view, has wronged Harry in one way or another.

The series is called Harry Potter, so the two best ways to judge a character is either a completely neutral view using the law (which, outside of purely magical areas like Hogwarts or Diagon, is the British legal code and international standards like the universal human rights or the Geneva and Hague converntions) or how they treated the main character since he is the most detailed narrator, even if obviously biased or not accurate (for example when it comes to female emotions).

Yet I am not wrong. Dumbledore's "ten dark years" were an honest-to-god confession, any Death Eater is guilty of war crimes, Snape's obsession with a woman long dead was more than just a little creepy and Molly, however you want to judge her parenting (there are some theories about why her sons all flee home as soon as they graduate; once is a coincidence, but 5 times?), was not a good person to Harry. She openly insulted his last real family member in fron of Harry. She never really followed up on her words. That is enough for me to judge her (and that's not even taking her treatment of Fleur into account).
