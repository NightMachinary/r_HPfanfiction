Nah, it isn't just because of that. Harry deserves a lot of slack for his shortcomings, because he's constantly faced with life threatening situations and has an insane mass murderer after him. How goes the saying? "It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you."

To be honest it would be completely ridiculous if among all the shit that happens to Harry in canon he'd also be a really insightful person with a flourishing social life who is always available for help and advise. That's how fanfics with completely shitty Garry Stu MCs come about.

IMHO a decent Harry bashing story could only occur post Hogwarts.
