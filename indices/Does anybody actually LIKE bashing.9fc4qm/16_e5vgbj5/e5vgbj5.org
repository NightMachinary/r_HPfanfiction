Bashing is a symptom of lazy writing. If an author who does not care for a particular character is still thinking deeply about logical characterization, story influences on their personalities, and other factors that contribute to plot development, most less-than-favorable outlooks don't even qualify as what we know as bashing even if the intent is to critically undermine a character or set of characters from the start. If it can be called 'bashing', it's probably just a sore, outspoken author with Lots of Opinions. Some people like this blunt, overt slamming. These people and these authors are made for each other.

Also, just like the word 'slash', when someone reads 'bashing' it is assumed this is the main focus of a story even when it's not. That speaks more to the overall quality of writers in this niche than to the niche itself. There should be a term for good bashing to set it apart. I like reading critical character analyses, though calling it that every time I want to reference what I like would get tiresome after a while.

Anyway, I don't look for bashing, but for certain characters (Hermione and Remus, even though I like them well enough aha) it is interesting to me when I find it. Vitriol in narrative form can be a hoot to skim.
