I used to...and everytime I see one I cringe becasue I now know that 9 out of 10 bash fics are based on character hate for the sake of hate. It also made me realize that vast majority of ff readers just love bashing. I can count only a few writers who can criticize characters without bashing, like Lomonaaeren.
