After a thousand Mary Sue's I like a little bit of bashing. OK I like a lot of bashing. Like Ron bashing and Dumbledore bashing. When done correctly Weasley bashing is very satisfying. Making them exactly what Malfoy described them to be is not the right way though. I like it when they are opportunistic to a fault rather than overtly greedy.
