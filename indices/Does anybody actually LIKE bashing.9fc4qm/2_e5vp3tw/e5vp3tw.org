I've only found bashing appropriate in a crack fic. Any serious writing, I've never been able to see it worked well.

I must caveat though, I've seen characters written in a way that they become bad people, they are criticized, go through hard times, “bashed” for lack of a better word. But it's actually developed in the story, there are events that organically lead to that development. To me, “bashing” is inherently bad writing because I think of bashing as ridiculing and ruining a character without proper development. If it's done with good writing, it's no longer bashing, it's just diverting from canon.
