Sure. I love it. A well written harridan!Molly who huffes and puffes and throws pans at the wall while calling someone a scarlet woman, while also presuming to be Harry's adoptive mother and constantly overstepping her bounds is a guilty pleasure of mine. Dumbledore can be similarly entertaining.

I think it really depends what someone wants out of fanfiction. Some people exclusively want well written and imaginative stories with their favorite characters. I enjoy those too. But I can also dig a bit of breaking of the 4th wall and mockery. I like fics that solely exist to explore the ridiculousness of Ron/Hermione and bring that to its most absurd conclusions.
