Well... I can't quite say that I /like/ bashing, but I usually don't mind bashing much. Fics that are pure bashing ("Ron's Hogwarts" is the only one that comes to mind atm) are at best mildly amusing, but bashing does not detract much from the rest of the story for me. edit: Actually, come to think of it, there were a few bits of bashing in "Chunin Exam Day" that were awesomely hilarious, though there was a lot of things wrong with that fic too. But it's very rare for bashing to be awesome.

And some bashing arises from some reinterpretation of some aspect of canon or fanon that I think is... more valid in some ways than the original. In which case, even if the bashing doesn't directly contribute to the story quality, I might still appreciate it in a kind of "Yeah! You tell them!" agreement kind of way. Like, in the Naruto fic "Destiny Is A Hazy Thing" linkffn(7421841), it's not the main focus but each chapter reinterprets a different minor aspect of canon (like, say, Lee's determination to keep fighting Gaara in the exam) in a manner that bashes some of the characters involved, as a kind of deconstruction. And I often appreciated the reinterpretations and thus the bashing. Actually, come to think of it, I think all deconstructions are kind of inherently bashing, even if the better ones are usually quite subtle about it.
