  Some people just want to read pages and pages of their ship doing domestic nice things together.

I want to read hundreds of pages about Harry and Hermione being domestic together, but there are pretty much just two oneshots (Definitions of romance, home making dilemma) which got that covered. Sadly, it's rather difficult to find something without extended families which required a whiteboard to keep track of or some absurd bashing.
