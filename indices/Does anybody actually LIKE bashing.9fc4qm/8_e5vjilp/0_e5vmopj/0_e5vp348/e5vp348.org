I remember some longer story where Hermione had Harry move in with her parents, and convinced him to take up jogging (?) and it was just a sweet story. But Ron would come over once in a while, and act like a buffoon who was too dimwitted to understand their quips. I gave up on that one and I'm still bitter about it.
