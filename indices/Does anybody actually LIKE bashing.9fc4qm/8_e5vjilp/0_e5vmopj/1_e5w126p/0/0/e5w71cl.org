So, the original fic is linkffn (12116819) and its sequel is linkffn (12662484). And on checking the author's profile, it seems that there is a third fic in the same universe (which I haven't read) - linkffn (12642263).

And the Hapne fic that I talked about was not actually Amalgamation Agreement but linkffn (11697407) and its sequels, linkffn (12381694) and linkffn (11185533).

Edit - fic IDs since the bot doesn't seem to work with the story titles
