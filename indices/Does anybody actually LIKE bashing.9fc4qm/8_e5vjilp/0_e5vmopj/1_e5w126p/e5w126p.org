There's this Percy Jackson fanfic writer who created a nice fluffy romantic fanfic between two characters who had probably never been seen from that angle before. And then that writer followed up with a sequel with each chapter being a one-shot describing various everyday moments in the pair's life. This format ensures that the writer is under far less pressure and can update the fic after long delays without the headache of annoyed readers. And the readers get the opportunity to revisit characters they like and see what they are doing after x number of years.

I wish someone did that with HP fanfics. The one that came closest was a Hapne fic - Amalgamation Agreement I think it was.
