It's fantasy fulfillment. I dont' consider it quality, but, some people don't read fan fic for quality.

Some people just want to read pages and pages of their ship doing domestic nice things together. Some people just want to read about healing, so they have lots of pages about graphic abuse that leads to rescue and healing. Some people like to hear bad things about characters they don't like, so they read fics allll about that.

I can't /stand/ bashing and won't read it, but I get why it's a thing.
