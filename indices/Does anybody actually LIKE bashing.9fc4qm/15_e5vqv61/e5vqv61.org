I love it. It's hysterical when Dumbledore suddenly goes off on a tangent about forcing students fall in love with each other via alchemy as part of a decades long eugenics plan or when Hermione starts ranting about how the Ministry's marriage law is the only way forwards post-war because it's the law and she's /always/ followed that or when it turns out that Ron and Hermione have both been paid spies for some unnamed reason and everything was a lie because clearly Harry needed to be kept away from those spooky slytherins who aren't actually that bad because it's the filthy mudbloods spreading lies about the glorious superiority of pureblooded bludlines and now Harry has the sharingan.
