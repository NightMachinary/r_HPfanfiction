I can't stand Dumbeldore/Ron/Ginny/etc. bashing, I find it unpalatable. I don't really see the point in it, I have read stories that portray character's flaws/in a less than good light, but in those stories they show both sides and it's interesting. Bashing stories are frustarting to read because of how they purposely misrepresent the characters.
