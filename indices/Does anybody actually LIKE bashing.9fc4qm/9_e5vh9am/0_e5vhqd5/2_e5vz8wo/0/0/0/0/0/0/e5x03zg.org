Sine he is happy after his son is born, saying he was against having children in general is not true. He avoided her all year, but Tonks was determined to have this relationship. She chose to marry him, no one forced her. You can't blame one person for something that is usually decided by two people.They've been married for a month when this happened, he was gone for a few days, they worked things out. It's far more difficult when things like infidelity happen after people have been married for 20 years. Their main mistake was to marry so quickly, and then the pregnancy just complicated things. If Tonks had not forgiven him, she would have looked like a 15 year-old teenager who doesn't really know what she wants, because as I've said, she wanted this relationship. Then something happens and she says,"no, I don't want this after all".
