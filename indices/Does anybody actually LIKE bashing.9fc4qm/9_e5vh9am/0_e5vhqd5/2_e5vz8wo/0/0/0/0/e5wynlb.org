We had this argument before, but I don't think you would be happy if he had left her when he knocked her up even though they weren't married (from your comment I get the impression you are criticising him for leaving her when they were married). I don't know how long it's been since you've read DH, but JK puts sevral clues that let the readers see that pregnancy was the culmination of a bad situation. First Tonks and Remus leave Harry's birthday party because Tonks says' the ministry is pretty anti-werewolf at the moment'. We don't know what consequences this had for them, but if they can't even stay because their presense 'would not do Hary any favours', I bet it's not all that nice. Later Tonks tells that Bellatrix tried 'very hard to kill me'. Remus can put two and two together, and knows it's likely because of [[https://him.So][him.So]] as I've said, the pregnancy is just a final straw. You don't like Remus, but try reading that scene and notice the way he behaves-he is even described as 'looking quite'derranged'.This is not simply a reaction to a pregnancy. No man looks like that just for this reason. Besides, it's only your headcanon that Tonks was all responsible and so on. Maybe one of them made a mistake. I definitely don't intend to argue, I'm just pointing out certain things.E
