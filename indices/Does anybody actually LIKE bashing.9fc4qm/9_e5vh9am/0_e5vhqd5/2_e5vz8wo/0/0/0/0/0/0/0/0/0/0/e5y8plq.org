I've argued with him before and now I realize it's kind of pointless. I mean, we don't even know what kind of vow wizards give,maybe they don't even have all this 'for better for worse', so then he didn't even break any promisses,lol. There's something about honour in those vows, I think, so he says something nasty to her, then she says," you broke a marriage vow, I want a divorce". What kind of person you would have to be to give up something you fought so hard to obtain? As Tonks said in one fic, if she had wanted him away, he would have given her exactly what she wanted, and she isn't going to punish him by telling him to stay away when she wants him to be with her. Like you, I've never heard such a strange argument before. I think the problem is that this person doesn't like Lupin, so no matter what we say, he will disagree. Even psychologists say that you have to work through your problems, and divorce seems just like an easy way out.It just seems strange that apparently if they hadn't been married, she became pregnant, and he got scared, this wouldn't be such a big problem. I didn't know marriage vows change so much according to this logic.Weird.
