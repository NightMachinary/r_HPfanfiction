Kids should be discussed before marriage, if you are not on the same page, don't get married. If you can't handle the responsibility, don't get married.

Nowadays, people marry out of love (and I am pretty sure Tonks didn't marry Lupin to strengthen her alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Crown). Marriage is basically a declaration that you care for a person and want to spend the rest of your life with them (and raise children together if you want them). Or that you want tax benefits, but that's a different story.

If he felt like throwing a pity party due to his disease or even committing suicide, fine, I don't care. But he shouldn't drag other people down with him. Because if you use "He ran because he cared for her" as the excuse, he is still a dick since he never should have married Tonks in the first place because he was just doing her a disservice.

Or you say that the marriage was not a mistake, in which case Lupin was a dick for running.

Rowling could have even made them a good example of parents who didn't work out together and still both care for their children, but that would require admitting that the marriage was a mistake (well, and not killing them off).
