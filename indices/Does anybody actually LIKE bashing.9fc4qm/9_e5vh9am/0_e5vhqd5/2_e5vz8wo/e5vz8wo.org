Totally this. You can honestly show pretty much any character in a negative light while staying close to canon. Ex. Lupin, although he's a generally good guy, tries to abandon people when the going gets tough (also never contacted his best friend's abused and orphaned son (which seriously bothers me. Reading through it I always felt like Lupin was on the cold side)).
