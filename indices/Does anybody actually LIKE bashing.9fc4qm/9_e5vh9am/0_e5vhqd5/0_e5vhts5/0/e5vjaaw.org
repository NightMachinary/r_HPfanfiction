I don't like Ron, I'm the first to admit to that. I simply think that he is a boring character, and the less involvement he has, the better (unless you write him like in "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!").

BUT

I really don't get the hype about bashing him. The bloke had issues which could end his friendship with Harry under certain circumstances, but there's a difference between them just not being friends anymore without much drama and those stupid "Death Eater Ron"/"Wife beater Ron" or "Rape Drug user Ron" stories you see everywhere.
