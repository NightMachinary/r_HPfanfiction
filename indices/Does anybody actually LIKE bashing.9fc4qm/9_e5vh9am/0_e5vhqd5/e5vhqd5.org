  how they purposely misrepresent the characters

Funny thing is, there are countless scenes for which you could actually bash characters for since whatever else they do, that one scene made any positive quality of them irrelevant. Like Dumbledore admitting to 10 dark years, Pomfrey not spotting clear signs of child abuse (and at least in books 1 and 2 it was obvious) or Molly victim-blaming Sirius for being unlawfully locked-up in hell on earth for a decade.
