The Brightest Witch of Her Age by chocolateberrycake. It's a Charlie/Hermione story where the latter is a Veela. I have to say that it has some of the worst grammar and spelling I've ever seen (the author spelled "legs" as "leggs" in Chapter 1; that's in close proximity to "chrystal", "headmester", and "Mya" acting as a nickname for Hermione). However, it's a fun read and as another user said, a "guilty pleasure".
