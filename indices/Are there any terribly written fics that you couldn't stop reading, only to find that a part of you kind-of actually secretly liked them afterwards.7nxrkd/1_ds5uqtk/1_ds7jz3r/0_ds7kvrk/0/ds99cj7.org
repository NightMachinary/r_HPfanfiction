It to this day remains the fic I'm most sad got abandoned. It has some of the coolest AU world elements I've seen to this date (at least that was handled the best). The dragon fight and outcome was such a great read and its such a shame that it stopped where it did cause it seemed like the real meat of the story was about to start.
