No bashing. If you can't make your main characters likeable without shitting on another character, then your plot isn't believable. That's honestly the most egregious HP fanfiction sin I see.

Don't rush things. If you are writing primarily a romance, understand that 90% of the drama comes before they get together. Draw it out, make your characters grow to love each other and allow your readers to want them to get together.

Same rule for action stories - if your story is about fightint, and your protagonist is bulldozing opponents from Chapter 1, what's the point of reading? Where's the conflict

Remember that how you see your characters is not how your audience will see them. I love OP!Harry stories, but in a lot of them he throws his weight around and acts like a total dick, to the point i can't even root for him. Ask yourself "if someone in real life was acting this way, how would i react?"

That's the best I've got.
