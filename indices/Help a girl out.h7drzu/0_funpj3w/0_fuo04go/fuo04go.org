In addition to this excellent post, make sure to do your research to make sure you're not accidentally making continuity mistakes. If you're going the AU route, make sure the altered elements are clear to the audience.

And a general tip for any story -- proofread, proofread, and proofread again. A story can have an amazing plot and development, but be seriously hurt by errors, especially when there are a lot. Get a beta if needed.

Good luck, and have fun!
