I've only read Face Death in the Hope (and you can be sure I'll start reading the other one right about now, if it's as good as the first). I'm not sure exactly what the fics have in common, but if you want well-written time travel with a good characterization then I can think of\\
linkao3(In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud)

And although the style might be different, I wrote a story about unusual time travel that maybe would fall into what you're looking for? (self-rec) linkao3(Unfogging the Future by Naidhe)

Then maybe you'd enjoy linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow) and other stories by the same author
