Hopefully, The Second String lives up to your taste!

Thank you so much for the recommendations! I finished Unfogging the Future and LOVED it. Lavender Fics that are well written are hard to come by but you nailed it. Any chances on that sequel from Tom's view?!?

I'll check out the others, thank you!!!
