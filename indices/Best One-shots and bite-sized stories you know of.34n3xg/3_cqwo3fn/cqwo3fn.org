Here you go. These are mostly funny:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/][/Secure Containment of Prophecy: Case Number 368 (SCP-368)/ by AngrySlytherine]]: A post-Hogwarts / SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) crossover. A lost prophecy is recovered after the fact. Undersecretary Hermione Granger is not happy. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774443/1/][/Time on my Side/ by Mark Geoffrey Norrish]]: To prevent a pair of werewolf infections on the night of Pettigrew's escape, Harry and Hermione decide to turn their stable time loop into a time corkscrew.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/554931/][/Harmless and Easily Domesticated/ by Angie Astravic]]: Hagrid has been forbidden to teach any creature of higher classification than XX: harmless, may be domesticated. So nothing can possibly go wrong in his classes now - right? Augureys and Clabberts and Bowtruckles, oh my, not to mention Redneck Wizards.

Note: The above fic is pre-HBP, but it has aged very well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118202/1/][/In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life/ by SilverWolf7007]]: Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10748912/][/House, DADA/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]: Dr. Gregory House, Head of the St. Mungo's Department of Diagnostic Magic, was hired as a teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts: '92-'93 school year. After months of pain, terror, and attacks on students -- and also Slytherin's monster -- Dumbledore finally decides he needs to deal with the situation before Minnie finds that Castration Curse in the library.
