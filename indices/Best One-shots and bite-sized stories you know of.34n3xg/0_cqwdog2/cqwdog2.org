#+begin_quote
  Colin Creevey leaves his camera with a muggle girl but never returns to collect it.
#+end_quote

/Albeit brief, it's sure to make an impression. It's able to be sweet without being overly saccharine. Pretty much a must read, in the way that most of the people on here have read it./

  "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.
#+end_quote

/After seeing this on the subreddit a couple times, I finally read Cauterize. While it's not the best piece of fanfiction I've read based on a recommendation, it's still able to be equal parts nostalgic and sad without being soppy or overly sentimental./

#+begin_quote
  The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault.
#+end_quote

/Snape's ghost haunts the Potter's. Rather funny./

  It always rains for Draco Malfoy. Metaphorically. And literally. Ever since he had accidentally Conjured a cloud. A cloud that's ever so cross.
#+end_quote

/Even an ardent hater of slash might be suprised by this fic. The prose is interesting, and the execution of the plot solid. It's worth a shot if you're new to slash./

#+begin_quote
  James Jr wants a summer job; his Mum suggests he help out Uncle Perce.
#+end_quote

/An interesting coming-of-age story, realistically showing the ups and downs of having a family./

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, don't be such a killjoy. Come on, just tell me. If you could die in a way of your own choosing, how do you want to do it? I'd like to die by a lake. At sunrise. In the winter, I think. Yes, in the winter, with two feet of snow all around me, and my fading breath clouding the air."
#+end_quote

/I'll start off by saying that this could be considered a tearjerker--it's dark and sad--I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][Playmate]] was sad; The Spring Turnover is far worse. The prose is lovely, and it manages to capture the symbolism represented in this fanfic. Told through the eyes of an unreliable narrator, it's confusing, but all too realistic in the end./
