Yes! I love this idea!

I also think it would lead to a bit of a stigma about casting the spell because there's always the risk of it being socially awkward. Like, there's all sorts of situations where you'd want to quickly know if there's a person hiding nearby, but pureblooded wizards and witches are reluctant to actually cast /Homenum Revelio/. It would be a logical and interesting area for a social taboo to be found.

Imagine this scene:

/Deathly Hallows/

The trio is entering Number 12 for the first time.

"I wonder if anyone else is here," said Harry.

"Just cast /Homenum Revelio/, Harry," said Hermione.

Ron winced and fidgeted a bit.

"Well, I guess you could do that, but, you know..." he said.

"What do I know?" Hermione asked.

"Well, it might make things a bit awkward..."

"How could it /possibly/ make this situation awkward?" Hermione demanded. "What would make things awkward would be if there's a Death Eater hiding in the kitchen!"

"Blimey! Calm down, Hermione! What I meant was, what if you're, you know, /in the family way/?"

"Ronald Bilius Weasley! I can't believe you!"

Etc.
