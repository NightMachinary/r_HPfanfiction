Something to keep in mind, there's basically a genre of British children's literature that revolves around stories set in eccentric or somewhat special boarding schools. The St Trinians movies in the mid 2000s are some of the latest cinematic adaptations of this genre that J K Rowling no doubt had read and internalized during her formative years (Malory Towers, St Trinians, etc).

I think a mistake in Rowling's worldbuilding was to label Hogwarts as the ONLY school in Great Britain. So many things could be explained away if there were other schools in the same country.
