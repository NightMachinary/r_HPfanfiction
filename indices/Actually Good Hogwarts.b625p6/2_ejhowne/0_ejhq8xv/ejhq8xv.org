Just did some looking, according to Rowling, there's approximately 1000 students at Hogwarts, she was later asked again and she settled on 600, that's been pretty consistent regarding the movies and everything she's said after. So assuming there is 600 students at Hogwarts, but only technically 11 actual teachers, 12 at one point but I don't think Firenze really counts in that aspect, the student to teacher ratio is absolutely shocking. You have 6 teachers teaching 600 students from ages 11 - 15+ depending on their OWL's, and 5 teachers teaching across a range of 600 students from 13+ depending on their electives. It's horribly thought out. For her having set 6 books in this school, she hasn't put much thought into how it's run.
