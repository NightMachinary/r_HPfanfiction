True, but things like this don't exist with out some kind of basis. For the entirety of the Wizarding community to be shown as primarily ignorant of the muggle community, or those not so ignorant thinking it's basically the 1800's out of Diagon Alley, it's easy to assume they were taught that.

In my opinion, muggle studies should replace astronomy as a core subject. Or even become one. They only have 6 core subjects, it's not hard to make that 7. You can easily fit 7 subjects into their schedule. Feel like it couldn't even just be the first two years, and it becomes an elective after that, so at least they all have some form of understanding ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
