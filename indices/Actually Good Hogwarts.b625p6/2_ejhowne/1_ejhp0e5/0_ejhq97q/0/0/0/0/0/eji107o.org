  it's easy to assume they were taught that.

That's not exactly true. I imagine Muggle Studies is like French/Spanish class but without language and more culture. How many people do you think is fluent with those languages by only taking classes at highschool? Some of my friends that are fluent is only because they have an additional interest in the language/culture, have a family member that is fluent, or just a nerd.

Even more so that Muggle Studies is an additional subject. Those that taken it will be viewed mostly as 'the weird kid that took Muggle Studies because they're a Muggle nerd' or 'the kid that took Muggle Studies because it's easier than Runes/Arithmancy'.
