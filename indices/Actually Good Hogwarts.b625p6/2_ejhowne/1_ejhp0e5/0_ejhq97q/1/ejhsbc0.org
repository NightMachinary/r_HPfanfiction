First of all, it's definitely implied more than once, and regardless of best or not, if it is the only one, which according to Pottermore it is, it's shit. It's absolutely garbage. It's honestly a horrible school. If you stop focusing on the fact that it teaches magic, it's a bad school. She taken no thought into how children learn, apparently hasn't looked at how schools run and yes I understand it's a story, but it's a story set mainly in a school, so therefore, the school should run like a proper school.

Binns is more than boring. Hermione is Hermione and we see how she is all throughout the books. If a teacher is so boring that entire classes can not pay attention, then you need to get a different teacher. Children are there to learn, as a teacher you need to be able to properly engage your students. We see McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout do excellent with this. They know how to interact with their students, they know how to engage with them, they know how to keep their students interested in what they're learning. Honestly, we don't have many other examples. Snape is a terrible teacher and should never have been put in charge of 11 year olds, even up to the age of 14 I don't think he should be teaching. I don't think he should teach at all, but he is a very good potions master and knows what he's talking about, he just doesn't know how to teach that to children. After understanding the basics and learning how to actually make potions, I'm sure he wouldn't have such an issue with older students and they will mainly just be able to brew.

Any bullying is bullying and we see a lot of it in the books. Name calling is bullying. Attempting to harm others with spells is bullying. Being blatantly racist or the magical equivalent of that is bullying. There is nothing done to stop any of this. Luna is harassed for years by people in her house and from the rest of the school because she says odd things. Neville is bullied for years for no reason. Hermione is bullied for being a know it all and for being muggle born. These are just examples that Harry sees. These people aren't stopped or reprimanded. There is definitely more bullying going on than this. You see on more than one occasion how quick the school turns on Harry in GoF, that's not a normal thing. They all bully him, they're all hostile. When Hermione, Neville and Harry lose all those points in PS, practically the whole house turns on them, 3 eleven year olds. CoS, basically the whole school turns on Harry and then just as easily forgets the whole thing. It's a very prevalent thing that is never stopped. I know at any school I went to if people started wearing badges insulting another student, regardless of why, they'd have been confiscated and whoever was wearing them, making them and distributing them would have been punished.

I assume there's something wrong with it based on the rest of the Wizarding World, perhaps Charity Burbage actually does a good job of the class for the few years she's there, but considering the likes of Arthur Weasley who you can easily assume took the class, he knows next to nothing about muggles.

And I don't think it has anything to do with cultural differences but rather a lack of effort on Rowling's part.
