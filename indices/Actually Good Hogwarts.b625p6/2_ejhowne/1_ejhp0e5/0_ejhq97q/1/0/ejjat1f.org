Dude, I hate to disappoint you but... sometimes teachers are just shitty ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it happens, have you been to school ever? Schools should be how you say but really, having some shitty teachers is part of the average school experience as far as every single person I know is concerned. Should it be fixed? Yes! Absolutely! Is it unrealistic that the school has shitty teachers? No. Additionally you mention the bullying. That's common too. Some have it better than others, but school, especially in the 80s/90s when the story is happening was super shitty for you if you were a weird kid. You mentioned how having the whole school turn against a kid is nuts and I agree, but you are forgetting Harry is first and foremost a mega celebrity in the wizarding world. Every aspect of his life is under heavy public scrutiny and so reactions to it are far more extreme. At the end of the day, you talk about things about hogwarts that are bad, but not unrealistic. I do agree with you that there's some shoddy world building involved when you think of the math of the whole thing. I also agree that having the slytherin house be the ‚Äúevil‚Äù and consequentially hated house is dumb and lazy. Like if everyone evil comes from slytherin as is implied, you would think the kids there would get some idk extra screening or counseling, or they'd get rid of the house all together but nope! This is just where the evil kids go!
