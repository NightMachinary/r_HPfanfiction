There's a difference between having some shitty teachers and a quarter of the teachers being shitty. There's only 11 classes, 3 of those classes shouldn't have a shitty teacher. Also the bullying that happens in the book would be dramatically reduced if the teachers actually did anything about it.

It's rather they aren't ‘evil' when they get there, but after 7 years of ridicule and being told you're an evil, horrible person for putting a talking hat on your head differently to 3/4 of the school, there's obviously going to be a lot of resentment and this happening year after year, generation after generation, it builds a festering hatred that continuously grows. It doesn't make people like LV, he was already like that, he was already developing to be the man he was, but it definitely helped him. There's people like Malfoy who joined because of his views, but I'd be willing to bet that there was people who joined purely because it felt like it was them against the rest of the world.

Imagine how much better it would be without houses. Obviously you need them for group sports etc etc. but other than that, completely useless and entirely inserted to the extent she did to further the Slytherin vs Gryffindor plot. Obviously there's multiple other ways this could be achieved, but it's a children's book so that would be easiest. “Slytherins are evil, you should hate them.” “Gryffindors are stupid, you should hate them.” 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ Literally the stupid points at the end of PS shows this. Dumbledore literally let the Slytherins think that they'd won, these are children. He then awards a bunch of points just enough to tip the scales, Gryffindor wins, everyone cheers that the evil Slytherins didn't win and the first years are left wondering why the whole school hates them so much considering they are 11 years old and haven't done anything except go to school. Lol.
