1st : Who says Hogwart is the best magical school in canon? I can only remember Hagrid (ex student, member of the staff and almost worship the Headmaster) and maybe some student. None of them having any objectivity on the subject.\\
2nd : It is said that Hogwart is the only magical school in Britain, the other option being homeschooled (as said in book 7), but we have to remember that magical Britain fonctions more like a little town than an actual country. Hogwart's is more like a town school,t aking every students than an elite school on this point, students don't even have to pay tuitions.

3rd: Most of the "problems" you said are exagerated. Harry Potter is a story told by the eyes of one student, Harry. So for example, Binns may be boring, but it is just a boring old teacher who happened to continue after death, interested student (ex Hermione or probably some Ravenclaw) can and do listen during his lessons. Snape may be a discutable teacher, but we do know he was mosly here as a future and actual spy than a teacher, and even there, we know he does hate Harry as a personal level. Without being a perfect teacher for others, he most likely cause less problems. And for the "intense bullying". . . which one? With the exception of some name calling and petty hexes, I don't remember being that unsafe. The only grave situations that come to mind are either extremely rare (like Snape and Lupin) or due to the war and still safer than the outside world (Draco murder tentatives). And for finish Muggle study, how do you know it's out of date? We never saw any lessons of this, we just know Hermione took it and found it extremely easy because she is Muggle raised.

I think most problems you said are either due to "cultural differences" (magical brittain is not Brittain and some things as a ghost teacher is normal for them) or too much fanon reading.
