I think that the HP fandom has been so over-saturated with fanon related to either 'improving' Hogwarts, or circle-jerking over a non-Hogwarts wizarding school (typically Beauxbatons or Durmstrang). I think people have so strongly adopted their headcanon of this utopian, wizarding school that they forget what Hogwarts was canonically like and more impressively, they forget what Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were shown like in GoF.

I'd argue that, yes, Hogwarts truly is the greatest wizarding school in the world. Not just a statement Hagrid made or some other biases, but that it is actually the best wizarding school in canon - objectively so. Think about it like this regarding the Triwizard Tournament in book 4:

- *Cedric was a sixth-year student, whereas Fleur and Krum were seventh-years in their respective schools.* Meaning that Fleur and Krum were a year-older than Cedric, and that makes a big difference. Compare HBP Harry to DH Harry, for example. Hell, compare how much more capable OotP Harry was compared to GoF Harry in just one year.

- Cedric received zero help from Dumbledore or other Hogwarts professors, whereas Fleur and Krum got more direct help from their respective headmasters. Let that sink in: Fleur and Krum, the best their school had to offer, were both believed by their own headmasters too incapable of getting past a dragon for the first task. Granted, Harry told Cedric about the dragons and Crouch Jr was helping Harry the entire tournament, but that simply evened the playing field for everyone. *With the advantage gained from Karkaroff's and Maxime's hints gone, Harry tied with Krum for first place despite Karkaroff being an incredibly biased judge in-universe against Harry. Cedric came in second place, meaning that he outperformed Fleur despite being her getting more help and being a year older than him.*

- *Fleur performed pretty terribly on the second task, failing to overcome a Grindylow... something that Harry was taught in his THIRD YEAR by Lupin.* If Hogwarts had a decent DADA professor for Harry first or second year, Grindylows likely would have been taught in first or second year. I know Crouch Jr massively helped Harry, but he wasn't helping Cedric nor Krum. If Hogwarts' DADA curriculum is really that bad compared to other wizarding schools, then why did Fleur, a seventh-year, do so poorly? *Meaning that Fleur, in her final year at Beauxbatons, can't handle third-year creatures like Grindylows when she's meant to be the best in her school. Let me remind you guys that Fleur came in last-place in both the first and second tasks, even though Cedric, the Hogwarts champion, was a full year younger than her and had zero help from his headmaster.*

- Speaking of headmasters, just look at Karkaroff and Maxime compared to Dumbledore. I'm not saying those two should have been on Dumbledore's level, but you'd think that the headmaster of Durmstrang would be much more talented than McGonagall or Snape. *Karkaroff, as talented a Death Eater as he is implied to be, despite being the headmaster of a prestigious wizarding school, probably wasn't as magically talented all-around as Snape, let alone McGonagall.* The fact that Karkaroff was not killed by Voldemort at all suggests that whatever his ability, Karkaroff was a very low priority for Voldemort. Given that Voldemort personally killed Amelia Bones, but left a lesser Death Eater or two (i.e. Yaxley, Rowle, Carrow siblings, etc) to kill Karkaroff, implies that Karkaroff wasn't that much better than most Death Eaters. The fact neither Bellatrix nor Snape were ordered to kill Karkaroff just strengthens my view on this.

- Its also rather telling that the only possible foreign Death Eaters that Voldemort actually recruited were Antonin Dolohov and Igor Karkaroff. Given that Voldemort travelled the world for many years, its strange that only two non-British wizards would be deemed worthy of joining him, let alone want to willingly join Voldemort. Even then, Dolohov's background was unknown and Karkaroff is somewhat implied to be a Hogwarts alumni (based on his 'dear old Hogwarts' comment, lack of an notable accent like the foreign students and Maxime, and his familiarity with Snape). So its very likely that Karkaroff was a Hogwarts alumni; Dolohov could go either way, really.

- Karkaroff, while implied to be one of the more talented Death Eaters by hype, was significantly beneath Snape (and by extension, Bellatrix). As for Dolohov, he is easily Voldemort's third-best Death Eater after Snape and Bellatrix, but in the end, he was struggling against Dean and Parvati despite having both Travers and a third Death Eater backing him up. After that, he lost a separate duel to Flitwick who, while skilled, was a /retired/ duelling champion. He was not an active duelling champion, or even someone who would have duelled often like Dolohov, but a rusty wizard who would have been not as good as he was in his prime. Dolohov's best accomplishments in-canon were beating Moody, but Moody was rusty and far past his prime (and it was never even said that Dolohov beat Moody 1v1), and beating Moody (which Pottermore stated that Lupin was a bit rusty, possibly implying that Dolohov might not have won otherwise).

*TL;DR: In canon, Hogwarts really is shown to be the greatest wizarding school. Whatever you think of Hogwarts, its still a better school that the others by miles if Fleur and Krum are deemed equal or slightly worse than Cedric, a Hogwarts student who is an entire year younger than either of them, and had less support in the tournament. The fact that Harry, regardless of what help he got, could even remotely equal or surpass Fleur and Krum despite them being 3-4 years older than Harry and despite getting help from their headmasters (who really should have, by hype alone, outclassed even Moody or Crouch Jr).*
