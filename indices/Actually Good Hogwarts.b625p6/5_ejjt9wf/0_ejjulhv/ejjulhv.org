I'm not even thinking of the other schools, I'm thinking about how mediocre Hogwarts is. If the other schools are worse, well then I guess that's all just saying something about the education in the Wizarding community.

Maybe the don't even change the teachers or whatever, but like, why can't it actually be run like a school? You have the bare minimum traces of any kind of school. Forget the magic part, make the magic into science and English and stuff, muggle school subjects, now think about how the school works, how the teachers work, how the students work, it's just so poorly done. As soon as you add magic it's like none of that matters. Why don't they have sports or any kind of physical education? Like, why don't they have any kind of science based classes? Potions doesn't count and astronomy only says so much about Earth. We don't know much about what's being taught in HoM, but you can look up what Harry actually mentions, there's no modern history, in fact, from what we know the most recent history they learn was from 1911. Do they learn about other magical communities? I would think not since Harry didn't even know there were other schools.

Anyway lost of train of thought lol
