That's par for the course for fictional schools though. Looking at the number of teachers VS the number of students, it's USUAL for fictional schools to seem like they have too few teachers because when it comes to fictional stories you HAVE to limit how many characters are there. Better to have fewer characters and actually give them some personality, than to have ten times as many characters that are just a list of names.

The entire thing is also pretty vague because in the HP stories characters who aren't directly involved in the story tend to be treated as if they aren't there... and if the story doesn't need them they tend to vanish until it does. We know thanks to interviews and everything that there are FIVE Gryffindor girls in Harry's year, and yet we only ever see three of them -- Hermione, Lavender and Parvati.

Which is why it's perfectly possible there are more than thirteen teachers at Hogwarts, it's just that the other teachers aren't mentioned because they don't play any role in the story and aren't important to any scenes. After all, we generally don't hear about a teacher unless s/he is directly involved in the story. We didn't even know there was a Professor Trelawney or Professor Kettleburn until third book, and we didn't know about Charity Burbage until the seventh book.
