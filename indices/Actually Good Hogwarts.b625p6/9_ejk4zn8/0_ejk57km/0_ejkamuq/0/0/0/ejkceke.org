We didn't know about Kettleburn or Trelawney because Harry wasn't taking any electives until that year. We don't hear Charity Burbage's name until DH, but we know the class exists and therefore must have a teacher, as with Runes and Arithmancy, the classes exist so a teacher exists. Hooch does flying lessons, what, once a year? How long for I'm not sure, but it's not long enough to receive more mention from Harry other than one lesson even though it's something he enjoys. She referees games but you don't hear from her otherwise. Filch is a caretaker, Pomfrey is the school nurse. There's more adults at the school, but there's only 11 subjects, and eventually 12 mostly full time teachers. I do not believe there is other classes available than those mentioned.

We only hear about those three yes. Rowling has said herself how she never mentioned them in canon. I don't take this to mean that there is mysteriously more teachers than accounted for and random classes that we never hear of. Even in slight conversations, perhaps an encounter here or there with a random professor to give the impression of a bigger, more active school, instead it's always the same professors we end up interacting with. She had no problem chucking in Charity in DH, yes it's a class we know exists, but how hard is it to add casual dialogue to give us more of a world view? I'll stay with my point that there's few teachers, as that's all she's said ever.
