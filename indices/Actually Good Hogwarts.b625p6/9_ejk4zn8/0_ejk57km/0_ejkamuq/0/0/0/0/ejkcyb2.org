Yes, for story purposes these are the only people and subjects mentioned. In some extra materials like the movies and video games, other subjects and teachers and even students DO appear, though they're not canon to the books.

You sort of have to make some allowances for a story-driven narrative. Some details DO need to be either fudged, ignored or glossed over, or you end up not with a story, but with a long list of details that aren't important and that nobody cares about.

There's no definite answers here, partly because you only get the story from Harry's limited POV and partly because you have to limit characters and subjects unless the story drowns in a lot of extra details.
