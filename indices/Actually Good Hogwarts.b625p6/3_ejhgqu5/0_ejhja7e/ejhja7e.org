I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you probably never went to a school that was widely considered one of the best in world. It's perfectly realistic for a school to have the problems Hogwarts does, yes, but it's perfectly /unrealistic/ for it to maintain a sterling reputation despite that. Its students' grades on standardised texts, ie OWLs and NEWTs, would have to be consistently excellent compared to, say, Durmstrang's students'. There's no indication that this is the case, and there's no way that it could be when three of the required subjects for the first five years have woefully incompetent teachers.

You could argue that Hogwarts' reputation is unearned in universe, but that's really neither here nor there, given the op's actual point.
