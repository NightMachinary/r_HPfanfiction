But moving on as a society doesn't necessarily mean that they were idiotic before. There's obviously lots of other issues that aren't even mentioned. I didn't know shit about writing a proper essay when I was 11, you don't ever hear of them receiving any more information about that either, just that they need to write essays a certain length.
