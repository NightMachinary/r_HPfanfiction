Sry I don't have any recommendations but a quick thought: Hogwarts having bad teachers is rly realistic. Thing about it. Did you ever encounter a school with fair AND competent teachers? Even schools with a good reputation usually have at least one bad teacher. At least that's what we have to deal with in Germany. Credit is never given fairly, Marks are given rly subjectively and bullying is often overlooked by the overworked teachers.

So what you are looking for is a unrealistic utopian fix it au- with all the usual tropes this genre entails (e.g. Annoyingly snarky/smart harry and lots of dumbles bashing)
