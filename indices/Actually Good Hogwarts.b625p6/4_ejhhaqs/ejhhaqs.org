I've been to a few as my family moved around a bit and in the 7 schools I've been in, 3 primary (grades 1-7) and 4 high schools (grades 8-12), I've only encountered a handful of bad teachers, although never were they both incompetent and mean. I've had two mean competent teachers, and a few incompetent teachers at no fault of the curriculum. I mean, I guess Australia has higher standards for education, but every school I went to whether public or private were all better than Hogwarts. There was always ample support from staff. The majority of teachers were helpful. There wasn't a massive divide between students. There wasn't intense bullying. I never had to independently study whole subjects because my teacher couldn't teach. When I got into senior years and could pick electives there were always many choices, rather than 5 other options. Tradesmanships are available in school, rather than additional subjects you could choose to do work experience. There are so many options to help you once you're out of school, options that help you start building foundations in what you want to do, whether it's to do further study, start working, or go into a trade. I just feel like Hogwarts doesn't do shit. You do your OWL's, you do your NEWT's, that's it. Two exams. At one point there's a “what do you want to do and here's what you need for it”, there's no guidance. Hogwarts only offers 11 subjects. It's not some utopian school, it's just a proper school with proper classes and qualified teachers.
