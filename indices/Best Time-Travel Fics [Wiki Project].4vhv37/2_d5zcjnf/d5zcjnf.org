One series I don't think I've ever seen recommended on here is the Dissonant Melody Trilogy, linkao3(3368597) and linkao3(3368927). Due to the way the diverging timelines work, I think they can really be read in either order, though reading the 2000 word prequel, Desperate Overture, first is probably a good idea. linkao3(3313406)

It's been a fair while since they were updated, it looks like the author has fallen off the face of the earth, which is a shame. Everything here is well written and though not paticularly innovative indiviudally, they way that both stories seemed to building towards meeting up was very cool and just makes it more of a shame that they'll probably never be finished. I'd reccomend.
