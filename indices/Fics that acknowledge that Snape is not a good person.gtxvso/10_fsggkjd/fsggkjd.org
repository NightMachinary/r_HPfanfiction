Well, to be fair, he knew that Voldemort wouldn't let Harry survive because of the prophecy. And James defied Voldemort three times (Lily did as well), but he's also a marauder. I can only imagine what he did to Voldemort and his pride. Also, James was Severus's bully; would you have saved your childhood bully who married your crush? So, really, the only person Snape had a hope of saving was Lily, and that was only because Voldemort acknowledged that Snape was loyal and did a good job, so he needed a reward. So, even though Snape was not inherently good or bad, we can't form an opinion of him only based on this.
