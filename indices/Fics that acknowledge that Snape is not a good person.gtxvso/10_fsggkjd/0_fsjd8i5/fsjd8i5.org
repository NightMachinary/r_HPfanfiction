  Well, to be fair, he knew that Voldemort wouldn't let Harry survive because of the prophecy.

I'm so sick of seeing this as a defense for Snape not caring that a literal infant was about to be murdered because of him: Harry being killed was /always/ a part of Snape's plan, he just didn't know that it was Harry specifically whom Voldemort would target. Even then, he wouldn't've cared if that hadn't put Lily in danger, too. Snape was outright confused when Dumbledore called him out on this, because he sincerely did not understand that what he did wrong /wasn't/ inadvertently endangering Lily specifically.

What he did wrong was tell mass murderer who wanted to overthrow the government and replace it with a genocidal autocracy where to find the one person who could stop his rise to power.
