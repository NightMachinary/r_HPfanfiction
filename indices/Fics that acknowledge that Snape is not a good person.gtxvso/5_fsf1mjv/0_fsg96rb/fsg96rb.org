Why? You can't have a character who's selfish and immoral? It's annoying that there's so few fics that actually explore Snape as a canon character and instead just transform him into this paragon of love. I'd love to see a Snape fic that's not revisionist and makes him into a victim, but shows what actually leads him into becoming a selfish magic Nazi.

I hate that stories that try to create a non "black and white" backstory for Snape end up becoming black and white in a different way that's in favor of Snape being the best person ever. The good Snape trope is just that, a trope that lacks depth by revising Snape's backstory until he's everything good in the world.
