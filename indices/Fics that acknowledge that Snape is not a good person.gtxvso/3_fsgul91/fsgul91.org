The Scourge from the North by DogheadThirteen is an excellent read, with a more subtle approach to this trope.

From the first chapter:

  Dumbledore sighed and shook his head slightly.

  “I confess Severus can be difficult,” he said.

  “He's an arsehole, Sir, and it's getting more and more tempting to do something drastic.”

  “Please don't; he's quite useful to me, both on a personal and professional level. I'm sure that as you develop the political base we're both well aware that you're working on, you will find yourself possessed of servants most people strongly dislike, but who are important to your plans... As Severus aptly demonstrates every time he opens his mouth, desirable skills and likeable personality do not inevitably go hand-in-hand.”

  “Teaching isn't one of his skills, Sir.”

  “Indeed. We'll need to do a certain amount of... housekeeping before I'm able to move him to a less people-oriented position; the likes of Lucius Malfoy have a great deal of influence, political and financial, and are a large part of the reason Severus is where he is. They like their spoilt brats having a teacher in their back pocket.”
