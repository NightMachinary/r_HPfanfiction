To be fair to Snape, the last book doesn't focus on hogwarts so anything Snape does to help the students wouldn't be mentioned. He probably did help the students in subtler ways. We also never learn how Dumbledore and the order used his intel, since Harry, the narrator, wasn't allowed to have a major role in the order during the books.

Additionally, his grayness has nothing to do with his usefulness to the light and has everything to do with his willingness to switch sides and help the good side. He still was a crappy person and an abusive teacher, but he is still part of the good side.
