That's a good point since Alan Rickman does play him as more sympathetic in the movies. I think his greatness comes from his role in the order rather than his personality. The good things he does are opposing voldemort and fighting on the light. The bad things he does, like bullying Harry and Neville are what makes him a grey character, since he does some good things but also is petty and hurts his students.
