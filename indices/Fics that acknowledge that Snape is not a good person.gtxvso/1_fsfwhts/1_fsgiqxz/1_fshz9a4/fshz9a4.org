  He still was a crappy person and an abusive teacher, but he is still part of the good side.

People do not become the good guys by attending good guy meetings and being part of the good guy club. They actually fight and put their lives on the line to help defeat Voldemort.

Snape cannot do either of these things. He never fights - which is fine since he's supposed to be a spy, there shouldn't be any chance of the Death Eaters recognising him and blowing his cover - so he's supposed to make up for his lack of fighting with his information.

And yet, the Order are caught flat-footed when Amelia Bones is killed, when Hagrid and Maxime visit the giants, when giants attack multiple muggle villages, when Arhur, Bode and Podmore are attacked in the Ministry. He also has no clue about the mass-breakout from Azkaban in Book 5. And then, he turns around and passes information that directly leads to Emmeline Vance's death, and the Seven Potters' debacle, where Mad-eye Moody is killed (someone like Moody would have been invaluable to everyone had he survived).

If he has no information, then he's useless as a spy, and his worth to the Order is next to zero, right next to Mundungus Fletcher.
