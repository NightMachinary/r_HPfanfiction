Dumbledore: After I am gone, would Voldemort put you in charge of Hogwarts?

Snape: Yes, it is probable.

Dumbledore: Protect the students, Severus.

Snape nods.

Neville (on Hogwarts' new policies) : We're supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who've earned detentions ---

Harry, Hermione, Ron: *What?!!*

Snape's usefulness as a spy is completely negligible. He doesn't have any intel that saves anybody's lives. He can't prevent some of Draco's more bullheaded schemes. He doesn't protect anyone at a school from being target practice. He can't even behave like a spy would - the best spies are the ones you'd least suspect, which is the opposite of Snape.

The only thing he does that's vital is the memory transfer - which is deus ex machina by the author. Those memories could have been transferred in a lot of other different, more fail-safe ways.

The idea that Snape is some sort of "gray" character is absurd.
