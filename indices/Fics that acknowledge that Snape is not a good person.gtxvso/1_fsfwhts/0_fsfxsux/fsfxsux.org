Exactly.

I can't remember a single worthwhile thing Snape did as a spy. Maybe Draco's plan of killing Dumbledore. But even that doesn't work. Because,

1. Dumbledore was dying anyway.
2. Even Harry figured out that Draco was up to something and knew about the unbreakable vow.
3. Snape couldn't do jackshit to prevent Draco's dangerous schemes that led to two innocent students nearly dying.
4. Snape barely did anything to make the battle at Hogawarts at the end of sixth year less damaging.

You can blame plot contrivance. But that only goes so far.
