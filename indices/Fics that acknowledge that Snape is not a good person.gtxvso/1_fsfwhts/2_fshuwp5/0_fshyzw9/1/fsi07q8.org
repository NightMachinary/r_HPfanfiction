Yes, but given enough provocation, they'll still do it. Luna was pureblood and was still kidnapped. Neville had to hide out in the Room of Requirement or face the same thing, and eventually any rebellious students had to join him.

And how much of that reluctance was policy dictated by Snape in the first place, which might not hold up if he were demoted or transferred?
