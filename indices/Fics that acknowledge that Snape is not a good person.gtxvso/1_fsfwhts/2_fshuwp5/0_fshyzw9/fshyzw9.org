  Voldemort intervenes and puts the Carrows in charge of policy. Things get much worse than canon, very quickly. By the time the Golden Trio arrive, there is no rebel army to speak of; they've mostly been killed or abducted.

Not sure if you haven't read the books properly or not, but the Death Eaters take a lot of care not to kill purebloods in Book 7. There are several examples of this -

Ted and Andromeda Tonks' home is attacked by Death Eaters, who know that the real Harry Potter landed there. Remus and Tonks, who is pregnant with a half-werewolf, are unharmed. They were tortured for information, but not killed.

Arthur Weasley, who Voldemort knows is part of the Order, is seen working at the Ministry and being in good health. Same goes for Bill, who they know to be part of the Order.

Xenophilius Lovegood, who openly prints pro-Potter propaganda, is not killed. Luna is kidnapped, but she isn't harmed. I can't imagine any violent regime where people spreading propaganda against the state are allowed to live, but hey, that's the Death Eaters for you, I guess.

Fred and George, who ran U-No-Poo a year before, aren't harmed.

So if the Carrows are put in charge of the school, nothing changes, seeing as they're not killing purebloods or halfbloods, and there are no muggleborns in the school thanks to the Registration Committee. The students were tortured before, they still get tortured, nothing changes.

  Snape quite possibly never manages to deliver the Sword of Gryffindor, nor inform Harry that he's a Horcrux.

The deliverance of the sword is another example of deus ex machina. It could have been done in a lot of other ways. The only reason she did it the way she did is to try and get Snape some time in the spotlight and highlight his "love". And to make things as difficult for the trio as possible.

  Option 3: Snape openly rebels before everything is ready.
#+end_quote

Seeing that Dumbledore tells Snape that Voldemort can't be killed before Harry dies, I can't see Snape doing this.

  There's a very good chance that this actually happened.
#+end_quote

Neville is speaking in present tense, so this didn't happen.

Option 1 would have been most likely had Snape put his foot down. Voldemort made Snape the headmaster, not the Carrows, and he did so because Snape is way higher up the Death Eater pecking order. The Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. Even Voldemort listens to Snape from time to time.
