  & tonks was ultimately murdered by bellatrix.

If you can't understand the difference between getting killed in battle and getting systemically murdered as part of the state's eugenics drive, I'm afriad I cannot help you.

  volde speaks about pruning one's family tree at the beginning of the book
#+end_quote

Yeah, he says this in July 1997. Tonks is killed in May 1998.

The Death Eaters know where she lives as she's a Ministry employee. They even capture the Tonks family in August, so they had ample time to "prune the family of its rotten parts". That's about ten months they had the chance to "prune the branches" that they didn't do it.

  all DEs answer to voldemort, & voldemort ultimately does what he wants
#+end_quote

There is this thing called delegation of power, I wonder if you've heard of it. Voldemort delegates powers to his underlings, because he can't run an entire country by himself. When he assigns positions to his Death Eaters, he expects them to run their posts as they see fit, so long as it comes under his overall vision.

He delegates the Muggleborn commission to Yaxley. He delegates Hogwarts to Snape. Yaxley runs the commission with a certain degree of autonomy - Voldemort would prefer all muggleborns killed, but we see muggleborn beggars in Diagon Alley.

The same thing applies to Snape. Snape can run Hogwarts whichever way he wants to, so long as it is within Voldemort's greater vision of what the school should be.

  we see snape agreeing to protect the students, we see him assigning ginny & co. detention with hagrid
#+end_quote

I often see this example touted as though it is some sort of shining example of Snape's magnanimity, as though it is supposed to excuse the fact that dozens of students were hiding away from the rest of the school out of fear of torture, and that unforgivables were practiced on eleven year olds.

In any case, Hagrid fled for his life a few months after the school re-opened and lived in a cave for most of that year.

What's more the students' own view of Snape was crystal clear - they cheered when they heard that Snape ran away before the battle. That should be an indicator about what they thought of Snape and his "subtle protections".

  claiming that stopping the carrows was as easy as snape 'putting his foot down' but he chose not to is absurd lol
#+end_quote

No it isn't. With most militaristic hierarchies, even one as crude as the Death Eaters', orders demand obedience. Disobedience in militarised organisations generally involves severe punishment - in this case, the same methods of the Death Eaters.
