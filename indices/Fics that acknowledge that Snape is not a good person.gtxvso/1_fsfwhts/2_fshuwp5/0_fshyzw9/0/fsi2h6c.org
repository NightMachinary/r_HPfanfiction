  Remus and Tonks, who is pregnant with a half-werewolf, are unharmed.

& tonks was ultimately murdered by bellatrix. volde speaks about pruning one's family tree at the beginning of the book

  The Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. Even Voldemort listens to Snape from time to time.
#+end_quote

all DEs answer to voldemort, & voldemort ultimately does what he wants. his listening to snape's request to spare lily & then murdering her anyway being the infamous example. we see that volde is vaguely aware of neville & what's happening at hogwarts, & it's framed as him giving the /carrows/ trouble

  “It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”

  The students were tortured before, they still get tortured, nothing changes.
#+end_quote

the answer is, plainly, 'it would have been worse'. whatever torture & murder snape /did/ mitigate wouldn't have been. we don't see the atrocities snape's prevented, because 1. he prevented them 2. we don't have his perspective

we see snape agreeing to protect the students, we see him assigning ginny & co. detention with hagrid , & we see him stopping fenrir from cruciating harry at the end of hbp. there's nothing to suggest he /wasn't/ trying to help them where he could. we have no idea the context is which the carrows behaved as they did

claiming that stopping the carrows was as easy as snape 'putting his foot down' but he chose not to is absurd lol
