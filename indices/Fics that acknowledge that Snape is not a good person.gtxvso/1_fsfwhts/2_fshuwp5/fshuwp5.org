And what, pray tell, do you expect to have happened if Snape had cracked down on the Carrows and forbidden them to torture the students?

Option 1: They accept his reasons at first, but keep grumbling as time passes and the students keep rebelling, making louder and louder noises about the need to "keep them in line" and "make them know their place." There's a very good chance that this actually happened.

Option 2: Voldemort intervenes and puts the Carrows in charge of policy. Things get much worse than canon, very quickly. By the time the Golden Trio arrive, there is no rebel army to speak of; they've mostly been killed or abducted. Without the privileges of being the Headmaster, Snape quite possibly never manages to deliver the Sword of Gryffindor, nor inform Harry that he's a Horcrux. Voldemort wins.

Option 3: Snape openly rebels before everything is ready. A bunch of Death Eaters die, but so do all the non-evil teachers. Voldemort takes personal control of the school and kills off dissent even more thoroughly than option 2. The Diadem is never destroyed (along with several other Horcruxes). Voldemort wins.

Option 4: Voldemort takes Snape's side, and replaces the Carrows with more intelligent and subtle Death Eaters. Harry's return to the school is much more difficult, possibly even resulting in his capture. Final outcome uncertain, but with a better chance of Voldemort winning than canon. Also, this option is unlikely to happen.
