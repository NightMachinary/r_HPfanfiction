Thank you for this.

It's great and Dumbledore here is right. If Lily was alive, she would be absolutely sickened with Snape.

I love this. If Snape truly was redeemed or had an ounce of the conscience people like to think he had, he would not have had a night without the whispers of the lives he destroyed running through his mind.

As it is, he probably cursed James Potter and thought something demeaning of the young boy who he caused to be orphaned, before sleeping peacefully.
