Have you read linkffn(The Peace Not Promised)?

I saw it recommended recently. Loved the Snape characterisation. Yes, he 100% knows how awful he's been and still frequently is, but as long as he can do something for Lily, he will not give up his duty. And when his change of heart causes her to start reciprocating, that gradually chips away at his hard heart and makes it easier for him to let go of past hurts.
