Few things I've noticed.

"sounded--almost--disappointed" is awkward to read. "Sounded almost disappointed" works better.

There's a lot of tell vs show and passive voice issues.

For example, you write "his wand had flashed out" instead of "he flashed his wand out".

A lot of stuff seems forced and there are a few changes from canon that I don't think improve your story. Voldemort is frail? Instantly, Voldemort doesn't feel like a powerful villain. He can't kill two kids before the parents can wake up? He can't flick his wand twice to cast killing curses but he has the time to take off his cloak and pick up a baby to disapparate with it? That required a bit of suspension of disbelief. Voldemort (or magic) seems nerfed and I don't think that makes a story better. It reduces the stakes and the wonder of magic. The "Noble House" thing isn't promising either. More times than not, it's a sign of poor writing but I have seen it done well so I do hope you pull it off. Setting it twenty years later can work as long as it isn't an excuse to stick in some song.

The premise is interesting, even if its setup feels forced and requires suspension of disbelief. I'm interested to see where the story goes and I do think there's a lot of promise. The issue with the scar frustrates me as a reader (I'm providing my reaction as a reader; it's not good nor bad).
