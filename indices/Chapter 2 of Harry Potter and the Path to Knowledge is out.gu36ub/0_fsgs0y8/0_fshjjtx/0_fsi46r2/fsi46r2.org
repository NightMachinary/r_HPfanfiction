I'm always glad to give feedback. I'm going to provide my thoughts, some of which are disagreements, and my intention behind them is merely to provide my perspective. In no way do I intend to force you to make changes or belittle you for your choices. Merely writing is impressive; I dabble a bit myself and I know that it is far harder than it seems. I write this assuming a canon-compliant magical system, which seems to be what you're going for with your stated intent of expanding the HP universe.

Your intention of making him a strategist instead of a fighter definitely comes across as a nerf. The issue is that removing Voldemort's ability to enter combat is a change from canon. We know from Halfblood Prince "that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact" which means that "it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes". My first point is that Voldemort's combat capabilities are not diminished by a broken soul.

From your reply, I get the impression that Voldemort's care comes from the need to preserve and protect his soul. I got the impression that his care comes from his physical weakness from the story. You describe his hand as "frail and sinewy" which gave me the impression of physical weakness. You also state that his body is frail, too frail to disapparate. However, we know from OoTP that apparition is reliant on one's mind. The three Ds are all mental and splinching is caused by insufficient determination. We also know that side-along apparition is possible with Harry apparating Hermione and Ron (along with Yaxley). Voldemort was remarkably competent at apparition and I find it unlikely that Voldemort would be unable to apparate two babies. Though again, I do believe that Voldemort could easily have killed the two babies with killing curses. I also think that physical weakness on Voldemort's part would conflict with canon.

You stated that Voldemort has to take care with killing because of his damaged soul from killing. Killing does damage the soul, yes. However, it takes additional effort to remove a fragment and place it into a vessel. Incidentally, Voldemort's creation of an accidental horcrux stems from both his weakened soul and because of his body's destruction from Lily's sacrifice (a unique condition).

Short aside, and I can't believe I missed this in my first comment, the story leaves me with questions about Voldemort's defeat. After all, Lily does not sacrifice herself. My current guess from the story would be magic surrounding prophecies.

In the books, a fragment of Voldemort's soul sought a living vessel. However, I don't think this precludes him from killing other people. Voldemort killed plenty of other people without creating horcruxes. There is also no downside to damaging one's soul via killing (besides the ethical considerations - though I doubt Voldemort cares). If creating a horcrux does not diminish one's capabilities, I find it unlikely that a damaged soul would. Order members, Dumbledore, and Voldemort kill canonically without issues from damaged souls. In short, I don't believe Voldemort has to worry about fighting because there is no real downside to a damaged soul. Voldemort's fighting capabilities (and the fear caused by actively employing them) were a major reason for his successes. Taking Voldemort out as an active fighter would be a nerf. Incidentally, I couldn't find much evidence that Dumbledore rarely fought on the frontlines against Voldemort (Grindewald is a different matter). He fights directly in the ministry battle, turns Snape himself, duels Voldemort in the ministry, and is said to be the only one Voldemort fears. Voldemort and Dumbledore are held up in canon as magical powerhouses. It's a badge of honor to be killed by Voldemort.

With regards to my feelings over the scar, there are two parts. One is a good thing; I'm frustrated along with Harry. The other is that the conflict is frustrating. I've read other stories with a disability and a lot of the time they get frustrating because the main character can't do anything to resolve the conflict. My opinion currently is that the issue of the scar is in a good state right now. That said, if scar pain and Harry's emotional responses continued to crop up throughout the story with ramifications for Harry, I think that it would detract from my enjoyment of the story.
