I can't thank you enough for the elaboration on your thoughts about the story. While I do agree that most, if not all, of my choices regarding soul magic, Horcruxes, and Voldemort would not coincide with canon, I find that they will make sense in my own universe.

I was a bit wrong when I stated that I would be expanding upon JK's universe. I do intend to do that, but also much more. For example, I would like to introduce or change the way certain magics work, making some, while more powerful, much more volatile as well.

I will begin by addressing the point about Voldemort's magical capabilities. He isn't becoming nerfed (or that wasn't my intention, at least). His change to work in the sidelines is just as much a practical one as it is magical. He has no qualms in fighting, dueling and killing, that much I can assure you. I merely attempted to humanize Voldemort, which does nerf the extent of his actions, as he is more concerned about practicality and his own body. By his logic, the Horcruxes are already the extent of his evil, and he should not push himself further than that, even though magic would allow him to do so.

In my AU, magic intended to harm and heal, and specifically magic regarding powerful forces, such as life and death, have severe consequences. Some more dire than others, but Magic in itself is more volatile and dangerous than in canon.

About the killing of others. Think of this metaphor, or comparison, if you will. You have a full watermelon in front of you. This is your soul as a wizard. Killing someone would be equal to stabbing it with a butter knife. It will cause damage, that much is sure, but it is negligible in terms of everything considered. A Horcrux would be similar to chopping a piece off, (and haphazardly, at that) and inserting it into an object, through a squeezing of the watermelons juice.

Now, the rest of the watermelon is still intact, and very much functional. But when left exposed for a while, the outer layer of flesh gains a darker colour, and it tastes too sweet. This is because it has begun to rotten.

Now, after cutting the watermelon up another five times, and along with hundreds if not thousands of butter knife stabbings, this leaves a very messed up watermelon. This is also taking into account the beatings that the soul received after Voldemort's soul received after dabbling in Dark Magics. You would be careful about stabbing it once more, correct? Therefore, Voldemort realizes the state his soul is in, and acts upon it, choosing to distance himself from further unnecessary harm rather than attempt to heal it. Do keep in mind that Voldemort could still probably duel Dumbledore successfully. His mind (for the most part) and his magic were not very much affected by his actions as his soul was. So I'm not saying he isn't a threat. He very much is. But he is also smart, and realises the best course of his actions with what he has available currently. (in my AU, at least) This involves him decided to risk one more murder, but he doesn't /need/ to kill 3+ more in order to do that, so he doesn't.

Against what we see in canon, Dumbledore is more of a planner than a actor. We see this in other places as well. Newt Scamander remarks that Dumbledore usually never goes out and does things himself, choosing to send other witches and wizards in his place. I'm following on that narrative, which seems to be the case as we are shown in canon, and also implementing it, though not as much, and for different reasons, for pre-story Voldemort. When he comes back, things will be different though.

Dumbledore and Voldemort are still absolute magical powerhouses. But they still have weaknesses, make that magical, mental, ethical or emotional. I'm just changing some of these, and for good reason: so that they adapt to the world I'm trying to write.

Now, about the scar. I'm glad that you felt frustrated along with Harry. That's a big part of the reason I decided to do a pre-travel chapter at all (besides shamefully info-dumping, which I later toned down on). Regarding the other point about the disability. It is mentioned both in the first and second chapter that the Portwoods are looking to deal with it, and they will. I will not state how, because that is spoiling, but it does get addressed. I'm glad you like the current situation. It will stay how it is for a while, though it won't actually be so much of a arguing problem, because the Portwoods will be reaching for a visible goal, but it will still cause conflict, if not between the Portwoods, but with others.

You mentioned scar pain and Harry's emotional responses, but I'm not sure about that. While Harry won't really be having pain from his forehead or visions or anything like that, things change because of the Horcrux, even after he gets rid of the problem.

Anyhow, thanks again for the messages, and I hope you'll bring up more questions, as it allows me to further think about things that I had only outlined in passing. Your thoughts are more than welcome, and greatly appreciated at that!
