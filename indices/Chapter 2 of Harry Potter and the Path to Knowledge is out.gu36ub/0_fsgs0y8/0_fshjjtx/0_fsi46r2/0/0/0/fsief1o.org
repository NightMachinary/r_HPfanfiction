Your questions are really good!

I do know that Dumbledore was likely to fight on the frontlines, but I'd put this down more to a necessity of the situation. In other words, if he didn't have to be there to win, he wasn't.

And while I do think that having both Dumbledore and Voldemort avoid combat whenever possible will be a very nice dynamic, it really would only come into play into the canon equivalent of around 5th year onwards. With the exception of Little Hangleton, Harry is mostly tormented through Voldemort's followers.

I'd assume that the damages to his soul would change him mentally, though it wouldn't be direct, I reason. It would be more out of fear or need to protect his own soul, or something along those lines. You can have an individual that has undergone severe mental harm, and still have their 'soul' intact (or have been a relatively good person, in other standards).

His followers have not gone most of the changes that Voldemort has subjected himself to, although there is considerable damage done to them. Examples such as the Lestranges, would have more damaged souls in comparison to Lucius Malfoy (though both pale in comparison to Voldemort) because they have had more chances to hurt their souls, and near none to mend it.

Souls are able to mend themselves over time, though it takes more effort considering the amount of damage. It can also be healed through love, or some other fluffy things I have not established concretely on. But this notion does align with what Dumbledore said about Voldemort. He didn't understand love, and that was his downfall, in the end. (though this is in canon, the 'logic' applies somewhat).

I don't think Voldemort would care too much about the condition of his followers souls, but most of them are far from being as close to broken as he was, even though they killed more. The combat capabilities of his Death Eaters will stay to the same level as before (canon),or increase, if anything.

The OotF does avoid lethality in canon, I believe, and so they would have to use stunners and lesser curses to incapacitate Death Eaters. And don't worry about asking questions. I'm more than happy to think about it. Some information can be considered the exact same as in canon, even if motivation/backstory changes. Others, not so much.

For your last point, I will concur that both /do/ offer blood tests, but that Gringotts has just been favored more because the Goblins are easier to hush. (With gold, of course)

Glad to answer these questions, and I encourage more, if you want to. Looking forward to writing more, If I'm honest. Currently fixing up Chapter 3 so it isn't a complete bog-down.
