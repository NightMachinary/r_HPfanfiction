I'm still a little confused on the consequences of a damaged soul, it doesn't seem like there is much if you don't worry over it.

That said, I've only read one other story that really explored the canon feature of damaging souls via killing. I look forward to reading more!

I've pretty much given all the thoughts I can on your first two chapters. I would also advise, obviously not mandatory, to stay away from overly helpful Goblins/Gringotts. It can come over tropey, especially when goblins hold a massive grudge against humans. Good luck writing!
