With regards to canon considerations, I think the text implies that Dumbledore and Voldemort fought on the frontlines. Death Eaters and Voldemort fear Dumbledore. Voldemort is said to have cut through order and ministry members and only Dumbledore is said to have matched Voldemort during these attacks. He claims to have avoided killing whenever possible, all of which heavily imply Dumbledore saw extensive combat. I find it unlikely that Voldemort and his death eaters, often arrogant, would fear a man who never fought himself, even if he had a previous reputation from years ago from defeating Grindewald. I do agree that Dumbledore was far less personally involved in the conflict against Grindewald, however.

That said, I do think it'll be an original dynamic in a fic to have Dumbledore and Voldemort avoid combat whenever possible. It's one that I've rarely seen.

I think I understand Voldemort's attitude regarding his soul in your world now. That said, I'm still a little confused as to whether or not the damage to his soul has any repercussions. It seems like there's mental harm? It also raises the questions of his followers. Does the fact that his followers have not created horcruxes mean that his followers have to worry less about soul damage? Does Voldemort simply not care? How will the long-term ramifications of soul damage affect the combat capabilities of his death eaters? Does the order of the phoenix avoid lethal force? I don't mean to force answers but instead offer questions that someone exploring your world for the first time might have.

I also have questions over the blood test. Is there a reason that Gringotts administers the test as opposed to St Mungos or the ministry? It seems a little jarring (though I'm aware it's common) for the equivalent of a DNA exam to be administered by one's bank instead of a healer or ministry official in charge of inheritance.

I look forward to reading more, especially the development of the OCs.
