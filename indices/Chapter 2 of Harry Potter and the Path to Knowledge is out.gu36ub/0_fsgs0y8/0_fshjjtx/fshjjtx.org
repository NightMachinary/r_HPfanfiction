Thanks for the feedback!

About the tell vs show and passive voice: This fic is my first attempt at writing, and I honestly don't expect the first couple of chapters to be any good, so I'm just happy people even bother reading them. I've only had experience writing essays and such to this point, so this is as much an attempt to better my writing as it is to create an enjoyable narrative.

About Voldemort: I'll admit, he was probably one of the parts I thought would come across misunderstood.

I know he comes off as weak or frail, or that magic is weak and frail, but that was definitely not my intention. I don't know how well I can explain this without spoiling the story, but I assure you that Voldemort isn't nerfed in my AU. In fact, his actions (in my head) pointed towards better caution and understanding than he ever showed in canon. He knew that his soul was already very much on the verge of breaking (due to the Horcruxes and his previous evil deeds), and during his later years of terror, decided to remove himself from most encounters, and chose his battles more carefully. He had the support to do so, and for all intents and purposes, it became a proper movement, which further escalated into a civil war. He became more of a strategist than a fighter, and his image as a ruthless killer and Dark Lord had already been established, so there was no need to put himself, or his soul, in more danger. My reasoning was that he only decided to attack Harry because of the Prophecy, thus taking a huge risk with the killing, and didn't want to damage the precious parts of his soul that were still intact with unnecessary killing. So he did everything discreetly, and removed himself from a position where he had to fight anyone quickly, while also taking Harry to finish the job. He took a gamble with his killing curse, which didn't work out for him in the end.

I promise that my intent was never to downplay his threat as a villain, or to make magic less wondrous. It was just my version of Voldemort's rising. After all, Dumbledore rarely fought on the frontlines, right? Even if he never killed.

About the "Noble House" thing. I can also assure that this won't be one of those political fics with bartering or chartering or anything similar. Some characters use this for their benefit, and others do not. But I don't really intend on going to deep into the political rabbit hole that some fics do. It is a part of the story, but a very brief and side one, to that. However, I too hope that I 'pull it off'.

I also don't intend to stick in any existing songs, for that matter. Most would be wizarding-related, anyways. The twenty year change was more because my memory of the 80's is useless.

I'm glad that you think my story has promise (smiling like an idiot rn), and I do feel grateful for the people that take time to write a review out, like yourself.

I do want to ask you about your feelings about the scar, however. You did say it wasn't good or bad, but frustrating. How so? Is it sympathising, or because I did a shoddy job of explaining it? Thanks for any future answers
