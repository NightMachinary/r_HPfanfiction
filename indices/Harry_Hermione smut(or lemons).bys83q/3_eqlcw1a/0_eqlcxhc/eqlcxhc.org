  One disastrous breakup was all it took to convince Hermione dating your best friend was a terrible idea. So why is she having such a hard time staying out of her other best friend's bed? Her mind already knows its a mistake. If only she could get her heart on board too. This piece was written for The Harmony Shag-A-Thon, hosted by the Facebook group, Harmony & Co. All canon characters, plots, dialogue, and situations from the Harry Potter series belongs to JK Rowling. I am not profiting from this work.
