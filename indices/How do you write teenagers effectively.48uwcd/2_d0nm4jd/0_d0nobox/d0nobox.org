Thank you for that incredibly detailed response. That was both insightful and frightening. This bit here:

  "The main thing that separates a teenager from an adult is a lack of context for their emotions. When you fall in love for the first time as a teenager, its one of the strongest things you've ever felt; heartbreak feels like the world collapsing; when someone you love dies, it's the first time you've ever felt that sort of absence. Everything is brighter and harsher because there's nothing to compare it with. In short, teenagers feel a lot more than adults do."

Actually gave me pause. It makes me wonder if the depressive and self-destructive tendencies I had when I was 18-19 were an indirect consequence of feeling things much less deeply. Going from everything affecting me strongly to feeling normally might have mislead me into thinking "I'm numb and dead inside" just because stepping into emotional normalcy was such a sharp change.

As for using your advice in any of writing, I think I'll probably have to practice, practice, practice. I've always found dialogue the most difficult thing to write because my own speech is vastly different to how I talk in writing.

Thanks again for your response. I don't think I've read anything relating to adolescence that struck me quite as strongly as this did.
