Interesting question. Here's some other disjointed thoughts from someone else who's 21. Everything is just relying on what I remember about myself, and is mostly applicable for ages 15-18, because that's what I remember best.

- The main thing that separates a teenager from an adult is a lack of context for their emotions. When you fall in love for the first time as a teenager, its one of the strongest things you've ever felt; heartbreak feels like the world collapsing; when someone you love dies, it's the first time you've ever felt that sort of absence. Everything is brighter and harsher because there's nothing to compare it with. In short, teenagers /feel/ a lot more than adults do.
- Similarly, teens tend to think that their mistakes are the blackest sins known to man. I used to have the habit of not turning work in on time, and I became pretty self-destructive about it. I would promise my teachers (who I loved and respected) that I'd get them work the next day, and when I didn't, the hatred and disappointment I felt in myself was beyond any reasonable response.
- Another characterizing struggle of being a teenager is that's when you first start thinking independently from your parents, and start to codify your ideals and figure out who you want to be. There's a lot of uncertainty and self-reflection that goes into this process.
- Your teen years are when you first start grappling with the idea of mortality, that you and your parents and your friends and everything you love are some day going to vanish. I know I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about this as a teen.
- It's important to remember that teenagers /are/ articulate (I probably had most of my adult vocabulary by the time I was 15), and /are/ thoughtful (to the point of doing almost nothing else), but that there's often an incredible disconnect between what goes on in their minds and what they actually do. The way I used to think of it was that I could either be thinking or talking, but never both at the same time. I would mull over a problem or relationship for forever, finally come to a conclusion, and when I went to act on it there was no guarantee that what I did would follow through with my plan of action.
- Teenagers are often uncertain as to where they lie in relation to their friends and in relation to society, and can be very insecure and tentative because of this.

Here are a few stories I feel like do a good job of showing how I, at least, acted as a teenager:

- Having a perfect first kiss was really important to me (I hadn't even had like a middle-school fling), so I kept a list in my head of people who I would be OK with being my first kiss, and the most probable reason they would kiss me, and whether or not I thought that was a good reason to have a kiss. All the people were good friends, and the reasons varied from pity to making sure my first kiss was someone who loved me to actually being interested in me.
- Relationships terrified me, as I'd only really see them tear people apart, and so I would only really start becoming friends with girls if they were in a relationship or I otherwise had no shot with them.
- I vividly remember walking outside with my friend Allie and the sun hit her hair and I wanted to tell her she was beautiful, but ended up not doing so because I didn't want her to think it was a romantic gesture (as above). I got really frustrated with people assuming actions were something they were not, or measuring me by the actions of other people. I was in love with pretty much everyone, but really not that into the idea of sex and really really not into the idea of relationships. But because everyone (even other teenagers) assumes teens have sex as a first priority, I had to guard and monitor my actions.
- I had two fantasies, and those were 1) to sleep with someone in the most innocent sense of the word and 2) to really fuck up and have someone forgive me.
- I spent maybe half an hour writing in my best friends yearbook after graduation, because I wanted her to know how much she meant to me and wanted to make sure every word was perfect. I ended up writing maybe two incomprehensible sentences.
- During the latter half of senior year, I decided that maybe relationships weren't such a bad thing after all, and I had a huge crush on one of my friends. I was too afraid to tell her, though, and so I started sleep-depriving myself (like 2-3 hours a night for weeks) so my inhibitions would be low enough that I'd just blurt it out. I'd get to school and have to lay on the floor because everything would seem like it was moving. I never told her I liked her :p
- As with a point waaay above, I spent an unbelievable amount of time considering death and free will and other philosophical things. I remember watching my friend in a school production of Fiddler on the Roof and having an existential crisis halfway through because I realized that if I believed in physics and in causality, I couldn't also believe in free will. Then my friend who was watching with me saw that I looked glum and tickled me until I fell out of my chair.
- I would read a book every day or two, more than any other time in my life. Empathy could be really frustrating sometimes, trying to figure out why people acted the way they did and how they felt and how my actions affected them, and so it was a relief to be able to see the way someone else's mind worked, and to sit behind their eyes for a while.

Other than trying to remember how you acted when you were a teen, I think the best advice I can give is to read some books by *John Green* (Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and The Fault in Our Stars are the must-reads. Read LFA before Paper Towns). There's a reason his books are beloved of teenage readers, and that's because he does the best job of any author I've read at capturing how teenagers think and what they're preoccupied with.

If you're looking to write younger teens, my reading list would be the Sammy Keyes series by *Wendelin van Draanen* (or at least some of them as there's 18 in all), the Circle of Magic by *Tamora Pierce*, and, of course, Harry Potter.

I just remembered something one of my teachers used to say, which is that adolescence is when we start to learn that our actions affect other people. I think there's a good amount of truth with that, and a large part of being a teen for me was indeed becoming more empathetic and realizing that I had a lot more power and responsibility than I had thought.

OK. I know I wrote a lot here, but I hope at least a bit of that was helpful to you!
