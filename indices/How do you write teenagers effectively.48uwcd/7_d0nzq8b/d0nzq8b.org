Imagining the mindset isn't the hardest part, for me---I usually just think back on how heightened every emotion I felt seemed to be, and how little continuity my moods and beliefs seemed to have from day to day.

What you can do as a writer that a lot of people miss is /keep your distance/---make sure your narrative is older than your characters. Lots of writers find themselves with an overly annoying narrative because their characters are annoying, or overly mature characters because their narrative (and their own perspective) is mature. Both problems---annoying teens and 40-year-old preteens---come from the same inability to separate the mind of the author from the mind of the character.

At her best JKR uses humor and irony to write interesting, young characters without aging her characters up to match. She stays in Harry's consciousness and behind his perspective, but because she separates her sensibilities from Harry's you have distance when he's at his teen-est. It's not a matter of disrespecting or satirizing your character's perspective, just recognizing that you aren't 100% bound by it.

Obviously there are other times where she doesn't do this so well, and you get really annoyed with Harry anyway. I've always thought Jane Austen was the master of this, if you want other examples to try. Don't watch her on the "villains" so much, because then the satire gets heavier than you might want with your protagonist---look at the subtle ways she makes you understand that her lovely, kind, thoughtful heroines are in spite of all that just /younger/ than you and she are, and less experienced.
