You're right that most authors tend to make them far more mature than their canon counterparts.

I think it would be a mistake, though, to have a 'teenager' archetype and base every character design off of this. If your protagonists/antagonists are truly unique, then they're going to react to the same stimuli in different ways. Hermione in canon is infinitely more cautious than most teenagers her age. Harry seemed to be a rather happy, snarky kid until he contracted a case of the sullens in OOtP.

  How do you get in the right mindset?

I tend to think of the individual facets to their characters first and their biographical details (such as age) as a secondary quality.
