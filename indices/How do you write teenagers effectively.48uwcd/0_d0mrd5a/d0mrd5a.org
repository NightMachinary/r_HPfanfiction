With teenagers you always have to remember that they are hormonal and don't have enough life experience to fall back on when they are in unfamiliar situations. There needs to be trial and error even by the more intelligent characters, because that's how they learn and mature. It's not unusual for a teen to be extreme in some cases since that is, essentially, how they test their limits.

To get into that mindset, embrace your childhood memories. Base interactions on the silly, stupid, or smart things you or your friends might have done, then twist it to fit the personality you are writing. If you are ever confused on how to proceed with a scene, just remember, your character can reflect that confusion. Worrying about what to do, say, wear, etc. is normal for everyone!
