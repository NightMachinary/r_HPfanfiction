Since this tactic has not been mentioned I would like to add that writing characters for yourself or a target audience of some description might also be an option. There are several examples, notably enembee, that eskew the concept of externally relative believability in favor of internally believable, interesting characters.

There are very few times when reading or watching some media that I think to myself THAT is just too cool. Nothing is that cool. No-one is that cool. Indeed when I say that to myself it is usually a product of enjoyment rather than a criticism.

Obviously there are authors in various genres who fail the internally believable test, but usually it's not because the characters are just too awesome to be twelve. It's usually because a given piece or portion therein sucks a bit and should have been improved.

Part of the reason we like fiction is that one doesn't have trouble finding the bathroom in a public building or the detergent aisle in the grocery store (deep epic voice) In a world where magic is might.

Tldr - Perhaps conceiving and writing an effective story is the greater burden rather than capturing the inexperience, ignorance, and silliness of teens the world over.
