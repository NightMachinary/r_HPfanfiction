Read what you write. If you don't like what you're reading, then you screwed up. Throw that away and try again, until it is something /you/ would want to read.

Reread some professional published writer whose work you like. You know, the one who wrote that one book you've read twenty times? Copy their style, but add in your own touch until it feels right for you. You aren't meeting a page count or word count for some assignment. You're writing something that should meet your own personal standards for quality entertainment. So make sure you've done that by reading what you wrote.

As a writer, sometimes I think this is the only thing I'm good at. I miss spelling and grammar mistakes, misuse words, and screw up formatting. But I always read what I've written many, many times before posting. And what I write I enjoy reading. My work also seems to hold together as fiction better than the work of the vast majority of my amateur peers.

Proofreading is your new god. Pray to it every day.

It will make the single biggest difference to the overall quality of your writing. Do a first draft all the way through, or as far as you can in one go. Then read it and correct. Repeat until publishing deadline or it shines like a perfect little angel -- one that you'll want to strangle by this point. Then read it all from the start again and more corrections, damn the deadline.

Rewrite the parts you don't like. But just those parts. Less is more, so maybe just delete those bits you don't absolutely love on an "nth" reading. They'll be there, trust me. Did you write something that was really cool sounding when you wrote it, but seems long and boring the second time through? Cut it.

Then read the chapter backwards, by major section. Read every paragraph as usual, but from the end to the start of the chapter. Read sentences backward. Find what works, but have your eyeballs on the things you wrote for as long as possible.

--------------

You have change controls on in your LibreOffice or Word, right? Turn that on. You'll never accidentally lose text in a chapter again. Just make sure to save a "clean" copy as .odt for uploading to FFN, or however you do it. Use /free/ Google Drive or Amazon Cloud to save synced backups, and even losing your laptop won't lose you your /precious/.

--------------

Then, at the moment of truth, right before posting, read it all again, beginning to end.

I /try/ to make sure I'm able to read the entire chapter from start to finish once without finding a single mistake before posting, but I honestly can't always do that. But it helps to approach it like that.

Good luck, and have fun with your writing.

Oh! And don't tell people it is your first fic when you publish. You can ask for constructive criticism, but don't prime people to find imaginary style faults in a first time writer's work. Your style is your own, don't let people tell you something "isn't done" stylistically. Be polite to people suggesting grammar and spelling fixes, but don't let anyone bully you into thinking you should write a different way. Accept writing tips gracefully, but make actual changes to how you write based on what you think is good.

Remember, you are writing something you'd want to read. So, if someone says no one likes a particular way of telling a story, you already know they are wrong. Because you like it.
