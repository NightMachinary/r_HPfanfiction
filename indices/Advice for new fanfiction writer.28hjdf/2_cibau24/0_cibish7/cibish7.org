Very sound advice, and I agree with it-- but I would caution on /too much/ proofreading. I have gotten caught up in proofreading so much that when I open a fanfic with full intentions to begin writing that new chapter, I instead start reading over and over what I've already written, looking for those mistakes, or changing words here and there in an effort to achieve a better flow. It can slow you down considerably.

Perfection is a great goal, but at some point you have to let it go.
