Gotta have a plan. Write drunk, edit sober, for example. But yeah, know what you are sitting down to do, and make writing different from editing and proofing in your planning and approach.

I like to read on a different device, my tablet, and only write on my laptop. I also don't let myself read AND correct at the same time. I keep a list of all the areas with mistakes, a text file with the the word or phrase that was wrong pasted in, then I go to the laptop to fix them all at once, finding them again by those snippets. Keeps that creeping edit cycle from happening.
