Something I am bad about is picking a genre and sticking to it.

If you want to write romance, then write romance. If you want to write action/adventure then do so. If you want to follow a single character then do so.

If you want to write an EPIC though... don't fall into the trap many of us have done.

First step is to write a plot out line, this can be overarching and envelope all characters and all plot devices as well as all relationships.

Then break that down into your action/adventure plotline only. If need be and the characters will be separated, then write an outline for each characters journey.

Then write the outline for your romance. If there is more than one romance, then you need a separate one for each.

Now try to layer these together in one massive outline so you know when characters will interact, what dangers they will face separately or together, and where the romance fits in so that it feels believable.

My biggest problem is letting the story get away from me until I don't recognize the current product from my original thoughts.

That does NOT mean you can't let the story grow organically. If two characters suddenly seem right for each other based on what you have written then do not force them to be with other people. If someone has to die based on the situation you have created, then you might just have to let them die (or rewrite to stop it). If you try to force your original thought onto a growing story then you will end up pulling a lot of unbelievable stuff out of your arse.

It is harder and easier to write fanfiction, because you get immediate feedback. But that feedback may lead you to change the story and next thing you know your muse decides she's had enough and takes a vacation.....

Not that I know anything about that... Nicky is around here somewhere with the rest of chapter 29 of 'Hogwarts Shuffle!'.....
