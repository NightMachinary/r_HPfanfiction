Fanfiction specific advice: Get the names right. Nothing will infuriate a dedicated fan more than if they're yanked out of a story because the writer keeps using Voldermort or MacGonall.

Here's a writing 'hack' in case a word keeps tripping you up- use a substitute while you're writing, then use Ctrl-H to find-and-replace your short word for the right one when you go back to edit. I do this for Quidditch [qdt ], McGonagall [McG ], and Dumbledore [Abd ]. Just make sure you remember to do the substitution before you post!
