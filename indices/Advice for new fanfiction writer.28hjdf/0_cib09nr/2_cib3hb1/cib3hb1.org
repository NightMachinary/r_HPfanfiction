Yeah! Kill your inner critique and burn it with fire! Nothing good comes from listening to the little bugger (but of course, you'll have to ressurect him when you edit...)

I'll add that writing FanFiction, you absolutely must strive to write something new, original, that has not been done over and over already. I think that's what people like best about my fics judging by the reviews I get.

Last advice is to just write, and write some more, and enjoy writing as you go!

Good luck!
