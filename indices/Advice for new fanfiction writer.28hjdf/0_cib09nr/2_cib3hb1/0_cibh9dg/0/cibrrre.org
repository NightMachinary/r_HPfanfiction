It would be my pleasure!

My story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10073115/1/The-Savage][The Savage]] is the one that gets the most comments of originality, but it's still in progress.

The Savage

AU. After the war, Severus has resumed his life as best he could, taking back his position as potions professor at Hogwarts and Head of Slytherin. Everything is monotonously normal and dull, until a mysterious person saves his life from what he fears most. Now, Severus has a purpose again: discovering who his saviour is, and give him a sever tongue-lashing.

Then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8776626/1/Patronus-Totalus][Patronus Totalus]] was original in some aspects but not as a whole.

Patronus Totalus

AU after Order of the Phoenix. Post Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix is sill fighting Voldemort and his Death-Eaters. In a desperate attempt to fight off dozens of Dementors, Hermione creates a new powerful Patronus. Rated T for language. A RL/HG story.

And finally, I have a Mary-Sue-but-not-really story, which was more popular than the other two for some mysterious reason.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8348025/1/The-Fairy-Godmothers][The Fairy Godmothers]]

What if Lord Voldemort had attacked immediately after Dumbledore's death? All is lost when Hermione is mysteriously sent back in time to the Marauders Era, where she discovers she has surprising new powers. Lots of friendship, romances and surprises! A HG/SS story with a twist of RL.
