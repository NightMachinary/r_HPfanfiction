I second this. It doesn't help overall, but the clich√© of writing while drinking (in moderation) really does work for that. Helps to shut down the part of your brain going "no no no no". If that is a problem, find a way to (safely) get into that zone, the one where ideas flow and you don't take time to analyze them first.
