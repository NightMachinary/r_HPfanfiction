The key to writing is silencing your inner critique. Most of the time when I'm writing the little bastard will pop up and say that this or that sounds stupid. Ignore them, it indeed may actually sound stupid, but don't worry about that. Write. Later once you've distanced yourself from your work then look at it an revise it.

I would also suggest looking at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1591992/ScytheRider][ScytheRider's Writing Tips]]. They toward the bottom and are really informative and helpful.
