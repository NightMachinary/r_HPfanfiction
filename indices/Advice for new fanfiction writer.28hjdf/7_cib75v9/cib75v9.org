Write and re-write. NEVER go with the first thing that comes to mind, you're inevitably going to look back on it later and hate it. Use a drafting process. I write long-hand and then transcribe everything into a word doc, which I then edit down even more. Then I have a beta go through and hash it further before I have a final draft. Writing is process. Don't feel pressured to throw something up online simply because it's a fleshed out story. You'll know when it's finished.

Grammar is God. If you think you know that you're using a word appropriately, double check. So many fanfiction authors use big words improperly and it throws the whole piece off. You think you sound witty; you end up sounding like a kid with a thesaurus and a lack of education. Look up how to quote dialogue correctly, and make sure that your characters are using a dialect appropriate to their world. Someone in the 19th century isn't going to be calling a younger person "kid", that's a goat. Interjecting slang or verbiage that doesn't mesh with a character is off-putting and a mark of poor writing.

If you think it sounds cliche or purple prose; it is. If you think that your plot is campy; it is. If you think that you're using the your/you're/lose/loose wrong; you are. Second guess yourself. That's pretty much the best advice I have.
