Fair point, but I wasn't saying it was a bad idea or anything like that. I was just pointing out that tons of fanfics take shots at everyone around Harry, with varying levels of awareness of that fact to be expected of course.

In any case I just thought it would be interesting to go the other route and roast Harry as it seems like a fairly unique idea that occurred to me when I read the OP

I will also point out I posted before the edit.
