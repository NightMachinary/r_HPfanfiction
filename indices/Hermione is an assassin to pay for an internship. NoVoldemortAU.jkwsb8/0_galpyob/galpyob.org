  *Lucius:* It's not what you did, son, that angers me so. It's who you did it to.\\
  *Draco:* Who? That fucking mudblood?\\
  *Lucius:* That "fucking mudblood"... is Hermione Granger. She once was an associate of ours. They call her "Baba Yaga."\\
  *Draco:* The Boogeyman?\\
  *Lucius:* Well, Hermione wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. She was the one you sent to kill the fucking Boogeyman.\\
  *Draco:* Oh.\\
  *Lucius:* Hermione is a witch of focus, commitment, sheer will... something you know very little about. I once saw her kill three men at the Hog's Head... with a quill, with a fucking quill. Then suddenly one day she asked to leave. It's over a man, of course. So I made a deal with her. I gave her an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The bodies she buried that day laid the foundation of what the Malfoys are now. And then my son, a few days after her husband died, you steal her broom and kill her /fucking Kneazle./
