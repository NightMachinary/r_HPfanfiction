SSHG is one of the pairings I read the most. It can be done well. However, I don't really have much emotional investment in it and read it mostly because it's the most "safe" SS pairing (I almost only read SS-centric fics), and my preferred pairing (LESS) has an unusually high rate of bad endings. That and I've pretty much gone through all of them on FFN/Ao3 and there simply isn't any left anymore.

I've always liked Sev&Harry guardian/mentorship fics (but preferring the reverse the most -- Harry raising a young Severus due to time travel/de-aging), but I don't think that's the kind of connection between them you was thinking of.
