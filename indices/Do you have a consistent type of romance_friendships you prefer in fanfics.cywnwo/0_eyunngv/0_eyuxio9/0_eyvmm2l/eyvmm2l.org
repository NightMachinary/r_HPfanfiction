Snape is talented, I never said otherwise. But his need to bully children, especially Harry over a grudge with a bloke who is dead for 10 years, is just pathetic. The books are explicit in that regard. And he is one of the best defined characters and gets more background information than Hermione.

As for Rickman, he was a good actor, but far to old for Snape, who is 30 in the first book/movie.
