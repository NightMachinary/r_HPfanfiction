I can see the Snape-haters are camping out in the thread already, with all of the downvoting.\\
He might get more background information than Hermione, but we never get to see Snape from a more neutral point of view ever. The closest we come is to the Spinner's End scene. Everything else is seen through the eyes of Harry or the Marauders. I'm not saying he was "nice", only that we are getting a heavily biased viewpoint all the time. We never see different sides of him. We never see inside his head. The viewpoint of him in the books is very one-dimensional. The closest we get to some kind of canon version of what is going in Snape's head in this: [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/the-harry-potter-books-from-severus-snapes-perspective]]

That's a pretty strong description. Dumbledore is Snape's dearest friend?! We certainly aren't SHOWN this in the books, but something was going on, that Harry Potter never saw. The books do very little to flush Snape out as a three-dimensional human being. He's just the one-dimensional jerk as far as the Harry lens is concerned. But it's that one-dimensional veneer that allows fanfic authors the ability to explore so many different options with explaining what's /really/ going on beneath the surface.
