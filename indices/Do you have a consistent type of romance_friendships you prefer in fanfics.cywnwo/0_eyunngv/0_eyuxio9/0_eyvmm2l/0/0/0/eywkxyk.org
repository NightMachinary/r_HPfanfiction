hahaha, I have no love of Pottermore either. But Pottermore, The Book That Shall Not Be Named, and JKR's stupid tweets are technically "canon".

But do notice that after Snape gave his memories to Harry, Harry decided he was a "hero" and worth naming his son after him. So there's that.

It's probably just shitty JKR writing again, but how the hell did Snape cherrypick exactly the right memories when he's literally bleeding out from a snake bite? Like did he have some kind of "package" boxed up in his mind, ready for delivery, the instant it was needed? I would have expected a crazy massive information dump, or even if there was time to pick a few quick memories to explain everything as quickly as possible, still some random memories chucked in by accident. Now I want a fanfic where someone tries to pour their entire brain into a pensieve, either as a complete record of their knowledge, or as a strange method of immortality.

The occlumency lesson pensieve scene is great because there's about a million different interpretations/arguments for /'was it on purpose, was it not on purpose'/ that Harry had access. I put my money on Snape NOT wanting Harry to see it just because he was so angry about Harry snooping. But you can always make more complicated, layered arguments like /"Snape is furious Harry is a snoop. But just in case Harry decides to snoop, Snape chooses the best memory to punish Harry for snooping."/ But I don't think JKR is clever enough for that many intentional layers.
