Snape is talented in Potions, DADA, dueling, Occlumency, Legilimency. He is a very competent wizard. And Alan Rickman's performance at least is played with the confidence and control that he knows how talented he is.

I'm with the group that JKR intended (or later decided she liked better) Alan Rickman's performance of Snape. (Strict and sarcastic, but not as bad as he seems. And that Harry is an very unreliable narrator.)

I see the potential of what Snape could be, which is why I read fanfics that flush him out and make him a main character. We see so little of him in the books, and all thru the lens of Harry.
