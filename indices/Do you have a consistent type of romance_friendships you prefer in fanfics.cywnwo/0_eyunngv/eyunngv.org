  I like sarcastic banter friendships and romances.

I am with you here, banter is probably the most entertaining and lifelike way you can write a relationship since most of the body language and gesture-based interactions do not translate well to fiction.

  I think I like these characters because they're confident and competent.

That archetype is missing in the HP world IMO. Snape was a petty asshole who bullied children over a grudge with a guy who was dead for a decade. That seems like the opposite of confident or badass to me. Draco was all bark and no bite. Bellatrix can fill that niche, but she is a henchman, not a confident leader (and she is batshit insane). Voldemort, just no. He is the closest you get to magical Hitler, and he is so far beyond the hot-crazy curve that you can no longer see the line.

Also, they regularly get beaten by a schoolboy and his friends, so they are the definition of incompetence, with only Bellatrix managing to be properly threatening. Dumbledore has Snape leashed, Draco can't kill and Voldemort cooks up crazy plans instead of just going for the kill. Also, his strategy during the Battle of Hogwarts is so stupid that only the defenders' incompetence made it a close call.

I am open to pretty much every girl with Harry as long as you stay away from the fanon interpretations (Ice Queen Daphne, Goddess Hermione, Quidditch Girl/Soulmate Ginny, Veela-bond Fleur, "wants to see my face" Tonks)
