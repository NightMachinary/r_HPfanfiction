You sound like the type that doesn't get hung up on one character, but just looks for a solid romance of any pairing?

I think many fans get really hung up on one single character in a series, and then look around for options to pair with them. While the partner is often well-written, the partner is only well-written for the sake of the character the fanfic author is so in love with. Outside of that context, they would never choose to write about the partner.
