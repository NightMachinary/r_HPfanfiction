I like romances between two people who are equals. She's not eye candy that's just there to fullfil the authors fantasies and he's not an emasculated pretty boy whose only purpose is to be humiliated (right, Potato19?). Both should be interesting, and smart and funny in their own ways, both should bring substance to the story on their own, and their union should be an even greater boon.

I like relationships that are cute and flirty and light-hearted on the surface, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going and so they should both be very tough---steadfast in their love and support for the other. Basically they kick dark lord ass together and then they frick.

Lastly, they should both be smart and mature enough to avoid all the stupid, contrived plot devices that surface in order to bring drama to their relationship. "I love you and I know you love me and I know we could be happy together right now if I wanted it but I'll marry your brother anyway" lol fuck you.
