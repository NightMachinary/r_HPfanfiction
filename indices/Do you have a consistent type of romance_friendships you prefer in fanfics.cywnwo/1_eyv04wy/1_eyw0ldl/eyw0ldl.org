If there's one thing I never liked in romance in fics is when the fic goes on and call the girl "the most beautiful girl in her year" or similar as an objective fact. It just makes them unapproachable and goes in hand with sayings like "she's out of your league" and similar. I much prefer fics focusing on personality traits and how they work well together as a couple. Not saying they can't be good looking but focus should be elsewhere.
