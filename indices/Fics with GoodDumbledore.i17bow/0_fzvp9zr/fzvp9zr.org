Dumbledore is pretty freaking /awesome/ in Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

He has all the silliness of "Alas, Earwax" Dumbledore, is pretty manipulative but takes /all/ of that out on the Ministry front to get stuff done, and last but not least /is a competent adult/, near-miss with a Horcrux-ring notwithstanding.

The story in general is one of the best slice-of-life takes on the series, even with its cracky premise.
