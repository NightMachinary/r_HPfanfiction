[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), both are from the same author and feature scarily manipulative Dumbledores. But instead of the usual "how to manipulate a teenager to sacrifice himself" BS, these Dumbledores display their skills on the political and operational level. Of course, Harry stays totally loyal to him.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] plays out in a non magical sci-fi universe in which Hogwarts is a spy school. Needless to say, this Dumbledore is manipulative and ruthless as hell. Being trained from very early on, these kids are also on a totally different level and eventually figure out what Dumbledore was up to. But since they are already master spies, no hard feelings here:

  Harry softly said, “Dumbledore was already resigned about dying. He didn't even care about getting hurt or poisoned when we went in the cave. He would've asked for help on something else. Like turning Draco. Or protecting the school.”

  Ron fumed, “You're trying to tell me Dumbles was asking Snape to kill him?”

  Hermione asked him, “Would you have wanted to go out the way the headmaster was facing? Either being tortured to death by Death Eaters or slowly dying in agony from his illness?”

  Neville said through his packed nose, “Old SS and KGB trick. You shoot your spy so everyone thinks you're on their side.”

The still updating [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/][Albus and Harry's World Trip]], linkffn(13388022), is pretty cool.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24450217/chapters/59001382][Too Old for This]], linkao3(24450217), is a crack piece featuring 'gangster Dumbledore'. I think it's awesome, here is the first paragraph

  "Sit down, Harry, and shut the fuck up."

  Dumbledore pulled a cigar to his mouth and inhaled. Then he blew the smoke out, letting it spread throughout the room and form into obscene words.
