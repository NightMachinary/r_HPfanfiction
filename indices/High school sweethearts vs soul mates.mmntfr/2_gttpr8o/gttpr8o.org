Because it's boring.

Any relationship takes time, often a lot of time. Putting everything in a story makes it long and uninteresting. It's quite hard to arrange a dynamic plot through time period that covers several of them.

Also the Magical World is very small. If someone has several past exes, it's well known, he/she has to interact with them quite often and it brings tension into interactions with others. There's a good rule: no exes in the present, and it exists for a reason.
