Exactly, except we don't really get much about it (because a) she's only doing it to try and make Harry jealous iirc, and b) it's completely unimportant to the plot). I want more stuff like that, but with the protagonist actually involved, rather than it being something that always happens off-screen.

The only two shows that come close to my thought processes on this topic are How I Met Your Mother, and Drake & Josh, and neither of those were all that consistent either, because there was a certain level of status quo reset that happened because they were primarily sitcoms.
