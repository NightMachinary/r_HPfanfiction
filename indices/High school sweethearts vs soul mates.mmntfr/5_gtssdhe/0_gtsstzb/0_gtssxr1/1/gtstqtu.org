Probably reading a bit too much into a few scenes from the movies, as well as fanfiction, because I haven't read the original books in about 3 years, but she was rather obviously crushing on Harry from a early as the 3rd book (hero worship from CoS, used to read the In-Universe Harry Adventure books, etc), and only started dating others (Dean Thomas? I think?) after Harry started going for Cho, and then suddenly she's not dating anyone at the perfect time to swoop in and date Harry right before the dragon dung hits the air circulator.

It's likely just a small plot convenience or whatever, but it just seems too neat that Ginny would be dating around and then suddenly not be dating the moment Harry Potter needs a loving shoulder to lean on.
