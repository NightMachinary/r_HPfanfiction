Yeah, the pairings were just too... /neat/ at the end of Harry Potter. The Golden Trio and the younger sister all just so happen to end up together? I can accept Ron/Hermione. I could accept Harry/Ginny with some actually good interaction. But I am definitely ignoring the whole wartime trauma child soldiers aspect.

I too would also love to see more Muggle/Magical marriages. There was a fic that was pretty good where Dudley married a witch, and basically only found out because she reacted when he mentioned Harry's name. It was actually a really good one, where Dudley was scared of becoming a father because of his own upbringing. I can never get the linkfic bot to work but it's "Cousin Harry" on Ao3 iirc
