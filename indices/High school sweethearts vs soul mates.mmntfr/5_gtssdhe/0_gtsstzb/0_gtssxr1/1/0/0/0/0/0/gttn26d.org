Oh that sounds good, I'll have to check it out!

But yeah, if I had it my way, I would've paired Ron with a muggle; Hermione with a guy similar to Krum (or maybe even no one); and Harry with Luna tbh. Ginny... I don't know, I don't think it would have had to be addressed.

In a similar vein, I don't think James and Lily's marriage would have realistically lasted, and they would have divorced before Harry started at Hogwarts. Harry, as we saw, put them both on a pedestal (especially James) and thus their relationship.
