Yeah no problem. I think too that there is a lot of media geared towards younger audiences that fall privy to the “marry their first love” trope. I was always deeply dissatisfied with the final pairings in HP (save for Remus/Tonks which I found to be intriguing).

For example, in Avatar: The Last Airbender I found it strange that everyone ended up with who they dated as TEENAGERS (save for Toph). This was somewhat remedied in Legend of Korra with Tenzin and Lin having a complicated past as childhood sweethearts that ended in tragedy (although that made their relationship all the more compelling in my opinion).

However, keep in mind that Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/etc. went through some deep trauma as teens and therefore formed trauma bonds. It is more common to get married and have kids quickly during wartime, which is briefly addressed.

With that being said, I find it so odd that the books fight for Muggle born rights and the right to Muggle relations, yet not a single character ended up with a Muggle. I could see Ron ending up with a Muggle, to his dad's delight (who I also feel like should've been with a Muggle, but I guess we wouldn't have had the Weasley clan then...).
