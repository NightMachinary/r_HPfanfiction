It's not entirely to make him jealous - but she does explicitly say she never gave up on him, and that Hermione gave her advice to date other boys and live life and that would get Harry to notice her, which it obviously did. Combine that with her obvious early crush and how she didn't really seem to take any of the other relationships seriously, and it reads to me (and some others, at least) that it was specifically in the hope to get Harry to like her.

Which it clearly did, because we have a whole book of Harry getting super jealous whenever he sees her with someone else.

It's not the only interpretation of it, certainly, but that's the one that fits the best for me personally.
