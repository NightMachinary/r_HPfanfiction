Yeah that has always grinded my gears, they date one person in thier late teens and thats who they marry for the rest of thier life? I have actually seen this happen in real life and that marriage did not end well.

If I ever actaully get around to writing my own fic, I think harry will date a a few different girls in hogwarts years and maybe one or two after hogwarts before he even considers marrying one of them.
