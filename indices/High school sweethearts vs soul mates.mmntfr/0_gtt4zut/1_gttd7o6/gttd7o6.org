The only thing worse than marrying the first person you date, is marrying someone you've been dating for less than a year. A friend of mine did that. He had two epic failures in 8th grade and 9th grade with bad breakups (the girl in 9th grade sent me over 300 emails in less than a week, wildly varying between death threats against him and me [for some reason], to haughty, self-assured diatribes about how he was gonna come crawling back any day now, to outright begging me to help her set up a "kiss and make up" date. She was terrifying, and also my first personal interaction with a restraining order, though as an outside observer), and then once he 22 he's suddenly found "the one" and they get married before the year is out.

What's even crazier than all that is that he ended our friendship because I wouldn't let him or his future wife drive MY car, when I was nice and went out of my way to pick her up when he and I were carpooling. Why did they want to drive? So they could sit next to each other. Which apparently they couldn't do in the back seat. I am perfectly happy to play wingman, but I'm not getting a goddamn ticket or worse just because they didn't care that my insurance didn't cover other drivers.

Even more irksome is the fact that she got off work hours prior and could have easily gotten home long before I got there by WALKING, let alone taking the bus, but no, I got to drive an extra 45 minutes in the dark because reasons.
