That actually was my original point. The girl my ex-friend had married had only lived in our area for about 5 years now. They got married around 3Â½, 4 years ago. He went from "just met" to "just married" in barely a year. That, right there, WAS my whole point. Your parents, and a lot of people who are sane like your parents, will begin dating a longtime friend, and decide to marry early because they've already known each other for X number of years, even if they've only dated for one year, where X = 1+N years. I very specifically mean "those who only know each other for a year or less" should probably hold off on marriage for a bit.
