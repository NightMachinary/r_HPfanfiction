In the fanfic I'm writing the MC gets with Cedric, he then (sadly)/obviously gets killed by Voldemort in GOF. She is then (I say then as I have not written this far yet) going to have a fling with George before eventually marrying Theodore Nott, as I didn't want it to be “easy” in a sense and wanted to go into detail and add more depth to the story; so I completely get where you're coming from. Although I don't mind a few of them that display the love connection and relationship straight away as it can actually be quite sweet sometimes.
