Yup, that's the idea. I just can't seem to get much further than that in my own story.

Toradora! is an anime where the two main characters have crushes on one another's best friends. So they make a deal to help one another score dates. Through a few misadventures, dealing with each other at their absolute lowest, and growing as people, they begin falling in love with each other, but pretend otherwise because the other is still hiding their feelings, until it all spills out and they nearly elope, before deciding to finish high school---taking it seriously this time---and seeing if their feelings have changed at all by the time they graduate.

I'm totally comfortable spoiling that, because they make it extremely obvious that the two MCs will end up together in the end, but the journey is what makes it fun.

Nisekoi is similar. The anime hasn't reached anywhere near the ending, but the manga has ended, and it starts with the MC dealing with a massive crush on this cute girl, who also has a crush on him, but they're both too freaking shy to do anything about it. And then a transfer student hops a fence and lands on him, before later their parents force MC and Transfer Girl Into a fake engagement, a "false love" (niseâ€¢koi) for convenience's sake. A few other girls show up, and of the 6 girls, 4 all have keys, one of which opens the locket the MC carries around due to his first ever crush, a girl he can't remember from when he was five or so. Only 1 of the key-bearing girls remembers the event, another wrote about it in her diary and then forgot about said diary, the third only knows the key is somehow important, and the fourth keybearer outright says that he key isn't the right one, because she only took a key because that's how the story they based this silly event off of went. Three "knights" to open the barriers so the "princess" can reach her beloved. And that's kinda what happens in Nisekoi. The other girls might all know something about the MC, or they might understand his reactions to certain events, but the girl he chooses at the end surpassed all of them, being able to go beyond mere understanding, to seeing hidden details, things that aren't hinted at as important to the reader at all, until you go back and realize those details have been peppered in since the beginning.

The only two downfalls Nisekoi has are that the "fated childhood meeting" is both given too much importance, and yet not enough, and that it threw in two extra girls just so one can be the designated panty shot, and the other can be the tommest of tomboys.
