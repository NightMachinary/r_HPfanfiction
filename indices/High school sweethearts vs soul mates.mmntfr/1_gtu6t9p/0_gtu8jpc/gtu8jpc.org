I do understand that. But you know what else is satisfying? A Slow Burn. Where it takes 80k words for the two main characters to even think to themselves "I think I'm starting to like them." All I want is a story where the slow burn takes all that time longer than your usual romcom, because the main character attempts to woo someone else in the beginning.

I want more Toradora!, dang it! I want more Nisekoi, without it HAVING to be a harem anime! I don't want to be flogged with realism, just smacked with it once or twice as a reminder that it exists, or whatever.

Heck, even Nisekoi suffers from First Girl Syndrome, if you look at it from the audience's POV. So does Harry Potter, since we're introduced to Ginny before Hermione. But that's still part of the problem I feel.

I've actually been fiddling with an idea for a globetrotting romcom, where the MC is looking for Miss Perfect, and doesn't find her until he returns home to the childhood friend who has always been there by his side. It's only now that he's met girls from all walks of life, all over the world, that he finally realizes that his home and heart has always been together, he'd just been blinded by the horizon.

My inability to write romance, let alone a multitude of different flavors of romance, has prevented me from getting very far into this idea, and after devouring a bunch of fanfiction and other media searching for inspiration, I finally was compelled to ask this post's question.
