Yup. And to kinda pick up a point: Ginny=Harry/Harry>Cho/Cho>Cedric still has absolutely no substance to it. Harry doesn't change from before his date with Cho to after. The experience nets him 0xp. Ginny is the only one to get any experience in a relationship, but because it's all in the background, we still don't actually get to see how it affects her. It's just so many missed opportunities for development, but instead we got reiteration and a net zero.
