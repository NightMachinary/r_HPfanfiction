There is some merit to both the countless fics and what you're saying.

On one hand -- yes, everyone finding their One True Love on what basically amounts to their first try at romance is unlikely. Yeah, it does happen in real life, but it's rare. Even canon doesn't do this. Harry's first romantic interest is Cho. Cho's in turn is Cedric, then Harry, then who knows. Ginny had several boyfriends before she ended up with Harry. Hermione was with Krum for a bit. And JKR has implied that for a time Lily actually did have feelings for Severus, even if nothing came out of it before she ultimately ended up with James.

However, while everyone getting together with their "final" love right away is implausible, I do think that the Wizarding World being full of relationships that boil down to highschool sweetheaarts is plausible. When everyone goes to the same school, something like this becomes far more likely. And the only example we have of the opposite in canon is Remus/Nymphadora and Bill/Fleur. And highschool sweetheart examples? Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, James/Lily, Molly/Arthur, to name a few.
