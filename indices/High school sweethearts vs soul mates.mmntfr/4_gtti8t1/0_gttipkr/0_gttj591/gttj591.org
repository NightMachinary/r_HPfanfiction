Yeah, that's actually another part of it - romance is tough to write! So having to do it twice in a story can be intimidating ;)

Although, to note, it's not completely unrealistic to have those relationships stick coming out of secondary school/high school - in certain areas, it's the norm (I know a good number of family members and classmates who, a few years after graduating, were happily married with their high school sweethearts and having kids). So it isn't unrealistic per se, unless it's the only type of relationship shown.
