The biggest reason is pretty obvious, I think - because it's being written, and usually the author will have a final pairing in mind. Since that's the case, writing a secondary relationship that is A) satisfying to read, B) plausible, and C) doomed to 'failure' (breakup) is not always an easy task - or one that an author would want to do.

It just so happens that Harry Potter is set during an age where that 'final' relationship would be high school sweetheart equivalents - but you'd still get the same tendency whatever age they were of authors having an endgame relationship and working towards it, with very few bothering to throw in a 'fakeout' one first.

It's also why - if there's going to be another relationship involved - they'll tend to start already established. Eg, a post Hogwarts romance between Harry and a non-Ginny character often start with Harry already in a relationship with Ginny (as per canon), but mostly as an obstacle - and not really bothering to develop that relationship more than to show why they aren't a great fit.

Anyways, while it's certainly more realistic to have flirting and short term relationships at the age they're at, as well as unlikely to have super long lasting ones coming out of secondary school, it's narratively what goes easiest for relationships for authors, so that's why it all ends up so /solid/. Add in that canon also ended up with final pairings at graduation from Hogwarts, and that just adds to it.
