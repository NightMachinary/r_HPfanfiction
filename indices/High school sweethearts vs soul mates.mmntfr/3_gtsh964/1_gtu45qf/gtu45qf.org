I was discussing this with a friend a while back and they made a good point. There is a subset of the fanfic community who should be kept on watchlists because of their views on romance and consent. However, many of the writers of fanfic are young. How many authors notes have you seen where the author apologises because of delays due to schoolwork, and that can be from people who have been writing for years. Not only have they probably not experienced a full relationship yet, they are still at the point in their lives when they are figuring out how other people work emotionally, so a more 'childlike' view of relationships is to be expected.

Add in the fact that once these tropes became established it is self-fulfilling, as that becomes 'expected' of a fanfiction (arguably the 'pairings' tags on ff sites should take some of the blame) and it becomes normalised for those who read a lot and go on to write their own.
