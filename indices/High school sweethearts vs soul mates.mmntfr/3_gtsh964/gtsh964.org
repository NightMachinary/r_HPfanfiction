Because most people don't understand how relationships work and form, and because most writers were indoctrinated from a young age that finding "the one" was inevitable and a magical moment beyond compare. The fact that relationships can be hard, that even during difficult times the strength lies in holding together, inexorable, the fact that sometimes you just want to be alone and many other facts like these are mildly taboo in our society.

Same as the fact that some people just don't want to have kids, or that you're free to not have kids while maintaining a great relationship. Or the fact that some people never get married (and just stay in an unmarried relationship forever), which is also not required. Or that neither partner /has/ to give up their last name.

Real, actual relationships are scary and unknowable - they're based on trust and mutual understanding, not fate and the universe. The only people that can make a relationship happen are the ones that do. The fiction of fate pushing together "soulmates" is incredibly attractive to people paralyzed by this fear.
