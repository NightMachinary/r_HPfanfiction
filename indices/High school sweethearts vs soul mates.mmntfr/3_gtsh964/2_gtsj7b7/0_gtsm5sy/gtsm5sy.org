That would be the perfect romantic story, wouldn't it? Could even go so far as to have the character end up alone in the end, having learned that they don't necessarily require a relationship to live a fulfilling life and having become a fully realized person (Definitely want to see more happily single female protagonists in general).

Or maybe in the end they meet someone who's went through the same trials and troubles and they end up together due to a mutual understanding.
