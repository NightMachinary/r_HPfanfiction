That is a wonderfully insightful answer, thank you!

But that again makes me wonder why no one has ever tried to demystify all that messiness.

To use HPFF as an example, I love a good romance, no matter who it involves, so long as there is inter-character chemistry. Harry and Hermione canonically have good chemistry, and the movies exponentially increased it, which is why Harmony is such a widespread ship.

Ginny and Harry's relationship lacks that chemistry (Harry and Luna have better banter, even!), which is why it's lambasted.

I could see Draco/Harry forming after the war, built atop their rivalry and a certain amount of UST.

Harry/[Daphne/Tracey/Padma/whoever] are all usually fun because while there is generally accepted fanon about a lot of the background characters, the way various different authors use them always makes the story interesting, because while the base ingredients are largely the same, the chemical reactions can vary wildly, even if the end result is still a relationship.

All that said, I would love to see a story where Harry dates a number of different girls before finally settling down, because each girl he interacts with would leave a mark on how he acts moving forward.

In other words, I want to see a story that works like a dating sim/Visual Novel, where the Main Character becomes sporty when dating the athlete, or more studious when dating the librarian, or more aware of the greater community/social scene while dating the student president. Except instead of a blank slate protagonist becoming a sportsy himbo OR a valedictorian, he gets a bit of both, becoming a somewhat athletic bookworm who runs 5km before sunrise three times a week, and studies late into the night somewhat often.

I want a well-rounded character, rather than "Mr Perfect at X" or even worse, "Mr Perfect at Everything"
