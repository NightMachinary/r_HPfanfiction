While I do understand that from a logical standpoint, I don't understand why a romcom where a guy is overly persistent with one girl is considered a good story, but they're aren't any stories where a guy is just persistent in general, not letting the fact that it didn't work with X number of girls because he's confident he'll meet the right girl so long as he continues to try.

Or, y'know, something similar to your average romcom or romdram, but reverse some common anime tropes? Like instead of a harem anime where one boring guy is surrounded by gorgeous girls, it's a somewhat average guy who tries his luck and while he strikes out with some, and befriends a few others, the story can actually freaking end with one of the girls asking him out (gasp, role reversal), because we don't have to hold onto the stupid status quo that is the lifeblood of a harem anime.

I seriously don't know how to ask the question I WANT to ask, so I'm asking questions I hope will lead to the question I want to ask, if that makes sense.
