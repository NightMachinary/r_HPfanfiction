  I don't understand why a romcom where a guy is overly persistent with one girl is considered a good story, but they're aren't any stories where a guy is just persistent in general, not letting the fact that it didn't work with X number of girls because he's confident he'll meet the right girl so long as he continues to try.

Are you still taking about fanfics? Because in most non-fanfic romcoms, one or both of the leads usually have had a ton of failed relationships before they meet each other.

I think that what you may be missing is that for most shipfics/romcoms/romance stories in general, people are reading/watching the story because they want to see a relationship develop and for the couple to be happy together, so failed relationships don't get much attention.

And a failed relationship could still make for a good story, but people generally aren't interested in those stories for the same reason they're generally not interested in stories where the villain wins in the end: people like happy endings.

I'll also note that stories focusing on teenagers are much less likely to give the characters past relationships, but that's because teenagers are generally too young to have had many previous relationships. I'm pretty sure that most teens graduate high school with no more than two exes, though my quick searching hasn't turned up any actual statistics.

If you want stories about dates and relationships that don't work out, try looking for sitcoms about single adults.
