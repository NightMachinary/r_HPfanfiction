I've said it elsewhere, but I'll reiterate here because it's likely in a different comment chain: I understand that RomComs about adults usually have past relationships. That's not what I want. That doesn't do much, as unless said previous love interest shows up, they have no effect on the story other than "Oh, I'm gonna be a bit more awkward and whiny than usual for a minute because Current Happenstance reminded me of Previous Girl™️."

The thing I want is a main character going on a personal journey of self-discovery and romance where we SEE how they ACT before, during, and after each relationship, and get to see the character grow and change. RomComs don't do that, even in flashbacks to previous relationships nothing about the character changes because they have to act in a recognizable manner (usually as part of a joke), or if they act differently, then it's a Big Lipped Alligator Moment, or a Goth Phase. It's always just a joke and never actual growth, even though actual growth can and has been incorporated into jokes in other genres.

I asked this question in the first place because I don't really have an exact idea of what I want, so thank you for bearing with me as I use everyone's comments to build a little puzzle in my head.
