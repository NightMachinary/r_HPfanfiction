linkffn(Why Can't it be a Joke by bballgirl32). Fred and George go back in time to interrupt Aberforth and Grindelwald's argument. Their presence means Ariana doesn't die, and when they come back to their own time they find that the world is ruled by Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and the Weasleys are their evil supporters and muggleborns are slaves.

Since the traditional Hogwarts Houses have been replaced with two new houses -- 'Dumbledore' and 'Grindelwald' -- I suppose this counts as alternate sorting too.

The writing is rather mediocre, but it does have some interesting plot points.
