I don't think that it works that way but what ever floats your boat.

I would go with the explanation that people can learn a magical talents like Parseltongue, divination and metamorphmagus, but most people don't even know you can learn them and even if they did know it was possible to learn they wouldn't both to try because it would take years just like learning to be an animagus takes years( the only thing that even hints to this in canon is that Dumbeldore seems to have learnt to understand Parseltongue In Harrys fifth year even if he can't speak it)

So someone that even thinks to try to learn Parseltongue can understand it Easily enough , but learning the spoken part of Parseltongue is a lot harder takeing years so it not worth the effort.
