Well, I think that Parseltongue is a bit of an exception; because being a Parselmouth is a magical talent that gives you automatic knowledge of the language both ways, but it's wholly possible to just learn how to speak the language, as Dumbledore had, without any magical steps involved. Dumbledore could only understand it but functionally not speak it because it's so hard to pronounce it if you don't have the innate, instinctive knowledge of a Parselmouth (all those slight variations in hisses are hard to pronounce with a human tongue!). In my story, I have showcased Dumbledore /trying/ to speak Parseltongue, and the result was absolutely hilarious to Harry because from his perspective he was speaking with the thickest lisp anyone had ever seen.
