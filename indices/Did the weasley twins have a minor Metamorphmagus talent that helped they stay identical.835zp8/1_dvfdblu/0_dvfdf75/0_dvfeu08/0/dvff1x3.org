I was looking the at Parselmouth page on the harry potter wiki the other day and I am pretty sure that it says that Isolt Sayre can only understand snake but not talk to them. what would you call that?

from the wiki page: Isolt Sayre, a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin, was able to understand a Horned Serpent which she regularly visited but as of known never spoke Parseltongue herself.
