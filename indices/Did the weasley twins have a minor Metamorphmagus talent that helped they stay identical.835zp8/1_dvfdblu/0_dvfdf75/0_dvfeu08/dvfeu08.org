My point is, I don't believe there's such a thing as a "minor Metamorphmagus talent". In my headcanon it's as absurd as being "kind of" a wizard or only "slightly" a Parselmouth --- you're either a full Metamorphmagus like Tonks, or you're not and you'd have to use advanced self-transfiguration like Grindelwald if you wanted to change your appearance.
