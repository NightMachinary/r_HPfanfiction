The idea is amusing, but it hinges on that "everyone can /sort/ of change what they look like" idea, which I don't believe to be canon, though it's certainly interesting. So I don't "believe" they did, to answer the thread title. But again: cool idea.

That said, don't let fanon fool you; Molly usually /could/ tell her children apart in canon, just not when she was under too much stress.
