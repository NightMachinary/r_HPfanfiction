Not even identical twins are that identical... They will throughout life acquire differences! If one eats more he becomes bigger/fatter. One will have scars the other doesn't, they will get brthmarks, their hair will be a bit different lenghts, they will talk a bit differently. I have never heard of identical twins who their parents can't tell apart... So either Molly is a bad parent, wasn't paying attention or there was magic involved.
