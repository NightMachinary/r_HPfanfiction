  Grindewald fell in 1950, and the five years in which he still held sway changed the course of history. Wizarding Britain, terrified at any threat to the Statute of Secrecy, decided in the late 50s to pass the Muggleborn Wizarding Appropriation Act, which took muggleborn children from their parents at the first incidence of accidental magic. Children could then be fostered or adopted by wizarding families, or would live in Wizarding Institutional Houses. Some Pureblood families took things a step further and decided to foster children in case they only had one heir to act as a sibling, companion, and stand-in for punishments deemed too harsh for their own children. If the muggleborn did well, they reasoned, it meant they had earned their place in the wizarding world.Hermione Granger is such a child, chosen at a young age to be Draco Malfoy's companion. She's an ideal muggleborn: polite, intelligent, and magically capable. It isn't until she attends Hogwarts that someone sees the potential in her. She becomes the favorite of a certain professor, who would rather see her embrace her power than subjugate herself.

  You would have thought that Hermione Granger, a major in Political Science, would know better than invite a stranger from a pub home. But then, she would never be a true politician if she did.

  Hermione respected all of her professors, but none more so than the brooding, talented, possible Death Eater, Professor Dolohov. Antonin never paid attention to any of his students until he developed an ill-fated, unwelcome, utterly bizarre relationship with a young Hermione Granger.

  AU, HG/TMR/FW. Attraction builds between Hermione and her best friend's older brother, yet she can't tear her mind from the mysterious puzzle that is her critical theory professor: Dr. Riddle. EPILOGUE UP.
