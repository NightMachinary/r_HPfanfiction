Well said. Now apply that to fanfiction. Stories are the authors' intellectual property. While there are no laws or rules protecting authors, unfortunately, do have the basic decency to respect them. They've put hours of their time and effort to produce these works. It's not fair for them if anyone can just come up and take their works without any permission.
