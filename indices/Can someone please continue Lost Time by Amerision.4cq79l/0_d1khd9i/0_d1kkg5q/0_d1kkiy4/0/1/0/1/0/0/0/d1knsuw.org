The fuck? Of course it's different. There's a reason why people are allowed to make remixes of any song they want. As long as whoever is continuing this fic puts a comment saying they are making their own story continuing on from the existing fic, it's your own intellectual property, not the writer of the story which ends in a timeframe before yours begins...

Of course, to make it truly yours, you should not use any OCs made my Amerision.
