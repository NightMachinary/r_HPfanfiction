No, it isn't. Amerision has made no statements saying that he has abandoned the story, neither has he given permission for anyone to take the story. So, until something changes, the story is still Amerision's intellectual property. While there are no rules against taking fanfiction, please do have the decency to respect the author's effort in creating the work.
