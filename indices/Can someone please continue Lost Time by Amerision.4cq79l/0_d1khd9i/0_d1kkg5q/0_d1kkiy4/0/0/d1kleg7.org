Money doesn't really have anything to do with it.

There are several disanalogies with the JKR situation.

1. As was already stated by M-Cheese, JKR gave explicit permission for people to write fanfic of her works.

2. JKR's work, as canon, has a special authoritative status that separates it out as "above" any fanfic. No matter how many fanfics are written, there can be no doubt that JKR's version is the "real" version. There is no such division between two fanfics, which means any continuation of an incomplete fanfic has the ability to supplant the original's authoritative status as the "real" version of that story.

3. JKR, while she spawned the fanfic community, is not a part of it. Within the community there are certain standards of behaviour upon which the continued functioning of the community rests. Not taking other people's ideas is one of the biggies. If it was accepted common practice then people would just stop writing - why bother, when someone else is just going to write a derivation of your work and get the credit for your hard work?
