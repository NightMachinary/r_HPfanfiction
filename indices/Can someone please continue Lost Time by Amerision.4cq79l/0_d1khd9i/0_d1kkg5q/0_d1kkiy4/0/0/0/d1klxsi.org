It's not a perfect analogy by any means, but there's no analogy to be had considering how.... "Unique" (that's another word for weird) the conventon of fanfiction is.

It's true, though. I can simply state that lack of permission isn't an eplicit prohibition either, but's that's a flaky argument at best.

I'm gonna be honest, I wouldn't be adverse to writing something that has been abandoned for half a decade. Either continuing fromw where it stopped or drawing heavy inspiration from it. I don' see that as rude- If the person cared, provided nothing had happened to them- it would have either finished it, or explicity stated it would not permit fanfanfiction.

I mean, this is flaw on itself considering how many fics spawn from the same idea. And it's not even the case we're discussing- What I'm defending is somehting that has been, for one reason or another, clearly abandoned (Say, over three years without the author saying anything, or even the author him/herself stating that it wouldn't go back to it) and someone picking it up where it left, clearly stating who'd been the original author. There isn't really any toes to be stepped if this happens.
