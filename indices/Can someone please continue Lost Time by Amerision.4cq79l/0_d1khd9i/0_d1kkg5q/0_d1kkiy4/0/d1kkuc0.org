It's not like anyone's making money out of it. Someone likes a story that will never have an end, imagines an end for it, and shares it with the rest of the fanbase. Surely as a fan on fanfiction, you will understand, since it's not that different. Imagine JK rowling had suddenly disapeared off the map without ever publishing the seventh book. Are you telling me there wouldn't have spawned a million of fan endings? Hell, there /were/ fan endings anyway while she was writing it. Where was the common decency there?
