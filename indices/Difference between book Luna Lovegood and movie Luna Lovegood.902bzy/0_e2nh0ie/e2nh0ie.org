Luna's one of the most faithfully- represented characters in the movies both in looks and mannerisms. The biggest change is that Movie-Luna seems to be better groomed; the book version had scraggly and dirty-blonde hair, while the movie version has regular blonde hair that's not particularly scraggly... this is hardly the first time someone's hair has been prettied up for the movies, though.

Book-Luna also seems to be slightly less serene, or at least she has more moments where she isn't. She's a little quicker to show annoyance... especially towards Hermione, whom she regards as narrow-minded. When she finds something funny she laughs HYSTERICALLY at it; At one point she laughs so hard at Ron's not-very-funny joke that the others start wondering if something's wrong with her.

Other than that's it's generally small things that are either hinted to be different in one version, or just not mentioned. Like, the books never specifically mention that Luna has an Irish accent; in fact since she lives and grew up in Devon it's more likely that she doesn't... but it never specifically says she DOESN'T have an Irish accent either. The books never address her liking for pudding, but again they don't say she DOESN'T like pudding. And of course in the movies, Luna never once mentions the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.

Compared to Ron, Hermione and even Harry, though. Luna has made the transition from page to screen with very few real changes. There's a reason why even fans who don't like the movies much will still praise Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna... she pretty much nails the character.
