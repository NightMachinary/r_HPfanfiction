I know the British use of "pudding"... but Michael Goldenberg, who wrote the script for OotP is American... as is Steve Kloves, who wrote the scripts for all the other movies. The characters of the movies often have a certain American turn of phrase and wording even though the actors are mostly Brits...

So I'm pretty sure Michael Goldenberg, when writing "pudding," meant it by the American definition. ^_^*
