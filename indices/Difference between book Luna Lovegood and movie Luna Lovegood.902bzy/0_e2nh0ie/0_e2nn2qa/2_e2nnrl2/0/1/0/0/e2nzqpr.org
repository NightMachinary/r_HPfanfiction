Custard/Mousse, regardless my point was that American style pudding isn't like yogurt. And in America pudding always refers to a dessert, where in fact pudding in Britain does not always refer to a dessert because there are in fact several savory pudding dishes in British cuisine that are almost never (if ever) made in America.

Pudding is much thicker, and the texture is completely different. Sour cream would also be something that pudding isn't like either.

My main objection is the snide insulting tone.
