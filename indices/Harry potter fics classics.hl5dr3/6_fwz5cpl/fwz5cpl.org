I you have Wattpad, then Tightly Knit by KMbell92 is really great. Warning: don't read the comments, there are always spoilers for some reason. Also, she has another series set in that AU, you can check out the reading guide on the bio to find out which to read first.

Another good fic is linkao3(be the light in my lantern by starfishstar). It's a Remus/Tonks series, set in OotP I think.
