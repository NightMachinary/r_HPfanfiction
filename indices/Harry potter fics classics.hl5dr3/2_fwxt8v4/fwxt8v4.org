Wow, that list is pretty hardcore. I'm trying to make myself read all of Harry Crow just so I can say I did and so I can properly evaluate it, but I'm struggling to stay motivated.

The classic Peggy Sue fic that comes to mind is Nightmares of Futures Past, though it's still incomplete (not abandoned!). Best place to read it is the PDF version on [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][GitHub]]; nowhere else has chapter 43. Harry beats Voldemort, but everyone else is dead, so he sends his soul back nineteen years to try again. Features him building up his friends and preparing them, which I always enjoy rereading.

And linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) is definitely a classic, giving the full life and times of Severus Snape, from his mother's pregnancy to his death. His perspective on canon is just a fraction of it. I quite like the alternate ending, too, linkffn(Miles to Go Before I Sleep by rannaro), where he survives and goes on to help round up the remaining Death Eaters and have a chance at a peaceful life.
