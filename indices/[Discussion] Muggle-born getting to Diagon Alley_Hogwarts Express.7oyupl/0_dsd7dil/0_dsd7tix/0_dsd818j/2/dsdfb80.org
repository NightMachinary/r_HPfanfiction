There's a fic where Septima Vector introduces Harry to the magical world. He also runs into Luna in Diagon and there's a nice friendship dynamic going on.

The story is technically abandoned but the "last" chapter is them boarding the Hogwarts express so it actually has a nice cliffhanger ending. The author thinks about calling it done at this point.
