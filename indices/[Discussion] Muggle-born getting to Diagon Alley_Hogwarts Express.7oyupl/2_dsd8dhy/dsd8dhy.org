We know from canon (books + Pottermore) that a professor (or Deputy Headmistress/master) is sent to introduce muggleborns into the Wizarding World. However, we are introduce to Hagrid who was probably supposed to tell Harry how to get onto the platform.

Many fics, usually either Muggle wank fics or just independent!Harry fics usually have him find out there are several brochures about everything in the Wizarding World. However, due to the wizards having the Statute of Secrecy, I doubt they would give muggleborns what most fics make out to be everything everyone needs to know about wizards.
