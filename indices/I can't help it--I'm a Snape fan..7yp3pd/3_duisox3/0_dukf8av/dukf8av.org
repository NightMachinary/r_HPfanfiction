  Snape was not a character who was bullied in any real sense of the term. I actually love that he believes he was bullied. J.K. Rowling takes great pains to show the depth of character, and later having it explained to Harry that Snape gave as good as he got. From Snape's perspective he was bullied, despite the fact that Snape himself often sought out confrontation with the Marauders. They were school children. They all behaved reprehensibly.

except she never portrayed him as such. she's explicitly said the opposite- that he was bullied
