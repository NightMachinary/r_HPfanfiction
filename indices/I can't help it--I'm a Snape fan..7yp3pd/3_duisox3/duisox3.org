  only choosing to side with Dumbledore because he hated Voldemort so for killing Lily.

I wouldn't say this was the case. Voldemort threatening Lily was certainly what pushed the hay barrel over the hill, but I don't think, had Lily never been threatened, Snape would have stayed a Death Eater forever. Perhaps the only significant change would have been timing and whether or not he became a spy (He only became a spy at Dumbledore's request).

Note, before I continue, that I'm not defending any of Snape's actions. I'm also not saying he was a good person. Those are mostly opinions rooted in perspective. I'm going to lay out a few points that I think are important to distinguish in the often black-and-white portrayal of Snape's character.

Snape wasn't simply against Voldemort because he hated him.

Throughout the series, hidden underneath his sarcasm and biting cynicism and obvious disgust for some people we would otherwise consider extremely good characters, you can often see the /real and tangible/ connections he's made with people. In particular, the long-lasting staff at Hogwarts. These people were not simply colleagues - he lived with them for a more than decade-and-a-half before his death. They were his family. We're shown that he cares, at least, for McGonagall and shows reluctance and remorse for the death of Burbage.

Snape didn't believe in Voldemort's cause.

Often people focus so much on the fact that Snape called Lily a mudblood as untenable proof that Snape was a racist or a bad person. I think that's a naive way of viewing the situation. Does it make him a bad friend? Perhaps - I tend to think it does. I'm certainly not excusing it. Did Lily overreact? Should she have given him back his friendship? Perhaps not. But one ruined friendship that, in my opinion, rests solely on Snape's feet does not an entire character make.

Snape was not a character who was bullied in any real sense of the term. I actually /love/ that he believes he was bullied. J.K. Rowling takes great pains to show the depth of character, and later having it explained to Harry that Snape gave as good as he got. From Snape's perspective he was bullied, despite the fact that Snape himself often sought out confrontation with the Marauders. They were /school children/. They /all/ behaved reprehensibly.

In my personal opinion, Snape believed himself the victim because he convinced himself that he was. During the years before he lost Lily's friendship, teller her that he was the victim was how he rationalized his behavior to her. It made her stick around him. It kept her upset at Potter, someone Snape knew was a contender for her fancy. When Lily died, Snape kept the charade, perhaps attempting to continue hiding the contempt he felt for himself. His actions are what drove Lily away, in the end. He couldn't /really/ blame it on James Potter. For someone like Snape, that moment he drove Lily away was the moment he signed her death warrant. It's absolutely ridiculous to take that credit for himself, but J.K. Rowling loved to point out the similarities between Snape and Harry and Tom whenever possible. Harry, like Snape, had an overwhelming capacity to take responsibility for things that they couldn't have possibly had any control over. They internalized the guilt for the continuing war as personal failures.

Snape loved Lily. But it was more than that. He loved what she stood for.

Snape is often portrayed as a creepy, obsessed man clinging onto the memory of a dead woman. I think this is, again, an incredibly naive way of looking at the facts as they were presented.

Does a creepy, obsessed man continue on with his life, dedicating his entire purpose and soul to the /values/ of the person? No, he jacks off in the dark to photos of her red hair or some trite.

Snape dedicated his /life/ to ensuring that Voldemort fell. Additionally, he dedicated his /life/ to ensuring that /Harry Potter/ would live. He wanted her sacrifice to not be in vain.

The most accurate interpretation I can think of for the famous "Always" line uttered by Snape, and portrayed so brilliantly by Alan Rickman, R.I.P, is thus:

1. Snape gets upset when Dumbledore, essentially, says that they'd been raising Harry for slaughter. *
2. Dumbledore, shocked, asks if Snape had truly started to care for the boy.
3. Disgusted at the thought, Snape, perhaps to Dumbledore's disappointment, denies it.
4. Snape casts his patronus, taking on the form of what we may presume to be something that symbolizes Lily Evans.
5. "After all this time?"
6. "Always."

*I do not believe Dumbledore actually holds this opinion, it is merely what he needs to Snape to believe, so that Snape can report to Harry exactly what Dumbledore needs to convey to him.

Snape wasn't upset because he cared for Harry. Quite the opposite - he hates Harry. Undeservedly, and that's another side of the coin, but he does.

Snape was upset because allowing Harry to die, and worse, manipulating the situation to the point where Harry /was forced to die/, would invalidate what Snape believes to be Lily's strongest most important motivation in life - the survival of her son. Perhaps he even considers it her Last Request.

This isn't the type of man who's obsessed with the thought of just fucking this chick. It may have been unrequited, something I don't entirely believe, but he was /truly/ in love with this woman. One of the purest forms of love that I can possibly imagine. He didn't lust after her. He respected and admired her and, when she died, he carried on living to ensure that her ideals for a better world would be realized.

--------------

I'm going to conclude this, because this message has gotten to be entirely too long.

I don't think Snape was a perfect human. It's entirely open for debate on whether or not he was even a good person.

But what he was was a man with a mission. A pure mission. A respectable mission. And he was fucking overwhelmingly brave to pull it off as he did, even to his death.

I'll end this with an opinion that I share with Albus Dumbledore and, perhaps, it was one of the most important emphaseses and nuanced underlying points of the entire story put together by J.K. Rowling.

Sometimes Hogwarts just sorts the children way too fucking early.
