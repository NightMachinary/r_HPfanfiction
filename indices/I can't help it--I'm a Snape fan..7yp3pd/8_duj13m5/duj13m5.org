I like Snape as a character because he was very complex , he showed that you can't just forget your childhood bullying just in an instant and become a good man , despite his tough exterior he was slowly changing

But I hate the fans who keep telling Snape did nothing wrong , James is worse than Voldemort , lily is a gold digger , harry misinterpreted his tough teaching as bullying etc , lily wanted to divorce James etc

And they get angry if we don't agree to their delusions
