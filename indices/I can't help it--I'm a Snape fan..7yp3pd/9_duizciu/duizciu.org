Likeable characters are the bane of my existence. Not the idea that they exist, but the idea that all interesting characters /should/ be likeable, or else they're bad guys or shitty writing or something.

(For the purposes of this post, consider /unlikeable/ defined as a character you wouldn't want to be friends with, not a character that the audience is supposed to hate -- even if there can be some overlap, it's not the same thing.)

But really, there are some /fantastic/ examples of unlikeable but compelling characters out there: Amy Dunne, Patrick Bateman, Tony Soprano, Lou Bloom, Cersei Lannister, Rust Cohle.

With the exception of Cohle, the above examples are mostly villain protagonists, but Snape is one of the few "heroic" examples (for certain values of heroism). I can understand why he does what he does, even if I don't agree with it. His actions combined with his background make for a complex and deeply flawed character.

So yeah, I guess you could say that I like him, too.

(Now if only people could nail that characterization in fic.)
