He is a brilliant character, and definitely one of the best written in the series, if not /the/ best one. To the point where fans on various platforms, forums and blogs were debating the seemingly eternal question "Is Snape Good or Bad?", up until the last day before the release of /Deathly Hallows/. Snape is definitely on the Light Side, though at the beginning it clearly is for selfish reasons, given that he only switched sides because Lily was in danger. But by /DH/, it does seem that he is genuinely converted, as evidenced when he reacts negatively to Phineas Nigellus using the "Mudblood" slur to describe Hermione.

But is he good in terms of being a good /person/? No, he is not, as clearly evidenced by his repeated bullying of (in particular) Harry, Neville and Hermione. This should be extremely clear. He is a truly grey character with many nasty characteristics. JKR said it best when she called him an "anti-hero".
