No you're not, I quite like him too, for most of the same reasons (over-the-top scheming, etc). Although I take a slightly kinder (and I believe closer to what Rowling must have intended) view of his character, in that I think he /did/ have a conscience somewhere in there that Lily's death jolted, and his turn to the side of good was /partially/ motivated by actual will to help, even if he'd never admit it.
