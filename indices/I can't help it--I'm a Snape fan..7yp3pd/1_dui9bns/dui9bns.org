I would've liked him better if he was more selfish - or maybe less self-destructive would be a better way to put it. He has nothing to live for but Lily's memory and it seems has given up on ever creating a new life for himself. That's actually the main reason I can't root for him, as weird as it sounds. If he actively worked to better himself as a person and to build himself a future (beyond the more immediate worry of Voldemort) that would've made him more relatable to me.
