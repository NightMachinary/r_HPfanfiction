I mean, Snape is really funny.

Are his jokes incredibly dark? Yes. Are they very sarcastic? Oh, yes. Are they quite nasty? YES.

But the Snape we see has such a developed sense of humour that I genuinely think at a higher level - say, in the equivalent of a university - people would enjoy it rather than being scared of him. I'm not blaming the kids, particularly Neville, for being scared of him, because Snape's way too nasty for a kid to brush it off, but as a higher level teacher, I think Snape's whole shtick would keep you on your toes whilst performing at a higher level.

Besides, his nastiness aside, he really did get people to perform well in Potions. In HBP, all those students, bar Harry and Ron, got Os. Umbridge says he teaches them at a higher level than is mandated, et cetera.

Like! Arguably a bad man, and undoubtedly shouldn't be teaching actual children, but the idea that he's a bad teacher or that kids don't learn in his classroom always struck me as an idea manufacted BECAUSE someone doesn't like him as a person.
