  because he was a poor, bullied child with zero positive adult influence, an abusive father and overall neglectful family, relentlessly bullied at school, and taught to associate blood purity and the type of power that the DEs offered with agency and escape from abuse.

Sure, I sympathize/empathize with the poor little boy a lot. Maybe that's just the misunderstanding between us? Is that what you are getting at? I don't sympathize with teenager Snape though, who decides that's a good reason to start killing muggleborns though. He's an asshole. And turns out, even though his asshole-ness leads to the death of his lustful obsession he decides to remain an asshole, tormenting little children (including the child of the woman he professes to have loved) in school to get his rocks off. I'm against the death penalty so I guess Azkaban would be an appropriate punishment and I wouldn't sympathize with him for rotting there.

There's plenty of people with terrible childhoods who don't turn out to become bastards (see Harry).

  this was so emphasized within the series that the protagonist empathises with him, the man who's partly responsible for the death of his parents, even against the father whose death he's partly responsible for

Yeah. It's horrible isn't it? Harry is an idiot. Who would name his poor child after a humungous cunt like Snape? Personally I find the attempts by JKR to turn a vile person like Snape into some kind of hero really disgusting, it's kinda terrible to be honest. Like applauding someone for cleaning up their own shit. "Hey idiot, how about not taking a dump in the hallway in the first place?"

  have you interacted with fiction, ever?

from time to time.

  do i really have to explain the concept a sympathetic bad guy?
#+end_quote

Kinda. There's sympathetic tragic heroes or anti-heroes, but you usually aren't supposed to feel sympathetic towards the bad guys. That's why they are the villains. Except if you're a psychopath I guess: "Man, that Adolf Hitler guy had the right idea! What a tragic fate, poor man!".

I mean, that's why JKR is trying to paint Snape as some kind of hero, right? Because it would be weird to celebrate a villain? So he gets to nobly sacrifice his life as if that makes up for anything. People who have no strong moral principles are easily swayed by such appeals to authority though: "The author said X is a good guy so he most be good". That's why so many people feel the need to defend Snape even though he's objectively terrible and has no redeeming qualities. Oh, and Alan Rickman of course.

Before the prequels? Sure, I could have imagined some kind of tragic past... with a good and decent person underneath. After the prequels? Na, just kidding, turns out he's always been a dick. Looks like he's just a giant idiot and a whiny bitch, who likes to murder little children and has illusions of adequacy. The whole burning alive thing is kind off a shit fate, but maybe he should have considered not murdering innocent children.

But I agree that he is /supposed/ to be some kind of "tragic hero". The prequels just totally shit the bed in regards to him (just like JKR shit the bed with Snape), since he's either annoying (Episode 1 & 2) or revolting (Ep 3).

Jury still out on that guy. Seems like he's kinda idealistic in some ways and doesn't really care that much for the whole murdering stuff. Pretty hard to get over the whole Patricide though.

Haven't watched Avatar. Sorry.
