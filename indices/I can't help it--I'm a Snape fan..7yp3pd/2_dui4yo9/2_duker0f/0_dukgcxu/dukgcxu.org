Oh, poor Snapey-poo, joins a terrorist organization with the stated goal of wanting to get rid of Muggleborns (never mind the treason and violent overthrowing of their society), but then gets all upset when his insane Lord kills the wrong one. Dawwww. So sad. I wonder how many of poor Snapey-poos potions were directly or indirectly used to murder other people that he didn't give any shits about. And for ultimate irony he himself is partly responsible for Lilys murder. Feeling sorry for himself is the least he can do. Why should I sympathize? It's really easy to avoid what happened to him.
