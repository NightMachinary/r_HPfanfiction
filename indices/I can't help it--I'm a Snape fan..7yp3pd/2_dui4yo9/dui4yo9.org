Do I like Snape as a character? Sure, he's one of the best in HP. Do I like Snape as a person? Hell no! Do I like him as a teacher? Are you fucking kidding me? Does he deserve sympathy? No, everything that happens to him is well deserved. Would I engage in any kind of apologia for this horrible piece of shit just because he's interesting as a character? Certainly not.
