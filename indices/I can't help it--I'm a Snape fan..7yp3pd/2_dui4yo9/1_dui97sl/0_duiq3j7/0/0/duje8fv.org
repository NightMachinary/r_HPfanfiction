  I like Hannibal. He's a scary piece of work. Does this mean I endorse cannibalism or sth? Nah, I just like Hannibal. I actually think he'd be just as scary even if he didn't eat people.

Eh, I think it usually has to be clarified. I mean, in the case of Hanibal it's pretty obvious that you aren't a pervert who's into canibalism... but there are plenty of people in the fandom who genuinely like Snape and think he's a great dude.

I've seen it in other fandoms too, when people get too involved in "cool" antagonists and start to make excuses for them. In particular when they appear as PoV characters.

The "Dark Harry" genre is full of this shit. Even the authors seem to occasionally forget that their protagonist is the bad guy.
