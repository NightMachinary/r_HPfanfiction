I love Snape as a character. He is a decidedly /adult/ character in a children's series. Our surface reaction to his is "ew! evil!" and children love to hate the greasy-git. He is the bully teacher we have all dealt with over time.

But I think about him as an adult. He was abused and neglected as a child. Once sorted into Slytherin, some older purebloods took him under their wing - of course he would want to blossom under them. He let himself get swept up in the whirlwind of peer-pressure and abandoned the one person who genuinely liked him. After Hogwarts, he loses his best friend and vows revenge for her death -- meaning he goes against those "friends" who took him in all those years ago.

Then he gets forced to teach small children, whom he does not relate to very well, and after suffering through that for years, his love's child shows up. Except, this child is a spitting image of his childhood Gryffindor bully.

Snape is like one of those dirty jokes cartoons toss in to keep the parents entertained. He is a complex, grey, completely convoluted character. And I love him for it.
