I second Methods of Rationality and Lady Thief, both great fics. Lady Thief has lots of break-in and break-out scenes with the Azkaban one being just one of many, if you like sneaky spy and heist action. Methods has one of my favorite scenes ever when the escape from the Dementor pit with the power of Newton's third.

Other fics with Azkaban scenes:

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has an Azkaban breakout being prepared throughout year 2 and executed in the holidays before year 3. Most of Hogwarts' smartest students help to get Black, Rookwood and the Lestranges out.

Linkffn(We are the Golden Trio) has a scene where they break Sirius out. It's adult trio in their 11 year old bodies doing a surprise attack on Azkaban with Patroni blazing, pretty epic.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) has a war with France and a scene where they break prisoners out of a french high security prison. Not Azkaban but close. Same author as Lady Thief and a similar style, but shorter.

Linkffn(Significant Digits) is a follow up to Methods of Rationality, it has another attack on Azkaban following the one in Methods, and an attack on a foreign dementor prison using kinetic bombardment.
