CaerAzkaban is a yahoo group founded and headed by Rorschach's Blot, which means it's mostly chatter and discussions with occasional snippets and story posts. Some stories are in the files section, but most are buried in tens of thousands of posts.

On the up side, most posts end up on ffnet or other archives after a while.

It's not worth it joining if you're in it only for the story posts. OTOH YMMV
