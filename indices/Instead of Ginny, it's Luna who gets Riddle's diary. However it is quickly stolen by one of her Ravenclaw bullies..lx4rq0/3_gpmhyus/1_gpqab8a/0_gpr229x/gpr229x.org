I could see Tom manipulating Luna into doing this, to be honest. He was charismatic, and she was a lonely, bullied, eleven year old girl.

Her common-sense of "not trusting anything where you can't see where it puts its brain", as said by Arthur and is something I can see Luna adhering to, would be overlooked out of her desperation/loneliness.

Her only friend was Ginny, and she's the only one who may see something amiss if they still have regular contact with one another (unlikely, due to different Houses and Ginny being a shy sheep at the moment to Harry's presence).
