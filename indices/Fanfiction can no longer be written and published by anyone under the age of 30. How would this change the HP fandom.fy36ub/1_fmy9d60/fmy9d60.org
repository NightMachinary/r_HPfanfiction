You know the satisfaction of following a story, and being able to witness the author improving with every chapter, even if it's the little things? Yeah, that'd be much harder to come by. I've never seen anyone else mention this part of reading fanfiction (or following any young and independent artist, really) but it's one of my most favourite parts of the experience, so I'd be pretty sad, I guess.

Also, things would get even more stale. Only a specific age group means less diversity, and all that.
