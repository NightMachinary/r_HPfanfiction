But you would lose out on all of the fics from young adults, college and the majority of graduate students, which comprises a big amount of the fic-writers right now. As someone else mentioned, age wouldn't necessarily help with quality. Even if it should be expected that things like grammar would improve (which I don't think is a given), I agree with the person who said that things would get stale. I think that's absolutely true.
