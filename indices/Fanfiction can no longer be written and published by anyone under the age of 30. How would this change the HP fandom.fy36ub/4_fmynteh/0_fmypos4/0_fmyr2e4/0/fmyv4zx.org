I didn't say the quality would stay the same, nor did I say it would decrease or improve. My exact words were that, "age wouldn't necessarily help with quality." What I said was, "I agree with the person who said that things would get stale," which I stand by. If you limited the writing of fiction to a particular demographic of any kind, it would get stale. Having different voices in writing is critical, even if not everyone is contributing the same caliber of material.

The quantity of poorly written "original" fiction would actually counter the argument of middle-aged authors creating works of a superior quality. There's a good amount of self-published fiction that suffers from a lack of editing, and that problem would only increase for fanfics, as there are a lot of people who do minimal/no editing when they write. While there are many examples of great older adult writers whose works are of a superior quality, this is far from standard for most writers. Age helps, but the main advantage age has is that a person would have had more time to hone their skills. But a 30-something writer who was just getting started is not going to have that advantage. A lot of fanfic writers tend to be newer writers, I doubt this would be much different for older writers, though of course there are plenty of exceptions (given that there are quite a few famous authors who have written fan fiction even after having their own works successfully published).

The quality of the writing alone isn't all that compromises the quality of a work. Yes it is an important factor, but the idea, the premise, of a work itself also contributes to quality. You would be losing out on a lot of creative premises if the works of everyone under 30 were lost. Even if you reduce that down to 20, that would account in loses, because not all teenagers have awful, overly cliche ideas, just like there are a lot of people over 30 who write the most unoriginal crap imaginable. The vast majority of fan fiction is "shitty," but, again, you can make that same argument for published works, which are overwhelmingly written by adults. So even if a lot of the poorly conceptualized fics would disappear, you would still have plenty of lower quality works too.

There's also the issue of quality having an aspect of subjectivity within it, but subjectivity is an issue with a lot of things, so I'll leave that point alone.
