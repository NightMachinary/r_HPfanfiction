Saying that the quality would stay the same is assuming that the quality of work by young adults is superior to that of middle-aged individuals, since it's a given that teenage authors are less capable on average.

If we assume that the quality of writing by all adults (let's say twenty and over) is on average the same then just taking the subset of fanfictions written by middle-aged authors would result in an average superior quality, that's all. Of course there would also be way fewer works.

I'm not saying that aging makes you a better writer beyond a certain point, I'm saying that the average quality of writing is better when you've excluded teenage-written shit.
