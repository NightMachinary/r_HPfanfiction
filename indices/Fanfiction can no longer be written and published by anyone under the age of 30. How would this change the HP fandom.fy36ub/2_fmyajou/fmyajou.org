No!!!!! Lol.

Something to consider is that 'older' writers (like myself) grew up with Harry Potter as it was being released. We got the books in installments. We had several years between releases to imagine what was going to be in the next book. Think of all the canon that didn't come out until book 5 or 6 or 7 (the Order, horcruxes, the prophecy, character deaths, etc). So there is a lot of fan-fiction that went in a completely different direction from the original novels - which is why I think we have so many categories of AU after 4th or 5th or 6th year. Sometimes writers didn't like the direction of the later books. I remember at times feeling frustrated because I wanted something to happen that didn't, or I thought the books were leading up to something and then was disappointed when I was wrong. Now consider younger writers who got to read all the books at once. I think their focus has been more on what happens /after/ book 7, because they didn't necessarily have to wait years between books.

Bonus: I think this is true for a lot of fandoms. If you are growing up with something that is released in installments, you have time to hope for something to happen in the next book, or next movie, or next series. You get disappointed if it doesn't happen, or angry if they treat your favorite character wrong. You rage against canon. You write your alternate endings and give your favorite characters the happy or tragic endings that you wanted.

For someone who gets to binge watch/read the entire source material, there's less time for that angst to grow. Take the Marvel Movie Universe, for example. How many early stories have Phil Coulson in them? A bunch! People had opinions about Phil Coulson! Emotions were fresh and left to fester for years. People guessed at what would happen with his character. But as the universe went on, his arc was solidified. To everyone playing 'catch up' and binge watching the movies, his was a minor character arc that maybe didn't need a lot of attention. Or the recent Star Wars sequels. How many stories tried to guess at Rey's origins, or provide a background for Finn or Poe? Now we know the official answers to those questions. To someone watching Marvel or Star Wars all at once, they are more content in accepting the answers provided by canon. But for those of us waiting years for the next installment, we formed our opinions. We dreamed and guessed and hoped and plotted. We were... disappointed at times. So an 'older' writer might tear apart canon more and depart from the plot. Someone younger might write more sequels to the canon, jumping off where their story left off.

Obviously, this is not true for everyone. There are plenty of younger writers out there more than happy to write an alternate 5th or 6th year, and there are older writers who are now writing more traditional sequels, stemming from the canon provided. But, I do think that this is a trend. And this has turned into a rant that part of me wants to delete because it's so long... but I won't because I have strong opinions about fanfic, lol.
