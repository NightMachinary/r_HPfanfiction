Yeah I do understand that Evil!Dumbledore does have some merits. In Hogwarts a Super!Harry doesn't have many obstacles to overcome; Quirrell, stone obstacles, basilisk, Tournament, and Voldemort's plots become trivial things to overcome especially if Harry is time traveling and does not have to solve any of the mystery surrounding these events. So in order to have some competent evil in Hogwarts the role goes to Dumbledore. But most fics with Evil!Dumbledore doesn't make him a real threat just something for Harry to bash and complain about, and where Dumbledore never even has a chance to ruin any of Harry's plans and whatnot.
