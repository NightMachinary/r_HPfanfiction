  But if using an Evil!Dumbledore is just a plot device to make Harry more tragic, angsty, or independent, I believe there are better and easier ways to achieve this.

I think there's another reason for an Evil!Dumbledore: More adversity for Harry. In most fanfics Harry becomes more competent than canon and that lends itself to making Dumbledore another obstacle to overcome.

  Because Dumbledore is mostly the sole way to feed Harry information that moves the plot along, he is blamed for with holding information and not raising him for warfare and whatever else. The story wants Harry to have a childhood and him training to be a magical badass who is Voldemort's equal in terms of deity like powers would not be a story about childhood.

I think this is a bit too simplistic. As someone who criticizes Dumbledore a lot my main point wouldn't be that he didn't raise Harry into some kind of super-warlock to defeat Voldemort. The point that Harry should have a childhood is a good one, but when viewing Harry through the "innocent child" lens Dumbledore's negligence becomes even more horrifying.
