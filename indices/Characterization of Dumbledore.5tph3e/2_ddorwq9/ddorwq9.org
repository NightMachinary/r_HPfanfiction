One of the flaws in young adult fiction is that adults end up needing to be pushed out of the way for the story to progress. My simple version of this is that " Aall adults in YA novels must be evil, incompetent, or both. If they were not, why would children have to solve anything? "

Dumbledore in canon falls victim to this rule and thus fanfiction writers take it to the extreme, often with good intentions, but poor execution.
