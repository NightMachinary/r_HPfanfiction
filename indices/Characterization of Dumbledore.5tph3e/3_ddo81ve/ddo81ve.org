If Dumbledore was really evil and ruthless, he would have neutralized that upstart Riddle in his office back in 1957.

IMO, Dumbledore was a great failure who ABSOLUTELY failed to live up to his reputation. I have ranted several times about this topic, so I won't bore you with more repetitions. Here are some links to my past comments:

Because of his ineffectiveness, he resorted to sacrificing children in desperation, and even then he failed to adequately prepare them. Being a 'good person' didn't excuse a leader's failure. Both Neville Chamberlain and Herbert Hoover were considered 'good people', but they were viewed as abject failures in history, and Dumbledore should be remembered the same way.
