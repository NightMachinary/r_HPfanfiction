Isn't Neville Chamberlain's bad reputation the result of character assassination, though?

It's easy to point to Nazi Germany as obvious bad guys today, but back then, British people didn't know about the planned Holocaust, and didn't want to get into another World War just 20 years after the first one. And Neville did pursue a policy of rearmament even after signing the Munich Agreement.

Sorry, it just bugs me when people say bad things about Chamberlain.
