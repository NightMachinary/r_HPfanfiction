Actually, Chamberlain gets a lot of flak he doesn't deserve. While it is true he initially followed a policy of appeasement, once it was realised that Germany was re-arming, he immediatelly begun secret war preparations for Britain - and once it became obvious that war was unavoidable, he resigned, fully aware he wasn't an appropriate PM for war.

Now, take a look in history and count the politicians that have gracefully stepped aside and admitted they weren't qualified to lead, instead of clinging to power.
