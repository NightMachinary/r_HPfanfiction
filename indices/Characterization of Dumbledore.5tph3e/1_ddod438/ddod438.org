Dumbledore is a tricky topic, for a number of reasons.

First off, we have to consider issues with the canon. In canon, most things stand alone pretty decently. Rowling had specific IRL reasons why she made some of her calls. But the fandom community thrives of digging deeper, making the HP world more and more real, by going piece by piece through every detail. And every so often, they come across things which aren't logical, which do not stand up with the chains of cause and effect that we see in real life. And these details, are often those self-same details that Rowling put in because she was aiming at a particular concept. It is similar to if God just suddenly made a person win the lottery. It would be a completely intentional act to do to a person, but the rest of the world is not in on the act, and must assign some reason to it, such as luck, despite the odds. This is seen particularly in how the books went. If this all went down in real life, then Harry would of course be trained, and raised from birth as a soldier. There would be no other option. But that doesn't constitute a good story, to thus the illogical option is taken, and Harry is put with the Dursleys. The fandom needs to realize that at the end of the day, it wasn't Dumbledore who wanted Harry abused, it was Rowling who wanted Harry to be sympathized with and supported.

That aside, there are issues I have with the bash Dumbledore trope. The fact of the matter is, it is inherently a lazy shortcut for unoriginal authors to continue their plot. Evil! Dumbledore has the effect of providing a second enemy, a foil who acts out the intelligent enemy. And thus, we get two enemy's, Voldemort being the enemy of magic, and Dumbledore the enemy of intelligence. Dumbledore can only be defeated by intelligence, usually by tricking him into some political demise. And Voldemort can only be defeated by magic. This has a couple effects. Lazy writers use this to showcase Harry's traits, with the reasoning that if Harry could defeat such a smart wizard, then he himself must be smart. They then follow this up with a separation from Hermione and intensive studying to prove that Harry is smarter than the rest. I call this lazy, because it doesn't showcase Harry and his character development, it doesn't showcase it through his actions. In my mind, it is like having Harry take a (American) GED in one scene, and thus not have to writing about school, and education. Which itself is an annoyingly common trope. Another thing that this Evil!Dumbledore stereotype does, is it allows Harry to become independent. In my opinion a large amount of writers like to project with Harry as their target. And in that sense, a lot of the worse quality fics are nothing but original characters named Harry. The writer wants to be respected? Make Harry the heir to the founders, and don't forget to add trillions of Galleons. The writer wishes to be powerful? Give Harry the largest magical core that exists. The writer wants to be competant? Make Harry smooth and intelligent in all his dealings, buttering up Goblins, sticking Voldemort and dodging Dumbledore. The writer wants to be independent? Make Harry independent. But from what, is the crux of this post. Harry has no family. Harry's only superiors consist of the Hogwarts staff, but it isn't enough to insult Snape and get away with it. Dumbledore is the biggest person around, so making him bigger and badder, and devoting the fic to Harry getting out of his control fulfills their fantasy.

Now, I want to clear it up a bit. I have read good stories with the tropes I have listed. The tropes are not inherently worthless. The reason for my virulent hatred of them, is because they are so often used as an excuse for bad writing, and I cannot excuse that. Bad writing, lazy writing, are personally offensive to me. I am aware that I am a hypocrite, as the most popular fic I wrote has all of that, and worse writing than most besides. I hate it, but I don't delete it because I have to remind myself that I can do better.

Personal emotions aside, I have always found that I like Dumbledore better when he is good. When Dumbledore is a flawed, tragic old man carrying the weight of the world. He might be quirky, he might be funny, or take on the role as a teacher, or grandfather. But so long as he is not malicious in his actions, or malevolent, the story always turns out better.

Some examples:

linkffn(Circular Reasoning) linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) HPMOR linkffn(Deprived) linkffn(The Arithmancer) linkffn(Divided and Entwined) Even linkffn(Too Young to Die) counts to an extent.

TLDR: Writers love to take the HP world as they see it, and judge it by their logic, when their logic cannot truly apply. It is most often an excuse for lazy writing, and OP seems to recognize a lot of it.
