Just a tad rambley. Anyway, my take on Dumbledore is old man trying to do his best. His best just tends not to line up with everyone else's. He is a man who in my opinion is scared of power and what it did to his best friend but had it thrust upon him. I can't remember which story it was but it suggested many of his roles were given to him in an attempt to appease him after he proved he was more powerful than Grindelwald. This is a man whose central belief is that we are defined by our choices. That everyone deserves the right to make their own choices and will always try to let people choose for themselves. See Draco in 6th year. Combine him wanting others to act for themselves with him not wanting the power given to him goes a long way to explaining why he seems so reluctant to do anything. He's terrified of becoming benevolent dictator with nobody who can balance him out. That the power will remove his perspective and he'll fall back into the views he held as teenager; the idea that muggles and people that he is superior to should be led by their betters for their own good.

With regards to evil Dumbledore, whenever I think canon I think back to the policies of the Dursleys. Often forgotten but the mantra drilled into Harry as child was 'don't ask questions.' JKR is a fantastic story teller, just roll with it and don't ask quiestions. Unfortunately, we love the world she's build we want to know more, to analyse everything and the plot holes etc come out. In my opinion on of the best things I ever heard was to never attribute to malice, what can be attributed to stupidity. Now take a plot hole, make the mistake of instead of someone making a mistake, JKR or a character and call it malicious and then mistakes are the result of evil. The idea that every mistake, every time when something stupid happened was a deliberate act in some greater plan. Who makes big plans, should know better and is in position to manipulate everything, Its Dumbledore.It can be entertaining, spin on certain things can have you thinking and it does allow some interesting ideas. It also provides a great villain, you have the establishment vs little Harry. It aides all those trying to do redeemed Snape/Draco etc. Or you can have a three-way brawl between the Order vs Death Eaters vs underdog Harry. This gives scope to huge battles and internal conflict as Harry questions whether the Order are evil or simply misled.

Tl;dr Never attribute to Malice what can be blamed on stupidity or else it all becomes a grand evil plan and we have a known plotter with a beard and opportunity. We love to see our heroes fall, else we wouldn't have the paparazzi etc.
