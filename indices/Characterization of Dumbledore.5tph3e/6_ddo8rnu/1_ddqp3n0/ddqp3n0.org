Yeah I understand there are some merits, I just feel that the troupe is so overdone at this point that while it gives Harry a place to shine and think for himself it ultimately ends up taking more away from the story then it adds. Who knows though I have never been a fan of bashing of any character, and Evil!Dumbledore stories usually bash him liberally so that may color my opinion of them.
