[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] skewers Evil!Dumbledore like everything else, but its reasoning makes sense; basically Dumbledore as a super-powerful wizard has to be removed in order to let Harry Potter or Oliver Cromwell shine, because if he weren't removed he could just solve all the problems.

Thus, when a problem needs to be solved with firepower, Dumbledore has to be a moron, evil, out of the way, or some combination of all three. Alternatively, boss fights where Harry/Oliver & Dumbledore team up to whoop ass because the bad guy is just that tough.

So yeah, there's a reason Evil!Dumbledore exists, it's very hard to make Independent!Harry work without it. Although I suppose such fics could go the route of canon and let Dumbledore be a good guy, but inexplicably called away whenever Harry needs to do something by himself.

(Also, I was trying to come up with a clever way to say 'O.C.', as in Original Character, as in Mary Sue, and Oliver Cromwell came to mind. Does it work?)
