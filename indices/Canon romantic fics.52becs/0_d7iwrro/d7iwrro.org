A lot of people love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][*The First Day* by Little0Bird]] for canon pairings. Especially because it picks up RIGHT after the battle at the end of DH. Personally it isn't my favorite because the author doesn't put chapter breaks in the right places (ever?) but it is well written and although depressing is probably pretty accurate head canon.

Right now everyone on this sub, myself included, are LOVING [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. The are not only canon pairings but CC compliant fics. The twist is that there is an Albus/Scorpius relationship, but even that is CC compliant with how she did it and so well done (even if youre not huge on slash - it isnt graphic at all).

These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend them! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)
