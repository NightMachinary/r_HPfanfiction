Little0Bird has the same problem as me when it comes to breaks - sometimes they take, sometimes they don't, and I can't work out what exactly I'm doing differently from chapter to chapter. Stupid ff.net.

I second all these recs though, you beat me to it!

I would also recommend Northumbrian - he's got LOADS of stories, all canon.
