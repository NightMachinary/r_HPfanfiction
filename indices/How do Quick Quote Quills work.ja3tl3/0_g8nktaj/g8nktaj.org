  “Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.” Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations --- “Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her

  He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.

Probably a combination of your second and third ideas. It's clear that many enchanted objects usually have a degree of sentiency in HP. I'd say that this one does. It's clear the quill remembers its previous work for Skeeter or at the very least has knowledge of her. It's twisting the narrative to support Skeeter's agenda but also itself. It hints towards itself with "savage quill". But it's also an enchanted object made for use. It's deliberately designed to help its owner quickly come up with memorable quotes.
