I know of 2, both are on the short side though. I was disappointed after Luna was introduced then had no role w/ the epilogue... anyway. The first is *[[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=245704/]] Forgetting Alone] and the second is *[[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=301180/]] Like Being with a Friend]. The author mentioned a sequel for that long ago but I have yet to see it. Not much story, but she is well written

edit:Well I cannot figure out hyper links via phone but there you go
