This is my favorite ship, too! But everyone always goes on and on about how Ginny is much better suited. I just don't like that ship as much because it seems cliche for the hero of the story to get the most popular girl. I like Harry x Luna because you get this curiosity on Harry's end. Normally he's always sticking his nose into things about Voldemort or other conspiracies, but with this it's just such a cuter curiosity. I also think it's a more interesting writing point when the two people are in different houses. (At least for pre DH) Then you can have all of those scenes where they have to sneak out to see each other. Thanks for the story though.
