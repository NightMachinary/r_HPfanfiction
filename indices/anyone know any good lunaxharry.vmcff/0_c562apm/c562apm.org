It's a shame about Harry x Luna. It's easily my favorite ship, but Luna is by far the hardest character in the series to write. Especially when writing her in a romance, you need to keep the spirit of her character alive, keeping her mature enough to make the romance not feel creepy on Harry's end, and weird enough that you don't start to go to far into "Luna flake" territory. I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle_in_the_Jungle_A_Harry_Potter_Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and the sequel, but flake Luna tends to feel like a copout.

I don't have any recommendations, just felt like sharing my thoughts.
