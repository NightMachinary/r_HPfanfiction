That is a very good argument and I fully agree, given the definition of manipulative you gave.

However, I always knew the words "Manipulation" "manipulativ" (as I am Austrian, hence German is my native language) as something that means to merely interfere in order to make others do what you desire. It doesn't necessarily have to be to your advantage. Thats why I think he /is/ manipulative. Once again, he is not in the way fanon paints him, but way more subtle and less frequent. All in all he is a good man, a wise wizard and anyone could hope to have a grandfather like him.

Its a bit of a anticlimactic thing to blame definitions, but it is nonetheless true.
