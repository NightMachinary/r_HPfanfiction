  While Dumbledore did actively interfere in Harry's life, I wouldn't call that manipulative, not when he's done it for Harry's good (happiness and safety).

Ands some would argue that it is manipulative since he didn't inform Harry of it right away.

I really do think that I'm the wrong partner of discussion here. The german word is much less negative and actually describes these small influences, as you described in your example. The only condition that has to be fulfilled is that you have a reaction in mind before you try to steer your opponent towards it by your action.
