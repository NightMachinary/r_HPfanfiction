He is a teenager throughout the books. The last boy from a family of super-succesful boys and the designated sidekick of the most famous person in the british wizarding world. I think its excused if sometimes that's a bit too much for his ego to take.

I'm not a fan of his character, I'll admit it. But as far as loyal goes, he was probably the most "realistic" representation of loyalty between teenage best friends.
