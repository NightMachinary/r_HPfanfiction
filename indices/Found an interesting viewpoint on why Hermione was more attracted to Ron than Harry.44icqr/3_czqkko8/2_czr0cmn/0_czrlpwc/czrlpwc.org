Well said. I don't think I'll ever be 100% on the Ron bandwagon, but he's definitely the character that gets bashed the most often for little reason. It's particularly annoying when it happens in a 'romance' story as an excuse to get Harry and Hermione together.

There are several times in the series where he displays a supernatural level of bravery in the face of almost certain death. At other times his ego gets in the way of his decision-making abilities. I blame JKR, not Ron for that problem. There were times in her story where she wanted Harry to truly feel alone and her favourite way of doing that was to have his best mate blow up in a fit of jealousy. It felt like she was cheating her own narrative by giving Ron a rather drastic character flaw at one of the worst possible moments. He didn't appear to be jealous of Harry's addition to the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. AFAIK Ron never blew his top at any of Harry's other successes either. The GoF incident felt like a bolt from the blue.

That being said, Ron doesn't exist in a vacuum. Hermione believed that Harry hadn't entered his name in the TWT. Fred and George didn't bear Harry any ill will for succeeding where they had failed. Even Cedric was kinder to Harry before the First Task than his best mate. This makes the gap in Ron's character harder to explain away.
