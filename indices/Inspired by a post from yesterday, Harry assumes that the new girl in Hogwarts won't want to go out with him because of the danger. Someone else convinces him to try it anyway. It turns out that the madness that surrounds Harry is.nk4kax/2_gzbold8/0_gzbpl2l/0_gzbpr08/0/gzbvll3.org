We do unfortunately, the two extra days are called Wulliesday and Brusday. Wulliesday was only added recently, commemorating Oor Wullie. It was a ploy by the Clydeside shipyards in the 60s to save money and maximise profit by making their workers work the new day, but pegging their wages to the international standard week.

Brusday has a convoluted origin. Folk Etymology would say it's named after The Bru, since everyone uses it to recover from getting mad wae it at the weekend. However, this is not the case. The day is named in honour of The Bruce, and dates from the Protestant Reformation when The Kirk of Scotland banned Christmas. The Kirk used Brusday as a replacement alongside Hogmanay and the 2nd January. As a result, Christmas wasn't widely celebrated, at least officially (People may have celebrated privately but it wasn't a public holiday) until the 1950s.
