I'd imagine it's just life in general intruding on fic time. At least, I hope it is. The man is too good a writer to have anything serious happen. He does write professionally as well I think, even if it isn't fiction, so maybe he's just slammed.

Best of luck to you Mr. Wolfe whatever is happening. :)
