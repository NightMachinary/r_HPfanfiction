Because Death won't get involved in the war, nobody can die for war related things. All Order members and Death Eaters members and Voldemort, cannot die in battle with each other.

(But they can die, for example, if Bellatrix and Narcissa and Andromeda fight each other for whom has the more beautiful hair, for example; or for illness, or have strange accidents)
