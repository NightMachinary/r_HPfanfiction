I mean its an idea, but Harry would want to stick with the cloak cause of the whole, James owning before him. I don't really see that flying with canon!Harry much less fanon!Harry. Although if death phrased it as "his old cloak" it might work, but most likely not. And he would also have to take Dumbledore's Elder Wand Of Deathstickingâ„¢ and I don't see him getting hired if that's a possibility.
