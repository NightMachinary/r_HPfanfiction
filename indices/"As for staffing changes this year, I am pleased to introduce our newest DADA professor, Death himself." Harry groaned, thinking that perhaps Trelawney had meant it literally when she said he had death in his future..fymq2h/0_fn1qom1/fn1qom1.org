"And on another hand, I am pleased to introduce this years Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Death!"

The usual scattered applause broke out in the Great Hall, none except a few muggleborns looking perplexed. Harry looked around wildly, about to dismiss it as a coincidence, but of course he dismissed the idea as Fate (maybe she would be their divitination teacher next) would never give him the luxury of a coincidence.

As Ron delved into the depths of his food, and Hermione pursued her latest book, Harry tried to sound as non committal as possible (for he would certainly not be making a fuss if no one else was- God forbid he be seen as delusional yet /again/)

"Hey, y'know when Dumbledore said Death, I really thought they were gonna be Professor Death Eater." Ron sniggered slightly, but Hermione winced.

"Harry! That really was not funny and if you had a smidgen of co- /wait/"

She gave Harry an (in his holy opinion) a very undeserved death glare.

"Did you not read up on this?" seeing Harry about to complain, Hermione continued, "No of course you didn't,"

"Harry. You /do/ know that /Professor/ Death is actually the deity, right? And that he will teach us all of our classes invisible? And that he will somehow manage to teach us depite the fact he has no mouth, and even if he did he certainly wouldn't speak English? You didn't know that? "

Harry blinked. " Of course I did Hermione, don't be silly. I only wondered when /Professor/ Death would be reporting to his master."

Aka: its 2am and I have 10% battery so this doesn't make any sense
