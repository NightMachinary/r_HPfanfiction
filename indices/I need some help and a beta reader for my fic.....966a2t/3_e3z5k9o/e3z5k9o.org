Sorry, but this post is just plain rude. Personally, I think the relationship between an author and a beta is pretty important. There needs to be trust and respect. Your post looks like you are doing someone a favour. And what's up with "must be a native speaker"? My beta has a degree in English lit. There is no one better. And she isn't a native speaker.
