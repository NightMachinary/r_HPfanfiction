It sounds as if you think you are the one doing the favour here!

Seriously you need to be at least some way into the process and have several fairly polished chapters to share. It's not really fair to ask someone to commit to a project that you might not even finish, especially if it looks like being a long term commitment. You also need to let us know some basic things about your fic. Who are the main characters and premise, what period is it set in, what is the genre, how long is it and so on.

I know not everyone agrees, but personally I think the time to look for a beta is when you have a complete draft ready to go.
