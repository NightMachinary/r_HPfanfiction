Im only asking for a email because this project is special to me, and I really wanna know that whoever is going to help me is committed. I can't put this to word- so I'll just say this, I need a Samwise to my Frodo.

About the premise of the fic- its a 4th year AU with an Independent Harry. He is a big time loner. Only one friend in three years at Hogwarts.

Sorted into Ravenclaw. I will write new tasks, and Im doing away with the age line, instead I have something else in my mind. PM me for anymore info that you may want....provided they are not my mother' maiden name, my first pet, the name of my favorite teacher in elementary school, etc. ðŸ˜‰
