As others have already said, you need to think about the way you're advertising this.

I've been a beta for a couple of very popular authors and offered my help because I already enjoyed their work and thought I could help out.

Things worked very differently too - for one I was looking over one finished chapter per week, polishing grammar, making a few suggestions here and there and generally being a proofreader. For another, it's a totally different process as I tend to receive a few hundred words at a time and then we bounce thoughts and ideas. For two others, I was acting pretty much as a mentor to people without a firm grip on the language or writing in general.

So instead of listing requirements for a beta, you should be telling people what you're trying to do, how you're going about doing it, and how they'll fit in.

Alternatively, publish some chapters, say you're looking for a beta or two, and see who bites.
