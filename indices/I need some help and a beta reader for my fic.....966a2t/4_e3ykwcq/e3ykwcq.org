One thing you neglected to include in your reddit post would be the type of story you are writing.

What is the pairing? M/F? Hermione/Draco? Harry/GiantSquid?

What is the genre? Angst? Romance? Adventure?

Is it an AU or Canon Compliant?

Do you have a vision (outline) already in place? What sorts of fics do you envision your story being similar to?

In short: What sort of story are you writing? That way potential beta's know whether its something they would be interested in helping with.
