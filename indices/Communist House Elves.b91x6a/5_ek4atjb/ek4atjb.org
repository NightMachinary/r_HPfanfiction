[[https://snape-potter.dreamwidth.org/162365.html]] has Dimple the Socialist House Elf.

  "Elves in slavery aren't encouraged to better themselves," Dimple informed him, "and quite frankly, we do the 'Master mustn't be angry with Dimple! Dimple is a good elf!' crap in order to lull you all into a sense of false security. When the revolution comes, the Goblin wars will seem like a picnic in the park in comparison; or at least, they would, if we could be arsed to actually revolt."

  "Merlin," Harry said faintly. "I didn't realise you were a communist elf." Dimple shrugged.

  "A socialist, actually. I'm not impressed with the Muggle communist experiments, to be honest. But someone's got to run the country and elves seem in the main to be content to let wizards and witches do it. We have dreams of taking over the holiday islands of Lyonesse and Ys, but frankly, there's only so much time you can spend lazing on the beach eating ice cream or playing Wizarding bingo before your brain dissolves and leaks out of your ears."

  She pattered off back to the basement, humming something that sounded suspiciously like The Red Flag.
