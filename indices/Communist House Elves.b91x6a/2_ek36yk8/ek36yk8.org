Yes, one beautiful aspects of linkffn(7211094) is a May, house-elf reading Marx and dreaming about emancipation of the working class. Another interesting aspect of the story is that it tries to deal with families of all involved (mainly Evanses), which is kind of interesting point. Under normal circumstances people have their grandparents around: where are grandparents in the HP universe? Aside from Grans Longbottom and eventually Tonks, there are almost no older generations of ancestors in the HP universe than parents. Isn't it weird?
