The Hogsmeade permission slip I feel was more a formality, there just needed to be an adult's signiture on there. Given how all the arguments for banning him would have been equally valid even if the Dursleys had signed it, and how cheerfully McGonagall ignores school rules when she wants to, Harry would have been banned that year regardless.

I feel the more compelling argument for it is how there never seems to be any notification of non-magical parents of their children's problems. I know that the petrification was viewed as entirely harmless and reversible, but it still seems weird that as far as we know Hermione's parents were never told. Also when Harry was summoned to court in book 5 (although there were a whole bunch of irregularities) he was represented by Dumbledore, and the Dursleys as far as we know were never informed. That suggests that muggles are not viewed as responsible for their magical children when it comes to purely magical matters.

So overall I feel it is never explicitly stated, but it is a valid intepretation of what we see of canon. Although given how little of the actual legal system we see, that doesn't necessarily mean much.
