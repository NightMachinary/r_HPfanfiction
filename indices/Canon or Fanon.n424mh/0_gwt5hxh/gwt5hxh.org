Not in the least. Based on Professor McGonagall's denial for Harry to go to Hogsmeade in book 3, even the legal concept of the school administration operating in loco parentis is dubious. That said, McG had reasons to deny Harry's request that year even if she did effectively have the authority, so all you can say is "there's no explicit designation like that". Complicating it slightly, Sirius signs Harry's permission slip for the next two years, so it may be a thing as far as godparents being more than a ceremonial designation.
