Thanks for the recommend!! A good story is gold enough for me. :D I read SO MUCH fanfiction... I currently have three tabs of different stories open on my ipad, 2 on my desktop, and I'm always looking for more to queue up....... Not to mention the 75+ alerts I have on FF.net!

So yeah, the more stories the merrier! Reddit Gold would just take away from how much time I have to read fanfiction. ;)
