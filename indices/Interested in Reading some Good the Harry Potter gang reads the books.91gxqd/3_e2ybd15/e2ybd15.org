Never saw any that were good, and there used to be thousands of them before they got purged from FFN. TBH, not sure how anyone could make it through them, since it was almost always just full of characters reacting with the author's metaknowledge. Always seemed cringey to me.

I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they all got shifted to some other archive site, though I don't know what site that would be. Probably ao3.
