It's been a while since I read RC last, but IIRC it was a way to let Harry get out of Hogwarts and fool anyone trying to follow him or w/e. Plus, you know, plausible deniability. "I wasn't there and you can't prove it". I think it was mentioned that simulamancy was the perfect disguise, even with all the stuff magic can do like Polyjuice and self-transfiguration. Plus it involved Tonks' blood, which lead to some not-directly-spelled out implications that something went really wrong, as in the whole HIS NAME IS HARRY POTTER thing. As a subplot, it was left without closure, but I thought it might have been explored in the sequel before it was abandoned.
