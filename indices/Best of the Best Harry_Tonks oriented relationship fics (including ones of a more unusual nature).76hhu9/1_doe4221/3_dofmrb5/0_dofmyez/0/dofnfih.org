I thought so. Could you explain that bit to me? That was my biggest problem with the whole fic and the issues it created kinda turned me off, I can't remember if I finished this fic or not.

For one thing, it seems pointless, like it was a literary device to create conflict out of nothing. The original reason for why they did it was something like "We need a solution now, this is the best we got", which would be fine, except for the fact that the solution was /not/ the best solution they had. One of the worst. Even setting that aside, they kept bringing stuff up about problems the Simulacrum was causing and then it never really built up to anything except for a certain death. After that it was forgotten and I guess he had free reign.
