Since most of the Honks fics i've read i've found by turning on the favorites filter with tonks selected in the character filter, and don't see why you can do the same, I'll reccomend (Harry Potter and the Half Blood Auror) which is discontinued and no longer on ffn. Google it its still on many sites. Features a well characterized tonks and a slow building relationship.
