I love the Honks concept, and beyond Summer of Change this is probably my favorite. ffn(8175132) Jamie Evans and Fates Fool is a Honks story with a reality skipping Harry who ends up gender-bent in this reality. Personally I'm not a fan of those stories, but this one was recommended often enough that I gave it a shot, and I'm very happy I did.
