I'm actually reading Sin & Vice right now and I'm finding it very well written considering a lot of what's out there for this ship. Pretty much all the major issues with this ship have been addressed, the characterization works given the plot events, my only issue is Snape's characterization. But I'm only at chapter 20 so we'll certainly see.
