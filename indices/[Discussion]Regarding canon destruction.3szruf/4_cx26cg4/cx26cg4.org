Bound to You is another super squicky Severus/Hermione. And I'm actually a fan of Severus/Hermione only not while Hermione's a student. Never ever ever while Hermione's a student. Bound to you is another one that's basically "rape is so romantic" except in this case it's "repeated rape is so romantic".

Also the number of unintended pregnancies in Severus/Hermione fanfiction drives me up the wall. Any fic where Hermione gets pregnant and after a short period of deciding what to do decides to keep it despite that screwing up all her life goals is a fic I immediately abandon. The exception is Sin & Vice, which is a Severus/Hermione that gets rid of pretty much all the elements that non-shippers seem to find squicky
