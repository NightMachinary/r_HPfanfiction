Well, I love fanfiction that walks all over canon - at least if the writing is good (ok: the pairing has to be ok, too - I can't stomach slash -.- particularly Harry with Draco or with Snape (hell: I can read other slash fiction, I might cringe occasionally but I can read it...can't say the same about the same about those pairings))
