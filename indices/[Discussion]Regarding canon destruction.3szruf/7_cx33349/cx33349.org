Wow, I didn't expect this kind of response to my first post, thanks guys! Having so many others echo the same sentiments does wonders for a battered morale.

That said, this is probably what the author thought after reading reviews for the infamous chapter 14: /"I aimed for the fandom's heart, and by accident I hit it in the libido."/

Honestly. The warning was as follows: /"The following chapter includes a graphic description of violence. It is not meant to be titillating in ANY way, or to romanticize this kind of violence. It is, however, meant to relay a sense of sacrifice and courage under fire."/

Indeed, I was overwhelmed with a sense of sacrificed honor and congratulated myself for courageously surviving the fic.

If you swapped a typical harem fic and this one, it would be mistaken for actual smut. Down to the capitalization of the word "nature" a la certain porn sites.
