Honestly, I can almost a forgive a story for being complete shite if it clearly only exists for the sole reason of promoting the author's OTP. That happens a lot with fanfiction, authors and readers get so wrapped up in the cuteness and romance of the fic and then completely forget that everything else about it is complete crap.

I think we all know by now that Harmony shippers(at least a large portion of them) are the most infamous when it comes to stuff like this, but I always find the reviews to be much more interesting than the stories. I mean, when you have a story about Harry and Hermione being psychopaths who brain damage Ron into oblivion and come out on top, then see a review that claims how in character everyone is, you raise an eyebrow so hard, that it busts out of your head and into space.

I think the main reason behind it is people get so caught up in fanfiction that they forget all the details in canon, because you don't get a vibe that anyone knows what they are talking about, especially in fanfiction profiles. How many false Draco tropes do we have by now? Draco in leather pants, Draco the Slytherin sex God, Draco the extremely intelligent, Draco and the rough and abusive childhood, Draco who totes had feelings for Hermione throughout every book 4 realsies. Pretty much everything that keeps the Dramione express going.

I've come to realise that making sense out of it doesn't really work though. I once wrote a fic taking the piss out the awful portion of Harmony shippers, debunking every problem with their beliefs and still got a review or two that was basically a copy and paste of one of their fanfic profiles.
