I got a real kick out of your post. May your mental scars fade. Even as a person who's read a fair amount of Hermione/Snape. What can I say, except different folks, different strokes.

That being said Hinge of Fate is atrocious. Oh my stars, I hate it. By some wonderful miracle of luck I thankfully did not read it as a teenager. Only very recently have I come back to the fanfiction scene, and then I found this motherfucker. I couldn't. I haven't gotten past chapter 4 or 5 it hurt so much to wrap my head around this fic. The inexplicable choice at the beginning, the casual conversation with your memory erased rapist about apparition lessons. The complete massacre of Dumbledore as a character in the first two chapters.

I take away from all this: You can't control what people write. You can only rant online and entertain kindred spirits.
