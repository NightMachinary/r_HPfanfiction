I've been saving up a rant for something like this. Who the FUCK thinks that Hermione/Severus or Severus/Potter or any fucking student teacher shit is a good pairing?! Seriously, it's creepy as fuck in so many ways AND it's rape in at least 2. Even the Hogwarts x Giant Squid is more romantic than the bullshit those stories shovel AND it's more original in it's plot than the stories that seem to go about as far as "hey, I watched some porn with this plot, gimme a second to pull my pants and grab some tissues down before I start writing." I mean goddamn, the writers for that stuff either have as many issues as Perfect Lionheart or are laughing their asses off that the creepyass basement dwellers lurking around dropping reviews taking things too seriously.

Edut: And that's not even getting started on the writing, seriously, you read most of these fics and you'd think they were typing with their dick. Come to think of it, considering the content of the shit you're talking about they probably are. Oh, and If I see another fic that talks about fucking tongue wrestling I think I might end up killing someone.

Edit 2: AND FUCK MARY SUE BULLSHIT. I want a good story with an interesting narrator that brings two universes together, not one that has 11 year old Harry fucking Potter dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, resurrecting Tom's diary as an inferii thing to interrogate it, while eveyone's constantly harping on about how talented the conceited little fucker is. Seriously, I wanted a good crossover between the Fate universe and the Harry Potter one. I saw Fate's Gamble and I figured, Hey, It's got a lot of fans. It can't be that bad, right? WRONG MOTHER FUCKER! Looking on the bright side, I did end up finding a good crossover (phenominal acutally) in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]], where nobody's pulling Bullshit out of their ass fast enough to solve world hunger.
