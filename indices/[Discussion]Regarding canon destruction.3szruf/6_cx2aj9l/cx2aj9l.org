I have never read reviews saying rape was romantic (thankfully). However, in stories with this theme, it is important to note the man didn't want to do it either but had no real choice. I don't think it's a healthy basis for a relationship, but the premise is that they're both traumatized by the same event.

I read stories with this theme more for the hurt/comfort aspect of it than the romance. Some of them don't even have a romance plot in there, just Angst/Hurt/Comfort.
