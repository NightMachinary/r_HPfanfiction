I automatically dislike any Hermione pairing that's been justified using any iteration of the line 'they're intellectual equals'. (And btw, Voldemort/Riddle and Hermione aren't magical equals, he *far* outstrips her. Draco is closer, but I think there's more evidence that she's more intelligent. Severus is the closest, but I'd argue he's more creative/intellectually motivated whereas Hermione is more principle oriented.) I *loathe* professor/student and the general vibe of Sevmione.
