*/Well/* if this teacher was telling you all the gods of ancient mythology that were debunked centuries ago you would be a bit sceptical. She was mainly rude by just speaking without asking and loudly asking questions about it and saying things like:

' But all these Gods were debunked ages ago, surely it's not true?'

She thinks shes just asking a question but her tone is aggressive and rude.
