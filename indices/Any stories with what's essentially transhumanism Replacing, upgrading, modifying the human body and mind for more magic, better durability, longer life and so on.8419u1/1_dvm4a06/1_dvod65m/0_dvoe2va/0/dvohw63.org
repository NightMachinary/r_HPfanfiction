Thanks. It's something that's stuck with me ever since I finished my business course, and started working in management positions. I finish all written correspondence with a thanks(for them taking the time to read from me), and then my name(to introduce myself).

I got people complaining about it, but I thought i'd keep it up, because i'd rather annoy a few people, and stay in the habit of finishing letters/posts instead of forgetting about doing it, and losing possible clients.

Thanks,

Warryn.
