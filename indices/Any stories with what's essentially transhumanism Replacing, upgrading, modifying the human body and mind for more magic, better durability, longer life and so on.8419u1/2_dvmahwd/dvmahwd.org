I know of two stories with physical alterations.

"Dead Man Walking" is about Harry coming from a more war oriented Universe into a more canon-esque. I guess you could call Harry in that story a magical cyborg. His home universe was a lot more war oriented and he didn't really learn Hogwars curriculum. Pretty damaged mentally. linkffn(12188248)

"The Art of Self Fashoning" is about non-bwl Harry. His parents share Neville's parents' canon fate. He makes it his goal to heal them and his way to do so is transfiguration. On his way he starts altering his own body with transfiguration to make him stronger, faster, etc. linkffn(11585823)
