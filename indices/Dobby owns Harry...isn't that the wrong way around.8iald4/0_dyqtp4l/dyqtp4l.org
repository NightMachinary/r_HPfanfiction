*The Gryffindor Common Room*

"Hey, Harry, whatcha reading?" Ron asked.

Harry lowered the magic book in his hands and gave a half-smile to the redhead, "Oh, just some dumb fanfiction about me."

Ron raised his eyebrows, "Let me guess...super-exclamation-point-you with a huge inheritance from Gringotts? Again? With incompetent 'Greater Good' Dumbledore thrown in?" he guessed.

Harry shook his head, "Worse. This one has some kind of Right of Conquest thing. Apparently because Voldemort-"

Ron silently mimed a dramatic scream and clutching his hands over his ears.

"-was blown up by mum's protection when I was a year old, and I killed Quirrel with that same protection in 1st year, then destroyed his horcrux in 2nd year, I've apparently defeated him three times which makes me eligible to claim the entirety of the Slytherin estate..."

Harry flipped through his magic fanfiction-showing book, "...And, yes, that apparently involves stripping Voldemort-" Another mimed scream of anguish, "-of his magic at a whim, and taking all of his Death Eaters as slaves because apparently, having the Dark Mark counts as a slave brand and means they're legally-magically classified as chattel."

Ron snorted, "That's ridiculous. If that were the case then that one tattooist on Diagon Alley could take over magical Britain overnight."

Harry giggled at the mental image, before another thought occurred to him, causing him to snort louder than Ron, "Or, or...remember my second year, again? How Dobby-"

There was a quiet pop, "Did Harry Potter sir call for Dobby?" the suddenly-appearing house-elf squeaked hopefully.

Harry blinked, "...No? I was, um."

"We were just talking about you, mate," Ron explained, "Harry was reading this dumb fanfiction where beating Volde-shriek three times apparently gave him Right of Conquest over the whole Slytherin estate. Land, gold, the death eaters as slaves, the whole lot."

Harry nodded, "Mm, and I was just going to say, with the time you dropped a cake on the Masons at the Dursleys, and the time you froze the Nine & Three-Quarters barrier so I smacked into it, and the time with the bludger, you've sort-of beaten me three times."

Dobby blinked slowly before he put two-and-two together. "So Dobby claim Right of Conquest over Harry Potter?"

There was a loud whoosh of wind, rattling every window in the common room, as the astonished Dobby began to glow.

Harry was tossed to the floor in front of the house-elf by some unseen magical force, golden threads extending from his body to connect to Dobby's hands.

Things suddenly stopped, then 5 seconds later a flock of half-a-dozen owls burst in through the window, followed by several envelopes flying of their own accord, all bearing various messages about the assets of the Potter estate that Dobby (elf) had just claimed, the receivables (the irritating phrase 'Right of Conquest' being repeated several times) that the Potter estate was entitled to, including the Slytherin estate, which itself was entitled to claim from who-knows-how-many-others...

"What is going on?!" Dobby squawked in a panic.

Ron stared at the maelstrom of owls and talking envelopes, before it came to him, "Dobby, mate, you just claimed Right of Conquest over the Potter estates because of your beating him three times!" he gasped.

Harry grumbled from his face-down prone position on the floor, "I officially hate all fanfictions with Right of Conquest in them."
