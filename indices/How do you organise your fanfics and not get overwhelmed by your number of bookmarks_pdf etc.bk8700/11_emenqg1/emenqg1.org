I down load the stories, and than create a word document that has several categories and list them along with their summary. So example, I have two Category pages for HP, one is sorted by character and the second is sorted by theme (azkaban, tri -wizard ect). I do this for several fanfics I like, Naruto, Gundam Wing, Crime Shows, Games. When I want to look for something, I can usually remember either the main character or the theme and can find the fic that way.
