For fics that I find interesting and might want to read later I simply bookmark them in my browser and sort those bookmarks into folders by fandom.

For keeping track of what I've read already, I use the favorites button on ffn and the equivalent offered by other sites.

People who keeps dozen or tabs open in their browser at all times just confound me. You're probably not an AI capable of that level of multitasking, so if you're not likely to use a particular tab any time in the next hour its probably a better idea to just bookmark that particular webpage so you can close the tab and save your RAM the trouble of keeping it open for no reason.
