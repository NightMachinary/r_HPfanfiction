If there's a story I'm interested in on FFN, I follow it on the site, since there's a section for that. You can add completed stories, so it's perfect for 'i haven't read this yet but want to.'

If it's one I've already read and liked, I add it as a fav, and every few months I'll download them using an ebook converter. I check the author's pages right quick first to see if they have a note against it (I know of a few that do but it's uncommon). If it's on AO3 I just download since it's a native part of the site. After that no real organisation.
