Whenever I come across a fanfic I like and/or might want to read later and/or want to check back in on if it ever updates and/or want to remember for some other reason, I add it to my Chrome bookmarks in the "Fanfiction" directory. Any threads in this subreddit that might have some good recommendations go in there as well.

It's a completely unorganized mess, and I can rarely ever find anything.
