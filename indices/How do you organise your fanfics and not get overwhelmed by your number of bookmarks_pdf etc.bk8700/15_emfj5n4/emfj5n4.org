For fics I downloaded I have a folder just for fanfiction.

In that folder I have folders for each fandom. If there's more then one ship I have folders for that. If you have a PC it allows you to group by type, which is what I do. If I have a fandom I'll read sporadically I have a miscellaneous folder. I also have one for fics that are finished/author deleted them.
