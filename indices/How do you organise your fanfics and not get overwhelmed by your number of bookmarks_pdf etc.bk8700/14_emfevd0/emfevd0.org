I second google sheets. I keep it for everything that I have already read. One google sheet, divided into separate pages for each fandom. Each page has a series of headers that I fill out for each fic (I mark each story's title, author, word count, url, where I found the story, if it has a happy ending, pairings, summary, how much I liked it, if I downloaded it, if it is in a series, and how many times I've read it). I also have the sheet set up to calculate how many words I have read in each fandom, just to give me an idea how much time I spend with each. I never considered adding the dates I read a story to mine, and that is an awesome idea to help job memories. I might need to start doing that!

So google sheets for things I have already finished. For my huge backlog of stories I want to read, I just bookmark them in a single folder for "Reading to Pursue". That folder is divided into subfolders for each fandom, and I don't worry about marking them past that. I figure that if I bothered to bookmark a story, that means I wanted to read it, so it's okay if I don't remember exactly which is which. I worry about that for stuff I have already read (hence the google sheets), but for stuff I want to read, a lot of times I just start the next story on the list. Honestly, it never takes me more than a couple of minutes to pick my next story, so I don't worry about it. I do sometimes get in the mood for one fandom, hence the subfolders. I also will bookmark links to things I've downloaded, just so I know they are on the list in case I pick one. When I finish a story, I delete the link in the bookmarks folder and add it to the google sheets, that way I can keep track easily of what I've finished.
