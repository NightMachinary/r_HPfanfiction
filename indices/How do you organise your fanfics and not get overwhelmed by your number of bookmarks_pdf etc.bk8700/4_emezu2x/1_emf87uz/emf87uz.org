I also use Calibre and FanFicFare, then sort them into categories that become folders when I import stories to my ereader. So I have folders for different fandoms/genres on my ereader. I keep an analog reading list in my bullet journal, just something basic with the title and few keywords (I actually have two, one for fanfiction and one for published books).
