I use evernote. I store each fic as a bookmark, with various tags according to what kind of fic it is/how long it is/pairing, etc, and then after I read it I review it and give it a score (or add a "couldn't read" tag if i couldn't finish it). Any fic that I give the highest rating to I download an epub of it and put the file in the note.
