If I find a fic interesting but not enough to finish it immediately, I leave it in an open tab. Eventually, I'll get back to it, or close the tab if I lose interest.

But usually, I don't lose interest in the middle -- it usually only happens if the reason I started reading it is done with (for example: I lost interest in linkffn(Marauders of the Mind) after they eventually got physical bodies, because at that point the reason I got interested in the story was no longer relevant), and the unfinished stuff is something I wasn't interested in.

If a fic is unfinished, but I'm not "done" with it, and it's actively updated, I follow it by a "sort by last updated" filtered FFN/Ao3 list I refresh once a day or so. With the narrow interest I have, this is a simple task. In the rare case where I am actively following an unfinished fic outside my main interest, I leave it in a tab, similar to fics I've simply not finished reading.
