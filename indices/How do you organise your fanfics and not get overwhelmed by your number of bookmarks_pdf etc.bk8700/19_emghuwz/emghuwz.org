I have on my bookmark bar to start with a fanfic folder, in that i have 4 sub folders Unfinished Unupdated, Done, Fave author, and Ble,

the "Fanfic" folder also holds any fic I want to start reading, holds bookmarks to the latest chapter of any fic i read that i got to the end of and it was unfinished but was updater recency enough to be still alive, and any fic I stopped in the middle of but still want to read

Unfinished Unupdated holds any fic that are Unfinished and Unupdated bookmarked at the chapter it ended it at time of bookmark

Fave author is used mainly for people with a ton of oneshots to save on bookmarks and isnt really a fave author folder

Done are ones that i finished

Ble are ones i quit cause they are bad (which i need to keep cause what if i want to rec them cause they fit that perfect niche)(and im neurotic)

​

Unfinished Unupdated and Done both have a subsub folder that are simply "fave" (self explanatory)

Ble has a sub folder "Ble" which is for fics that I dont want people to see and its not really a indicator of quality

​

While that sounds like a lot in practice it just means i use "fanfic" as a queue, when i finish a fic it goes in "Done" or "Done,Fave" and if i get to the newest chapter and its dead it goes in Unfinished Unupdated which I skim sometimes to see if something alive again so it can go back in fanfic. and when I want to reread a fic its almost always in "Done,Fave"

works pretty well, thoughts? too much?
