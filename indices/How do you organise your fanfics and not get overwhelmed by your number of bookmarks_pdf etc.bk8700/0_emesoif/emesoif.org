I keep a list of fanfiction on a google sheet, writing down name, author, date I'm writing it down and the date I finish reading/decide to abandon it, number of chapters, status (ongoing, complete, abandoned, dead...), fandom and crossovers, some tags, pairings, a link to it. A few months ago I also started putting a small 'review' to each one, just a couple sentences to remember what it was about or what I did or did not like about it.

I've got written down more than 1800 fanfics. I'm thinking of revamping the tag system with specialized ones for each fandom, though I'll have to set aside a couple days to do that.
