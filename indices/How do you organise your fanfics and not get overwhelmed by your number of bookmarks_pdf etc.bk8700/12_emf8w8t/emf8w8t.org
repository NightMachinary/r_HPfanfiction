I just bookmark everything by the date of the last update, chapter number, fandom and title.

It's a long list, sorted by date of the last update. For example:

190401 HP c21 blablabal

190412 ncis c3 blablabla

190503 skyfall c14 blablabla

I'm pretty good at remembering the story by the title. And if the title doesn't trigger my memory, I just take a quick look at the first chapter.
