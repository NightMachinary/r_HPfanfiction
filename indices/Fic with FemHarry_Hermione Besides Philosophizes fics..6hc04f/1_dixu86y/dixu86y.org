I can't believe I never thought about this before but in the past I often reject fics if I don't like the name of the main character, e.g., Jasmine for Fem!Harry. Now I realize I can just use an extension to replace the name I dislike for something else or download the Epub and edit it since I believe that format is essentially HTML (I use "ebook-edit" which is part of calibre). Now I have to go back and find those fics I rejected again -_-
