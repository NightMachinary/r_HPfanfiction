Philosopher's Stone has 42 scene breaks. The first is in [[http://imgur.com/qrLrekA.jpg][Chapter Two]].

Scene breaks aren't a fanfic thing. They happen in published fiction just as often, but they're easier to overlook because of how they're indicated. In most fiction, they're marked simply by an empty line between paragraphs (and an asterisk only when the break falls at the end of a page, to avoid confusion).

They stand out more in fanfic because of how we mark them. FFN didn't always allow the use of a horizontal rule to mark scene breaks, but it also had restrictions on paragraphs consisting entirely of non-letters (and even just the same letters, such as "x x x") so authors were forced to come up with crative ways to indicate scene breaks -- hence the Firebird trilogy's use of the title.
