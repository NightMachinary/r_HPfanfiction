Some of the stuff I wrote has section breaks, some hasn't. No links provided because it's not fanfics and that's that.

That said, I can tell you from experience that it relies on the kind of story you have, on the exact narrative you give it, and on the narrator's position in the story. With a slow-paced story that simply tells a tale and it is all narrated by one of the characters, sure, it is easy to narrate that time passes every single time. A mystery story with something to hide is likely going to flow better with marked scene breaks, though. An action story is probably going to use scene break markers if the narrator is a third-person one and possibly but not necessarily the same if it is narrated by a character instead. An adventure story could go both ways. A fairy tale, likewise. A story that consists of a series of vignettes, like “Cauterize” by Lady Altair (a story often praised for simply being well written, I will note), simply won't go well if you don't use scene break markers.

Going further, how does it change the feel of the work, you ask? Well, a scene break conserves the speed of the story, so to say, as opposed to a narration that time passed which makes it slow down in the reader's perception. Additionally, a scene break conveys that “time has passed” and that only if you are actually shown that it did whereas a narration that time passed conveys that /and/ additionally that “nothing noteworthy has happened in the meantime” which can feel fairly jarring when used after particularly ... hmm, let's say “emotional” moments, because surely, if something noteworthy happens during the time skip, that very thing would be noted, and anything cliffhangery or simply that emotional is something the reader will not expect to be dismissed just like that. Of course, one can still narrate the time skip in those cases if they know what they are doing, but it's simply harder to do that well and I do believe it might be somewhat intimidating to some people.

So why do people resort to it? Because it is a legitimate writing tool. That you might see it too often for your liking is one thing, and that some people who are just unilaterally bad writers use it is one thing as well, but in the end it is used simply because it exists and can be used in that way and both over-saturation of its (or any other thing's, really) use and the fact that some dreadfully awful writers are aware of its (and, again, many other things') existence are problems frankly unrelated to that tool itself.
