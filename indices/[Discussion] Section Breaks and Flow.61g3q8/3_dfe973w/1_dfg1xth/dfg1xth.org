  Rowling published all her chapters in single books (obviously) while fanfiction writers usually publish a single chapter at a time - once a week if we're lucky.

That is a very good point. To elaborate on that, I will use the third book as an example: the edition I have has 22 chapters and 435 pages of the actual story, that is a bit shy of 20 pages per chapter, and with the book's word per page count it is more or less 5 thousand words per chapter. It is not unusual for some fanfics to get updates over twice that size, and sometimes even four times, and while I do understand that this is an issue in and of itself I will note that chapter changes kind of are scene breaks too so Madame Rowling's books get /those/ scene breaks more often than the fanfics do and it's better to have non-chapter-change scene breaks than to artificially inflate scene length specifically to avoid their usage.
