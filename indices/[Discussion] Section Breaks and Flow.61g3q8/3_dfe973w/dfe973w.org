The big difference is how it's published. Rowling published all her chapters in single books (obviously) while fanfiction writers usually publish a single chapter at a time - once a week if we're lucky. This means canon could spend an entire chapter on one thing while fanfiction writers would be deluged with reviews asking why X didn't get a mention in this update if they tried it.

Another difference is that canon is centred solidly around Harry (I think there's only one chapter where he doesn't appear - Spinners End in book 6),while fanfiction often has strands in many different places at the same time. Take Divided and Entwined by Starfox5, for instance. The latest chapter had nine scenes spread over four days in multiple locations. The sections are essential to keep the story readable.
