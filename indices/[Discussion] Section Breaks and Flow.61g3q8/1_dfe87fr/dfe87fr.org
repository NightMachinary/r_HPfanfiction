In published works, each chapter represents an event to further the plot. POV changes, if they occur, change with each chapter.

In fanfic, the bar for writing is much lower. I've seen very long chapters broken apart into scenes with tildes and asterisks, but this could easily be worked around by adding transitional writing (like JKR does with the months and seasons). This requires more effort than a fanfic writer is really going to care about, since it's basically filler writing and most readers won't really care too much about it. Fanfic authors usually don't have editors, so changes can come off as too abrupt.

In canon, scene changes seem to have the previous end with dialogue and a sentence or two and then "Over the next few weeks Harry felt *[something related to previous scene]*_." This is a more seamless transition and is just better writing. Choppy canon would be jarring and edited to fit publishing standards.

As for me, I'm ok with infrequent breaks consisting of any combination of asterisks, tildes, dashes and o's in fanfic.
