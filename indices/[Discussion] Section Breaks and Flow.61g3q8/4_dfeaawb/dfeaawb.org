Nitpick: JKR definitely does use scene breaks, even in /PS/. Depending on the editions that I have, there are either blank spaces or symbols employed.

As far as her transitions go, yeah, she knows her way around them. She cuts the clutter and condenses the story to the important parts, especially in the earlier books.

  Why do you suppose fanfic authors resort to abrupt changes?

Lack of skill level and/or editing.

Fan fic writers don't have a market or editors to worry about -- though the latter can be remedied by betas or self-edits -- which is why you'll run into clunky scene transitions (among other things). Rehashes are a symptom of the same problem, as well as operating as a crutch (/I don't have to plot this part/) and word-padding (/have another copy-pasted Sorting Hat song, everyone/) to springboard off into the real meat of the story.

  How does it change the feel of the work?

It often makes it lethargic and less engaging.

Most people reading in a fandom already know the stations of canon, so it would be best to summarize known things and then move on to the interesting bits.

  How would canon be different if it was much more choppy?

Maybe it would have been a /little/ longer. Mostly it would have just given JKR's editor a fit.
