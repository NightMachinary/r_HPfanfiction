Fanfiction is a fundamentally different genre then the Harry Potter books, without even getting into the various types of stories such as adventure, romance, humor, mystery ect. First, you as a fanfiction writer have a great deal of worldbuilding already done for you. It would be foolish to retread the same ground that JK Rowling already laid for you unless you are going to take it in a significantly different direction.

As an example, in a lot of fics certain parts of canon are outright skipped, such as in linkffn(Oh God Not Again! by Sarah 1281) the author completely skips most of Harry's shopping, because we can safely assume it happens much the same way as it does in the original books. However, because the author wants to change the dynamics of the relationship with Draco, that scene is included and plays out very differently. In my own stories, whenever something is going to happen more or less as it did in the books, I just skip right over it, instead covering new ground or changing things. This leads to a lot more more abrupt breaks as you're skipping over chucks of time.

Another point to consider is that in some writing styles, especially those from multiple points of views, there are many more abrupt breaks without smooth transitions as we move from different characters perspectives. Many fanfcition writers opt to look through the eyes of other characters, as even familiar scenes play out differently when looked at through someone else's eyes. There also isn't always a good, smooth way to move to another character without a lot of cruft and while some people like to inflate their word counts, others prefer to keep things more barebones.

And of course, there is always the writers style to consider. Some writers strive for a smooth, flowing narrative that eases the reader along. Others want a more abrupt, choppy narrative that is more startling and challenging. It can be a conscious stlylisic choice and not simple laziness that is found in many professional works where the author wants to be jarring. It's the same in other media such as movies. Some have smooth cuts that make the movie flow together well, others have smash cuts and abrupt scene changes because they want a different audience reaction.
