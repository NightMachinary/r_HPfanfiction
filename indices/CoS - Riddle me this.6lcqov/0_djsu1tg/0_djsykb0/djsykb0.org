I don't think this is possible within the HP canon. We're told quite clearly that the only way to reunite a horcrux with the master soul is remorse, which is not a factor in the above scenario.

I think the embodied horcrux would simply seek out Voldemort and then assist in his resurrection, much as Pettigrew did... only much more competent.
