Doesn't that require the Diary Tom deferring to the original? We obviously don't know if there is some in build sense to help the 'master' or original but to me there is a chance that diary Tom would consider himself superior to someone who is quite literally a shadow of a man and so rather than seeking to aid him would rather supplant him. The idea of Voldemort sharing power, even with himself strikes me as wrong. He's too ambitious, of course the wraith Tom still has more knowledge and experience but how does that compare to a functioning body?
