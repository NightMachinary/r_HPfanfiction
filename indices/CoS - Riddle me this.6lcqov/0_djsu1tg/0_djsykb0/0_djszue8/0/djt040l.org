Firstly I think it's important to remember that horcruxes are not the equal of the master soul. For example, the horcruxes only anchor the master soul to life - they don't anchor each other, nor does the master soul anchor them. The relationship between master soul and horcrux is very one-directional (as is indicated by the fact that the original person is referred to as the master soul in the first place).

Secondly I think it's important to appreciate that horcruxes are not clones or copies of a person's mind. A soul is more than a mind, and there's a good reason why wizards are genuinely and viscerally horrified by the concept of splitting the soul, beyond the mere immorality of the method of creating a horcrux. Though we don't have a precise definition of the soul in HP, it is generally considered your essential being, your very sense of self and identity.

Given this, it seems unlikely that a horcrux would consider itself a separate entity from the master soul or in competition with the other parts of itself. An embodied Riddle horcrux is not a clone of Tom Riddle, it is literally the same person, just happening to be split between two separate bodies.
