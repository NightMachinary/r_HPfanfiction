If the diary consumed Ginny's entire soul/life/whatever it was up to then would that elevate the Diary Tom above a standard Horcrux? With the memories that Tom imprinted into the Diary its almost a save point for his sixteen year old self. We know so little about the other horcuxes and their behaviour I hesitate to say but the Diary might well have been enchanted to be special and be independent, would that bleed over to a resurrected Tom?

Obviously in the hands of Ginny it wouldn't be possible to travel but does the fact that it never tried to seek out Voldemort, instead aiming to reopen the chamber of secrets tell us anything? The diary never tried to work its way into an adult's hands and while that might be because it wasn't confident in controlling them, it never seemed to want to help Voldemort other than learning how Harry survived which could be more about self preservation over learning for Voldemort.
