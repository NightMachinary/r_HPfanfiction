A portrayal that I particularly liked was from linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). I'd like to think that his horcrux is a separate entity to Voldemort with different thoughts and behaviors depending on his life experiences up to the point of separation. Obviously as a horcrux, he is living some sort of half-life with merely a portion of a normal persons soul and would not be able to last indefinitely.
