  Would he - Riddle - have become flesh and blood?

Sure, flesh and blood, or rather magic solidified, a permanent transfiguration type deal maybe.

  Personally, I want to say that he'd be magically inclined to reunite with Voldemort himself

Ha, not a good chance, can you see any Voldemort sharing power with another, even himself? If there were two I imagine, despite fanfiction to the contrary I admit, that they'd decide to take out the other(s), no one commands Lord Voldemort! Though I guess Tom may have been stupid and young enough to try, he'd probably get his soul sucked up by his main body and turned into a new hocrux right after the main guy gets a new body.
