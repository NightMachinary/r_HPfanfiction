I see the confusion here, my bad. When I said reunite with big Voldemort himself, I meant it in that their souls would reunite, as one. Call it as a part of the design of the diary horcrux, or even just the will of Voldemorts magic. Essentially, Voldemort would eventually find his 16 year old horcrux returning to him, providing a body and a soul fragment to boot.
