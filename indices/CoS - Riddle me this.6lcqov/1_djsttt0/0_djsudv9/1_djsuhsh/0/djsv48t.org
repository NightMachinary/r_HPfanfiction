Sure, there are kinks and quirks with the idea, but this is magic we're talking about. It isn't clearly defined, even with what we already know. Horcrux wise, the short of it all is that they are a means for Riddle to live forever. The diary horcrux is also significantly unique in its function, as shown through its use of communication with Ginny and Harry as well as the potential to how memories. It's never disclosed just how Riddle could've used his horcruxes as they're all destroyed promptly. However, I think it could be plausible for any capable horcruxes to make their way to the "original" soul if said soul was in danger or in need of a form. This is all just theorising tho, I just like the idea that 16 diary Riddle would be pulled by the will of his original soul to reunite and, in the process, provide a body.
