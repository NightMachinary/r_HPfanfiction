The golden snitch in quidditch chooses who it wants to win based on the team's performance or something like that. Sometimes a particularly good seeker can catch it even if the snitch isn't favouring them, but it ensures the game always lasts the right amount of time and the team who wins usually deserves to. So chaser performance impacts seeker performance, in effect.

Character-wise, I like to believe that during deathly Hallows, Percy Weasley was secretly trying to help muggleborns and saved some while trapped in the Ministry before he reconciled with his family.
