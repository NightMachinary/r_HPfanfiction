I've been proposing this theory for some time: the Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.
