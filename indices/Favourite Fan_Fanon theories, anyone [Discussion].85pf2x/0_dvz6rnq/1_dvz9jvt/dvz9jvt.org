Something like this can be easily disproved, however, by the lack of contact since the books wrapped a decade ago. Imagine this whole world exists, hidden as described, and wants to make contact again. There would have been no better time than that first month after book 7 to have Harry Freakin' Potter make himself known as a /real person/. Everyone and there mother would have been ecstatic, and the series was still on everybody's mind as a cultural phenomenon. Now, though still hugely popular, it's left the consciousness of the world the way it was before.

I love this theory cause like everyone fantasizing this world is a favorite pastime. But this was a much more fun theory when the books were being put out.
