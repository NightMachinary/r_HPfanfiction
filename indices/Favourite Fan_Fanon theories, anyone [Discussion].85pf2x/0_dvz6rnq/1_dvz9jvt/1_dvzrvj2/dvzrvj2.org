Why would they want to come out again?

As I said in my comment, the Books were originally designed as a test. They found out most Muggles were fine with magic, but a significant portion still wanted them dead, so they would have to stay hidden for the time being.

On the other hand, /Harry Potter/ has become so popular that Muggle Potterheads are now publicly flashing their wands, and real Wizards can now wield their wands in public too, as long as they don't use flashy spells.
