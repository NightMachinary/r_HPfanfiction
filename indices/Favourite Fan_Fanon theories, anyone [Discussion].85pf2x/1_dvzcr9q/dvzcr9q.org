I dunno if it's a fanon theory or anything but I always sorta wanted to write a thing where Harry Dresden was actually Harry Potter after becoming an auror and growing sick of the ministry.

So he takes his investigation skills elsewhere, and becomes the wizard PI in Chicago. I think it'd be a fun link, but no idea how to effectively link the two universes and not make it slight one of them as they have completely different views on magic.
