Usually when it comes to crossovers I just prefer having Harry magicked into the new universe where he either adapts to the new rules of magic or has some measure of his own native magic available to him. Considering how overpowered HP magic can be, it's a delicate balance.

So after growing bored with the tediousness of an actual job, Harry goes on an adventure with Luna Lovegood to find the Crumple-Horned-Snorcack who then uses its special magic to send Harry to the Dresden universe.

Or something haha.
