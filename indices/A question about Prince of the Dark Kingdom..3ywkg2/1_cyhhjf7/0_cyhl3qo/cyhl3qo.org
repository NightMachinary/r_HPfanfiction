What bothered me about the scene was how different and out of place the scene seemed in a fic that up to that point consisted of a manipulative, self serving Voldemort, some amount of politics and Harry being rebellious. I didn't mind the ritual part, just the sudden, mostly unexplained, shift in character of Voldemort. Who (as I remember) hadn't even mentioned the word love and then says it three times in a very short time span and seems very suddenly compassionate, a slightly more gradual shift that had been occurring, but none the less, it stood in stark contrast to how i had perceived Voldemort in the previous chapters.
