Okay, thanks. That chapter seemed so unexplained to me and with such foreign characters I probably over reacted (for context it was like 5 i then morning with no sleep). Thinking about it now, I see the hints of Voldemort starting to increasingly use different more caring means to "manipulate" Harry. I think ill give it another attempt and read a bit further this time.

P.S. Read the rest of the chapter, at the end theres an AN where the author basically refuted my fears with it, so if I had just finished the chapter..... Oh well, I can know enjoy the story again.
