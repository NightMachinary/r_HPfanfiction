I realise I have mixed up the stories. Wokf wolf is a very lovely wolfstar, but they story takes place after Hogwarts.

However the one I wanted to recommend is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants series]]

There are four books in total, the last one of a long read, but they are totally worth it. It fulfilled your requirements and it is quite a lovely universe and a different take on magic :)
