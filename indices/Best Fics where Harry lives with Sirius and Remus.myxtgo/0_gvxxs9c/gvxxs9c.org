How emotional can you go?

The best one I've read is linkao3(The Art of Getting By by Sarewolf). It's angsty as hell but so wonderfully written. Excellent Remus.

Linkao3(The Dogfather) is really sweet. Lots of Sirius.

Linkao3(Stealing Harry) is also a great fic.

Sirius lives in all of them. But warning for NSFW content, especially in Stealing Harry and TAoGB... I don't remember the Dogfather but sure, I'll warn that one too just in case ðŸ˜‹
