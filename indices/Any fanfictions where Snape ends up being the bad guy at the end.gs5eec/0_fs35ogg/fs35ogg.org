  and the Snape/Lily thing was kind of obvious to everyone

Really? While we know they had /some/ form of interaction (Snape's Worst Memory), we had absolutely no idea what form this interaction had -- past lovers, friends, rivals (like Harry-Draco) or something else. I do remember reading an oneshot that nailed his motivations and rough chain of events that was written before HBP was even released, which I found really interesting, but that was /one/ fic. There's also couple of pre-DH Snily fics, but I think those were mostly a result of "the author didn't have any other choice of known female company that went to school the same years as Severus" and his Potter-complaints being suspiciously lacking in allusions to Lily.

I remember reading a fic where canon-Harry inadvertly stumbles upon an AU where Snape wasn't the bad guy in the "final boss" sense, but was definitely evil. Neville was the BWL, and Snape had arranged to poison James to death (very horrifically, no less), marries Lily and has a kid with her and also intended to do the same with Harry but is thwarted. But it wasn't obvious from the getgo, but rather a plot twist -- he seems to be your typical redeemed!Snape at first (retaining snarkiness+etc, but overall a good guy). He doesn't mistreat Lily or their child -- he genuinely loved her and it was obvious in the aftermath when he is arrested that Lily couldn't just "stop" loving him in spite of everything -- but his actions otherwise were so horrific that he was pretty much a psychopath.

However, I don't remember the fic title. Sorry.
