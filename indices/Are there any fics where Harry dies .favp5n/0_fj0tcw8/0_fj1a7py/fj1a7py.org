I am looking for it. I'll post it when I find it. SPOILER.

It was something along the lines of Harry dying, Voldemort taking over. Years go by Ron and Hermione are living separate lives from each other. One day Hermione asks to meet Ron and restart their mission. It is in the end of fic they realise why it was important for Harry to die . If someone knows that fic . You can post that.
