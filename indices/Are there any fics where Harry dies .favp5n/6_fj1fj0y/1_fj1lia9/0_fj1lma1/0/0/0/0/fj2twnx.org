Honestly I really disliked the ending, and I dislike the epilogue even more. Fantastic fic, but I've only read it once for that specific reason.

A Taste Of Ismenian Water is just the epilogue that was already written before the author decided they liked it better open ended, and cut it off at the last chapter then posted the epilogue separately.

I'm a Greek myth nerd, though, so I /really/ like the titles. The epilogue's is quite clever.
