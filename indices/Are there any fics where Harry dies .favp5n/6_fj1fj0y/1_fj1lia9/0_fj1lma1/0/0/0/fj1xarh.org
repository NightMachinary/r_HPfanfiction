Yeah, there was a separate epilogue that differs from the original ending. I think it's called A Taste of Ismenian Waters. I think people didn't like the original ending too much and the author decided to write that epilogue. It should be in the author's page [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] page.

Edit: apparently that one was the original epilogue before the author decided to write the actual ending the fic got. Sorry for the confusion, I read that a while ago, and my memory is a bit foggy.
