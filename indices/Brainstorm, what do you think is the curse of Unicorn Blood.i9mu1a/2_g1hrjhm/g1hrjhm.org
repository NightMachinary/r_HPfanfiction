In my headcanon, it makes you weaker magically/mentally and physically - hence how Harry could beat Quirrell.

No self-respecting wizard loses to an 11 year old, even with sacrificial magic protections in place. There's plenty of four-syllable-or-fewer spells that could have easily been used to keep Harry out of touch range and just off him, but Quirrell didn't use any of them.

Not to mention that Quirrell hadn't the physical strength to fight Harry off once he closed the gap - another thing that doesn't typically happen in a fight between an 11-year-old and an adult.
