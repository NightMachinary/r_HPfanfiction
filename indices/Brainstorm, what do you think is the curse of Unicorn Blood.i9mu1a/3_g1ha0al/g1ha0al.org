My HC is that after drinking it the person's body, though alive and with all organs intact, will start the process of decomposition, literally rotting as if the body was already a corpse while still being forced to function as it should normally. Eventually the arms and legs, tongue, eyes, ears, nose, tooth and all non-vital organs would fall or rot inside the person, from the second the blood is drank the natural healing and growth of the body would permanently stop, worms would start eating the flesh with the cursed being forced to feel every second of it, the very organs that keep the person alive would degenerate to the point where it should be impossible for them to keep the person alive while still moving normally -all of this generating extreme amounts of pain for the recipient and getting gradually worse and worse- and if left alone it would go on and on with no rest, natural death would forever be outside the drinkers reach (not for aging, not for disease...) the only ways of ending it would be either suicide or murder.
