  The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.

It seems to be up to interpretation; I like to think that you lead a life where you are alive but not really living- no joy, no fear, no feelings. A half-life. I can see Voldemort being able to do it despite the consequences- after all, he did literally rip apart his soul to gain immortality.
