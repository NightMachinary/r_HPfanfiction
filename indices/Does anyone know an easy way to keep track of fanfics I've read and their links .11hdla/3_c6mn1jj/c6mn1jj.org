As mentioned, fanfiction.net has a set up to keep track of both favorites, and fics you want updates for. As well as author alerts...

Other websites aren't as helpful. I'm dealing with either bookmarking them, which is fairly easy and able to be synced with browsers like google chrome, or saving the urls in an excel, .doc, or .txt file.
