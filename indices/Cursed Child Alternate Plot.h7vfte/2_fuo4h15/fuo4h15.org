It's much better, but so think the sheer existence of Delphi makes Cursed Child feel like a bad fanfic. Even some random no-name upcoming Dark Lord would be better in my eyes. Like some kid lost his parents during the second war and is mad that reformed Death Eaters like the Malfoys are allowed to roam around and at the golden trio for allowing it. They get a small following of people that feel the same way in order to hunt down these ex-Death Eaters and reform society. This way 40yo Head Auror Harry Potter isn't overpowered by some random person, but by a group of people.
