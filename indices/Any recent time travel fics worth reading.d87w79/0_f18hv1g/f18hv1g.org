*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have the soul-bond stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13221168/1/][*/Me Without My TARDIS/*]] Not a doctor who crossover, This Fanfic has Harry, Hermione, and Neville sent back to 1947 by the time room explosion. Featuring a Moody fresh out of training, and 11 year old Mcgonagall.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306252/1/][*/Double Time/*]] Future Hermione (who has, of course, lived through a dark and angsty future) deaged herself and sent herself back in time.

What makes this fic different from most similar fics is:

One, De aged future Hermione doesn't have all the future memories. When she was de aged the memories were removed too, what she has are pensieve memories left behind by Future!Hermione, F!H was working on a Greater-Good principle so didn't give all her memories, just the ones that will fulfill her goals.

Two, the ritual to send her back in time didn't erase present!Hermione from the timeline, so now there are two Hermiones.

This fic is definitely not for everyone. It is angsty (but in a good way), dark, and handles very difficult issues (like consent in a world with love potions, lifedebts, obliviations, etc etcetera), and is a bit bashy...
