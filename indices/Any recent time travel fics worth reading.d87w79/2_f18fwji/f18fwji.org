One of my favorites is "Falling Through Time" by Kait Hobbit [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418202/1/Falling-Through-Time]]

It starts off a few years after the war, but Hermione travels back in time to just after the battle at the Department of Mysteries, but this time around she falls for Fred instead of Ron. it isn't complete, but is updated regularly.
