Linkao3(the debt of time by shayalonnie) and linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by Mrs J's soup) fit this. DoT is really on the nose. 169 is more plotty than smutty and more Srimione than a full three way, but I have to mention it because it's my favorite fic, period.

There's another fic I'm thinking of in this vein (Hermione fix-it marauder era fics) where she's a lioness animagus and she recruits death eaters and brands them with lion paw dark marks, so they later be shown to be double agents. Anyone know what I'm referring to?
