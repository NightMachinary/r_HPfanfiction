If you haven't read that, Harry is obsessed with potions and scrounges you every spare moment with Snape he can, even though Snape is still a total dickhead. Has a really good Voldemort too. And the best Draco I've seen yet. But my favorite Snape scenes are:

    “Are you poisoning Professor Lupin?”

    Snape's lip curled. “If only, Potter. If only.”

    This was not particularly reassuring. Harry hesitated, then plowed on.

and on the subject of trewlaney:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    ”I avoid her,” Snape said evenly. “Whenever I remember she exists, I have a powerful urge to kill her.”

    As Professor Snape seemed entirely serious, Harry decided to never, ever bring up his divination professor again. He didn't really want to be the one who tipped Professor Snape over the edge.

Harry thinks it's so offhand at first, just Snape being a typical grumpy asshole to his idiot coworker, but then you remember that she was the one who gave the prophecy and you're like ohhhhhh shittttt. I hadn't even considered what it must have been like for him to live in the same area as her.
