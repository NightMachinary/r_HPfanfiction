I usually dont read Snape specific fanfics, i dont mind them, its just really hard to find good ones. I got "Come once again and love me" recommended on fanfiction.net . But its Snily. Lily and Snape both travel back in time and there is no Marauders bashing, so will want to read it someday. Here is the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834]]
