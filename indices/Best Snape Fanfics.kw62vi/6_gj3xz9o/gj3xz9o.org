Your best bet might depend on what part of the timeline you are writing, and how you need to address his insecurities for that part of his life. Is this a Marauder-era Snape dealing with his path toward becoming a Death Eater? Series years trying to balance his double-agent roles? Post-war romance/mystery/comedy? Decades change a person, and Snape has been through some serious shit, so think about that for sure.

Ever since I read it, I've been recommending all writers who want to get into Snape's head should find a library copy or cough up the 5 bucks to get [[https://www.amazon.com/Snape-Definitive-Reading-Lorrie-Kim-ebook/dp/B01I04EMK6/][Snape: A Definitive Reading]]. Many of my own fics are post-war EWE but otherwise canon-compliant and this analysis has helped me significantly to keep him in character.

That said, he's the mysterious magical spy, so if you can find /any/ shred of canon evidence for the behavior you want to give him, or even a halfway decent explanation for why the canon behavior is not his /true self/, then you can probably make it work!

Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][all of my fics are Snapefics]] if you care to take a look.
