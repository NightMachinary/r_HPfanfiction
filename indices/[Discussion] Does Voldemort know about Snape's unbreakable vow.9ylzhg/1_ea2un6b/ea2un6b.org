Voldemort was so insane at times in the books it's hard to really figure out what he would do or think. But from what I get out of it, my personal opinion... Voldemort probably didn't trust Snape completely until he killed DDore(I wouldn't have) so even if he did hear of it (probably did but wasn't mentioned) if I was Voldemort I'd probably be stoked that My Spy who I didn't know I could trust, just took an unbreakable vow to kill one of the biggest thorns in my side
