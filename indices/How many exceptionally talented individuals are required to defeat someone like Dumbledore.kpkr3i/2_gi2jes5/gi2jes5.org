In canon Dumbledore and Voldemort seem an of magnitude above everyone else we know of in terms of combat. Not a single other character pulls off anything similar to the stuff shown in the Ministry duel. I'd say Snape is probably at that level within the field of potions and given his spell creation is arguably the 3rd most skilled wizard we see. It feels honestly like the number wouldn't matter unless there's a significant amount of snape or moody level wizards.
