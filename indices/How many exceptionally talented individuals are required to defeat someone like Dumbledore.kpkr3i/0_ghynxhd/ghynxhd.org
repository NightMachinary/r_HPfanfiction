It depends on if they get the drop on him, he gets the drop on them, or both parties are prepared.

Dumbledore and Voldemort were roughly equal,

Both parties prepared, Voldemort was fighting 3 at once in the final battle

When he had the element of surprise, Dumbledore completely overwhelmed 4 or 5 people when they tried to arrest him at least two of them being aurors- furthermore he managed to knock them out in a specialized manner that made them think they were simply knocked down

Malfoy arguably almost got the drop on Dumbledore when Dumbledore only paralyzed harry before being disarmed

When they were occupied fighting other people Dumbledore manged to capture somewhere between 6 and 10 death eaters in the DoM so he could likely do even more without restraints like capture over kill

So if 3 exceptionally talented wizards/witches get the drop on Dumbledore or Voldemort they would likely be out of their depth

In a fair fight they likely would need a minimum of 5 or so opponents before being decidedly overwhelmed

If their opponents are caught unawares then we don't really have an upper limit but we can assume that they can probably take out at least 6 or 7 if they really had to

If their opponents are actively occupied in some other activity then they could probably take out a dozen or more
