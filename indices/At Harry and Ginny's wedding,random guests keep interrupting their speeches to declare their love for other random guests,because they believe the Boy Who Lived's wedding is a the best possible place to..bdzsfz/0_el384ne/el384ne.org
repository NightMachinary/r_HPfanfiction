Hmm...well, that gives me a funny and adorable mental image.\\
The Hogwarts dating scene is on a roll; Ron gossips to Dean that he's planning to propose to Hermione on Harry's wedding night, but wait! Neville was planning to do it then for Hannah too! And George is planning it with Angelina, Luna suspects that Rolf's up to the same thing, Cho Chang thinks it'd be romantic too...\\
Notes are compared, eyebrows are raised, and word gets around...

Finally, at the marriage of Harry Potter and Ginerva Weasley, vows are exchanged, husband and wife are pronounced, he does now kiss the bride...\\
And then, almost all of Harry's male school friends stand up (and a few besides); they turn to their partners, simultaneously go down on one knee, and each produces a ring. They choreograph a /synchronised marriage proposal/. With the wedding's musicians kicking into an appropriate love song.
