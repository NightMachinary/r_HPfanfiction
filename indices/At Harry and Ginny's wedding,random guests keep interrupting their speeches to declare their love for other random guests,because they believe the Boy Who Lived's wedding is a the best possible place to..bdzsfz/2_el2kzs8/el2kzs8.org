"Do you, Harry James Potter, take Ginerva Molly Weasley to be your lawf---"

"I love you Luna!" cried Neville from the back of the church.

Harry could make out two humanoid shapes making their way out of the wedding, and congratulated Neville in his head.

The priest started again, "Do you, Harry Jam---"

"I love you Harry Potter! Marry me instead! Leave that redhead bitch!" came the shout from a Harry Potter fangirl... Let's call her Karen1.

Hermione's wand was out before everyone else's and Karen1 was bound, stunned, silenced, and glued to the seat in a heartbeat.

Harry gulped. He turned around to see Ginny smiling at him. Shit. He turned to Jesus and prayed for mercy.

The priest stared at everyone in the hall.

And he waited.

And waited.

When no one was saying anything more, he again started the ceremony.

"Do you, Harry James Potter, take Ginerva Moll---"

"YES!" echoed across the church from the third row.

"I /told you/ not to shout Dean. Why would you shout when I whispered my proposal?" asked Seamus.

Dean's cheeks coloured, but then he looked around to see encouraging nods and death stares, and couple wisely decided to leave.

"You dated a poofter? What were you thinking?" Harry asked Ginny in a whisper.

"You're already in trouble, Harry Potter. Best not aggravate me even more."

Harry shut up.
