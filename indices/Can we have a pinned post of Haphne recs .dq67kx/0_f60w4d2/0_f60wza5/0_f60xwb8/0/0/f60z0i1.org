Hmm, good question. Presumably if the threads shared a bunch of fics it should lighten the load a bit. I have linked threads that had fics I was also linking in my comment (and they weren't duplicated) so it should be fine I think? But I don't know for certain, the bot does get very finicky ocasinaly.
