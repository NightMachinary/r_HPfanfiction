I honestly think this proposal has some problems on a few different levels.

First, there are only two pinned post slots per subreddit, so this takes up one slot, I will get back to this point.

Second, Is this really a problem? It's not that the subreddit is just constantly spammed with Haphne posts, one a day is semi-reasonable.

Third, why single out the Haphne posts? We have tons of things that come up all the time, (pet peeves, requests for other common ships, etc).

Four, If Haphne gets a pinned post why doesn't Harmony get one? Or Harry/Luna? By putting Haphne front and center on the subreddit it basically makes it the "official" parring of this subreddit, and you can't make a post for each major parring because of the slot limit. It singles out Haphne as something different than everything else, and in some ways shuts down conversation about Haphne to have it as a pinned post, because people are less likely to interact with it.

Five, It is selective enforcement in a way, and that never works out. It treats Haphne differently and so both unofficially endorses it and puts it down at the same time.

The best way to deal with a repeated request is to use the "linksub()" command in the bot. It posts all the fics from whatever reddit thread is put into the parentheses, so just link a few of the previous threads and everyone is happy.
