There were some ideas, in some fanfics, but never fully developed as far as I know, that basically had wizard's full name function a bit like in Dresdenverse. So Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was an insanely good name, since you couldn't focus on all of the names at once to curse him from afar, and it was his full name.

Same reason that Tom Marvolo Riddle, official name, changed his name to Lord Voldemort, so that nobody could curse him. It has some drawbacks, like Dumbledore knowing, but then you could imagine it's way easier to protect from one person than from multitudes of others.

Anyway, it's an interesting concept that has been touched upon by several fanfics I've read, but never fully developed.
