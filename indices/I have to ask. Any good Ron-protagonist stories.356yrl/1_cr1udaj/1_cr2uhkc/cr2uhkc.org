If you like a well written Ron, you might try reading anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2944739/1/][Solstice Muse]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2944739/1/][Within these Walls]] is a pretty good story with a rather original plot. It's basically a hostage situation fic, where bunch of desperate Death Eaters, after losing their master, kidnap 18 aurors and the DEs announce that they'll be executing a hostage each day, until all Death Eaters are released from Azkaban. Ron is one of the hostages. Been a while since I read it, but I remember it being quite good.

The author has posted a toatal of 84 stories, most of which are Ron centric. Check them out if you want to. I haven't read most of them, but the few I read are pretty decent.
