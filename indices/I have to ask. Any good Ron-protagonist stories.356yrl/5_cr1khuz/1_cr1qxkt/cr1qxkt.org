That's kind of disappointing. I had two ideas which really caught my interest:

- Harry dies early on in the Horcux hunt and Ron and Hermione have to find a way to destroy the Horcuxes

- Somewhere in 5th or 6th year, Ron realizes that Harry is going dark and tries to stop him from becoming the next LV.
