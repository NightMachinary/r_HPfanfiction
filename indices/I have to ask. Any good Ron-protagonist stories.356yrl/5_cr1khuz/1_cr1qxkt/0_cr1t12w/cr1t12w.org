I feel like both of these ideas when written in fic tend to be more about removing Harry as the main protagonist. In which case, it really doesn't make sense not to focus on Ron AND Hermione (a Horcrux hunt plot would naturally be driven more by Hermione than Ron, for instance), instead of just Ron himself, so it'll still feel like Trio-fic or maybe just Ron/Hermione shipping.

Also a good Ron voice is pretty difficult to pull off in general, IMHO.
