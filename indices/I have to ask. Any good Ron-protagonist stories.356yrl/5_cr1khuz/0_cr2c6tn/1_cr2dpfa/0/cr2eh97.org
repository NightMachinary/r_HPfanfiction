Yes, because he's human. Do the mistakes you make invalidate your good qualities? Of course not. Everyone has moments of wrong judgement, and yet because Ron isn't perfect and made a couple of mistakes, like any kid would (because this is a story about kids, you can't always expect them to make the best of choices) you say there's no merit to his character. I respectfully disagree.
