Why not? There's HUGE POTENTIAL, and that's what makes a good protagonist. A good protagonists learns and changes and grows up, and Ron has shown that he can do all that, that he owns up to his mistakes, that he makes mistakes (that can drive a plot forward), that he has issues (that can be resolved in the plot for character growth) etc etc etc. A protagonist doesn't need to be perfect, he needs to be someone that can drive a plot forward, and Ron definitely can.
