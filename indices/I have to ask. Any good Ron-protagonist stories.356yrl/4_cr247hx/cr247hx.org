[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305062/1/Speed][Speed]] by Clell65619, great fic. Ron gets saved by the Flash, along with his innate magic, from a lightning strike, which turns Ron into another Flash.

Still a bit dim, still has moments of great stupidity, but he becomes a much truer hero than in cannon.
