They all have their own appeal, but I think Maru would hold the most interest for an older guy. I think that most of the others have significant childish (not necessarily bad) qualities that would turn off people who are more cynical, or more seasoned.

For example, Penny is so shy she barely gets her name out. Most people wouldn't find that attractive at an older age; by then, I wouldn't want to teach a partner how to live, I want a partner who is whole person already, and who knows how to live without relying on somebody.

Maru, and maybe Leah, seem to have very complete lives and ambitions. They know who they are and what they want in life. The others seem a bit too childish for an older character, in my opinion. But with a good author, anything is possible.
