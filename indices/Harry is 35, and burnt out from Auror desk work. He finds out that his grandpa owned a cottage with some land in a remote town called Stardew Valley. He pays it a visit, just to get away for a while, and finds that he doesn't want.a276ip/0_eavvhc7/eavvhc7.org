The letter was delivered by post, and this was odd.

This was odd because Harry's letters never came by post. No, they arrived by owl and floo, by magic and providence, but never by something as banal as a postman. Harry twirled the letter in his hands.

“Who brought this here, again?” he asked the auror at the door.

“The postman, sir,” answered Bowlish. Bowlish was a young lad in his twenties, fresh out of Hogwarts. He wasn't particularly bright, but with the heavy toll of two wars weighing down on Britain's shoulders, Harry didn't have much choice when it came to recruitment. It was either Bowlish or one of the Goyle kin.

Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek. “You mean, the mail-cart?” he asked finally, referring to the magical monstrosity that trolled the Ministry's halls, dispensing letters left and right with the power and accuracy of a WWII submachine gun.

“No, sir,” answered Bowlish. “The postman. I dare say he completed his job with flourish, although the poor chap was rather shocked at first.”

“He was shocked? Why was he shocked?”

“Well, he was a muggle, sir.”

Harry slowly counted to five in his head. Then, he counted to twenty, just in case.

“You let a muggle,” he began, slowly, trying not to grind his teeth (Hermione would notice) together, “here, into the /Ministry of Magic/, just to /deliver a letter?/”

“Well, it was a letter for you, sir,” Bowlish chipperly answered, like that explained everything. “Oh, don't worry. We checked him for dark magic an' spells an' all, an' obliviated him right soon after. The look on his face, sir, you can't imagine! The lads and I laughed ourselves silly, why, Diggens nearly pissed ‘imself--”

Feeling a migraine coming on, Harry glanced out the window, letting Bowlish's babbling wash over his ears. It wasn't even ten in the morning, and his underlings had already violated exactly one hundred seventy-two...no, scratch that, one hundred and seventy-three laws (Hermione had instituted a new one just two days ago), and now he had to deal with the consequences. Idly, more in order to refrain from murdering his subordinate on the spot than anything else, Harry cut open the envelope and unfolded the letter, quickly scanning it with his eyes.

Bowlish was still talking when Harry jumped and threw a cloak over his shoulders.

“Sir?” Bowlish snapped to attention. If there was anything the new aurors were good at, it was pomp and ceremony. “Headed out, sir? Should I alert the Minister?”

“No,” answered Harry curtly.

“Then, an escort, perhaps?”

“No.”

“I must remind that you have a meeting with the Cabinet at one, with Mr. Malfoy at two-thirty, and with the Minister at three.”

“I will be making none of those,” said Harry, wrapping a scarf about his shoulders.

“But, sir,” Bowlish looked confused, “where are you headed?”

“Vacation,” answered Harry, taking out his wand. “I'm headed on vacation.”

And with a flurry, he disappeared, leaving Bowlish blinking in confusion at the sudden departure of his boss.
