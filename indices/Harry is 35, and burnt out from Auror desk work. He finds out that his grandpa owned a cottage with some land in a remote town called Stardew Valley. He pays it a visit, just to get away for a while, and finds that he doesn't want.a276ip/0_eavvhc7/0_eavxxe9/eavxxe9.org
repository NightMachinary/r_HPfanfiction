The train came to full stop, steam hissing into frigid winter air. Harry hopped off, stepping carefully on the ice-clad platform. /Stardew Valley/ read the sign above. /Population, 63./

Harry thought that was a nice number. 63. Not too small, but not a hundred either. It was somewhere right in middle, perfectly positioned, perfectly balanced, like all things should be.

There hadn't been much balance in Harry's life lately. Actually -- there hadn't been any balance at all, ever, not when he was a hungry kid, huddled in the darkness of the cupboard under the stairs, nor when he was at Hogwarts, seemingly forever chased by things that wanted to kill him.

That's not saying there hadn't been any good times. There had been. Hogwarts had been a dream. A magical castle, where, for the first time in his life, he had made real friends. And those friends had stuck with him through the most terrible and darkest of times, and then, when the war was finally over, they had all hugged, delighted that they were still breathing. That they were alive. Believing that the future would be better, somehow. Brighter, for all.

And, for a while, it had been. Harry had married Ginny, and the several years that followed were filled with happiness and light. They had laughed and cried, and even considered making a baby together. It was the best time of his life.

And then came the pox.

Voldemort's failsafe. Activated in the event of his death. Just when Britain's magical society had finally believed the worst to be over -- when the last Death Eater was locked away -- it came, and it burned through young and old, through men, women, and children, taking life after life after life...

Ginny had passed. Harry buried her body on a plot of land, just behind the small house they had purchased. There were pines there. Ginny had always liked them.

Two weeks later, Malfoy found a cure. He always had been good at potions. But that didn't matter, because Ginny was gone, and Harry hated Malfoy even more now, because if he had found the cure earlier, then Ginny would still be alive. But that's how life is, sometimes. Angry, lost, and confused, Harry threw himself into the job. He worked day and night, all hours, burning himself just as well as pox would have. In a year, he lost three stone. One month later, Hermione forced to him to take a break.

When Harry returned to the Auror's office, his zeal was gone. He drifted through the days, like a ship with no berth. There was nothing to hope for. There was nothing to dream.

Until this letter. This place.

Harry took a deep breath, the air crisp and fresh, stinging and free -- there wasn't any air like this in London.

“Let's go see the farm,” he said to himself, and set down the road among the snow-laden pines.
