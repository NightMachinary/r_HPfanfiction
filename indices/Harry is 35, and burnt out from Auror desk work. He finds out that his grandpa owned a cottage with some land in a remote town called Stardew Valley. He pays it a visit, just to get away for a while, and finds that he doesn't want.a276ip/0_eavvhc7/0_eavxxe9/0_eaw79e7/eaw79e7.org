It turned out, winters in Stardew were a sleepy affair. There wasn't much to do, but that wasn't a bad thing. Harry quickly found common ground with the locals, who tended to congregate in a cozy establishment called ‘The Stardrop Saloon' in the evening. They were a quirky lot. So far, Harry had befriended an old fisherman named Willy, was had gifted him a rod and was teaching him how to fish; a bubbly blond girl called Haley, who staunchly reminded him of Lavender; and a middle-aged interracial couple, who had baffled him on their first meeting, asking whether a tomato was a fruit or a vegetable.

Vegetable, Harry had answered after some time, because no matter what the scientific classification was, no one put tomatoes in their fruit salad and called it a ‘fruit salad' anymore. And if they did, they were probably french, and so their opinion didn't matter anyway. Upon hearing his reasoning, the woman -- Robin -- had laughed uproariously and given him a roguish wink, telling him he was always welcome in their home.

They were kind people, these folk. Some of them were maybe withdrawn, others burdened by heavy secrets, but everyone had -- and Harry had a little trouble putting this into words -- but everyone had this spark inside them, something that shined, making them seem unique and special and so vibrantly alive.

Folk weren't like that in the city. There, everyone was focused on themselves, their own problem and burdens, rushing to and fro, and it was always washed out in a haze of depressed urban cognizance.

Well, there was nothing depressing about Stardew Valley. The air was crisp and smelled of pine, the people always had some time to chat, and the days passed by in a leisurely grace that Harry was still trying to get accustomed to.

There were also many interesting things to discover. Like, what could be hidden under the snow, or what sort of monsters lurked in the mine, or what kind of wizard lived in the tower beyond the lake which was to the west of Marnie's farm.

Harry had heard about the wizard just yesterday, when he was sipping on a glass of mulled wine at the Stardrop Saloon, and it had instantly piqued his interest. But not because he actually wanted to meet the wizard. No, it was because Harry didn't want to be found. He had left London without telling a soul, and, frankly, he wasn't ready for anyone to find him.

So the next day, Harry laced up his winter boots, put on an old Weasley sweater, a coat, and then set off to find the mysterious wizard.

Snow was falling gently. It twirled around, a tango of tiny dancers. Harry walked, listening to the sound of silence and the snow, and he was suddenly taken far away, to another winter day, an evening when he had been walking with Hermione along the cobblestone path of Godric's Hollow, and there had been almost no uncertainty and no hope, but only darkness ahead.

His thoughts turned heavy and dull, and its uncertain where this would have led, if a shrill shriek hadn't pierced the air, startling him back reality.

“Help! Somebody...somebody, help, please!”

The voice was unfamiliar, but that didn't give him pause. Harry rushed forward, snow crunching audibly under his feet as he hustled out of the forest and out to the lake by Marnie's farm. There, a pretty girl with flaming hair was jumping up and down in the snow, desperately gesticulating at some machine that was angrily buzzing above her.

“Help!” she yelled, spotting Harry. “It's a JoJo-drone! It's stealing my tools!”

The Jojo-drone hissed and swatted lower, aiming for the aforementioned tools that the girl was trying to guard. Harry's instincts kicked in quick. Still on the run, he leaned down and picked up a handful snow, packing it into a tight ball. Then, reaching for his wand with his other hand, he chucked the snowball as hard as he could, hastily whispering a spell under his breath. The drone reacted instantly to the assault, tilting up in a sharp evasive maneuver, but it was too late. Guided by magic, Harry's projectile smacked right into one of the motors and knocking it off-balance. The drone whirred angrily, sparks flying out of the engine as it zig-zagged through the air. Its operators were obviously trying to regain control of the machine, but the damage had been done. Gravity was winning this battle, and with a final desperate electronic wail, the drone plunged into the icy waters of the lake, forever disappearing from view.

“Oh, thank you, thank you!” the girl turned to Harry, ecstatically clapping her hands. “Oh, you must be a magician, you arrived just in time!”

“Err, just in the right place, I guess,” Harry sheepishly said, hiding his wand. “What was that thing?”

“You don't know?” The girl frowned, blowing a lock of hair out of her face. “A JoJo-drone. They usually use them for surveillance, but they harass us when they think they can get away with it.”

“A JoJo...drone?” Harry asked with a pause.

“Yes...JoJo...you know, like the corporation?” The girl looked at him with her wide, caramel eyes and then her eyebrows rose and she exclaimed, “Oh, you must be the new guy in town! Of course you don't know! And we haven't met! I'm Leah!” She stuck out her hand brusquely.

“Harry,” he said, shaking her hand. “So these JoJo people were trying to steal your tools?”

“Yeah,” Leah said, pointing to the ground. “I'm an artist. I come here to paint sometimes, but those bastards--” she gestured towards the sky with her fist “--saw me and tried to take advantage. And it would have worked, too, if you hadn't come! Let me repay you--”

“Oh that's not necessary--” Harry began, but Lead waved her hands, shutting him down.

“Hot chocolate!” she exclaimed. “I make the best hot chocolate this side of the Bann! You must -- you absolutely must -- have a cup!”

Harry glanced towards the sun, which was inching towards its zenith. “I was actually going to see the wizard...” he said, trailing off, but Leah exclaimed, “That's perfect! You'll be coming back late then, you'll be cold, and some hot chocolate will be just the thing you'll need! Promise me!” She continued to say, leaning down to grab that things that had been scattered in the attack, “promise me you'll come! I live near, in the cabin just south of Marnie's farm! It's right on the way to town! Promise!”

Unable to withstand the sudden barrage, Harry unwillingly smiled and promptly capitulated. “I promise.”

“That's good then!” Leah straightened, and Harry was suddenly struck by how much she looked like Ginny. “I'll be waiting. Adieu!”

“Bye,” Harry said, waving at her retreating form. He watched her gradually disappear into the snow, and then turned back west, looking at the tower that he could see looming in the distance.

It was time to see just who this wizard was.
