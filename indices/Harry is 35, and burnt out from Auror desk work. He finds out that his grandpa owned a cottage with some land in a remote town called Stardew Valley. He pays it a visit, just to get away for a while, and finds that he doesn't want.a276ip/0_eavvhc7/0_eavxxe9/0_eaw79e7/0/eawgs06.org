The wind picked up soon after that, obscuring the tower in flurries of snow. When Harry stumbled onto it nearly two hours later, it appeared almost out of nowhere, as if it had been concealed with a spell.

Which was entirely possible, but that wasn't Harry's primary concern at the moment.

No, his eyes were glued to the figure sitting on the tower's steps. A man, in flowing robes, with a long, dazzling beard, his head bend low against the wind. /It can't be/, thought Harry, his heart skipping a beat. Despite the fatigue straining his muscles, he picked up his speed and plowed through the deep snow ahead. /It can't be, he's dead. I watched him die./

But the posture, the clothes...they seemed so familiar, /too/ familiar, and Harry's heart was already beating a mile a minute when he rushed up to the figure and gasped:

“Dumbledore?!”

The figure moved.

It wasn't Dumbledore. Of course. Harry suddenly felt very silly for even thinking that. Dumbledore was dead, and this was just an old man with a long beard, and that made sense, because it isn't uncommon for old men to grow long beards.

The man's face crinckled up into a smile. “Harry Potter,” he said in a wheezing, but friendly voice, “I've been waiting for you for quite some time. Come in! Come in, and we will talk.”

Still feeling embarrassed from his foolish mistake, Harry silently followed the man up the steps, wondering what sort of mystery he had stumbled onto...again.

. . . .

“I seem to be at a disadvantage,” Harry said ten minutes later, when the kettle was cheerily boiling on the stove, and the coldness of winter had evaporated between the walls of this small, yet cozy place.

“Marnecus!” the wizard introduced himself. “But my friends call me Marny!”

“We haven't...met before, have we?” suddenly asked Harry. There something so very familiar in the wizard's features, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

“No,” Marnecus chuckled. “But you have met my sister!”

“Your sister?”

“She's a professor at Hogwarts!” the old man proclaimed proudly, and Harry suddenly realized why he seemed familiar. “You're Trelawny's brother!” he exclaimed. “I mean, uh, Professor Trelawny's.”

“Oh, there's no need,” Marnecus waved his hands. “Just call her Sybill. Or Syb. Tea?”

“You mentioned you were waiting for me,” said Harry some time later, when the tea had been poured and the biscuits set. Harry cautiously took one. He liked biscuits, but Hagrid's cooking had taught him well that blind trust in other people's culinary skills could lead to a cracked tooth -- or worse.

“Syb and I share the gift,” Marnecus explained, taking a biscuit of his own. He promptly bit into it and when he didn't cry out in sudden pain, Harry followed suit. “But I retain the memories of my prophecies, and she does not. I don't know which one of us that favors, but in your case, I saw you coming in our time of need.”

“Your time...of need?” Harry asked. He was rapidly disliking where this conversation was going. He didn't come here to be a hero. He came to forget.

“I know you came here to forget,” said Marnecus, and Harry almost jumped. “But you're already involved, whether you like it or not.”

“Involved..?” Harry began, and then his shoulders sagged in exasperation. “The drone,” he sighed.

“The JoJo-drone, indeed. Leah's not a rich girl, and losing the tools of her trade would have been a big hit to her. She might not have recovered, forcing her to sell the land.”

“And that's what these...JoJo people want?” asked Harry. “The land?”

Marnecus nodded. “They've been trying to buy out the village for some time, but with little luck. When they realized their money wasn't getting the job done, they started resorting to threats. Now, they're directly attacking folk. I fear the situation will only escalate from this point on.”

Harry looked down, at the bright teapot and the cheery plates with golden biscuits placed in concentric circles. “I don't want to fight,” he said. “I have enough battles to haunt me.”

Marnecus was silent was some time. “Well, I won't push,” he said finally, and then cocked his head, like a sparrow. “Now, why don't you tell me about Hogsmeade? It's been years since I've been there. Is Honeydukes still up? And that dame -- Madam Rosmerta -- oh, the knockers on her, pardon my forwardness! And...”

Marnecus talked on, asking questions that Harry was happy to recall the answers to. Gradually, he felt himself growing more relaxed and responding swiftly, telling Marny about dragons and snitches and potions brewed in a girl's lavatory. The old man was the perfect audience, listening raptly, slapping his knees with the palms of his hands as he laughed at Harry's stories.

Harry felt his own mouth curve up into a smile on several occasions, and was dejected when he realized it was time to go.

“Remember to stop by Leah's!” Marny shouted out the door, when Harry, bundled up against the cold, strode into the darkness. “Just follow the light! It'll lead you right to hers!”

“Alright!” yelled Harry back, and then turned away, facing the wind and the snow. Just a few feet ahead of him, a small magical firefly -- Marny's creation -- hovered steadily. It was ready to take him back to town.

For some reason, that felt like going home.
