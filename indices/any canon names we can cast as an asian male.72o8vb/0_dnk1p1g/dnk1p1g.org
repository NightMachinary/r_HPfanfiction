A name does have to sound Asian to belong to an Asian person, either because of a change in last name during immigration or adoption. Or, maybe the kid is Eurasian, with an Asian mom and a Caucasian dad, so he has a Caucasian sounding surname. Those are just a few examples of Asian people with white sounding names. Also, I don't know a single Asian person born in the US with a first name that doesn't sound "American". I can't imagine naming conventions are that different in the U.K.
