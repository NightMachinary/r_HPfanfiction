You can imagine any number of backgrounds to get a WASP-y name on an Asian dude, and Rowling endorses reading characters as any race or ethnicity you want --

But that's rather thin on the ground when you want your readers to understand, unavoidably and to their core, that this person is Korean or Vietnamese or Mongolian. So you'd have to bring it up again and again, rub our faces in it, make it a plot point. Which might not be what you're after.

So maybe change someone's name, or create an OC and link them to the existing students via their relatives?
