  If you're looking at the obscure, mentioned-only-once names, you might as well just pick an OC.

Debatable. While the character will essentially be an OC, someone who's making a "single-point-of-departure" fic where everything is supposed to be consistent with canon may not want to make up a new Hogwarts student out of thin air who would surely have been mentioned somewhere in the canon timeline.
