If you're looking at the obscure, mentioned-only-once names, you might as well just pick an OC.

Alternately, if you're that stuck on canon names, you could say they're adopted, or have one white English parent, or are the child of immigrant (grand)parents that gave the kid an English name in an attempt to assimilate more (possibly the adults legally changed their own names for the same purpose).
