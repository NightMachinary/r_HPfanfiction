If the characters have surnames, then none of the ones you've listed above are very 'Asian' surnames. I believe in some parts of India, children have their fathers' first names as surnames, so that's something you might be able to use. Peregrine Derrick, for example, has a last name that could be a first name. However, you'll probably be hard-pressed to find anyone named Peregrine.

If only the characters' first names are known, sure, you could cast some as Asians, so long as you give them a surname that sounds Asian. Using anglicised first names is fairly common in some parts of Asia. I, for one, was born in Asia, and have an anglicised first name, like many others in my home country.
