A while ago I finished such a fic where Harry, eventaully says fuck it all and goes to finish his education in a magical school in the states. There he meets a girl named Sophie and long story short, Harry is now an America-based wizard. I don't recall the name though.

EDIT: The story was called The Final Straw, by Belerephon30 (and also had a an alt take on the story called The Brave New World) but I can't find them anywhere anymore.
