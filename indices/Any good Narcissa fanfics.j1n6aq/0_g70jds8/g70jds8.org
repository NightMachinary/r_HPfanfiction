The Narcissa Militant series by Lomonaaeren has a fantastic Narcissa who is an assassin, immensely capable and in control. It's crack with some semi-serious world building/magical theory around light/dark spells, wards, blood magic, etc. Fits your request well because she is entirely focused on keeping her family safe and happy.
