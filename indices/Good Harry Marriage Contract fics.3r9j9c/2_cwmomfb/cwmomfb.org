There's a very old fic, by a guy named "Clel" followed by several numbers. It's just called "the marriage contracts" it's Harry/Daphne and is a seventh year/post war fic. Harry spends large amounts of time with Neville, gives dumbles consistently more ridiculous tales of how he defeated voldemort, and turns down about 800 marriage contracts following his defeat of the dark tosser.
