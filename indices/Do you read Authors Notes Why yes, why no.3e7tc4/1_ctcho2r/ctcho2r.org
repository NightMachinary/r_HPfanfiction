I do. I actually get tired of people bitching about how someone's A/Ns are too long and distracting because it takes less than a second to skip over it if you don't want to read it. With some fics that span over years, it's kind of fascinating to see the author grow up through the A/Ns--such as the story starts out with the author saying "Sorry this chapter is late, but I had to study for my AP Lang test" and then later on "Just graduated college!" and then "Sorry this chap is late, my son's being a nuisance again."

However, I also think that A/Ns should never be necessary to read to understand the story. I do really enjoy the little tidbits about their lives, or the story choices they made, though.
