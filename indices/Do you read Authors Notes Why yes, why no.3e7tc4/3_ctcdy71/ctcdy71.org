Depending on the author note. I like extra story meta, so I don't mind that sort of thing or when authors talk about their writing process. I post author notes and usually it's brief and just thanking reviewers/readers, sometimes it's clarifying something that I see a lot of in reviews.

eg; in the 2014 Pottermore article it says Hannah retrained as a healer and applied to Hogwarts. I have her in a story and people were leaving me reviews saying it was 'cliche and uncreative' to have both Longbottoms work at Hogwarts, so I clarified that that was canon because I don't appreciate someone calling me 'uncreative' over something that JKR wrote. Sometimes it's just easier to leave an a/n explaining a decision than to get a bunch of reviewers telling you "Lavender died at the BOH". (I have some sticklers for canon who read my stuff?)
