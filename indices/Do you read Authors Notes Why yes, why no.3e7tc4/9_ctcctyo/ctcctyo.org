I only read maybe the first one before the story starts because they often give us a better idea of what the story is about, especially if the summary is cryptic.

I usually don't read any others because authors unfortunately spoil a lot of the upcoming plot in their A/Ns (ex. warning: character death ahead or explicit scenes ahead, etc.)
