I generally don't read them anymore since I've been spoiled by them a few times. One author in particular would put in a note explaining something in the chapter, but it was at the start of the chapter instead of at the end. (I'm also not a fan of authors who feel the need to explain things from their chapters in great detail - if it's not clear in the chapter, then I'm probably not going to enjoy your writing.)

I also tend to skip them if they're very long. A/N should be short and sweet, IMO.
