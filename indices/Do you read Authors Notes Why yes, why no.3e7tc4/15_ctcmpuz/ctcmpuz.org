I read them. There is often helpful things there, and it helps me (at least I think so) get to know the author a little more and what kind of person they are. Sometimes they address problems of continuity or other such things. As an author (so far only one time) who uses them, I found it annoying when people would ask questions about things that I had answered in my author's notes.
