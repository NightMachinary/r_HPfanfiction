It really depends on the author. I'll read them the first couple of times and keep reading them if they pertain to the story itself, like things that happened in the last chapter, or where song lyrics they've incorporated came from.

I'll skip them if the author is just blathering on about why their update schedule is taking too long, or thanking the usernames of people who helped them, or answering questions from their reviews about where they plan to go with the story, etc. Some authors take themselves way too seriously and will call their readers stupid petnames or get mad at people who leave bad reviews, I tend to skip those too.
