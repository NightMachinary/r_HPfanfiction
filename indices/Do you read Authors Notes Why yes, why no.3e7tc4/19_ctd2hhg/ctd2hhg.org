I do, in part because they're entertaining, whether or not they're quality.

In most top-notch fanfictions, there either aren't ANs or they are there to add some sort of context that isn't common knowledge.

In the rest of them, they give random personal anecdotes, review replies of varying degrees of seriousness, and in some of the so bad it's good guilty pleasure fics, a healthy dose of randomness that hasn't been enjoyed since the days of Myspace.

Whether they're good or bad, they have an entertainment value.
