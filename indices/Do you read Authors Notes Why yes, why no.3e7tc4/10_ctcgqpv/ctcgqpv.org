I skim over the long replies to reviews, the regular "read and review!" lines, the "I'm (username) on tumblr/twitter, pls follow!" repeated on each chapter, and disclaimers. I read everything left, and if I feel the ANs are not worth the time reading them, I usually just drop the story. I do understand how authors may want to leave a long AN to ward off weird reviewers with ridiculous demands, but I don't think they should be needed.

I expect there to be chapter specific warnings at the top of a chapter when needed, and the citing at the foot when they quote things. I like it when authors leave translations for the words/sentences in other languages they used.
