There is another reason I started leaving out author's notes.

I wanted write in such a way that the fic didn't need explanations in the notes. A friend in the publication world explained that a lot of fanfic authors she worked with could not write a story without the reader's knowledge of the HP construct or inserting information in the author's notes.

As part of my attempts to start writing more original works, I started leaving less and less information in the author's notes. If I ever convince myself to write original, I won't have the crutch of an author's notes to explain character motivations or plot turns.

It will have to stand on it's own.

I still enjoy the meta that exists in author's notes though.
