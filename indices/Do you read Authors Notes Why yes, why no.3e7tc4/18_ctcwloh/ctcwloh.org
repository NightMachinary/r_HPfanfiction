Sometimes. If they're long, or I know the author uses them for unnecessary commentary, I'll skip past them. But if I know the author answers questions that don't exactly fit into the story itself, I'll make a habit of reading them.

They make it interesting sometimes- I don't always look at when a story was first published, so I'll see notes about the author waiting in line for a book release or movie showing.
