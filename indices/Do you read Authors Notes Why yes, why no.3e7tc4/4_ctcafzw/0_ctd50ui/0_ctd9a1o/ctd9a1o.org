Fanfiction (with chapters) is different from published books in that it is posted as a serial with the audience afforded the chance to comment as each episode is released. In that way it acts more like a television show or a comic book.

Most fanfic authors who put in a foreword aren't even calling it that- it's just another author's note. What I see them as is more of a project's 'statement of intent'; the intention at the beginning rather than the assessment once complete.

Why I like them: it informs me as the reader whether the author is just shooting from the hip or has a concept with a goal in mind. I'm willing to afford a goal-oriented concept more leeway when it comes to weird plot developments, and it makes making commentary more relevant. If I know what they're trying to do, I can say whether I think they're veering off-track or not, and why I think so.
