Some author's notes are useful for context or to explain which version of canon they are abiding by. I despise the ones where they respond to reviewers' questions in such a way that you feel compelled to look up the comment to figure out what the comment refers to. Apologies for real-life matters have a relevant half-life of one published chapter - when you get a second chapter past that, the note should be removed.

I do enjoy historical reference information, which is usually the type of author's note I would post. My favorite of my own notes was a dedication to my late great-Uncle Milton, whose personality had inspired some of the character hijinks in the chapter.

Oh yeah: except for the 'foreword' of a first chapter, they belong at the end.
