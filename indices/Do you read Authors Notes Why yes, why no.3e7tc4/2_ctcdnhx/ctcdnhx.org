Generally, if author's notes are rare or include useful information (e.g., translations of non-English words/phrases that the author included for fun), I'll read them. If they're on every chapter and include a laundry-list of responses to every reviewer, or contain justifications (your story should justify itself!) or spoilers... then no.
