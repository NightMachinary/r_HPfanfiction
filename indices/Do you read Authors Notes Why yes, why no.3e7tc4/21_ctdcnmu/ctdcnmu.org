I have a love/hate relationship with A/Ns. Even from the same author (Bobmin for example) - sometimes I'm in the mood for goofy omake-like A/Ns...and sometimes I just get frustrated when I realize, /wtfity, that A/N was half the fracking chapter!!!/

A/Ns saying how reviews help them write faster actually make me puke in my mouth a little.

A/Ns that insist on replying to /each and every person who has reviewed/ frustrate the ever-loving sh1t out of me and make me want to reach through the computer and slap someone upside their head.

Sometimes I /love/ A/Ns ... if someone say, plugs another story as opposed to some kind of self-fappening of their own work. I forget the author, but at the beginning of each chapter of a story I once read, they recommended someone else's story. And it turned out (as I was enjoying the current story) each story that author recommended was also enjoyable. So there is the love for the A/N. I would have to go through my favorites to figure out who did this - if I have time I'll try to figure it out.
