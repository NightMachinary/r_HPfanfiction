I tend to read them, but they're almost always useless. Begging for reviews, promising the story is going to get better are the two big ones. I also really hate the notes you see at the beginning of amateur stories, where they basically outline the entire plot of the story, and put in every single applicable code they can think of, even if it's a spoiler.
