Seriously, are you mocking my Request of a Harem for Ron Thread? Your Text is basically the exact same as mine, just typed for Hermione, with her negative Characterizations and its posted right an Hour after i did mine. Posting Mocking Comments in a Thread is one thing, but you did it with a New Thread with the same title as mine, just replaced the Name, so everyone can see you are mocking my Thread. If you are like this in RL, then you must have much Friends!
