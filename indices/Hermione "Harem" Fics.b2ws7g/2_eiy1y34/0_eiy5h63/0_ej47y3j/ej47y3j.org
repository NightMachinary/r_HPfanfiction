ok, then i misinterpreted your Text. But its still strangely Written and the partners are also not reallly realistic. Death eaters, Werewolfes....there are exceptions sure, but most of them wouldnt go with a Muggleborn. Also, since your text was basically written as mine and released just shortly after mine, i got the feeling you were mocking my request. If you had used my Nick or linked my request, then i probably wouldnt have replied like this...maybe with a bit of text adaption like "as .... requested in his Thread, im looking for ... in my Thread".

As for the females/males: that are just the sex/gender classes and Females is a generic term for Girls and Woman as males is for Boys/Man. I dont see any dehumanizing in using it. It would be dehumanizing, if i said "well, those strange living beings with Long Hair, long legs, no Penis between their Legs and strange Bags on their Chests. Oh, and they bleed once in a Month". The Term Female is a shortcut for Girls and Woman, like males for their counterpart.
