I didn't mean it as a personal attack on you, but a general commentary on many threads, requests and recs treating harem as a serious genre, in the sub that generally dismisses so many pairings as "not realistic", "disgusting" or "character *** would never!". But I'm not kinkshaming, you do you and all that.

As to why I posted this as a new thread, I am genuinely interested if such fics with Hermione exist. Why shouldn't they? If Harry (or Ron) can have his harem of busty girls with little to no personality, I want to read about Hermione and her group of sexy studs worshipping her (well, to be honest, not particularly, but it would certainly be interesting to see).

BTW, please don't call girls/women females, it's dehumanizing +as is majority of the harem genre.+
