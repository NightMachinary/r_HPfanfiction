There are quite a few fics that have Harry delving into dark magic, but more intimate explorations of /what/ dark magic actually is (regardless of the world-building) are much rarer. I'll try to give some of the better examples or at least more interesting ideas:

- linkffn(12723942): Out of the Night is more of a world-building of dark wizards than anything else, but you can't deny its more fleshed out yet reasonable than 95% of what comes out of fanfiction.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): solid chance you've read this one, but some of the more detailed mechanics of dark magic are handled fairly well and with a more academic touch. It doesn't go the route of "all harmful magic is dark magic," but rather its the intent behind the magic itself that makes something the Dark Arts.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): in many ways the antithesis of HP and BWL, but it goes into quite a depth with its exploration of dark magic, though admittedly this is a fic I enjoy more for the world-building and unique storylines than magical exploration.
- linkffn(Lesser Evils): more of a focus on the brutality of dark magic, this fic nevertheless goes into fair detail showing the Dark Arts.

There is probably more, but those come off the top of my head.
