[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP's Library]] has everything you want.

- Ratings for stories
- Reviews focused on informing other readers
- Massive pool of stories that have already been rated and reviewed

There's even a tool to recommend you new fics based on your reading tastes, which you can find [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/recommended.php][here.]] It learns from which stories you rate what, and recommends you other stories based on similar user's preferences.

The DLP ratings are also incorporated into the search tool [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]], and will be displayed on the side if a library thread exists for that story in the list, along with a link to the thread.
