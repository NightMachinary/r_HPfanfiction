Not so much critiques as a review that would state things like slow plot, poor grammar, abandoned or detailed descriptions, OOC characters, but well justified and explained. Things that aren't necessarily for the author to read, but the reader.

Like yelp reviews restaurants on their quality and service, I was looking for a site that reviewed stories on their quality and writing.
