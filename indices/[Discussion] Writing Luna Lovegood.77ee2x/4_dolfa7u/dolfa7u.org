She's certainly hard to write. You want to get her strangeness across as well as her empathy as well as her misery. They're all linked by the death of her mother when she was young, or that's how I see it.

I really liked her portrayal in Linkffn(3676590) where's she incredibly blunt, really tests Harry's patience with her intensity, seemingly no sense of embarrassment but she's also nice.
