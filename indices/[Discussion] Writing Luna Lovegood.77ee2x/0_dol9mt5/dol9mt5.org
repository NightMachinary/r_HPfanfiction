I also loved her in linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke)

I think a lot of writers have this idea that Luna is totally comfortable in her status as an outsider when she's not. She's a pretty lonely character ( " I enjoyed the meetings, too. It was like having friends."). I doubt that she shirks off the bullying as easily as many fics depict. Some of her beliefs are also plain dumb, and many writers tend to portray Hermione as unreasonable and close-minded when she actually had a point.

I'd like to see more about her parents. One thing I've barely seen explored is Luna's relationship with her mom. Luna seems to be one of the few people able to see Thestrals at such a young age and I'd like to read about how witnessing her mother's death influenced her. Also, anything post-DH about Luna and her Dad. I can't imagine her taking the news of him trying to hand Harry, Ron and Hermione to the Death Eaters very well, even if it was for her sake.
