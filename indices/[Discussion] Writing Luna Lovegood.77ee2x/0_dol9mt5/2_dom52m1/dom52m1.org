  One thing I've barely seen explored is Luna's relationship with her mom. Luna seems to be one of the few people able to see Thestrals at such a young age and I'd like to read about how witnessing her mother's death influenced her.

That's actually a major plot point of one of my favorite Luna stories, /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./
