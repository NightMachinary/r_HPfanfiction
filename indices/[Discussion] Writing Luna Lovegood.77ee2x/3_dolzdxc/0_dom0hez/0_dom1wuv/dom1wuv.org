  Actually, considering this universe has Billywigs--electric blue wasps that cause you to float when they sting you, I have no problem whatsoever thinking wrackspurts exist.

The first 3 times I read that sentence I thought you were referring to our universe. I got very excited.

Also, that was an A+ quote. It pretty much encapsulates my thoughts on the subject of higher powers and afterlife and such. Like, yeah, logically, no such thing should exist, but I don't really want to just die and have literally nothing happen afterwards, that sounds really depressing, so I prefer to believe that there is something after death. And "talking with my higher power" has practically nothing to do with thinking I'm gonna get some kind of a response and everything to do with it being a kind of comfort to talk to something that can't or won't respond, like talking to your dog or cat. As long as you're "aiming" your thoughts to some ethereal being, or the universe, or Thor almighty, it doesn't really feel like you're just talking to yourself.
