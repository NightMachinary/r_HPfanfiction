  Luna says things that sound crazy, in her matter of fact tone, like that those brain fuzzy bug things are what's causing Harry to not think straight, Harry just thinks that Luna has a crazy belief in nonexistent fuzzy bug things. Luna thinks that obviously Harry isn't thinking straight, because the fuzzy bug things are affecting him, because that is how the system of the world works. That's the logical explanation.

Actually, considering this universe has Billywigs--electric blue wasps that cause you to float when they sting you, I have no problem whatsoever thinking wrackspurts exist.

  Disclaimer: If it seemed like I was ridiculing those with a belief in a high power, I was not intending it that way. I myself have a belief in a higher power, despite the fact that my own system of logic says no higher power exists. This is also the difference between me and Luna, that she believes in her creatures because her logic system says they do exist, rather than believing in the creatures despite her logic system saying they don't.

When you put it that way, I can't help but think of Puddleglum's speech from C.S. Lewis's /The Silver Chair./

"Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things --- trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia."
