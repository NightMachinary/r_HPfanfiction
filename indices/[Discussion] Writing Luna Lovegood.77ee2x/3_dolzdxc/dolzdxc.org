For me, I think the most interesting part of Luna's personality is the part the Hermione /can't stand./ This also happens to be the part most writers fuck up. Most writes portray the ditsy part of Luna as a belief system, like Luna just had a blind faith in mythical creatures existence. While this is very close to the truth it's still missing a core aspect.

Why does Hermione dislike Luna so much? Is it because Luna is more accepting of the impossible? Because Luna has her head in the clouds too much?

Hermione is an logical person. Her world operates in facts, and systems. 1+1=2.

The kicker?

Luna is /exactly the same./

But her logic only makes sense to herself.

According to Luna, 1+1=395.

And this /infuriates/ Hermione.

Luna doesn't "believe" in crumple horned whatever's like someone might believe in a higher power, with an absolute faith that disregards common logic.

To Luna, crumple horned whatever's exist because that's what /makes sense./ That is her system of logic. She has this whole internal world of systems, and direct progressions, that if x is this y must be that. But nobody else has been shown that world in all its glory, so when Luna says things that sound crazy, in her matter of fact tone, like that those brain fuzzy bug things are what's causing Harry to not think straight, Harry just thinks that Luna has a crazy belief in nonexistent fuzzy bug things. Luna thinks that /obviously/ Harry isn't thinking straight, because the fuzzy bug things are affecting him, because that is how the system of the world works. That's the logical explanation.

I vaguely remember some exchange between Harry and Luna, where Harry has kind of an internal realization about how Luna sees the world in a different way that only makes sense to her, but I could be completely making it up. If it does exist, it feels like it would either be the talk in the forbidden forest, with the threstral in OotP, or the talk at the very end of OotP, with Luna talking about how her shoes keep disappearing.

Disclaimer: If it seemed like I was ridiculing those with a belief in a high power, I was not intending it that way. I myself have a belief in a higher power, despite the fact that my own system of logic says no higher power exists. This is also the difference between me and Luna, that she believes in her creatures because her logic system says they do exist, rather than believing in the creatures despite her logic system saying they don't.
