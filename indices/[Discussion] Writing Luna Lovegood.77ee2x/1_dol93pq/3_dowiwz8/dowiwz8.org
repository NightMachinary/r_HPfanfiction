  "My housemates stole my shoes" - "The Nargles took my shoes."

  The first one would have Harry seething, the second one just left him baffled, at which point we come back to her incredibly observant and empathetic way of talking to people.

Did she say nargles took her shoes in the movie? She didn't in the book. And Harry felt more sad for her than angry ("pity").

EDIT: No, she says "people" in both the book and the movie.
