I love the analysis of Luna's character here. You definitely put some aspects of her character into a perspective I hadn't considered before. As for what Luna does when she's stressed... your suggestion about petting the owls made me think of Luna feeding the Thestrals. We see her do it in canon; maybe that's what she does to take her mind of things?
