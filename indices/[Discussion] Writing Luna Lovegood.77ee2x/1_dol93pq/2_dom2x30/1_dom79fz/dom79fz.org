We know so little about her, unfortunately. Maybe she has her own pet/familiar? Maybe she is very invested in the Hogwarts Unicorn Herd Foundation... /we don't know/.

In any case, I want her character to be what it deserves. Something 3 dimensional. Someone with strengths and weaknesses, with virtues and flaws. Someone who can truly be the heroine of a good fiction.
