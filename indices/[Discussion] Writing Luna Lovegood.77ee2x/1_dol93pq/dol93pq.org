I hate it when people "sane-wash" her, for a lack of a better word. Luna isn't some seer-type person. What Luna /is/, is very observant and empathetic. We have a short glimpse of that in OotP when she is the one who gets through to Harry - by not even really trying. She also delights in believing. If her creatures are fake or not doesn't really matter. What matters for her character is that she loves to bring them up, to use them as metaphors and to veil the meaning of her words. Not just veil them, but also defuse them.

"My housemates stole my shoes" - "The Nargles took my shoes."

The first one would have Harry seething, the second one just left him baffled, at which point we come back to her incredibly observant and empathetic way of talking to people.

On the other side she is incredibly forgiving and calm, to a point where one might wonder if she just can't express feelings of humiliation, anger and the like. The way she is treated by her housemates has to be a source of constant stress. Her stoicism in the face of this bullying is an aspect many authors see as interesting, but then go ahead and over-emphasize a lot. I personally think that this could be a great place to show her incredible strength and also her stubborn side. The more pressure you put on her, the more she fortifies within herself. But if you focus on her in your story, it would be interesting where she goes or what she does to let all that stress out. Does she explode in privacy? Does she cry herself to sleep under a Silencing Charm? Does she go to the owlery and pet the owls until she feels better?

And all of this is of course also a weakness of her. As good as her way of talking works with Harry - an emotion driven character - as bad does it mess up her relationship with rational thinking characters like Hermione (and probably a majority of Ravenclaw). They think her weird, annoying, uncomfortable and obstructive - unnecessarily complicated and scatterbrained. She probably is a lot of that, too. We know she is smart, but smart and smart can differ greatly between people. Some go straight at a problem, some circle it, some first test whats around the problem and some try to avoid it completely. Luna makes the problem seem like a solution to reverse-engineer an answer, I feel like. And if she can't, she doesn't mind much. Then she just believes. Because to her believing in something is almost as, if not just as good as knowing it (which, to be fair, is something that may have some value in the magical world).

Hmmm... I'm out of things to say for the moment, but I'll add it if I think of something else. Maybe this helps, even though it also seems a bit scatterbrained, now that I re-read it.
