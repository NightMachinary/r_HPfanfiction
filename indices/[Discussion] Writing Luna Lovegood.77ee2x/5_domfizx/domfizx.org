I don't know if you use mbti, but if you do, Luna's an infp. (As am I.) important parts of her personality:

Being authentic is her most important value.

She is inwardly focused to the extent of being visibly socially inept. However, she is observant of others when she finds them interesting.

Unlikely to be flexible about things she truly cares about, but they are few in number. She looks very chill from the outside because 99% of issues that come up are not things she deeply cares about. Internally she is very intense.

Her feelings guide her. She is empathetic and uses her own experiences as a foundation for connecting with other people. She is very good at connecting with Harry about Sirius' death because she has spent so much time processing her mother's death. However, if she is put in a emotional situation that she can not compare to her own experiences, she may flounder until she takes extensive time to think it through.

Not interested in power over others at all.

Does not think in a hierarchical manner. She will ignore titles and rank, instead prioritizing a person's character and knowledge. For example, she may consider it a point of pride to disregard an incompetent prefect.

Not good at managing interpersonal conflict.

She is protective of the people she cares for. When Hermione criticizes her father's work, Luna snaps back to defend him in a way that she does not defend herself.

She is her own bedrock. Her internal sense of logic is based on her own emotions. She feels it is true, therefore it must be true, therefore x, y, and z logically derive from that, and so forth.

How to piss her off: -do something that conflicts with one of her few highly internalized values. If treating animals well is a Valueâ„¢ of hers and not just a habit, animal cruelty may visibly enrage her. -be deliberately unfair or cruel to others. Even if she doesn't like the person being mistreated, she will still be angry on their behalf. Likely to protest the Malfoys getting unjust treatment (even though they imprisoned her).
