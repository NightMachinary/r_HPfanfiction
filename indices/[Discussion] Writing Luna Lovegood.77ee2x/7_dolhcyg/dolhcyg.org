I love her so much though. You actually got it though, how do you describe something that doesn't subject itself to description? "writing her character is like grasping at air. No matter how hard I try, it feels like everything is wrong." is exactly right!

Luna's only quality is that she is unpindownable. That's why everyone in canon feels lighter after talking to her.

You know that metaphor about the glass of water that gets heavier the longer you hold it? Luna's the girl that takes that glass, pours it out, does a rain dance, and invites everyone to pour their own glass on the ground and join her. That's why she makes you feel lighter.

What fanfic often does with Luna is make her make sense. Some ways of doing this are by saying she's damaged and hold people off with her creature comments. Some say she's so smart she uses it as a way to see who around her are smart enough to look past her silliness and recognize her wit. That's fine, but it /is/ the easy way out as I think you'll agree. Because the real Luna doesn't make sense.

She doesn't have a personality like most people because she doesn't have a consistent image of the world in her mind. To her the only truth is what she sees right in front of her, in this moment. She has habits, sure, ways she is used to describing thing, but those aren't even things she consistently hold in her mind, more like recurring themes. You use those when writing her, in a way that feels natural. When does she say a Nargle did something? What does that actually mean to her? If you can understand that, you understand her.

So how the hell do you write that? Well, in the words of an ancient Zen master, "there's no method to it". You can't find a way to do it because you can't grasp what it is that makes her her. But that doesn't mean it isn't possible, you just have to not grasp anything while writing her. Everything Luna does, feels, sees, things, is entirely spontaneous. There's a situation and she has a line? Don't think! Write! You can never find anything to rely upon to make her make sense anyway! So just write her!

If you somehow feel like you can't do it, or it frustrates you. Well that's just your thoughts that are in the way of your spontaneity. You wanna know what Luna calls that? Wrackspurts. How do they go away? Do something spontaneous.
