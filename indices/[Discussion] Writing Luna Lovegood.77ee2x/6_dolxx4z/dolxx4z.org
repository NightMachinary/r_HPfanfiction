Luna Lovegood is one of my very favorite characters, but I agree that she's hard to write.

What do we know?

She is unafraid of her emotions. She laughs so hard she cries at one of Ron's jokes, and it wasn't a very good joke either. But she thought it was funny, and laughed. But it's definitely worth noting that everyone else stopped laughing. So Luna herself is not a jokester.

(Did Luna have a crush on Ron? Maybe, but given that we never see her date anyone in canon, I have a very hard time seeing her pursuing romance with anyone)

While Luna doesn't seem to mind people taking her belongings, she definitely doesn't like it when people make fun of her beliefs. She's subdued, but clearly furious when Hermione mocks the Quibbler as "nonsense," and raises her voice to Parvati and Lavender when she thinks they're laughing at her for backing Harry, and outright fights with Hermione when she agrees that there are no such things as Crumple-Horned Snoracks.

There are several ways to interpret this, but my favorite is that Luna values honestly. She believes in taking people at their word. One could take this as very trusting, or possibly empathetic (After all, why would someone lie about seeing a Snorack?)

She's also very committed. Not driven, but committed. Especially with friendships. The most notable instance isn't the moments of compassion she gives Harry or Hermione, but the scene where she helps drive off Dementors. "Think of something happy, Harry....we're all still here, we're still fighting." Luna undoubtedly is reliving seeing her mother die, and whatever happened to her in Malfoy Manor, when a Dementor gets near her. And there's dozens upon dozens of Dementors surrounding her and her friends. And Luna is certain that an afterlife exists--to her, there would be /nothing/ more terrifying than a Dementor's Kiss. And yet she fights and comforts.

Assuming you're not going too dramatic, a good way to put this sort of interaction in is Luna comforting someone upset when she has every reason to be just as upset. (Think if Luna and Ginny both had detention with the Carrows).

Luna's not without her faults, of course. Much like Hermione, she's stubborn as a mule--though in fairness, nobody ever really tells Luna *why* she's wrong or tries to find a middle option (Take Heliopaths. Hermione dismisses them, Luna insists they're spirits of fire that burn everything in their paths. Fiendfyre, anyone?).

Luna also has a knack of embarrassing honesty. In other words, she is the perfect character to say something when it would be smarter to not say anything at all. Though she doesn't strike me as someone who would betray a secret on purpose, she may say something that was meant to be a bit confidential. Or just have a whisper that carries ten feet. In any case, this could cause problems.

Personally, I'd recommend making sure Luna has somebody to talk to:

Have Luna and Ginny study together in the library, or at the Lake. Maybe give Luna a chance to see what Good Fun Teasing looks like, compared to the bullying she's gotten (Ginny's somewhat of a jokester, so I can see her trying to make Luna laugh)

Have her talk to Hagrid about something (maybe have her apologize--Luna mentions she doesn't think he's a good teacher in OotP, but I find the idea of them interacting delightful).

Oh, and on to your point about fanfics. My favorite fanfics with Luna tend to be those that emphasize her friendship with Ginny (On that note, I once again shed a tear for the magnificent fanfic "Faith and Understanding" that was taken off Fanfiction.net and I stupidly didn't archive it).

"Fire and Air" is one of my very favorites. Ginny is /not/ happy that Luna's barefoot habits are a result of her shoes being stolen, rather than just an eccentricity.
