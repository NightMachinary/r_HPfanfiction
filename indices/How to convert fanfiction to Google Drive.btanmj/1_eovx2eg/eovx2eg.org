If I may ask, why do you consider Google Drive more convenient?

I've used both the Kindle app and Google Drive on my phone, and in my experience Google Drive uses much more RAM/processing power/battery life to handle long word files in comparison to the Kindle app.

Alternatively, if you don't like the Kindle app, you could use the Google Play Books app.
