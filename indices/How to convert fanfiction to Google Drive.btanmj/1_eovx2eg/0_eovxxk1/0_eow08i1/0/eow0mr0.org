I mean Kindle Cloud Reader. I have a school Chromebook with most websites and apps blocked, so I can't use fanfiction websites or download the Kindle app. I can use Kindle Cloud Reader, though. I had been bringing my Kindle to school so I have something to do in my free time (phones aren't allowed) but I somehow lost it.
