[[http://ficsave.xyz][Ficsave]] can be used to convert to ePub, MOBI, and plain text. It cannot export directly to GDrive, but they're just files, you can upload them to anything that'll take them.

There are Numerous E-Reader Apps for Google Drive (ePub/MOBI), and plain text is plain text and can be read by anything.

I have absolutely no Idea if Kindle -> GDrive is even possible. Probably not.
