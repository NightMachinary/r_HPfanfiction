I think I'm going to try out Google Play Books. Signing into my home account is blocked on my Chromebook, but next year websites won't be blocked so it will be convenient (though my phone is technically allowed, I won't be supposed to use it in class). I also like that you can use it on the web so I can use it on any device. Though, it will take a while to redownload all 106 books onto Google Play Books LOL (because I can't upload them from Kindle). Thanks for the recommendations everyone!
