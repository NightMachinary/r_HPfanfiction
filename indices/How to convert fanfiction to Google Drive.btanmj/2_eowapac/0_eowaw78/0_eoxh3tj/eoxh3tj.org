Someone else already mentioned Google play but I will second it. It does epubs and the thing I love is that I can switch from multiple devices like my home computer, my phone and my work computer without an issue.

I don't use AO3 at all. When I am on my phone I just use the epub links that the bot provides and then it's fairly simple to upload to my Play books account on Google. If I find something I like that the bot hasn't generated a link for I just enter the URL for it on ficsave.xyz and then upload it to Google Play.
