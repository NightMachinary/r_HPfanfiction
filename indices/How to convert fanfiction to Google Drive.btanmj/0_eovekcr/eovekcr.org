im fairly certain ao3 has a download option? most conversion websites will take one format and turn it to a pdf and vice versa, though since im not certain what format ao3 uses I can't fully confirm this method.

on my computer i use a program called fanfiction converter to download fics in different formats. you might have to google a bit to find it but it shouldn't be awful. :)
