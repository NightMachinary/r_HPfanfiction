1) I am pretty surprised someone may want to use the plot of Cursed Child (I have a deep hatred for it).

2) Considering your scenario, I you want the OC to touch the Cup without the curse being lifted, just create an event where he touch the cup without planning to do it :

- For example, while Scorpius and Albus leach to hide, Delphi may stay near the Cup "to make sure there is no problem", using the Invisibility Cloack if possible or just under a Desilusion charm. When the victims are near the cup, a Depulso charm in the back of OC, pushed toward Harry, who fall on the cup. Oc is touching Harry when he touchs the portkey, so he should be taked along.
