I'm not sure if it counts as a deviation from canon, as most people ignore or pick and choose information from Pottermore, but I use Charlus Fleamont Potter and Dorea Euphemia Black for James' parents. Combining the two just makes for a much more interesting background story.

As for Hermione, she's very proud of her father for overcoming racism to become a successful dentist (and her mother for overcoming sexism). She's either half or a quarter black, I haven't decided, but she has more of a medium skin tone as a result.
