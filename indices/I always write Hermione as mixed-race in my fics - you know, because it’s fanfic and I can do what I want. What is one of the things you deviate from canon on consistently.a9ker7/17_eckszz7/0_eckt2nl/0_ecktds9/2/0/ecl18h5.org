Thanks. I just find the common narrative utterly boring and quite frankly dumb. Unlike Sirius, Andromeda did not have issues with her family while growing up, so at the very least she was better at hiding her true self. And even then her sisters would have noticed. And Bellatrix joining the Death Eaters to protect her sisters is a better story than evil child becoming evil because she is evil.
