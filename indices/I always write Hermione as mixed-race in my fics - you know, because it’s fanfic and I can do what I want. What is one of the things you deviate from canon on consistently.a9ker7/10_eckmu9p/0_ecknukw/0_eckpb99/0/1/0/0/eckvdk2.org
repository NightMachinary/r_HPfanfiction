  To emigrate somewhere you have to be aware of it as an option and have reason to think it's a good idea.

I believe I mentioned the fact that travel is barely even a problem in the Wizarding World? From this the obvious conclusion to me is that wizards all over the world have had a pretty good idea about world geography for much longer than Muggles. It wouldn't have been impossible, or even uncommon, in my HC, for a 13th century Native American wizard to take a trip to Magical Persia, say.

As for why it'd be a good idea, I mean, Wizarding Britain is a pretty neat place for wizards. Greatest magical school in the world, home of one of the greatest dynasties of wandmakers...
