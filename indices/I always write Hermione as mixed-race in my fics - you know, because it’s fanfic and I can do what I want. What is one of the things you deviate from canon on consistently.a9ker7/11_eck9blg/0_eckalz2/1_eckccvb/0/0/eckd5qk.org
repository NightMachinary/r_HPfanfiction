Well, I have a thing for fiery Hermione's and as much as I love Emma Watson to death as Hermione, race or culture for her does not matter for me. I also have a thing for time travel fics, and while I am not sure this is one, if you are pairing her with Regulus I am assuming its at least something similar in concept. I also like fics that deal with the Black family in some way so it fits that as well. So definitely intrigued.
