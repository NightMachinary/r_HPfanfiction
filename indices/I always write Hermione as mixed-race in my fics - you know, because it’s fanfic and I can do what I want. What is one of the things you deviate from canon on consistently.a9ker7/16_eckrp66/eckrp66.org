I imagine Harry as bisexual. However, in the HP fandom, I've only posted short stories that were either gen or established Harry/Ginny. It's only in my current long fics - not yet posted - that that this is clear. So, I don't know what response that's going to get. Considering fic readers are used to filtering out m/m if they have a problem, it should be accepted.

I also write Hermione with Jessica Sula in mind.
