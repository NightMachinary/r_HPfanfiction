That's probably one of the big things that makes your fics as good as they are. The fact that so much is fleshed out. Your fics often get really into politics and magical theory, and that theres a certain amount of history that seems to be constant within the Starfox5 Extended AU makes going from one fic into another easy.

You also never seem to reuse methods for voldemort's defeat. That also makes it a bit more interesting.
