You have a point, but I see no problem with making the French government every bit as inefficient a bureaucracy as the British Ministry. Hence they would refuse entry to Britons without the proper paperwork. And the Umbridge-Thickness, Voldemort-controlled Ministry would hardly give them that paperwork, even while taking care to remain on perfectly cordial terms with their French colleagues, so that when the British officials say this person isn't allowed to travel, the French believe them and kindly extradite any unlawful fugitives back to Britain, dismissing their talks of Imperiused Voldemort-agents as the mad ravings they clearly are.

  And in my stories, the wizards really don't give a damn about the muggle culture, lacking three hundred years of common history now.

Unless you think of French wizards as particularly isolationists (and I would like to note that the, we're told, /especially/ isolationist MACUSA wizards from /Fantastic Beasts/ have still adopted a lot of Muggle American attitudes, accents, clothing), I don't really see how that would work. If nothing else, the inflow of Muggle-borns and Half-Blood-parents ought to be enough to preserve close ties between Muggle and Wizarding cultures.

  Untouchables who show magic? If you're lucky, the evil people who obviously stole you as a baby from a real wizard family are punished for their crimes and you're getting raised in a proper magical family after you have recovered from that trauma. If you're unlucky, you get killed as the abomination you are.

Er, points for creepiness, but the Untouchables thing doesn't entirely compute. If the wizards are going to enslave other wizards only to not allow them to show magic, ever (and seriously, do you have any idea how many Obscurials that would create?!), why not simply enslave Muggles? Besides which, one would expect the slave-caste of the Wizarding version to not be humans at all, but House-Elves or some other species of similar status.
