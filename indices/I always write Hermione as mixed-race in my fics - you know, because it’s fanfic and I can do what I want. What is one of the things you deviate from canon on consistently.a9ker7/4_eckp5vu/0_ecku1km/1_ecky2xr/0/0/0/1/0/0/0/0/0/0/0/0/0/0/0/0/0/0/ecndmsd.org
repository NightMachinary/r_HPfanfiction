But with wizards, a democracy needs a lot of work and organisation since individual wizards of exceptional skill/power, like Dumbledore, Grindelwald or Voldemort, are much, much more powerful compared to the government than muggles. Having elected leaders won't do anything unless they had the power to enforce their edicts.

And, frankly, I don't see individualists go and risk their lives enforcing the decision to hide from muggles on everyone else if the reason they went into hiding really was "We're sick of muggles". Anyone with that mentality would say: "Alright, I go into hiding, whoever wants to deal with muggles can still do so, no skin off my butt."

The whole SoS really doesn't work with "muggles are a bother, so we'll hide all magic", and "witch hunts are bad so we need to hide" oesn't work either.
