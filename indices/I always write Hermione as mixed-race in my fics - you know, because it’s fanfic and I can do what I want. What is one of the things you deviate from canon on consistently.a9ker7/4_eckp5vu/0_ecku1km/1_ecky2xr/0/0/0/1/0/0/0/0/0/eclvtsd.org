  (Do their day to day shopping in Diagon Alley? Can't even afford to have a servant who will do it for them? I think we have very different views of how wizards would live in a medieval society.)

We probably do. In general, I like your stories (dare I hope that you like mines?) but we have very different headcanons about a lot of thing.

In this particular case, wizards' equivalent of servants are House-Elves, and I don't think Elves are commonly trusted with gold to run errands with in the 20th century; I don't really see why things would have been different in the Middle-Ages. Besides, the sort of shopping a wizard does is mostly for magical items, and the wizard would want to pick those for themselves.

  Also, before the SoS, there was one society. I see no reason why wizards would segregate.

In my view they never really /were/ one society.

In my headcanon, in prehistoric times, there were tribes of magicals and tribes of Muggles, and they didn't really mingle. I'll accept that if a Muggle-born came to one of the Muggle tribes they became the shaman, but that wasn't at all the main place to find wizards in those days. Of those tribes, some trained their magic, perfecting first wandless spells, and, eventually, wandlore; they are the ancestors of the modern wizards; others focused their gifts in one area, and hence rock-carving cave-dwellers became Goblins over generations, and quiet, fleet-footed hunter-gatherers became Elves, and natural legilimenses became Dementors, and so on.

Furthermore I'm firmly convinced by the Ancient Times, wizards were their own bubbles --- not /priests/ to the Muggles as you seem to suggest, but /gods/. For example, there was a thriving wizard citadel on Mount Olympus, the ruling dynasty of which had access to Elixir of Life (Ambrosia & Nectar, don't you know). "Demigods" were usually Half-Bloods whom the around-sleeping pureblood wizards wouldn't dream of training in proper magic, but who would use their magic wandlessly to boost their own abilities.

By the Dark Ages, the wizards were no longer seen as gods, but as the Fair Folk with their immense riches and powers, and strange, amoral ways. As Muggles became numerous enough that Muggle-borns were a noticeable phenomenon for the wizards, so did the tales of "changelings" and babies stolen from cribs come to exist.

Only when Muggle population exploded did the magical communities find themselves with more or less no other choice than to mingle with them regularly, rather than live on their own in their towers with and occasionally swoop in to exact tribute from the nearest village of ignorant peasants. They could no longer truly hide that they were humans of flesh and blood like the Muggles themselves, rather than strange immortal spirits. Still most wizards thought of Muggles as little more than beasts, and lived secluded in their perfect worlds of advanced healing and hygiene and literacy --- though /some/ were happy enough to mingle with the Muggles, the Dumbledores and Harrys of the world, such, one presumes, as the Malfoy who courted the Queen.

But these people, while a /sizable/ minority, were still just a minority. The witch-hunts were only one more thing to convince the already-biased purebloods that Muggles were loathsome creatures who could never live in peace with wizards, and it would be better for anyone if they remained apart. After democratic Wizarding governments and the I.C.W. were instated, replacing the amorphous councils of before, it only took someone /suggesting/ the idea of making the Muggles forget wizards' existed altogether, to realize that a majority of the population was in favor. And so despite outcry by the "blood-traitors", the Statute was implemented.

But they hadn't accounted for the fact that the Muggle population would keep growing and growing to the point that by the end of the 20th century, half-bloods and Muggle-borns far outnumber purebloods and more Muggle culture has seeped in through the cracks of the Statute than was ever known to wizards /before/ the Statute.
