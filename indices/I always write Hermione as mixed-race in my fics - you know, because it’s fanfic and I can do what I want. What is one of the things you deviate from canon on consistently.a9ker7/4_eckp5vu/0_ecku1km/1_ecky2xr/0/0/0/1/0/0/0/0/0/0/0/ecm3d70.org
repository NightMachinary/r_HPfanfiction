  We have a very different origin for wizards then. I see it as the magic talent appearing in muggles as a mutation, slowly spreading along family lines, and I feel that it took a hell of a lot of time for any wizards to be able to actually do something magical, much less anything impressive. By the time magic had advanced to be useful, wizards were still a part of human society and even then it took even longer until they were able to live in a distinctly different style.

Hm, I see. Fair enough. Personally I run on the assumption that magic just appeared someday fully-formed --- a gift from some god or transdimensional entity or what have you.

Out of curiosity, as its own thing separate from /your/ headcanons --- what do you think of my version of Wizarding history?

  Nor do I think they were much more advanced than muggles until the invention of the wand, as far as daily life was concerned. And even after that, things took a long time to reach today's standard. Magic a hundred years ago was not as advanced as it is now. Magic two hundred years ago was even less advanced. Go back 500 years, and most of what today's wizards take for granted wasn't around.

Well, I agree with the end of that paragraph, but not the beginning. I'm one of the people constantly chiming others on the sub when they forget that canonically, magic is more advancing than it is receding --- but while a lot of everyday-commodity-spells that everyone can learn with enough elbow grease are recent (or recent-ish) creations, since I think of magic as having always been abstractly the same, any Dumbledore-level genius in Ancient Times could do a billion things that would make Muggles see them as gods.

There perhaps it's a difference in our conceptions of wandless magic --- but a true magical savant would, in my opinion, be capable of bringing down lightning and so on. Remember for example that Tom Riddle could apparently do a wandless Cruciatus as a child (or something close enough; probably not as strong as the wanded version; but if he can get that far without any training, as a child, and without a wand, then give him an adult's magic and a wand, and all bets are off).

My point is, Zeus could probably levitate things around, even if it took hundreds of years yet before /Wingardium Leviosa/ was refined into something you could more or less get into 11-year-old Neville Longbottom's head. And they may not have had cutting-edge Nimbus 2000s or Time-Turners, but the Peverell Brothers still managed to find ways to open a doorway to the freaking Afterlife.

So in short, my answer is twofold:

- The status of academic magic, and the might attainable by a few magical geniuses, are in my opinion almost entirely unrelated to one another.

- An ancient wandless wizard could still be trained to use his magic in ways that curbstomp a Muggle with a pointy stick any day, even if they wouldn't stand up to a modern duelist.

  Also, democratic governments in 1692? Fuck that. Wizards aren't some egalitarian superhumans forming democratic societies. They are a bunch of slave-owning scumbags.

Er... Ancient Athens? Ancient Rome? Heck, pre-Civil War United States? You can have democratic government /and/ be slave-owning scumbags at the same time.
