I'm not saying they /were/ extremely un-Muggle-like superbeings. I'm saying that's how they were /perceived/ by Muggles in those times (an image which, of course, they actively cultivated). It's always been my headcanon that the pre-Statute wizards are the source of the tales of what we know in our folklore as the Fair Folk. But again, that doesn't mean they're /actually/ this way.
