We have a very different origin for wizards then. I see it as the magic talent appearing in muggles as a mutation, slowly spreading along family lines, and I feel that it took a hell of a lot of time for any wizards to be able to actually do something magical, much less anything impressive. By the time magic had advanced to be useful, wizards were still a part of human society and even then it took even longer until they were able to live in a distinctly different style.

Nor do I think they were much more advanced than muggles until the invention of the wand, as far as daily life was concerned. And even after that, things took a long time to reach today's standard. Magic a hundred years ago was not as advanced as it is now. Magic two hundred years ago was even less advanced. Go back 500 years, and most of what today's wizards take for granted wasn't around.

Also, democratic governments in 1692? Fuck that. Wizards aren't some egalitarian superhumans forming democratic societies. They are a bunch of slave-owning scumbags.
