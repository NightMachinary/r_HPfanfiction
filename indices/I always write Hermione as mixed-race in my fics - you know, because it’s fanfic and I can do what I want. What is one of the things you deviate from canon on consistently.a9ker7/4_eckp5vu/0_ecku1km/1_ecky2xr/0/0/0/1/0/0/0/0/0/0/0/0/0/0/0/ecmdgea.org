  Also, I don't see them as using the force. Not at all.

I mean, not literally the Force. Strip it of the "telepath" aspect and of the magical force being sentient and you get a better shot.

But yeah, that's always been how I thought of wandless magic and I do know not everyone agrees. It's one of those things where headcanons just differ and we should all just accept it and get along.

  With regards to democracies, I do not think that in 1692, there would have been many willing to create a democracy.

Well, our headcanons for the background of the 1692 wizards differ so heavily that this, which indeed makes little sense for your well-integrated-in-Muggle-society wizards, makes perfect sense for my have-always-kind-of-done-their-own-thing wizards.

By 1692, /my/ wizards don't really have much of a ruling authority; most wizards, or wizarding families, live in their own domain and by their own rules, and even the friendlier ones would laugh at the idea that they're under the /authority/ of the Muggle kings. But as they enter an age where /some/ kind of wizarding coordination better than an inefficient Council is necessary to prevent catastrophes has become absolutely necessary, they grudgingly agree they need /some/ kind of government.

From this point of view (which, yes, is entirely different from /your/ headcanon), how would it make sense that they'd pick any form of government /but/ a democracy?
