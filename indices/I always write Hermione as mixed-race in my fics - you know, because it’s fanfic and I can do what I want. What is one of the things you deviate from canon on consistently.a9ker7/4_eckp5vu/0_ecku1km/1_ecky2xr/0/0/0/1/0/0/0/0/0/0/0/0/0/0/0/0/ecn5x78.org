Indeed. I see wandless magic as far, far weaker and not very useful at all. Certainly not on the level of force abilities. Wands are so important, for all their weaknesses, for good reason, in my opinion. Wandless magic is, in comparison, on the level of someone using martial arts in a fight where everyone else has guns and some have tanks. Sure, you might be able to take care of unarmed peasants (aka muggles in this comparison) easily - but the weight of numbers will tell anyway, so wandless wizards can't dominate multiple muggles easily.

Well, since wizards differ greatly in talent and ability, I see them looking for exceptional, powerful wizards to lead them - or, rather, I see such wizards taking the lead, and the rest following. I really, really don't see them, as a group, decide that they need a government and that they want to hide. That sounds too much like "those super-humans not only can work magic but are culturally so advanced, they know and want the best form of government, and are mature enough to install it.

Even if that were how it happened, it would mean that they then regressed to the state we see in 1990 - no better, and arguably worse than the muggles when it comes to politics and ethics. And I don't like the "there was a golden age in the past, we're but shadows of our ancestors" trope. I see the state of the 1990s in Wizarding Britain not as the result of a decline, but the result of progress from a much worse state.
