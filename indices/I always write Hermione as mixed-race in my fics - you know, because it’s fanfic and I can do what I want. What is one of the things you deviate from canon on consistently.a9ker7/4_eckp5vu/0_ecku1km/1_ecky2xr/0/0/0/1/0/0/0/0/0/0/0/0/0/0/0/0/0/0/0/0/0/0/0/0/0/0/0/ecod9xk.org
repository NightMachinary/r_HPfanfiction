  You don't get to court the queen if you are not high nobility. You don't get to be high nobility unless you've been part of the nobility for a long time. So, the Malfoys couldn't have "started to mingle".

You're thinking by real-world rules. But in the pre-Statute history I posit, wizards had for a long time been seen as, well, think Tolkien Elves. I think in terms of status, just being a wizard (especially a wealthy one of refined manners) would have been equal to being a nobleman, as far as most Muggles were concerned.

  Also, I think the idea that no wizard, ever, started their own dynasty ruling over muggles - and used their powers to defeat muggle competitors - as not very believable.

There probably were a few, of course. But that doesn't mean that wizards as a whole were integrated with Muggle, just because a few villainous ones occasionally decided to live in the Muggle world for personal profit.

But more importantly, most of the power-hungry wizards who ruled over Muggles, in my view, did so as God-Emperors or literal Gods. Again, if you want a dynasty of wizards who used their powers to rule the Muggles, see Zeus and the Olympians.
