  Ancient Athens and especially Ancient Rome had nobility and clear class differences. They were certainly not egalitarian. And I don't see why wizards in 1692 would imitate either.

They were nonetheless democracies. I'm not asking for the 17th century newly-formed Ministries of Magic and equivalents to be any /more/ democratic than that (the 20th century ones arguably aren't, what with the exclusion of nonhumans). But democratic it is.

Another point where our headcanons differ; I don't think "rituals" were ever much of a thing. The average wizard before wands and schools would have, in my opinion, more likely been trying to use his wandless magic Force-style than carrying out any "rituals".

Really, this is the shortest way to explain it --- I think wandless prehistoric/ancient wizards had loosely the same type of abilities as Force-users. Taking lightsabers out of the picture, a modern wizard (even a mediocre one) would make mince pie of a Jedi; but that doesn't change the fact that pitting them against the /SW/ version of /Muggles/, even one barely-trained Force-user is an extremely important factor to keep track of on a Galactic scale. /In a sci-fi universe./

  I don't like the idea of wizards being apart from muggles before the SoS, and I don't like the idea of magic being a gift from gods, fully formed. I like progression - magic being advanced little by little, with wands and later schools being huge steps.

Fair enough, but I'm not entirely against that either. As I said I do think spells and potions and so on were invented little by little; the gift didn't come with an instruction manual of ready-made spells. I was just saying that I think wizards from 10.000 B.C. had the same inherent magic as modern ones, and could theoretically have cast any of the modern spells. Doesn't mean knowledge didn't have a slow progression.
