First, as I said, priests and shamans had important positions in some societies. I really don't see medicine men abandoning their tribe, or high-priests isolating themselves. And even in societies without such obvious positions of power for wizards, I don't think many wizards would be hiding. Wizards, no matter what pureblood fanboys like to claim, are human. And humans like to enjoy their higher status, power or wealth. Would they mingle with the peasants? Probably not. But with nobility? Of course they would. "Peace and quiet" is not as desirable for most people as power, influence and status. And until they have a country of their own, that means mingling with and being part of the ruling class.
