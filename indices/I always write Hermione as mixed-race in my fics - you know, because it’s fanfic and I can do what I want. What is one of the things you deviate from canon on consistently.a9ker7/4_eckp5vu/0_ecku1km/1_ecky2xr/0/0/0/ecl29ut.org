  The French Ministry cannot refuse British muggleborns entry - they are British citizens and can legally travel to muggle France.

  The purebloods don't give a damn about what muggles think in my stories.

Oi, make up your mind. Either the Wizarding government of the relevant countries gives a damn about the Muggle one, or they don't. But if Magical France is a completely different regime that doesn't keep up with the Muggle side or give a frick about its laws, why on Earth would they care if the British wizards would be allowed by Muggle law, so long as they're not by Magical French law?

  For the caste society there, things are clear: Since untouchables are just that, they most certainly cannot be wizards. So, any muggleborn untouchable must have been kidnapped as a baby, and therefore will be "rescued", or they get killed as some evil abomination. It's not about slavery, it's about the caste system.

Ah, okay, I thought you meant that the Wizarding population had its own internal caste system reflecting the Muggle one.

  (The rest of the world certainly wouldn't have agreed to go into hiding and lose their place at the top of their society just because of some silly witch hunts in Europe which mostly killed muggles anyway. So it had to be a reason every wizard, world-wide, would agree was worth going into hiding.)

Interesting theory. My take on this is that an overwhelming majority of wizards were /already/ in hiding, more or less --- not hiding magic's existence as such, but trying not to mingle among Muggles too much and hiding their homes behind Muggle-repelling charms and illusions. So with a few exceptions the hassle of implementing the Statute of Secrecy wasn't in convincing the wizards (as a majority had always leaned in that direction), but in Obliviating the Muggles and corrupting records.

As for the rest of the world not having a reason to care about the European Witch Hunts, that would mostly be that the European wizards were the strongest and threatened war if the other nations in the I.C.W. didn't comply. Remember that the Europeans are the ones who invented wands, an extremely decisive advantage in battle magic. And besides, witch hunts [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_accusations_against_children_in_Africa][aren't just a European thing]].

Have you read /Hermione Granger, Demonologist/? It had a very effective sequence explaining how the witch hunts were probably not as harmless as Binns makes it sound.

  Also, there are no Obscurials in my stories.

Ah, okay. Why?
