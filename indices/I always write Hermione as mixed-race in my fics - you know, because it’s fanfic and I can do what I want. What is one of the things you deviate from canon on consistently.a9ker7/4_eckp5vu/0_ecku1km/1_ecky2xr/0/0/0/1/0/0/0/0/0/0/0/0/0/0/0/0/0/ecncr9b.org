  That sounds too much like "those super-humans not only can work magic but are culturally so advanced, they know and want the best form of government, and are mature enough to install it.

  Even if that were how it happened, it would mean that they then regressed to the state we see in 1990 - no better, and arguably worse than the muggles when it comes to politics and ethics. And I don't like the "there was a golden age in the past, we're but shadows of our ancestors" trope.

That the original 17th-century governments were a golden age is the furthest thing from my mind. I didn't see it at all as "wizards are advanced and mature and want the best form of government", but as "wizards at the time were individualists who'd rather not have a government at all, and /very grudgingly/ settled for elected leaders if they /really had/ to have one". No regression to get to the 1990 Ministry, just moral stagnation and the bureaucracy progressively getting more bloated thanks to the generous amounts of bribes that wizards started paying literally from day one so X law or Y regulation wouldn't apply to them.
