So, I gotta ask, what's with the "wizard priests" fetish ya got goin' on? Cuz other than a few cultural references (eg Christmas, expressions likw "good lord") the wizarding world shows no signs of being religious. And the useage of magic certainly isn't show to be any sort of religious worship or divine power. So are you suggestion wizards would be priests and pretend that their magic is divine power granted to them, basically conning people into giving them money and power? Or do you think wizards were actually preachers who wanted to spread the word of Jesus?
