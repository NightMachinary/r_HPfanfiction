You don't get to court the queen if you are not high nobility. You don't get to be high nobility unless you've been part of the nobility for a long time. So, the Malfoys couldn't have "started to mingle".

Also, I think the idea that no wizard, ever, started their own dynasty ruling over muggles - and used their powers to defeat muggle competitors - as not very believable. Just as with the whole SoS, the "wizards generally don't mingle with muggles" idea does not work. Even if 90% of the wizards thought like that, that wouldn't prevent the rest of taking over positions of power in muggle countries.

Your headcanon still relies on the faulty assumption that wizards would rather be the lowest of the pecking order in the wizard village than ruling the muggle town next over. And that assumption doesn't work, as our history shows. Certainly not for everyone.
