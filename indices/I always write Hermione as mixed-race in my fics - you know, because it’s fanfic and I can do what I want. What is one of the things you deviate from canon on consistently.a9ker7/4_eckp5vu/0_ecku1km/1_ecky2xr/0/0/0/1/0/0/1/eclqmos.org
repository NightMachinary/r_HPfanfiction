Also, thinking about it some more, it occurs to me that your idea of "Prophecies of the end of the world" doesn't fully work with the canonical magic system. Canonical Prophecies come true when people act on them, and are harmless otherwise. Spreading doomsday Prophecies worldwide and acting on their information is thus borderline suicidal.
