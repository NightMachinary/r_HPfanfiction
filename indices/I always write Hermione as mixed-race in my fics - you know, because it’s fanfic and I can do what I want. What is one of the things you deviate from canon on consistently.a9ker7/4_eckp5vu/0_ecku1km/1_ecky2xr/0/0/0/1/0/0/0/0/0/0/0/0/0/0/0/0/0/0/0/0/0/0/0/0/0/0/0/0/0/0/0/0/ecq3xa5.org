But you still have issues with your history. If the wizards in your headcanon were basically separate tribes from the start, and always kept their distance, they would never have adapted so much to muggle culture as in canon but would have developed a much, much more different culture. Alien to muggleborns. And that would have grown worse after the SoS.

So, something doesn't work with your "Wizards were never really part of the muggle world" headcanon.
