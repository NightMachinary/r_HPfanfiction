Ancient Athens and especially Ancient Rome had nobility and clear class differences. They were certainly not egalitarian. And I don't see why wizards in 1692 would imitate either.

With regards to the ancient wizards, Zeus might have been able to call down lightning - but he wouldn't have had all the utility spells we take for granted. And he would have been the Dumbledore of his time, not the average wizard. The average wizard would have been doing rituals just to get clean water, for example. So, no, Zeus couldn't do a billion things - he could do a few impressive things, tops. Because he was seen as a god, not an ordinary wizard, so he was exceptional. And ordinary wizards had a much harder time curbstomping anyone wince, without wands, they simply weren't that good fighting others - too slow, too vulnerable, apart from a few exceptional exceptions who had the knack for fighting.

But the average wizard? Was a priest or healer, who lived in muggle communities, and picked a talented successor, usually their kid.

I don't like the idea of wizards being apart from muggles before the SoS, and I don't like the idea of magic being a gift from gods, fully formed. I like progression - magic being advanced little by little, with wands and later schools being huge steps.
