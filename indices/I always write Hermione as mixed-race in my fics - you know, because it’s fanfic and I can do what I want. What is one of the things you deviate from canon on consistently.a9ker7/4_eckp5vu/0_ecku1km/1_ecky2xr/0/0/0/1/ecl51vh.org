I was answering your claim that the French in canon would refuse muggleborns entry. That won't work. They would need far too many people watching the borders to enforce that and would be meddling far too much with muggle countries - for no gain at all.

I do think the Wizards in India have a caste society. Just one without untouchables/casteless. Still nothing about slaves.

I don't think that wizards were hiding. Certainly not in tribal societies where they would be the medicine men and shamans. Certainly not in societies where they would be the priests. Certainly not in socieites where, like in canon, a wizard could court Queen Elizabeth I. By the time the separation happened, the other countries had wands - they were invited 1500 years or more ago.

There are no Obscurials since I consider the idea shit.
