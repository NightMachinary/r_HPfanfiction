Sorry, that goes a little too far for my taste. Not a little. I can swallow Zeus and his family as some exceptional wizard, but wizards being seen as Tolkien Elves? No, no and hell no. Wizards are humans, not elves. I loathe the "wizards are so different from muggles" mentality that crops up in some stories. They are humans who can work magic but are still stuck with the exact same human foibles, not some super species of noble people. The more you separate them, the more you make them less human, less integrated with human history, the more you violate what I consider HP's core message: Wizard or muggle, we're all humans.

Also, we have lots of legends and histories of super-powered heroes on mythology. We have lots of tales of priests able to heal people, or witches cursing others. I really don't see any reason why you'd have to make wizards into elves just to justify the SoS.
