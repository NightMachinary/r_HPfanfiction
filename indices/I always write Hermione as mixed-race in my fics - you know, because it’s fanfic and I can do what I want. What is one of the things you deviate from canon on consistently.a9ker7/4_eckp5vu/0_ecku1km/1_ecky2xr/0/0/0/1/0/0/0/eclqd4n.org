My feeling was that even though it interacted freely with the Muggle one, the wizards already had /their own/ society before the Statute. So 14th-century Malfoys mingled with 14th-century Blacks in Diagon Alley and got their social-interaction fix that way. Having power and status over Muggles would not, I think, have been worth much to them, since it's so /easy/ for a wizard of debatable morals to rule over thousands of Muggles if they so wish --- just use enough memory charms, Imperius Curses, whatever, and any wizard could become a king. Wizards do want power and status, but even before the Statute they would most likely have wanted it over their fellow wizards.

No doubt some wizards also enjoyed Muggles' companies, but I imagine that for a majority of even /those/ wizards, they were glad to pay house-visits to Muggles but nonetheless preferred to live in comfortably-warded, location-unknown-to-the-authorities-so-I-don't-have-to-pay-taxes houses off in the middle of nowhere, and to do their day-to-day shopping in Diagon Alley.

Also you keep talking about wizard shamans and high-priests, but... do we have canonical confirmation that this used to be a thing? I mean, it's a fine enough theory as part of your own AU worldbuilding. But I don't think it's a canon fact that you can rely on.
