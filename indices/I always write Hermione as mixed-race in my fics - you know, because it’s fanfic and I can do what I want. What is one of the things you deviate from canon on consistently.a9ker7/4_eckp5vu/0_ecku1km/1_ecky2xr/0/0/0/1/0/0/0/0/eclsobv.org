Canonically, one Malfoy courted Queen Elizabeth I. He couldn't have done that if they were not part of /high/ society.

Also, before the SoS, there was one society. I see no reason why wizards would segregate. Yes, they might prefer to have power over other wizards - but most wizards wouldn't have any power over other wizards. And, frankly, most wizards would prefer to have power over muggles than no power at all.

(Do their day to day shopping in Diagon Alley? Can't even afford to have a servant who will do it for them? I think we have very different views of how wizards would live in a medieval society.)

And yes, I do assume that shamans, priests, medicine men, and so on were wizards before the SoS. Anything else breaks my Suspension of disbelief.
