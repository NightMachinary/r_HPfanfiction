The French Ministry cannot refuse British muggleborns entry - they are British citizens and can legally travel to muggle France. Also, if they work with the British regime, they are evil or dumb - or both. Doubly so since the Delacours know better.

Also, I said, that's my personal take on it. The purebloods don't give a damn about what muggles think in my stories. And if the muggleborns want to make changes, they get stomped flat. That only started to change with the muggle population explosions, when muggleborn numbers started to reach levels where they started to matter.

You misunderstood my take on India. For the caste society there, things are clear: Since untouchables are just that, they most certainly cannot be wizards. So, any muggleborn untouchable must have been kidnapped as a baby, and therefore will be "rescued", or they get killed as some evil abomination. It's not about slavery, it's about the caste system.

In my stories, the wizards hid from muggles because if they hadn't, some catastrophe would have wiped them (and the world) out according to every seer in every country or tribe, presumably because magical WMDs would have been wielded in wars caused by medieval princes - or the belief in magic would grow so strong as muggle numbers exploded, the Old Ones would wake up and destroy the world. Whatever works. (The rest of the world certainly wouldn't have agreed to go into hiding and lose their place at the top of their society just because of some silly witch hunts in Europe which mostly killed muggles anyway. So it had to be a reason every wizard, world-wide, would agree was worth going into hiding.)

Also, there are no Obscurials in my stories.
