The huge problem with making France more tolerant of muggleborns - as opposed to being more tolerant of Veela (giants do not seem to be tolerated much, seeing as the Headmistress denied her ancestry) - is that it makes every British muggleborn who didn't move to France as soon as things got difficult instead of moving around through the country and dodging Snatchers an idiot. And, of course, it makes the French idiots or evil for not doing something about Voldemort starting his genocide.

I also don't see the Frech as having a revolution, since the conditions that caused it didn't happen to Wizarding France. And in my stories, the wizards really don't give a damn about the muggle culture, lacking three hundred years of common history now.

With regards to Magical India, it wasn't conquered in my stories. It's also not united either, though. And its economy is likely dominated by the Princes and has a rigid caste society - far worse than muggle India. Untouchables who show magic? If you're lucky, the evil people who obviously stole you as a baby from a real wizard family are punished for their crimes and you're getting raised in a proper magical family after you have recovered from that trauma. If you're unlucky, you get killed as the abomination you are.
