I like most of this, except that I think the French situation would be one of those cases where the "let's have a Revolution" craze would likely have spread to the Wizarding population. Hence I'm perfectly willing to have Magical France's borders not match the real ones, but I do think they had their own Revolution in the 18th or 19th century and abolished aristocracy like their Muggle counterparts. They may not have ever had a Napoleon, though --- it could be that the Magical Republic of France is still the same entity as the one founded in the 18th century, with no interruption.

I also tend to see Magical France as /more/ progressive than Wizarding Britain, on the basis of Beauxb√¢tons' Headmistress being half-Giant and their champion part-Veela. Which would fit the fact that what racism or class-warfare in Muggle France, ever since the Revolution, are greatly reduced compared to what existed (indeed, still has remnants) in the Anglosphere --- again, whether the Wizarding /government/ cares about the Muggle /government/, the cultures aren't impermeable to one another, and a racist/specist monarchic France seems to have little to do with Muggle France IRL.

Concerning Grindelwald and Nazis, my theory is somewhat different, in that I believe he /did/ prop up the Nazis, as part of a masterful tactical scheme --- simultaneously weaken the Muggle armies all over Europe, making it easier for him to swoop in and conquer them afterwards; /and/ collect /plenty/ of evidence to prove that Muggles left to their own device are horrifying barbarians.

One thing I do have along those lines, that you may not have considered, is that Magical India absolutely did not get conquered by Wizarding Britain, and they are still wholly independent and in much better economic shape than Muggle India.
