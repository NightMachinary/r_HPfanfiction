  Beauxb√¢tons' Headmistress being half-Giant and their champion part-Veela
#+end_quote

I think giant-human offspring are incredibly rare because of how improbable a union is - fully grown giants average about 20 feet in height, after all. And the reason behind Olympe Maxime's post as Headmistress of Beauxbatons could also be due to the fact that people just believed that she had big bones, or had a mishap with Swelling Solutions or what not, not with France being any more tolerant.

Until Rita writes the article about Hagrid, people don't suspect him of being a half-giant, even though he's about ten feet tall. And he's been at Hogwarts for the better part of fifty years. It's very clear in hindsight to all characters after the article comes out, but before that, nobody suspects a thing.
