In the battle that mattered, there were only 2 giants who fought on Voldemort's side (and were somehow bested by a midget giant). Expenses are not the limiting factor when the numbers are as low as that, and it's not as though Voldemort doesn't have access to an entire wizarding nation's economy either.
