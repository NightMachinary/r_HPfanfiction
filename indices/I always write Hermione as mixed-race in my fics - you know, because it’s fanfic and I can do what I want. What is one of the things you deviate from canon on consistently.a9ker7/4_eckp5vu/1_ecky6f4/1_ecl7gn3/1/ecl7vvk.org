It wouldnt suprise me, Bulgaria has had 2 points in history where its been a force to be reckoned with, and it had a much larger size. The original Bulgar Khanate that fell in the 9th century and the Vlacho-Bulgarian Empire (or just 2nd Bulgarian Empire by some) around the 13th century. Going from what you say, I would see the wizards that originally migrated there with the Bulgar muggles retaining the borders and influence of the original Khanate and maybe even expanding it, while its muggle government was conquered.
