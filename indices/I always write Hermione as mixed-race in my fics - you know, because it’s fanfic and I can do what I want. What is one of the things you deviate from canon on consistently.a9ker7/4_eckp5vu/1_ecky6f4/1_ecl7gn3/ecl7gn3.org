Speaking of Grindelwald and other magical nations, I've heard people say that Durmstrang teaches in either German or Russian, but I like to think it's Bulgarian. And that magical Bulgaria is actually a major superpower. And when Lucius considered sending Draco to Durmstrang? The first step would have been to put him through a two-year intensive course in Bulgarian.
