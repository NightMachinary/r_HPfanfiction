Ive seen stuff like this in various fanfics. Gotta say, its 1000x more realistic than thinking magical governments and nations are a perfect mirror of the muggle counterpart.

Edit: I always imagined Grindelwald very similar to what you describe, and Im still on the fence if i like how he is portrayed in FB or not.
