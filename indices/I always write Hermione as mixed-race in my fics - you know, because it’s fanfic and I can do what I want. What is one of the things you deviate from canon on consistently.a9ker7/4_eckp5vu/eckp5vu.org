I generally use a very different political situation in my stores: In 1692, the magical world split from the muggle world, and didn't give a damn about political changes to muggle countries afterwards. Prussia still exists. Poland is a big country. France is ruled by a Duc. There is no Magical USA - Magical North America is split up in many, many enclaves and tribal nations, often warring with each other. Magical Russia is ruled by a Tsar. Grindelwald didn't give a damn about Nazis and tried (and almost succeeded) to conquer Magical Europe with an "all wizards are equal and superior to muggles" ideology. That resulted in many muggleborns flocking to his banner, and a backlash against them in Magical Europe after his defeat, which means that Britain is the best place for muggleborns under Dumbledore - they are facing heavy discrimination in the rest of Europe.

I like to use Arithmancy as the way to analyse spells including wards (which is shorthand for "permanent protections").
