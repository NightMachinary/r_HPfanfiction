I like to imagine that Hagrid plays a bigger role in Harry's life, and is the most influential of Harry's father figures. More so than Remus, Sirius, Mr. Weaselly, or Dumbledore. I think Harry was in his own way very sheltered as a child (to keep him from getting ideas) and Hagrid frequently introduces him to a variety of notable weirdos. Hagrid's influence also means that Harry will usually hooks up with a non-human in the end.

On another note, I also have an extensive collection of headcanons regarding magical theory that underpins the setting.
