I don't write much, but I do occasionally contribute to things. Anyways here are a few:

- There are a number of different styles of magic, the two most common in Europe being Wizardry and Witchcraft.

1. Wizardry is magic born of will and whimsy. Casting a spell is like calligraphy with each being akin to a simple piece of art handcrafted and unique. Most of what are considered charms, hexes, and transfiguration are acts of wizardry.

2. Witchcraft is the art of utilising the the magic inherent in nature/objects/the stars. This is most commonly seen in potions, but includes some forms of divination. Witchcraft is considered outdated in the modern era.

- Nature spirits are poorly understood, but are at the core of the animagus transformation and the patronis spell. Werewolves are the result of a curse drives the wolf totem to madness. Lockhearts werewolf book is based on an encounter with a wolf animagus driven mad by its corrupted spirit.

- The Master of Death is a myth. The Deathy Hollows are not a set, but simply three related and powerful magical artifacts.

1. The Wand is cursed. Those who wield is are destined to die of violent conflict.

2. The Stone is cursed. Those who use it are driven to take their own lives to be with their loved ones.

3. The Cloak is blessed. Its owner cannot die until it is given to another that is almost if not always a decedent.

Harry chose to die (2), by being murdered by Voldemort (1), yet fate conspired to give him the means to return to life. (3)
