That's super interesting. I don't think POC is used that way in Australia at all, people who want to be respectful either say POC or, if they know it, their ethnicity specifically. Racists use slurs mostly.

I think that's a positive - for many people, the removal of race does signify the death of culture also though. How does France deal with that aspect of divorcing race from a persons identity? Is it something that is addressed?

Interesting note: my partner lived in France for a year and speaks French so I just had a discussion about it with them. They said the term ‘personne de couleur' in French and ‘person of colour' in English aren't equivalent terms (in terms of the implication? I don't exactly know how to describe it). Same with talking about race - /Noirs en France/, which is totally acceptable in French, is literally ‘blacks in France' in English, which is blunt at best and rude and reductive at worst (in English).

Language differences are so interesting!!

Also re Hermione's background: no, I don't think it's a deviation of canon at all, but some people seem to think it is. I haven't really /changed/ her background at all, I've just elaborated on it in a way that wasn't touched on in canon.
