  How does France deal with that aspect of divorcing race from a persons identity? Is it something that is addressed?

It's a bit of a political issue there, as of late. Historically, France has been spectacularly non-racist, but not much for diversity; the common wisdom is that you shouldn't care who someone's parents were and what color their skin is, but if you want to live in France, you must adopt French culture and customs. Melting-pot, not salad-bowl.

This may sound odd to you, but remember that France didn't start out as a mishmash of various peoples like the U.S.A. did, or even England to a lesser extent. The French are one people with one history, and while we do have minorities they are really --- well --- /minor/.

The problem is that with globalization, America's "multiculturalism is great" mentality is slowly being imported across the Atlantic and causing all sorts of political trouble.
