It's really interesting to learn about the cultural differences between western countries! (I think France counts as western, correct me if I'm wrong). I know, for example, police brutality are different kettles of fish in Australia vs. America - but Australia still had a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The racial tensions are just so different.

I also just read your list of head canons. Really enjoy it - particularly the Gamps Exceptions theory and the Veil. I read a really good fic that explored Transfiguration and the intricacies involved in needing to maintain a transfiguration (which I'm actually just realising might have been a section of HPMOR which was otherwise an extremely frustrating read) and your theory sort of slots in with that idea.
