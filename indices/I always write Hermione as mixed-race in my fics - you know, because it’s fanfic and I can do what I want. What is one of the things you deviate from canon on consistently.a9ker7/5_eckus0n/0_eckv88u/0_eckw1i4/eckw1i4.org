  Her skin colour hasn't changed tho, it's not a huge deviation from canon as far as physical appearance goes.

If it doesn't change her appearance, then since Hermioen's genealogical background is not gone into in canon, it's not even a deviation, is it?

  I'd never heard of it being considered a racist term. Do you have any sources on that?
#+end_quote

I don't have a particular written source. It's just that as a Frenchman myself, growing up, the term "/personne de couleur/" was only ever mentioned to us in school as the euphemism used during the Apartheid to just barely cover up how racist they were.

As for "mixed-race", the fact is that France rejects the notion/term of "race" altogether. If you start talking about someone's "race" in France, /at best/ everyone is going to look at you funny, at worst they'll call the police. There was recently a big symbolic movement where the one time the word occurred in the French Constitution was struck from it.
