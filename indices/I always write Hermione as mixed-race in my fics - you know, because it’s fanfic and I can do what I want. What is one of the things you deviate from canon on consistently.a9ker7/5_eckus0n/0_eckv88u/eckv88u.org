Her skin colour hasn't changed tho, it's not a huge deviation from canon as far as physical appearance goes. It just explores her ethnic background as a part of a bigger discussion - including French and Anglo branches of her family tree.

Regarding PoC - I'd never heard of it being considered a racist term. Do you have any sources on that? Would be good to read. Within all the circles I am a part of (as a PoC) it's considered a good catch all term when one more specific doesn't exist. As does mixed-race, along with biracial, multiracial, and regional terms (e.g. /mesti√ßo/ in Portuguese).
