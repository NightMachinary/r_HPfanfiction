Oh I'm definitely not changing it! I've given my Hermione Portuguese background, she's actually still described within the parameters of JK's character description so I can only conclude someone has taken offence to the idea that the background of her character can be taken at liberty.

That sounds like an amazing idea, I would absolutely read it.
