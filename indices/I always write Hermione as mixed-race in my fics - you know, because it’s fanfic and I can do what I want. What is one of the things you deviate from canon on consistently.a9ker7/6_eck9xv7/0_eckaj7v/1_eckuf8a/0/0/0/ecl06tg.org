It's the records of a magical family tree which can be done by magic (canon or fanon, I'm unsure). It's not mentioned where or how she traced it and the only thing we really know about Uagadou is that it was founded /at least/ 1000 years ago.

As far as what education they received or the type of school Uagadou was, that's not elaborated on. Presumably it was a precursor to the education available in the current time and writing wasn't a factor. I'm not writing a historical timeline of events for the Muggle world, I'm writing a fanfiction based on a vague outline of a separate world.

Iunno why you wanna talk about suspension of disbelief in a story where a witch has travelled several decades into the past because of house elf magic. If it breaks suspension of disbelief for you that badly you can just... not read it.
