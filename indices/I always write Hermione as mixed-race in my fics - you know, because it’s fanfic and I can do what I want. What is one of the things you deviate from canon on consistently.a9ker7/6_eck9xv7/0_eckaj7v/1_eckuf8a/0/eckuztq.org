  ”Mudbloods don't have heritage,” he responded without thinking, and then grimaced. “Sorry, automatic response.”

  Her eyes sparked with something he didn't recognise and she leaned forward to speak, “My father's family originated in France before emigrating to England in the 1800s. A distant great cousin of mine was the consort of Napoleon. We are distantly related to Joan of Arc, not that you'd understand the significance because she was a /mere Muggle/. There was a branch of the family tree, mostly forgotten until I started looking into it in my sixth year, a reclusive son of a reclusive father, going back to the 1600s. He married a woman and to the horror of everyone, also took her name. His name was Hector Dagworth-Granger.”

  ”My mother is Portuguese born, but her mother's mother was Nigerian. I grew up with tales from Portuguese and Nigerian folklore. I found in my family tree search that about six thousand years ago, a branch of my distant family tree attended Uagadou.”

  ”So you're not Muggleborn?' He asked, resisting the compulsion to use offensive language.

  ”I am Muggleborn,” she said fiercely. “Maybe Muggleborn doesn't mean what you think it does. Magic doesn't spontaneously manifest in Muggles, it's a dormant gene that is activated once in a blue moon.”

  ”Muggleborns are actually Squib-norm then?” He tried again.

  ”Yes,” she agreed, “technically. That's not the point. Even if every single one of my relatives was completely mundane, my heritage is real. It might not be magical, but it still exists.”
