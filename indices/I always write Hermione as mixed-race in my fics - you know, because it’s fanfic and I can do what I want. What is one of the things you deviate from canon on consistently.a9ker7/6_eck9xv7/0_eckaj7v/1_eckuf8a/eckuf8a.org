I mean, it's fanfiction, so you do you. You're certainly within rights to make any changes you want without having to justify yourself to anyone.

On a subjective level though, it just smacks to me of the idea that you need to be PoC to "have a heritage", as if being white Anglo-Saxon British isn't cool or special enough.
