  My description of Hermione doesn't really deviate physically from her description in the books.

Nor does it have to. When you've got the likes of Ryan Giggs - and you'd never tell by looking at him that his granddad is from Sierra Leone - cutting about looking like the welshman he in fact is, giving Hermione a grandparent from Jamaica or Jelalabad does no violence to canon whatsoever. Having some overseas genes in the mix makes her /more/ English, not less, we're not by nature an overbred people.

Plus the native-british-isles-back-to-the-year-dot colouration cline is a lot broader than some people seem to think.
