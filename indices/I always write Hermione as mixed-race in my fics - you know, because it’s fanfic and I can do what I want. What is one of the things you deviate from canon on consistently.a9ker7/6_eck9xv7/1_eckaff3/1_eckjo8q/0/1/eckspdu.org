The UK had something lile 97% white people in the 90s. If she had been "of colour", it would have been mentioned like in the cases of Lee Jordan, the Patil twins or Dean Thomas. Because unlike in the US, we don't really care about the skin colour per-se, we care about the country of origin. And, assuming the person isn't living solely on state welfare, someone might get more shit for being French than for being Namibian.
