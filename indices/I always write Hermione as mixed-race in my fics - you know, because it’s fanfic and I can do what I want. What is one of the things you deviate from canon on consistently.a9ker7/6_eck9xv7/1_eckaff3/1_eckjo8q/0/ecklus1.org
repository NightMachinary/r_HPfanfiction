Hermione was a middle-class ambiguously race coded girl who was probably intended to be white. Fanfic, being by its very nature created by the fans, takes anything open to interpretation and also anything completely not open to interpretation and changes that.

POC aren't just the very dark skinned, they can range from anywhere between so-white-they-burn-in-moonlight (like myself) to so-dark-they-blend-in-with-the-night. Exploring ethnicity when a character hasn't explicitly been given one in the source material isn't in itself an alt universe.

Regardless, my story doesn't change her looks in any major way, I haven't made her parents Nigerian royalty and Hermione is somehow suddenly a princess, I've just elaborated on a character background that never got explored in the canon story. She simply has Portuguese and Nigerian relatives and it's mentioned in passing. It's not an alt-universe if there's nothing for it to be alternative to.
