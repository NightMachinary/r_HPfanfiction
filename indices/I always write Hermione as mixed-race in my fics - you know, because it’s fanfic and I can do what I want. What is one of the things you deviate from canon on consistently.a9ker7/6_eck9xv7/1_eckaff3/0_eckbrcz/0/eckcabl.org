Still broadly speaking, apart from one instance when she is referred to as â€˜white with fear', she's never coded as white. I'm sure JK intended her as white because Hermione was a self-insert and authors tend to write most characters as their own colour.

POC still tan, and esp lighter POC like Spanish/Portuguese/Mediterranean it's not unreasonable to describe them as particularly brown after a summer spent in the sun.

The books leave it fairly open to interpretation.
