Self identification is the easiest and fairest way to quantify it. I'm not describing race as a colour anyway, it's not defined by skin colour, it's defined by ancestry and culture.

I'm not ignorant, I'm obviously just mixing in different circles to you. I know almost no Italians, but plenty of Spanish/Portuguese/Greek people both in Europe and in Australia and /person of colour/ is a common phrase tossed around. I'm not attached to the phrase, it's just an easy and respectful phrase that encompasses many ethnicities, at least as far as I've seen it used and used it.

I had an interesting discussion w someone French in one of these threads about how the direct French translation of the term is racist in France - but not the definition of it in English.

Quite possibly it is just a generational difference as I am quite young and therefore the people I socialise with are generally young as well.
