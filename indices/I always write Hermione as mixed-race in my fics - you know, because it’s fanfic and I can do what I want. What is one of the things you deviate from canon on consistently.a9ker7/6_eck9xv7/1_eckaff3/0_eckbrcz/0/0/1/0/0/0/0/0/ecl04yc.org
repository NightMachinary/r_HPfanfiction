Either there is a point at which you aren't mixed race any more, or we ALL are people of colour since somewhere, down the line, one of our ancestors wasn't pure shiny-white, seeing as we all come from Africa.

I'm fine with either. If we go with self-identification, then the whole "race" and skin colour issue vanishes anyway since then it's merely a cultural choice.

Also, you do seem to come over as ignorant of the European way of life. I can guarantee that almost no one in Spain, Italy or Greece identifies as PoC if they belong to the main ethnicity there. Certainly not the various right-wing populist parties there.
