I'm in Australia and a lot of our southern-Euro Portuguese/Spanish/Greek/Italian self-identify as people of colour bc it's used as a catch-all for â€˜not Caucasian'(ETA: meaning, not white. The definition I've been using of Caucasian is wrong). In Ireland and England, where I've also lived for periods of time, those people also self identified as POC.
