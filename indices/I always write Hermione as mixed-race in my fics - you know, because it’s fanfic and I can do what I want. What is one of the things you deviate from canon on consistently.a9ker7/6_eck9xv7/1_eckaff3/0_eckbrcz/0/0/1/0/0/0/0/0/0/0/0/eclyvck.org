Alright I've said it like four times now - I put some of the Southern European cultures under the banner of PoC because it's something that I've been taught /by people from that community/ that the communities use to self identify. Now that I know it's not widely used /I will refrain/. It doesn't need further discussion. I already understood and have let go of my stance on the matter. I'm not trying to pigeonhole them into a ‘non-white' box, I was trying to respect their identification as PoC. I will refer only to the people I know who use the term with that identification from now on.

Regarding self identification, i /just/ said *no one* gets to decide who's the right shade/culture/ancestry. Aboriginality in Australia, for example, is almost entirely based on self identification and participation in the aboriginal communities, because the minute we start talking about ‘how Aboriginal' someone is, we get into [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations][Stolen Generation half-caste bullshit]]. I don't think there's a definitive answer on how to regulate it and I never said it was actually easy or fair; just /the easiest and fairest/

FYI the word Aborigine is older language no longer used in Australia due to the negative connotations of the word. Aboriginal Aboriginal is the preferred term.
