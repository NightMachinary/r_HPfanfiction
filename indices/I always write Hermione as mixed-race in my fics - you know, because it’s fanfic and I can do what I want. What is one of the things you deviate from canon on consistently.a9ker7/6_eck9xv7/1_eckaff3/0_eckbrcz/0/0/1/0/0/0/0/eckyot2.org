That's prescribing to a belief that you can quantify ethnicity and that is 100% a Nazi belief if you wanna talk about Nazism holy shit. That implies that there is a certain point in time when someone's ethnicity has been bred out of them.

I'm an Australian Aboriginal from four generations back, very white now, and still self identity as a person of colour. Whether or not /you/ â€˜believe' someone would or should self identify as a POC is really not relevant.

You're speaking to me as though I'm American - which I am not - and completely ignorant of European, in particular Southern European, ways of life - which I am also not. Half my family is English. I've lived there and various other places in Southern Europe. Most of the people I have met would happily use the term POC as a catch all for a melting pot of ethnicities and most of the people I've met who would come under that banner are indifferent or happy to be referred to as such. I'm not pulling this opinion out my arse.

Not that it matters, but my character doesn't self identify as anything, at least within the story. It's part of a wider discussion on heritage that also includes French and Anglo-Saxon roots of the family - I used the term POC in the post because it was literally the language used in the disgusting comment left on my story. Fuck me.
