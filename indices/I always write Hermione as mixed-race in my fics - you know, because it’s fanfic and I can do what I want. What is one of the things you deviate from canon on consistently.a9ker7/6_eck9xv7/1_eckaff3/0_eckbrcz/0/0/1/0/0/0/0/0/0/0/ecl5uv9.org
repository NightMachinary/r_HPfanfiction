Self-identification is neither easy nor fair. Who gets to define who's got the right ancestry? Who gets to define who's the right shade of colour? Who's got the right take on the culture? Cultures change with time.

Person of Colour is just the latest way to say "non white" without using a racial slur. But Spanish, Italian and Greek people are considered white by pretty much everyone but hardcore racists. If people from those ethnicities self-identify as PoC then I'd consider them as the same as a person with pure Swedish Ancestry self-identifying as an Australian Aborigine - someone pretty much everyone from the ethnicity in question would disagree with.

This isn't a question of age or circles or whatever - people in Europe don't consider southern Europeans as "non-whites". Anyone who tells you differently is either a hardcore racist, a liar, or an idiot.

(People in Western/Northern Europe have a lot of racists views about Southern or Eastern Europeans - but "they're not white" isn't among them. The worst you get are the Nazis talking about "non-aryan races", which covers a lot of white people.)
