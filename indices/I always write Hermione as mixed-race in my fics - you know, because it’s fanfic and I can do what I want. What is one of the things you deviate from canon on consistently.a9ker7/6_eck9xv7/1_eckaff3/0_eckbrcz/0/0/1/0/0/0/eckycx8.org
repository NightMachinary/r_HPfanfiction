My general rule is to ignore whatever the USA thinks and does about "races". It's generally fucked up seven ways to heaven due to their history.

And I really can't believe any member of an ethnicity originally from Southern Europe would self-identify as a "PoC".

(Also, a great-great-grandparent from Nigeria? Sorry to tell you, but that's not "PoC" either. Not even the real Nazis would have agreed with that definition. Unless it's at least a grandparent people would laugh at you over here - or shun you. Honestly, just make it a Black or Indian grandparent or parent, if you want a PoC character. Anything else means that she wouldn't be considered a PoC in Britain anyway, and wouldn't identify as such either.)
