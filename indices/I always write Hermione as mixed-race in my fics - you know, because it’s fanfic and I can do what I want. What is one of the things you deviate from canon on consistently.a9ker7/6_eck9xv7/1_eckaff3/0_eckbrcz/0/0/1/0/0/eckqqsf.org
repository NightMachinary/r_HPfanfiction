Hmm I've been using the American-English definition of Caucasian which is apparently wrong. That's interesting.

Welp like I said, it is something that has been used by the various communities here as a self-indentifying term and as such I have also used it. I will refrain from now onwards.

Edit to add: reading back, I'd also included a great great grandparent who was Nigerian so for what it's worth my Hermione is a POC anyway oops.
