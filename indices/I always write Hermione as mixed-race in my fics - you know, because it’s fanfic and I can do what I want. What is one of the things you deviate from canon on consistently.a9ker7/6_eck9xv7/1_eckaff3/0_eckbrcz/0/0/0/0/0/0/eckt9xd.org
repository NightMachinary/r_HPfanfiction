Yes, but we don't care about race in the American sense. For example, in Germany you will get more shit for being French than for being Namibian (former colony) or Russian. Race is a secondary factor, national rivalries (and the French refusal to use other languages) play a much greater role.

We draw a line across the Mediterranean and Bosporus, but frankly, as long as you are a productive member of society, you will not get a lot of flak. And if you abuse the welfare state, you will be shit on either way.
