It's true, I find race isn't often treated the same way in America vs elsewhere. Honestly I have very little experience with America's particular brand of racism - I live mostly in Australia and parts of Europe so I really think in the context of my story it isn't treating it as a social issue at all.

Sorry if the previous answer came across as rude, it wasn't intentional. I've used the term people of colour as a descriptor and I realise out of context it's reductive, esp with regards to some cultures not liking the term in Europe. (You get shit for being French everywhere I think :P)
