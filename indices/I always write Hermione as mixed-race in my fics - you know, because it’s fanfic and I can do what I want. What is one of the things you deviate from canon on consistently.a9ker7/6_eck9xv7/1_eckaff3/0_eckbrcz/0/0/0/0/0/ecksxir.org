I mean, I'm not. The fact she has different race background is really not relevant to the story apart from the topic of heritage which comes up as a part of the Muggleborn/Halfblood/Pureblood argument that is already present in canon.

It's not a political or social issue at all in the story. No one is trying to discriminate against her because of her race or make an issue out of it. It's not a significant part of the story, it's just something /I/ like to play around with in /my/ fics.

The comment that I posted was, a) racist and unnecessary and b) asking me to tag a POC Hermione which I don't think is necessary and is such a nit picky thing to take issue with that I thought I could use it to start a discussion on headcanons that writers like to use in their fics.

It's deviated into mostly people nitpicking my language (which I've clarified in the OP anyway, I've included several backgrounds of ethnicity that qualify my HG as a POC and also learned that some European communities don't use the same language as the communities in Australia, which was interesting to learn) and telling me why Hermione isn't POC in canon which I never tried to claim anyway.

Saying Europeans don't care about race is ridiculous. That's a reductive view of a huge variety of people and ethnicities. Regardless it's not actually relevant to my post at all.
