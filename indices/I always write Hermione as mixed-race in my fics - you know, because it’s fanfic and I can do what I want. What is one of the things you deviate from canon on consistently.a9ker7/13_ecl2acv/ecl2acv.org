Hermione's race is never specified. She has canonically curly-as-fuck brown hair - more than reasonable for her to be mixed race. The disgusting slur used for POC Hermione in fanfic is revolting. It's absolutely ridiculous that white people must defend the white-unless-specified-otherwise defence (as a white person), because writing a non-white character is just way too PC and not at all representative of real life!!!
