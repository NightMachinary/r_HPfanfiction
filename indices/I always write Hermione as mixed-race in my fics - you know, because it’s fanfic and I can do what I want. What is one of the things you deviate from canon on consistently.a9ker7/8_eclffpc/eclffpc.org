Interesting, cause while my one fic is VERY AU and not following canon at ALL... I also imagine Hermione as mixed-race.

Here's a picture I drew for my "Witching World" AU, where 95% of the magical world is female, because I wanted to redesign the Hogwarts uniforms. That's Hermione at the far left, and yeah, I drew her with darker skin.

(That's Fem!Harry, Fem!Ron and Dean Thomas, who's still male in this AU, next to her.)
