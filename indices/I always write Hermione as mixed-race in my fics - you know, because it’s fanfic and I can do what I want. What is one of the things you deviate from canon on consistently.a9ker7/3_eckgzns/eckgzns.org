I always use WhiteSquirrel's concept of Arithmancy rather than canon. I just find canon arithmancy boring, not to mention that it doesn't make sense for Hermione to like it much if we use the canon definition.

I tend to use/prefer a lot of meta-writing explanations for some of the stupider things in the series, like some of Dumbledore's actions early on. In all likelihood, JKR just made mistakes and didn't think some things out. But I find it a bit boring to use that as an explanation, so it can be fun to find in-universe explanations even if they seemingly contradict canon.

I don't think we really have a canon explanation of how spells work in regards to hitting a target or affecting an object/person. Is it a projectile, or just a flash of light that has instantaneous effects? I head-canon that it depends on the spell. For instance, Avada Kedavra and Stupefy and more projectile-based, while most transfigurations and charms are not projectile-based.
