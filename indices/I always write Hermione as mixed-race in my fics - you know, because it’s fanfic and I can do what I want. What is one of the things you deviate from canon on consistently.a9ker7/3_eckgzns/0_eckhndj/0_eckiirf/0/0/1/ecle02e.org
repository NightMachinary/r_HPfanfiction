Interestingly enough, trelawney actually has a couple real prophecies and while she normally sucks at interpreting things, her predictions and feelings arent usually entirely wrong.

She predicts that someone will be lost to the class before the end of the year, and Hermione fulfills that by dropping the class.

She asks harry if his birthday is in late December and while he was born in July, Voldemort, who has a soul fragment stuck to Harry's face, was born in December.

She interprets the "Grimm" in Harry's tea as an omen of his impending death. While this isnt correct, harry does meet his godfather that year, who has an animagus form of a big, black dog.

While Trelawney kind of sucks at some parts of divination, the subject itself isnt inaccurate. Trelawney is just bad at doing it. Dumbledore really only keeps her around because hes afraid that Voldemort will try to use trelawney to get the prophecy.
