That's, I think, intentionally ambiguous. /Real-life/ charlatans get by on these vague predictions which always come true "from a certain point of view" if you wait long enough, so this could just be that (certainly, that's what the "it will happen on Friday" bit with Lavender suggests this interpretation). But at the same time, Prophecies /are/ real. So I think readers are meant to draw their own conclusions; it could really go either way based on the evidence in canon, either Divination itself is largely bogus, or Trelawney is just bad at it.
