I have an alternate theory of what Arithmancy is, however, if you're not convinced by the above (I wasn't either). My theory is that /on paper/, Arithmancy is about predicting the future with numerology, but a Headmaster long ago decided that it was superfluous as a second Divination class, but ideal to sneak some non-magical education under the Ministry's nose. Hence they're nominally learning calculus so that they can predict the future, but mostly it's just an excuse to get some math into the Wizarding kids' heads.
