IIRC, Arithmancy in canon is using numbers and mathematics to predict the future. This isn't awful or anything, it just feels a little dull compared to some fanon interpretations, like spell-crafting. It's also a little odd that Hermione would hate Divination so much (a class about predicting the future) and then like Arithmancy (a class about predicting the future via a different method). And now that I think about it, Hogwarts having 2 full classes about telling the future seems odd. It would make more sense if Arithmancy was something else, IMO.
