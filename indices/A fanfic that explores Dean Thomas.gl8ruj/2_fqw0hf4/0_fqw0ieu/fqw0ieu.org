  In the war, Dean holed up in hollows and friendly attics and Muggle pubs. He drew Umbridge the Toad, noseless Voldy confused by the last dozen plus years of wizardly pop culture, the Ministry of Magic with its fingers stuffed in its stuffy ears. He drew Snape as Headmaster, his sneer easy after seven years of notebook margin practice. Dean drew the Dark Mark over London's skyline and he left his work nailed up around Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow. He signed his name. He had things he wanted to say. There were long days when he didn't talk to anyone-- walking old fields and long roads, sleeping in haystacks. There were long weeks when he only talked to strangers-- passersby, shop owners, sympathizers, snatchers who he traded curses with. He drew the Gryffindor Common Room, hearths all ablaze. He listened to Lee Jordan's radio show on the crackling airwaves. He drew his little sisters, who had gone to France with his mother and father. He drew faces from the darkened boys' dormitory-- Harry's long bangs hiding his scar, Neville practicing his dance moves for the Yule Ball, Ron asleep with his head on his thick Weasley sweater, Seamus grinning at him over a three a.m. game of cards.

  Pieces Universe. Once a year, she watches their memories, and she relives those short few weeks of her life, when she and a boy still waiting to become himself were thrown together and beat the odds and fought a war and fell in love. Warning: character death.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
