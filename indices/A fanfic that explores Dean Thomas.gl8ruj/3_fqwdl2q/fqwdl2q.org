- linkao3(17777138)
- in linkffn(9566537) and [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War by Jeconais]] there is his cousin who is interested in one of the main characters
- there was an unfinished story, basically just a setup, where Hermione gets to some of there lectures on the immorality of house-elves slavery and Dean (or is it Angelina?) puts her down with something like “You know who was the second most hated character for my great-grandfather, who actually was a slave? Northern good-doers who decided to save them without actually caring for them or listening to them.” Cannot find it right now. Not sure whether Hermione starts dating Dean, and it was really just few chapters, but I would love somebody to explore this idea.
