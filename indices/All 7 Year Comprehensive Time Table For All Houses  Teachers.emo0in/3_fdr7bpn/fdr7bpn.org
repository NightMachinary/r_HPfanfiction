I know Harry never mentioned being in a classroom with Ravenclaws (at least not till NEWTs), but I'm still surprised by the lack of shared subjects between the two houses when every other combination exists. Also, this only follows Harry's year, right? I somehow remember that Ginny and Luna had transfiguration and herbology together for their year.
