[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] - Harry works and is 17. He dosen't know about magic until Hermione and Co. find him; later on in the story Remus appears. This might not be what you're looking for but it's a good read!
