Nearly everyone appreciates praise, but not everyone appreciates criticism.

This may seem obvious, but if you do offer criticism, try to keep it about the actual text itself, and not the writer's ability, and even if you do that, be prepared for the author to dislike or(far more likely) ignore your review.
