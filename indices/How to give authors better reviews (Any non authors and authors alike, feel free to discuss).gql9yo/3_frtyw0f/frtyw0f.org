Compliment sandwiches work when you have to criticize someone and you want to help them accept it. But you don't have to criticize a fic, so I think it's the wrong attitude to reviewing, going in with the intention to criticize. Fanfic authors are working for love, remember. I'd say, check the author's notes for something saying "concrit welcome". If you don't see that, ask in your review. "Here's what I liked. Do you want constructive criticism? Great story, thanks for sharing."
