The only one I'm aware of which resembles that is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13054713/chapters/29859897][Heroes Assemble]], in which Harry becomes the seventh Avenger (Mage) and Ted (he's a teenager, Teddy sounds so /childish/) manages to join the Avengers Academy as his apprentice/trainee (Marauder) with the proviso that he has to get EE+ in his Owls for it to be official.
