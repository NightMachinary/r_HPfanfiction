Something I never understood is why usage of Expelliarmus would count as defeating a master. Expelliarmus is used plenty before DH without any mention of this whatsoever; Snape disarming Lockhart in CoS, Harry disarming Severus in PoA, among others. Why didn't the victim's wand change allegiance then?
