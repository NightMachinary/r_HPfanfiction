Harry didn't cast the Disarming Charm in the forest.

It's not that Voldemort can't use the Elder Wand, or it backfires on him. He can use it just fine, just not to its potential because he is not its true master. If Voldemort's Killing Curse had hit Harry, it would have acted as normal and killed him.

Rather, it's that when Voldemort's magic went up against Harry's magic, Harry's magic triumphed due to being the true master of the wand Voldemort was using. The Disarming Charm overpowered the Killing Curse and reversed it onto Voldemort.

But in the forest there was no magical contest. Harry just took the hit.

The real question, of course, is why Voldemort killing Harry in the forest did not transfer mastery of the wand from Harry to him. Is it because Harry didn't stay dead? It's unlikely, given the low bar the wand requires to transfer ownership. It's specifically noted that it doesn't require death, just defeat. Is it because Harry went to death willingly, and therefore there was no defeat? Again, this seems weak. The Elder Wand is the ultimately disloyal wand, to the point that a casual disarming is sufficient to transfer ownership.
