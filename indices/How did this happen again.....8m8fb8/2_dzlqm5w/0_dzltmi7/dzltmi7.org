  Is it because Harry went to death willingly, and therefore there was no defeat? Again, this seems weak.

I'm not sure about that. That was essentially Dumbledore and Snape's plan. Kill Dumbledore willingly, and the Elder Wand's power will not transfer. Harry went to death willingly, and the Elder Wand did not transfer its power to Voldemort. Harry just cheated by coming back.
