The wand probably aimed for the piece of soul lodged into Harry, rather than Harry himself, which is why he didn't die. Another possibility is that it's because it IS the elder wand Voldemort was using and, from what I believe, it's pretty much a wand that brings death to it's owners, so while it would care if it's being handled by another person, it wouldn't care that much if it's owner died because of it.
