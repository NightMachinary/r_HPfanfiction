  My bad. I didnt even thought that her attitude could be interpreted as suspicion.

Interesting. I mean, she doesn't really says anything about the diary being evil or bad, she does point out explicitly that it belongs to the Malfoys though. If it weren't for your title I wouldn't even have considered any other explanation than this Ginny being quick on the uptake. But I see where you're coming from with her giving it back because it doesn't belong to her.
