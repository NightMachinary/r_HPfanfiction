Nice. Only complaint:

#+begin_quote
  "Than you should have sold it and bought Ron a proper wand with the money, before he accidentally blows himself up" sneered Draco.

It's "then". And also I don't think Draco would refer to Ron in such a respectful manner.

Oh... and... I don't really understand your title. Shouldn't it be "Ginny Weasley is an observant girl"? Or something like that? The main distinction here seems to be that she noticed that Lucius Malfoy dropped the Diary, which of course would make her weary about it. It doesn't really come across that she rejects the diary because of her goodness.

Edit: There's really an interesting idea in here. I keep thinking about how things would play out if Harry had to save Draco in the end.
