I don't know if it'd be great in actual life-or-death scenarios, but now you've got me thinking about the type of competitive dueling that must exist for Flitwick to be a champion. I'm thinking there should definitely be a style-points component to wizard dueling leagues, and summoning birds to block a curse would be a good example of how to earn them.
