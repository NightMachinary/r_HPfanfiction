I was thinking for things like curses/stunners or maybe blasting curses. If the bird is far enough away from you when the blasting curse hits, that's less of a chance for your shield charm to break. With curses they seem to be single target stuff. If an enemies spell is strong enough it can break a shield I think. This would reduce the chance of being hit if you overestimate your shield or underestimate your opponents spell.
