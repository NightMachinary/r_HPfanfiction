Spells don't necessary execute their effect when they make contact with the first physical object in their path, though. Have edited my above post to include an example. A bird is a fairly insubstantial barrier - if spells can blast through a thick layer of wood and hit someone on the other side, a bird isn't really going to block a powerful curse.

The Killing Curse is the exception because it "executes" the moment it touches a living thing.
