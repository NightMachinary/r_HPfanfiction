While it could stop a fair few spells, a powerful spell would likely just blast through the bird and keeping going towards the target. For example, in GoF, Dumbledore's Disarming Charm smashed through a door and continued to disarm fake Moody on the other side.

Also you have to question why you would do this, rather than casting the Shield Charm. It seems like more difficult magic to achieve the same result.

Really it sounds like a specialised defence for the Killing Curse, not a general duelling tactic.
