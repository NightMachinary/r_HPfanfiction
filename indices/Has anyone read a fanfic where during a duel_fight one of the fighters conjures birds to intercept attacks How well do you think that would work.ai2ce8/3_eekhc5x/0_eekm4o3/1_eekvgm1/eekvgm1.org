To me, it doesn't seem like much of an impediment, unless the opposition only knows how to sling straightforward curses. More skilled wizards will use transfiguration to attack and defend simultaneously by redirecting/shifting whatever their opponent creates to work with.

(Or by simply ignoring a conjuration that isn't directed at them and actually helps them more than hindering, i.e. a bunch of birds blocking your opponent's view while you send a wave of fire or whatever.)

As for time taken, (in my opinion) there's no reason it should take someone skilled more than a second to vanish or shift them.
