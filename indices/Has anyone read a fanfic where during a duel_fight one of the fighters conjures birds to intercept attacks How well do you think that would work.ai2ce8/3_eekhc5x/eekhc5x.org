If the opponent has any skill with transfiguration, I imagine they would shift the birds into something else like knives and attack with them. The birds could be vanished, blown away with wind, taken out in an explosive/wide-ranging spell, etc. Unless those involved are novices, it's not really a viable strategy IMO.
