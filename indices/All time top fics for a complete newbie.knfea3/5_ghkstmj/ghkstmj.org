The pureblood pretense and it's sequels aren't pre Hogwarts, but they are very AU. They are also among be the best written stories on the site. The description does not do it justice, and I could not help but recommend it.

The only other that beats it out, for me anyway, is Basilisk Born. Once again, extremely AU, and written amazingly. It is pre Hogwarts...kinda. If I could only recommend you one fic, it would be this one.

Note: both of these are a work in progress, however they are both still very much worth it, and are being consistently updated (if rather slowly).

Finally here is a small list of popular Fics that I have read, and many people seem to like:

This list is by no means comprehensive, just some ones I thought of off the top of my head, read through the descriptions and pick out the ones that interest you.
