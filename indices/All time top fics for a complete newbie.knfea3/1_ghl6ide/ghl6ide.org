It's been so long since I've been a newbie to the HP fanfic world, but a couple helpful things to start you off with is an awareness of both [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org][archiveofourown.org]]. Both have heaps of HP fanfic, however I personally 100% prefer ao3 due to the ease of navigation and tagging and the ability to exclude tags. As you read more you will find out what you do/don't like and ao3 gives you more of an ability to filter out those works. However, if you do end up looking for HP fanfic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], the search tool/site [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] helps a ton.

Something you might also find worth taking a peek at for recs is the tvtropes page for HP fanfic, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter]]. I personally don't read sirius/remus stuff or many pre/post book stuff, so I don't have many specific recs.
