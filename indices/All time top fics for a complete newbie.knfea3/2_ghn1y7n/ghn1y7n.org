[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]] is a great fic. It diverges from the Dementor attack in OotP, Harry travels to another dimension's past after he's Kissed.

There will be an epilogue and the author said it will be the longer chapter yet, so I am pretty excited (and trying to keep from rereading /again/ until then).
