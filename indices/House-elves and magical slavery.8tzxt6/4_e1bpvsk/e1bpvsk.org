I don't think it can be just cultural, there would be more dissenters if it were. I'd reckon very few human slaves were ever that fanatically willing to serve.

Alternatively it is possible that the slavery thing isn't some sort of an active spell from the wizard, but rather due to house elf physiology. They are not humans, thus they do not necessarily think anything like a human would, and their motivations might be incomprehensible to us.

Of course it is hard to believe that a mindset like that could come about naturally, but perhaps the house elves were created by wizards with those features in mind? Or perhaps wizards modified some existing species to be like that. We know that its wizards can breed new species.

I don't think it's a spell or a contract, because from what we have seen of contracts in canon (GoF and DA list), they do not make you do something but rather punish you if you break the terms. And while Dobby did punish himself, Winky didn't and also Marietta was punished directly, she wasn't forced to do it herself.

So basically what seems to me most likely that whatever forces the house elves to serve a master and worship working is something thats built into their very being and that it's an hereditary trait and a quirk of the species, that was probably engineered into them by an outside source. Likely wizards since they benefit
