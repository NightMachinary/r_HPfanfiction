Good take. I suspect they were not created by wizards, but simply enslaved in the past. There is some questionably canon content (written by JKR I believe, which suffices for me) which says there was talk of trying to force at least some goblins into house-elf-like servitude. Seems to suggest how the arrangement with elves came about if they could do it again.
