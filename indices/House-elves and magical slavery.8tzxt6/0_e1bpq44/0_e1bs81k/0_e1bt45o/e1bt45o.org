At the end of the day, it appears to me that house-elves can be bound but this is not the norm.

Whether they were enslaved in the past or wizards simply saw how house-elves were and offered them the deal of serving them is not known. Answering the question of their origin is sort of the crux of the matter: it determines whether it is a question of slavery, brainwashing, or magical symbiosis of sorts.

It gets even more complicated if they were "created" or made anew by wizards. Setting aside the idea of patenting magical creatures or creations (which I will not even attempt since we cannot actually answer that in the muggle world), it begs the question of what is it if you own a moderately intelligent creature like that. Owls, for instance, appear to be somewhat magical and reasonably intelligent (they appear to understand and can communicate to a limited degree with humans), but they are considered pets. Ditto for something like Crookshanks (a half-kneazle).

House-elves are "beings" according to the ministry, but what if they were created to be subservient, or even that they were always like that? Is it right to compel them to think differently, especially if they do in fact have a choice? And being given clothes for freedom makes it further problematic: clothes are not a reward but a punishment for house-elves, so it calls into question whether this is something house-elves believe about themselves or whether it is a magical aspect of their very existence.
