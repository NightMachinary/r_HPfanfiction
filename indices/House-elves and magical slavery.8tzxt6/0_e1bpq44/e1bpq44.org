As heated as this thread is, I feel like I should weigh in here. You have done a good job explaining your reasoning, but I think compiling what is known and what is suspected is necessary.

The known:

1. House-elves are always shown in service to wizards/witches, and seem to prefer that (whether it is paid or unpaid), and would almost always prefer staying in the same "lineage" if possible.
2. House-elves can choose to not do as their master(s) have ordered them, though they would rather not.
3. House-elves can be compelled via magical contracts of some sort, regardless of their willingness (Kreacher).
4. House-elves possess a magic that seemingly is not bound to the same "rules" that wizard-magic is.
5. House-elves obey their masters, but only "have to" to the degree that is specified by their master (Kreacher and Dobby). But they do not always need to do so (Winky).

The suspected (my take):

1. House-elves can be bound, but how common this is remains finicky at best.
2. Wizards do not possess a way to stop or resist house-elf magic, such that anti-appartion of the strongest caliber appears to be ineffective against them (ex. Hogwarts, the Cave).
3. Contracts of sorts seem to be real, but how these work is not really clear at all. It appears that house-elves are not a party to these decisions though, or they can be ordered by their masters to take part.
4. Most wizards/witches appear to either be completely unaware of how capable house-elves are, or simply believe the possibility of defiance is so unlikely it is not worth considering.
5. Their is some benefit to house-elves of serving, whether this be psychological or more magical in origin.

My thoughts:

From everything in canon, the most logical conclusion I can draw is that house-elves /were/ bound or contracted in the past (or rather this was the norm). But overtime, either through breeding, manipulation, or mental alteration, or sheer foolishness on their part, wizards no longer felt it necessary to "bind" house-elves with magic, though the families still retained the ability to do so.

Alternatively, it may be plausible that they are in fact "bound" to families or masters, but that they can ignore it because wizard-magic does not necessarily stop them from doing things (ex. apparating where they cannot). Dobby for instance may have a contract that simply states he must obey the family, but he can choose when to ignore it if he likes. Winky can be similarly explained. Magicals appear to not worry about loopholes like that, and seem generally inconsiderate of the idea that they could defy their masters (even Hermione thinks they cannot truly change their opinions on their own or think independently unless she makes them).

The issue with house-elves appears to require an understanding of the origin of their service to wizard-kind. This, unfortunately, is not something is known in canon. Its possible they were created by wizards themselves; wizards possess the ability to create entire magical species (ex. acromantulas and basilisks) as well as to breed other magical species to form entirely new creatures (ex. skrewts). They could also be a species that was truly enslaved by wizards, whether through compulsion or coercion. Finally, its actually plausible that house-elves were a species that in fact always desired to serve other beings, possibly as a form of symbiosis. Whether they needed this to survive or not in the past is unknown, but does not seem to be the case by the canon time period.
