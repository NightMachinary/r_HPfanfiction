  Firstly, in CoS, Dobby is able to visit Harry. He knows this is a betrayal of his master, but he is able to do it anyway. Crucially, he is not magically prevented from doing so

Arguably because none of the Malfoys said specifically to Dobby 'You cannot warn Harry Potter of our plan, you cannot prevent Harry Potter from attending Hogwarts, you cannot try and save Harry Potter's life'. Dobby is punishing himself because he knows he would be punished but he's going to continue doing what he does because he doesn't have a specific order telling him to stop.

As for Winky, it's entirely possible that a previous order relating to Barty Junior was able to supersede her order to stay in the tent. Either magically or in the way that people find loopholes to get what they want (the various stories about exams where you could bring whatever notes fitted on a 2 x 5 card. One where a student created a 2 foot by 5 foot canvas because the teacher hadn't indicated inches and another where a student brought in an older or smarter student who stood on the 2 x 5 card to give answers).

  The laundry dilemma is this: handing house-elves clothes frees them. But then how do house-elves do the laundry?
#+end_quote

Have people never heard of washing baskets? Or the floor?

"The family is careful not to /pass/ Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house for ever"

Key word there is pass. That (to me, at least) implies handing a piece of clothing directly from human to elf hands. Not 'dumping your dirty clothes on the floor or in a basket from where the House Elves pick them up'.
