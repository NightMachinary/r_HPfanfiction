  Kreacher couldn't leave Harry's service and had to serve him. Dobby wanted to be free, and tried everything he could to sabotage Malfoy, but couldn't leave until he received clothes.

You haven't really engaged with my arguments. I note both these situations in the OP.

We don't know if Kreacher was forced to obey Harry magically, or if he simply considered himself bound to serve despite his personal opinion of Harry.

We don't know if Dobby *couldn't* leave without clothes, or simply *wouldn't* leave without clothes. On that front, I note that even after he is freed, he doesn't advocate that other house-elves are freed, nor does he want "too much" pay or holiday. This is consistent with someone who considered himself bound to seek freedom in the manner accepted by his people, rather than breaking his culture's most deeply held beliefs and views.

If you say that house-elves are magically bound to their masters, how do you explain Crouch Sr telling Winky to stay in the tent, and her then leaving it? We know that she did indeed choose to do so from Crouch Jr's explanation at the end of GoF. Unless you can explain that, the best you can argue is that canon is ambiguous. Certainly nowhere near enough evidence to assert things in such a spectacularly absolute fashion.
