Not really. Winky was forced out of her home. If you free the elves, but let them work for their families- those who want to - there won't be much of a problem. and as I said, giving them the right to choose their owner will solve most abuse issues and effectively free them, but allow them to delude themselves into thinking they're still slaves. And you can start working on eradicating the slave conditioning.

It's really not as complicated as the slavery apologists make it out to be.
