Which is completely brutal in it's own way, even if it works. If it works, you have parents forced to teach their children a moral system that they find so totally abhorrent and unethical it will invariably cause immense psychological harm. Imagine if someone systematically forced all parents in the world to teach their kids to...I don't know ritualistically sacrifice and eat every second child (maybe a tad extreme, but points still there) you will break them. Even if they do obey, the question comes into play of would they be able to competently raise a child in the manner prescribed. They could try, but they probably have lullabies, fairy tales, idiomatic sayings, all that stuff that comes with culture and is extremely hard to excise, enforcing their subservience. And if it doesn't work (ie, this sparks disobedience, which if anything is going to inspire it, the children are) all you'll have is significant portion of all adult HE self harming in various ways because the disobeyed their masters. Granted, this entire string of arguments hinges on HE subservience being almost entirely culturally enforced, which I find...unlikely. But I guess it's fine to argue hypotheticals.
