The world isn't black and white - but that doesn't mean that everything's grey and there's nothing you can do. Ultimately, all that drivel about "complicated" and "there's a moral difference if you're forced to stay a slave through cultural conditioning instead of magical bindings" all have one goal: Excusing a vile institution. Otherwise, the tone of the posts would be far clearer, and not soaked through with "but they want to be slaves" shit.
