Again, you can stop slavery by simply giving the elves the right (and duty, with an order) to pick a new master/employer if they are unhappy with their current one. That solves pretty much most of the abuse problem, and makes them not slaves any more, at least effectively.

I really don't know why people keep prattling about how complicated it is to abolish slavery. It isn't.
