So? Doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, or that it's wrong to do it. And no, it doesn't really take that much time - just look at how German culture changed since the WW2 ended. Or any other culture in the last 50 years. Women's lib, civil rights - cultures change. And a culture like "We need to be slaves" can change quickly since you don't need to change that much - just replace "We need to be slaves" with "working as servants is OK", and you're mostly done from a moral point of view.
