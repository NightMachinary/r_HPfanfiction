That...doesn't really support your case? Womans' lib has been consistently going on in the US since at least the mid 1800's. Same with civil rights for minorities. And neither of those are even close to finished and that's with several huge fuck off wars helping the progress along. And if you're arguing what happened to the German civilian population during WWII wasn't brutal as all hell... And none of those clutures were so systematically entrenched as to enforce self harm if you deviated. By the examples you listed, you either need several hundred years or atrocities on par with the rape of Berlin or the Dresden fire bombings to fundamentally change a culture.
