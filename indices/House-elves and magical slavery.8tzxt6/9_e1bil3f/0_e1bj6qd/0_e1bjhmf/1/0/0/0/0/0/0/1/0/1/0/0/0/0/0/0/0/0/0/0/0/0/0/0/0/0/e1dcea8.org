The point is that if we followed the kind of "it's complicated" thinking here, US slavery would still be a thing. Yeah, problems won't go completely away right away - but they won't go away at all if you don't do something.

And yes, making up shit about how freeing elves leads to genocide is excusing slavery. Canon shows that no, elves don't die when freed. And even if they did, I showed how you can de-facto free them without disturbing their delusions.

It's really not as complicated as the apologists claim.
