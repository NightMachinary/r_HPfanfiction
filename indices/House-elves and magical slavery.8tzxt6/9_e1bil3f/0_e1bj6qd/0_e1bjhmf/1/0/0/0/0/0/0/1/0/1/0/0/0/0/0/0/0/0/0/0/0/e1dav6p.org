How many muggleborns and muggle raised (Harry?) supported Hermione with her SPEW?

The books contain a good example what happens to an average House Elf who was forced to be free against her own will -- Winky. The way you're suggesting would make the whole House Elves population to be alcoholic, which can lead to death. Sort of soft genocide like europeans did to some Native Americans.
