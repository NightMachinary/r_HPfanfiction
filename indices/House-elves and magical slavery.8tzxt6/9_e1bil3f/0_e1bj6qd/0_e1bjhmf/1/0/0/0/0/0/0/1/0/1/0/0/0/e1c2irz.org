The KKK was brutal and repressive and the African Americans were (the vast majority anyway) pushing for change and equality. Whereas wizarding Britain seems to be mainly apathetic, with the house elves themselves being the ones who perpetuate the system. If you want to use the KKK as an example, it's a non-violent KKK made up of former slaves who want to go back to the plantations without any coercion. It's sad and twisted in its own way. But again, it's something that will require subtlety and a long time to change, unless you want to go for the re-education camps and separated families route.
