Well, I would assume that if slavery is made illegal, the new law would be enforced. You know, what's normal for laws. And that would be easy since there's a department in the Ministry covering house-elves, and enough muggleborns who know how evil slavery is to enforce it against the same kind of bigots who just tried to murder them all.

When Britain abolished the slave trade, they had the RN enforce it. Against anyone.

Also, calling slavery "voluntary life-long service" for lack of threats even though we know they cannot disobey? And we know that they are harmed by owners, forced to hurt themselves?

What's next, calling murder "assisted suicide" if the victims cannot defend themselves?
