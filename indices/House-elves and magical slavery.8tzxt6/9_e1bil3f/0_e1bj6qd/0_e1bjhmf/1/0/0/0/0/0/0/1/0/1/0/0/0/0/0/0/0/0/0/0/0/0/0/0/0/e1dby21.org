No one here excused slavery, it was your imagination.

Unfortunately "they want to be slaves" isn't a shit, but a constant given in the books. You ignore it and suggest an approach that can easily lead to House Elves genocide. But you care about words only, not real consequences, don't you?

Others here looked at it as a problem that required a complex and possibly long term approach.

In US slavery was cancelled more than a hundred years ago and there're still problems with racism. Even if you close your eyes, those problems aren't disappearing.
