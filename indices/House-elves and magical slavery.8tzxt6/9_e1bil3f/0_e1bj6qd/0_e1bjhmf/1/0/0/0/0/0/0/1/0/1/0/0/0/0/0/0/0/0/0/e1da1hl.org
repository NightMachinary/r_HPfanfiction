It was a formal *part* of the movement to end slavery.

Itself it did nothing. There were slave rebellions, economic regression, Civil War. There were a lot of complex movements that led to the "Emancipation Proclamation".

The rebellions shown that slaves wanted freedom. Can you say the same about House Elves?

When you declare something, your declaration is just words, nothing more. In the same way you can name House Elves occupation as "Voluntary life-long service". It would be more exact definition, because in the books no one makes House Elves obeying with a threat of harm or death.
