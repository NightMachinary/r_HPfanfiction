I don't believe anyone was arguing that slavery was OK, merely that how it's enforced effects how the system can be morally dismantled. On one side of the spectrum, if they're completely 100% magically coerced, you can just dismantle the enchantments and proceed to re-integrate them into society as best you can. On the other hand, if the slavery is completely 100% enforced from within via culture, you'll have to change the culture. That means either

A) A focused and protracted (most likely multi generational) campaign to change, if not outright eradicate, current HE culture.

Or B) If you want to "free" them quickly, the solution is arguably worse than the problem. You would quite literally need to establish HE re-education camps and all that entails. You would have to separate children so that their parents could not indoctrinate them into their servile culture. It would quite literally be cultural genocide, which no matter how appalling you find the culture, I think can be agreed is an extreme solution.

In all likelihood the constraints are somewhere between the two ends of that spectrum, but which side it leans toward would effect how you could ethically "de-program" the HE.
