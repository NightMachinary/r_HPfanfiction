It really doesn't matter anyway - if there is a cultural compulsion so strong that it forces elves to iron their hands to punish themselves, it's effectively functionally and morally the same as a magical compulsion - evil.

If you raise a person to believe that they have to be a slave, it doesn't make slavery acceptable. And that doesn't change if you raise an entire population in the belief that they have to be slaves.

It is still evil, and the only moral choice is to oppose it - violently if needed.
