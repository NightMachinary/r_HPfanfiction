There is a legitimate debate to be had, which you are dismissing out of hand, regarding the line between acting morally in how you treat house-elves and acting morally in respecting house-elves' right to self-determination. If they wish to exercise that right to enslave themselves, then there /is/ a moral dilemma at play. It's not a simple matter as you present it.

The key thing with the difference between a magical binding and a cultural one is this:

In a world where house-elves are magically bound as slaves, wizards are morally bound to unilaterally free them, because there is an external constraint on house-elves such that they cannot be free even if they want to be. The above moral dilemma is not engaged, because the magical bonds prevent house-elves from having the right of self-determination.

In a world where house-elves' own culture and decisions have them consider themselves bound to service, then the above dilemma does come into play, because wizards have to decide between respecting the house-elves' culture and right to determine their own customs vs. wizards' own moral obligations. I'm not sure that calling all house-elves evil and wiping out their culture is the answer.

Further, in practical terms, if wizards were to force freedom on house-elves in the latter scenario, the only real way to do it is by arresting the lot of them, because house-elves will likely ignore wizarding laws on the matter and continue to consider themselves bound. You're essentially establishing a thought-crime of considering yourself a slave.
