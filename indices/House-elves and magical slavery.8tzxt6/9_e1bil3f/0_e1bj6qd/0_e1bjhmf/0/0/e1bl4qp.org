A culture that teaches people to be slaves is wrong. This isn't about thought.-crimes or any other drivel slavery apologists might think of - this is about saving people from a life in slavery. Whether or not the slavery is morally or culturally enforced doesn't matter at all since its effects are the same. We see in canon that elves are forced against their will to obey orders, to obey their owners, and that is wrong.

You're basically arguing that it's OK if Dobby has to iron his hands and Kreacher serve a Master he doesn't want as long as they are deluding themselves into thinking they have no choice, but it's not OK as long as it's a magical compulsion.

And that's stupid sophistry.
