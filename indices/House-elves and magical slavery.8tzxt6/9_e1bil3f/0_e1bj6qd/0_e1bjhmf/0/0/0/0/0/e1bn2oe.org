  There is an obvious and easy solution: Give them the right to choose their master. In one sweep, they're not slaves any more since they can pick their "owner", and they do not lose anything.

But I am saying that house-elves already have the capability to abandon their master - what is abandonment of a master other than consistently ignoring their orders? There is nothing that wizards are doing which stops them from doing so. Rather, it is house-elves themselves who refuse to leave the service of one master for another, because it is contrary to their beliefs. Even those house-elves who hate their master believe this so strongly that they refuse to leave.

That is why the distinction between magical and cultural servitude has such a profound effect on wizards' moral obligations.
