  You're basically arguing that it's OK if Dobby has to iron his hands and Kreacher serve a Master he doesn't want as long as they are deluding themselves into thinking they have no choice, but it's not OK as long as it's a magical compulsion.

  And that's stupid sophistry.

Respecting an individual's right to determine their own behaviour is not sophistry, it's the fundamental cornerstone of societies which value liberty.

There is a similar argument in feminism which is a useful analogy: we note that there are not many female engineers. So we offer subsidies and various special programmes designed to get women into engineering. But the take-up of those programmes is low and they are operating below capacity. The problem is that women are /choosing/ not to go into engineering, because a lot of them don't want to be engineers. So then some people say: well, the problem is that all women are brainwashed into disliking engineering. But at some point you just have to respect the decisions that women are making about their own lives. To say that all women are brainwashed and that they can't make decisions for themselves is to rob women of agency.

Similarly, with house-elves there does come a point where you just have to respect their own agency. If you consistently offer them freedom and they consistently deny it and continue to consider themselves slaves, you can't just say "oh they're brainwashed" and completely ignore their agency. That's treating them as slaves just as much as owning them is - you are robbing them of their ability to determine their own fate. It is a complex problem to which there is no obvious answer. I am not saying "house-elf slavery is okay". I am saying "house-elf slavery is complex and there's no obvious solution which is morally superior to all other options".
