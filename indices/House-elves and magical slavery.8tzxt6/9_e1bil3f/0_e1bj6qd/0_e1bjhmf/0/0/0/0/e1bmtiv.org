"Respecting their right to determine their own behaviour" is meaningless drivel if the person chooses to abandon that right - which elves in your example do. If an elf doesn't want to decide their own fate, their fate gets decided for them - that's how it works for slaves.

There is an obvious and easy solution: Give them the right to choose their master. In one sweep, they're not slaves any more since they can pick their "owner", and they do not lose anything.

Not to mention that if they want to be slaves and obey their owner, then they have to obey their owner even if they don't like the order - like, say "I order you to pick a new owner if you don't want to be my house-elf any more".

You can twist it like you want, there is no moral reason to keep the house-elves as slaves.
