No. Slavery is not OK just because the house-elves are deluded into thinking that they have to mutilate themselves if ordered so, instead of being magically compelled to do so. Whether or not there is a magical compulsion or a cultural one doesn't change the fact that a system where a house-elf can be forced to iron their hands and will do it is evil and wrong.

I'll try to explain it one more time: Whether you magically compel someone to obey you or trick them into believing that they have to obey you doesn't matter at all as long as they are doing something they don't want to, but feel forced to.

Dobby ironing his hands is wrong no matter whether he is delusional and thinks he has to do it, or is magically compelled to do so because from his point of view, he has no choice. Whether he thinks that this culture is OK or not also doesn't matter - if a culture thinks that all blonde children need to be killed, then that doesn't make murder OK. It makes the culture sick and evil, even - and especially - if the blonde children think it's ok to get killed themselves.
