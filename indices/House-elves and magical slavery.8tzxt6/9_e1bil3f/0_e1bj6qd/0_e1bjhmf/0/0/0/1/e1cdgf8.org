  Respecting an individual's right to determine their own behaviour is not sophistry, it's the fundamental cornerstone of societies which value liberty.

Except generally we /intervene/ if an individual is seriously self harming. To the point of depriving them of liberty until they are no longer a danger to themselves.

Of course we also provide people to try and get someone to understand why they're self harming and to try and get them to stop in as gentle a fashion as possible.
