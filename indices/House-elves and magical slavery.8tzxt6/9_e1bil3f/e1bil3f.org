Kreacher couldn't leave Harry's service and had to serve him. Dobby wanted to be free, and tried everything he could to sabotage Malfoy, but couldn't leave until he received clothes.

I think the "they don't want to leave" argument is wrong. There's a magical compulsion.

And yes, you should force freedom on Elves - they can still serve, but they can leave if they are abused. They do not lose anything but their chains. The moral obligation for any decent being is to abolish slavery. Not to mention that a culture that makes people want to be slaves is sick and evil, and needs to be changed.
