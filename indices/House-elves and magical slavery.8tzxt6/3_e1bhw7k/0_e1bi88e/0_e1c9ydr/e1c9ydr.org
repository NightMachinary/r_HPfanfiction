Your Goblet of Fire Crouch incident argument is flawed, because you're taking Crouch at his word for what he claims his order was. He /claims/ in front of others that he ordered Winky to remain in the tent. We don't see the dialog of his actual order, but it becomes clear at the end of the book that he was lying. His /actual/ order to Winky would likely have been something like "Keep Barty Jr safe." In order to fulfill that order Winky could have decided that Jr would be safer hiding in the woods. He goes to check the bushes where she was found because he knows that Winky /can not/ have disobeyed an order, so Jr must be somewhere nearby too.
