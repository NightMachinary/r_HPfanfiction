I'm not convinced that this is explained only by a magical enforcement. It seems to me that it is equally explained by Kreacher knowing that Harry is his master by the rules of inheritance, and deeply regretting this situation, but nonetheless continuing to respect the institution of house-elf slavery so that he considers himself bound to obey Harry. This is, after all, an elf whose main ambition in life is to be beheaded by his master.

It's really not very different from the situation with Sirius, where Kreacher considered himself bound to obey a master he hated, but was willing to exploit any ambiguities to disobey. The same with Dobby and Lucius Malfoy.

If it /is/ magical binding, then the result is simply that canon contradicts itself on this point, with house-elves both able and unable to directly disobey explicit orders. There's really no possible way to interpret the GoF situation with Crouch as anything other than a house-elf disobeying a direct order.
