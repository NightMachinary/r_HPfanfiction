I think the problem in this is that Kreacher didn't seem to acknowledge Harry as his master but was forced to follow his orders, even though he insisted that Bellatrix is his mistress. Dumbledore says that if Kreacher passed into Harrys ownership, he would have to obey him. But nobody really was sure if Bellatrix or Harry owned Kreacher.

  “Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore.

  “Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't!” croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. *“Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, won't ---”*

  “As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of “wont, won't, won't,” “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.”

  “I don't care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don't want him.”

  “Won't, won't, won't, won't ---”

  “You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?”

  “Won't, won't, won't, won't ---”

  Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.

  “Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.”

  “Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!”

  Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except,

  “Kreacher, shut up!”

  It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum. “Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “It means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.”

This would only make sense if Kreacher was magically informed who his owner is and was just in denial.
