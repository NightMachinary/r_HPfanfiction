  I should have checked canon right away, and not trusted Taure to have done so. Pottermore clearly states that elves are magically bound to serve, not just culturally conditioned.

That is not a "Written by JKR" page. I'm not sure if you're familiar with how Pottermore works, but most of it is made up of Buzzfeed style articles written by a staff of copywriters who use material from the books and movies along with their own interpretations. These third party writings are no more authoritative than me or you. The articles written by JKR are clearly marked as such.
