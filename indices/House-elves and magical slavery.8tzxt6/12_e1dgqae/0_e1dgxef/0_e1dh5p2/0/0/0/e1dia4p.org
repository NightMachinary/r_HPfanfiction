  This is my magical corner of the internet, a place where you can explore my writing, both familiar and new, *and* where you can read features, articles and news from the Pottermore Team.

JKR clearly separates out her own writing into a separate category to Pottermore Team "features, articles and news". The second paragraph simply says that new information will be revealed. It doesn't mean that every article can be considered new information. Most of the Pottermore material is simply "fact files" summarising information in the books.

In any case, the nature of the Pottermore Team material as openly speculative and relying on the books as evidence is quite telling.
