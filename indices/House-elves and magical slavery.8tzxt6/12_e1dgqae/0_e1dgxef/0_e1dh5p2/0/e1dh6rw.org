Yes, new information is revealed - in the articles written by JKR, such as those on the Potter family, Azkaban, etc. The idea that the commentary articles like [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/things-we-realised-about-harry-potter-when-we-became-older-and-wiser][this]] and [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/harry-potter-character-backstories-we-wish-we-could-have-seen][this]] are canon is kinda absurd. These articles by Pottermore staff are clearly held out as commentary, not word of god - as shown by the way they are using quotes from the books to support arguments.

This is further emphasised by the fact that the "Written by JKR" articles are kept in a separate section.
