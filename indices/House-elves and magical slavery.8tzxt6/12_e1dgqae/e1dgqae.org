I should have checked canon right away, and not trusted Taure to have done so. [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/to-spew-or-not-to-spew-hermione-granger-and-the-pitfalls-of-activism][Pottermore]] clearly states that elves are magically bound to serve, not just culturally conditioned.

  No matter how you slice it, house-elves are unpaid labourers, magically bound to serve, left at the mercy of their respective owners.

  Contented as they seem, elves are forced into servitude by a combination of magic and a culture of indoctrination.

With regards to the effects of freedom, the article cites Winky as an example of bad effects. However, it clearly seems to assume that being separated from their owners and unable to work for them is the issue, not freedom itself.

  Even with Dumbledore's support and Dobby's pep-talks, Winky is clearly depressed. She's even started hitting the bottle -- yes, it's only Butterbeer, but who knows the damage that'll do to an elf over time? Hermione cites the shame imposed on Winky by her culture as the sole reason for her unhappiness, but there may be more to it. Separation anxiety might also account for Winky's anguish and she doesn't seem to improve much over time.

That's not "freeing elves dooms them", especially with Dobby as the counter-example.

But the main point is that elves are magically compelled to serve according to canon.
