You argue persuasively for the existence of a cultural impetus for house-elves to serve, serve well, and be loyal. I don't think your argument against a magical bond is quite as effective.

#+begin_quote
  Now, it is common in the fandom to represent house-elves as being magically enslaved, and magically bound to follow their master's commands. But these two examples, and especially the Winky example, directly contradict that.
#+end_quote

That shows that house-elves are not in general magically bound to obey every order on pain of death. They might be magically bound in less strict ways. Bound not to run away, bound not to hurt their master, bound in a way that causes them physical pain or forces them to punish themselves for disobedience. And the level of binding could be different for different house-elves.

#+begin_quote
  This wording further indicates that Winky has a choice whether to obey or not, and that it is her desire to be a "good house-elf" which results in her obeying, not any kind of magical coercion.
#+end_quote

Winky was lying the whole time. She wasn't saving anyone a seat; she was minding Barty Crouch Jr to ensure he didn't run away.

If she had been ordered to ensure there was a seat for Barty Crouch Sr, she could have done that by dropping his coat there and leaving, or by putting up a sign, or by asking someone else to reserve the seat. That would have worked, but not as reliably. Or, if she were outright mutinous, she could have checked that there was a seat available at the moment Crouch Sr asked about it and then scarpered, since one interpretation of the command ("Make sure there's a seat available for me") was fulfilled. Kreacher would probably have done that.

Winky, being a good house-elf, would have stayed there to ensure nobody could take the seat without dealing with a persistent house-elf.

  Secondly, in GoF, Winky is able to leave Barty Crouch Sr's tent, which is contrary to his explicit orders
#+end_quote

Barty Crouch Sr claimed that, certainly.

#+begin_quote
  Another example is that it solves the "laundry dilemma". The laundry dilemma is this: handing house-elves clothes frees them. But then how do house-elves do the laundry?
#+end_quote

The next sentence of that GoF quote:

#+begin_quote
  Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments.
#+end_quote

"Present". Dropping a sock on the floor and telling an elf to wash it is probably not presenting them with proper garments. Dobby, despite being mutinous, was unable to free himself simply by picking up a piece of clothing out of a wardrobe or off the floor. He had to be physically handed a sock to be free.

Similarly, the house-elves in Order of the Phoenix found Hermione's plot of surprise freedom to be insulting. Not a threat to their service, just insulting. They weren't being presented with clothing.

#+begin_quote
  But I don't think these examples are sufficiently persuasive of the "magical binding" view. Both situations are adequately explained by house-elves being so heavily devoted to the culture of servitude that they consider themselves bound, despite the lack of external constraints.
#+end_quote

Kreacher considered himself to be the property of the Blacks. He considered Harry to be an interloper with no right to the Black inheritance. And still he obeyed. If it were merely culture, I don't think he would have been compelled to obey.

It certainly feels like he was more thoroughly bound and less personally dedicated than Winky was.

#+begin_quote
  One important implication of house-elves not being magically bound is that it changes the nature of wizards' moral obligations from the anti-slavery perspective. The debate on house-elves is essentially around the question "is it morally required to free a slave who wishes to remain enslaved?"
#+end_quote

That would still be the case with a magical bond, as long as it were accompanied by a cultural impetus to serve.
