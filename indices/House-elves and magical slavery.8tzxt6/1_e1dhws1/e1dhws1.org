Looks like I was wrong - Sesc has located the following quote from OotP:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh, yes," said Dumbledore. "You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoy's our whereabouts, or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. *He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius*. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it."
#+end_quote

So I think this is just going to have to be one of those areas of canon which is internally inconsistent. A house-elf disobeys an order in GoF but in OotP Dumbledore notes house-elves are magically bound to obey. Oh well. It does, at least, give fanfic writers more scope to do what they like with it.
