  But I don't think these examples are sufficiently persuasive of the "magical binding" view. Both situations are adequately explained by house-elves being so heavily devoted to the culture of servitude that they consider themselves bound, despite the lack of external constraints.

Well without an argument for how this is true I don't see how this isn't just dismissing counter evidence. It's clearly written that Kreacher was being made to do that. Kreacher wished to betray the Orrder to Narcissa and Bellatrix far more than he wanted to obey Sirius, evidenced by the fact that he immediately took an order that could be interpreted as being told to leave, even though it required him to disobey other orders (like not revealing their secrets).

And further, one can argue that being made to harm oneself for disobedience doesn't negate being enslaved. Dobby refers to them as being enslaved, in any case.
