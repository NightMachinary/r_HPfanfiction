My argument is that the "evidence" under-determines the outcome. Kreacher being "made" to do something can be equally explained by

A) a self-enforced belief that he was bound to follow orders and

B) a magical compulsion to do so.

Your noting that Kreacher wished to betray the order but didn't do so isn't really a counter-argument. House-elves being forced to do things they don't like is canon and noted in my OP. The question is the source of that obligation. The fact that the source is effective in binding house-elves' behaviour does not necessitate a magical binding. A social obligation explains the behaviour just as well - as evidenced by real life slavery. House-elves just go a step further in having a culture where even disgruntled slaves continue to respect the institution of slavery, and seek freedom/disobedience from within the framework of that institution.

It's not dismissing the evidence; it's noting that the evidence supports both conclusions equally. Since it doesn't favour one interpretation over the other, then it doesn't work as a counter-argument against the other, quite explicit evidence that house-elves can directly disobey their masters.

  And further, one can argue that being made to harm oneself for disobedience doesn't negate being enslaved. It's a bit like saying a slave on a plantation who technically could have run away, but didn't, isn't really a slave. Even if they like it (made to desire it, that is), it doesn't change what the thing is. Dobby refers to them as being enslaved, in any case.

No one is saying that house-elves are not slaves. The argument is about whether they are /magical/ slaves or simply legally/culturally slaves.
