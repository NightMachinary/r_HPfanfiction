  Why do you think the Kreacher situation can only be explained by a magical bond and not a cultural one?
#+end_quote

Because he was doing everything he could not to obey Harry including outright denial, but as Dumbledore said, he was compelled to do so anyway because he passed from Sirius to Harry. Can you show any cultural norm that works that way? Dumbledore wouldn't have been as concerned if Harry was Kreacher's true master or not if he wasn't magically compelled to obey.

  And how do you reconcile it with Winky directly disobeying an explicit order from her master in GoF?
#+end_quote

She disobeyed but had to harm. No one disputes that house elves can disobey (Dobby does it all of CoS), but they appear to have so make themselves suffer to do so. And this appears to be magically enforced in nature since, as with Dobby in GoF, he thanked Harry for stopping him. This means he never wanted to hurt himself and needed a third party to stop him from what made him do so. That's not a cultural norm.
