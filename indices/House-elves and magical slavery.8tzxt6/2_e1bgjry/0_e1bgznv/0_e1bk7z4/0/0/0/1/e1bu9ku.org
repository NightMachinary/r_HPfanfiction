  I'm not familiar with any example of real world slaves who wanted to be free nonetheless choosing to remain slaves

This is a very interesting thread, but this in particular reminded me of some recent articles I've read about Sally Hemings who was Thomas Jefferson's slave. In addition to being his slave, she was the mother of several of his children, which I knew, and also his late wife's half-sister, something I did not know.

Sally was with Jefferson in Paris and she /could/ have had her freedom as slavery was illegal there, but she chose to remain Jefferson's slave when he promised that their children would be freed upon reaching adulthood. That is one concrete case where someone who wanted to be free and could have been free chose to remain a slave.

Jefferson's home, Monticello, has long been a historical site and is finally grappling with the paradox that is the man who said, "All men are created equal," yet kept his own wife's sister in bondage.

Edited to add:

Also, on a recent trip to DC, I went to Mt Vernon, Washington's home and plantation. I knew that he owned slaves, but being faced with it was a whole other thing. Mt Vernon has an excellent, in-depth exhibit about Washington and slavery and his conflicted feelings and behavior. In the early days of the US, the capital was Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was founded by the Quakers and slavery was illegal there. If a slave was in Pennsylvania for more than 6 months, they were automatically freed. Washington of course knew this and purposely cycled his household slaves in and out of Pennsylvania when he was in Philadelphia so none of them were there the required 6 months. One of the household slaves, Martha Washington's lady's maid, took advantage of this and the confusion of the 6 month transition and walked away, remaining free the rest of her life.

George Washington's own valet ran away but was recaptured and was at his master's bedside when he died and was one of the few slaves freed upon Washington's death. The rest of the slaves he personally owned (most of the slaves at Mt Vernon were Martha's dower slaves) were to be freed upon Martha's death. Feeling the burden of that, she freed them 2 years after Washington's passing. Her dower slaves were never freed.
