  Because he was doing everything he could not to obey Harry including outright denial, but as Dumbledore said, he was compelled to do so anyway because he passed from Sirius to Harry. Can you show any cultural norm that works that way? Dumbledore wouldn't have been as concerned if Harry was Kreacher's true master or not if he wasn't magically compelled to obey.

But all this amounts to is noting that Kreacher was compelled. It still doesn't indicate the source of that compulsion. That Kreacher didn't want Harry to be his master but nonetheless obeys him doesn't really show a magical compulsion, just that the compulsion is powerful.

I'm not familiar with any example of real world slaves who wanted to be free nonetheless choosing to remain slaves, not out of fear of the consequences of fleeing, but out of respect for the institution. I'm sure there were a few "Uncle Toms" out there but that's not quite the same, as they didn't want to be free. In any case, it doesn't mean that a fantasy culture cannot have those values, especially when it is a culture of another species.

I suppose the closest real-life culture is the military chain of command, where soldiers will zealously obey orders that they disagree with. But again, it's not quite the same.

  She disobeyed but had to harm.

Winky didn't punish herself for that incident. (Except with alcoholism).

  No one disputes that house elves can disobey, but they appear to have so make themselves suffer to do so. And this appears to be magically enforced in nature since, as with Dobby in GoF, he thanked Harry for stopping him. This means he never wanted to hurt himself and needed a third party to stop him from what made him do so. That's not a cultural norm.

I think this is an overly narrow view of what determines behaviour. If I'm having a panic attack and someone helps me out of it, does that mean my panic attack was magically enforced? No, it just means that I was in the grip of my own psychological vulnerabilities.

Punishment appears to be entirely self-enforced as well, as Dobby is the one who determines what actions do and don't constitute those worthy of punishment, as well as the form the punishment takes. Indeed, even if house-elf slavery is a magical bond, I don't think there's any reason to think that the self-punishment behaviour was part of that magical bond.
