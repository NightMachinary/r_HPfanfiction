  But all this amounts to is noting that Kreacher was compelled. It still doesn't indicate the source of that compulsion.

  In any case, it doesn't mean that a fantasy culture cannot have those values, especially when it is a culture of another species.
#+end_quote

What I mean is that any Enforcement that works that way is not cultural. Cultural norms are enforced socially through peer pressure, community/familial shaming, laws and individual moral beliefs. Kreacher believed following loyal Blacks was correct (and "loyal" pure-bloods generally, presumably). However, he did not want to obey Sirius or Harry. No one who mattered to him would shame him for disobeying them. There were no known legal consequences for doing so (depending on what house elf laws are). And so on. It simply doesn't fit a cultural norm, he was compelled by an outside source, made clear, I think, by the description of him /resisting/ obeying Harry.

  Winky didn't punish herself for that incident.
#+end_quote

I think that was because she was stunned right afterward, and in any case, it seems to have been an instance where she had 2 conflicting orders: stay in the tent and don't allow anyone to learn about Crouch Jr.

  If I'm having a panic attack and someone helps me out of it, does that mean my panic attack was magically enforced? No, it just means that I was in the grip of my own psychological vulnerabilities.
#+end_quote

That's not a valid comparison, panic attacks aren't brought on by oneself. That elves seem to have a common reaction to disobedience suggests (unless we're going to say it's coincidental) it's the magic of their laws that make them do so.

  Dobby is the one who determines what actions do and don't constitute those worthy of punishment
#+end_quote

Hm? He and Kreacher seem to do exactly the same in this regard: Disobedience entails having to punish. The only real determination they do is if they can exploit commands that weren't made rigid enough to preclude creative interpretations.
