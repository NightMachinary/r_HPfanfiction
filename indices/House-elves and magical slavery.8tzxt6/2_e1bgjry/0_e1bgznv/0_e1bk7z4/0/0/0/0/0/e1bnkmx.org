  What I mean is that any Enforcement that works that way is not cultural. Cultural norms are enforced socially through peer pressure, community/familial shaming, laws and *individual moral beliefs.* Kreacher believed following loyal Blacks was correct (and "loyal" pure-bloods generally, presumably). However, he did not want to obey Sirius or Harry. No one who mattered to him would shame him for disobeying them. There were no known legal consequences for doing so. And so on. It simply doesn't fit a cultural norm, he was compelled by an outside source, made clear, I think, by the description of him resisting obeying Harry.

I highlighted individual moral beliefs as this is the way I am saying house-elves self-enforce their culture of servitude. You note that Kreacher did not want to obey Harry. This is not disputed. You also note that Kreacher preferred the other members of the Black family to Sirius. This is also not disputed.

However, what I am saying is that Kreacher has another belief which trumps all of those: the belief that he must obey his master. It is this belief which explains his behaviour without any need for a magical compulsion.

  Hm? He and Kreacher seem to do exactly the same in this regard: Disobedience entails having to punish. The only real determination they do is if they can exploit commands that weren't made rigid enough to preclude creative interpretations.

The issue is what counts as "disobedience". For example, Dobby considers speaking ill of his master as a punishable offence, but Kreacher clearly does not.
