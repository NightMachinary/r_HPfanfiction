This is a lot of assertion without any real argumentation. Why do you think the Kreacher situation can *only* be explained by a magical bond and not a cultural one? And how do you reconcile it with Winky directly disobeying an explicit order from her master in GoF?

As I see it, we have one section of canon which is explicit that house-elves can disobey their masters if they choose, and then a collection of ambiguous quotes which can support either magical service or cultural service. So the balance of evidence is very much in favour of cultural service.
