  The question is the source of that obligation.

I'm arguing the source of that is magical. House elves are magically enslaved. Kreacher was made to follow orders magically. As Sirius says, they have to follow orders, not simply choose to. And even with Harry's correct reply, they can disobey orders but cannot stop themselves from self-harm afterwards. Kreacher wanted to disobey Sirius and harm the Order. He didn't simply feel obligated to do so because he had something like a moral compulsion to do so, he was constantly trying to find a loophole to stay consistent with the enchantment, meaning obedience was enforced not simply complied with. Dobby didn't want to harm himself when disobeying the Malfoys (notice he thanks Harry for stopping him from self-harm after being freed), but does it anyway. Whatever the "laws of house-elves" are, they appear to be magical in nature, not simply social or moral norms house-elves can simply desire to uphold.

  No one is saying that house-elves are not slaves. The argument is about whether they are magical slaves or simply legally/culturally slaves.

I'm saying they're magical slaves.
