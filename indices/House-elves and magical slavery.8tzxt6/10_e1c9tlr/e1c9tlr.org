Hmmm. How about this:

Their biology and therefore minds are different from ours and when they feel guilt, they suffer from severe depression or something similar. Maybe even physical pain. So, when they disobey, to alleviate the guilt and those following bad feelings, they punish themselves. And by using loopholes, they sort of lie to themselves to not feel 'guilt'. Perhaps they are too honest so lying gives them discomfort. Or they are something like honor-bound to follow their promises lest they feel bad. Also maybe they have some kind of sensory organ that uses magic subconsciously to feel who is their owner or if the order came from their owner or not. They are magical beings after all.

But this also means they can be kinda bound with magic enforcing it. The process of buying a house elf would be just making one of them swear to serve you. Or even some vague thing like your family etc. Thanks to their instinctive ability to feel if that order came from their owner or not, they would obey. That way, even if the old head of a family dies, the next one can still order the house elf around because the elf swore to serve their family not a specific person.

For example, perhaps Kreacher swore that he would serve and obey the orders of the owner of the Grimmauld Place when he was first bought. (Or the head of the Black family?) So it's still kinda self-enslavement: He swore himself, not bound by some external magic, but because he swore, magic somehow enforces this. So when Harry orders him to do something, he 'feels' (for the lack of better word) the need to do it. Not like imperius or compulsion but he sort of 'feels' that if he disobeys, he will feel that 'guilt' I mentioned. It's up to him to actually disobey and feel bad or just obey.

And perhaps once upon a time there were more house elves who felt less discomfort and could disobey more easily but wizards killed them or they couldn't breed somehow so over the course of the time they evolved and became more docile.
