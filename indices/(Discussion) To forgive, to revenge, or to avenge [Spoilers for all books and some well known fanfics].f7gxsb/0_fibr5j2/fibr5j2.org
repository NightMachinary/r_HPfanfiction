As stated, canon already employed option 1, and to this day I'm bitter about that. Option 5 is possibly the most satisfying though, it's both hard to do well and may not fit many fics. It obviously requires a certain kind of Harry. Generally, I prefer some combination of option 3 and 4 combined as long as author doesn't drag it on and on.

Option 2 is the shittest option among all of them imho.
