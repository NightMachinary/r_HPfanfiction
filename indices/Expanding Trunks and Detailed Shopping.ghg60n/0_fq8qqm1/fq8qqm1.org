Early on, those shopping scenes or inheritance reading does seem fresh. Except for rare moments, the canon is really sparse on detail. It's like a kid reading trivia on random planet statistics. After a dozen or so of "oh Harry got this super cool/expensive thing", it becomes tedious. So what if he got an auto-drying/magic-detecting glasses but the story never uses them?

I'm not sure if the style isn't as popular, or now I simply stop reading after the first chapter for fics that have such scene. I don't think I have a favorite shopping scene, the earliest ones do make me "ooh, indeed, an auto-adjusting robe!", later on, I always skipped them because they feel like padding.
