I'm not opposed to a fun shopping trip. There's a reason why the indy!Harry expanded trunk shopping trip became popular in the first place, after all: it's a great opportunity to explore and expand wizarding daily life by depicting consumer goods, shops, professions, the hustle and bustle of daily life, etc. And just a good way to depict the aesthetic of wizarding society.

The problem with all those indy!Harry shopping trips is that they're all the same. There's nothing new there, and none of them capture that essential charm of Diagon Alley that you first feel when you read PS. In those fics, Diagon Alley isn't a living place, it's simply a vending machine to serve the function of giving Harry a ton of cool stuff that he will never use.

The depiction of Knockturn Alley in Out of the Night is the complete opposite of this, and I love it.
