linkao3(Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla) is slightly similar, but other way around. It is a cross-over (probably the only cross-over of HP, which I like, because it doesn't destroy JKR's universe) with the TV show “Spooks” about MI5. Two wizards and a witch work for MI5 and help them to resolve case which interests both sides. It is post-war and canonical, so Harry is somewhere in the background as the Head Auror and he is personally not much involved in the case. I am not sure whether Hermione and Ron make even appearance.
