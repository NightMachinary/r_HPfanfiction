That... Honestly doesn't actually narrow things down much. There's a lot of fics in which Harry is either or both of those - it's a common Super!Harry thing, and as such I wouldn't actually /recommend/ most of them because they inevitably fall /firmly/ under Sturgeon's Law.

In a complete vacuum I would recommend The Accidental Animagus ( linkao3(14078862) ) in which Harry is a cat animagus - it does have NobleHouse!Harry acting like a somewhat shrewd politician at the ripe old age of 11, but it does it relatively well and the rest of the fic is good enough to make up for it. It's also one of the few fics I've come across where the Animagus ability actually sees regular usage.

However, I also see Accidental Animagus recommended on here enough (and in enough similar threads to this) that I'm going to assume you know it.
