I know FF's where Harry becomes other things besides an Auror, but I don't know many FF's where he is in the process of learning to be other things.

Of the few I know, two is where Harry is learning curse breaking.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Sumer - linkffn(5915140)

Harry Potter and the Magic of Life - linkffn(11002763)

linkffn(Whispers in the Night by Jean11089) - This story has Harry learning how to become a healer.

After that, I don't know much else. Best of luck in your search.
