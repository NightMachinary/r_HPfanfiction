I just remembered some other fanfics about Harry wanting a different career in life.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Harry is slowly learning to become a magizoologist with a specialty with serpents. It's a fun story.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry is more interested in art, specifically pottery, at a young age and learns to incorporate magic with his art.

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - Harry ends up becoming a dad and that causes a change in life choices.

Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion - linkffn(11610805) - Has Harry interested in dragons and learning to be a dragon keeper.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781 - Avenger Crossover: Harry starts up a bar but gets pulled into becoming a hero. It is a story about Harry leaving the magical world and finding a new purpose in his life.

Welp, here is my extended lists. Enjoy!
