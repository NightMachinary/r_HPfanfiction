Do you care about ship? These two are Draco/Harry, which I know some do not care for.

Reparations by Saras_Girl: Harry is a healer-in-training (not sure if that counts enough towards your request) and his job is a very prominent part of the story [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075]]

That same author also has a story where Harry discovers he is artsy and learns how to be an artist (I think a glass blower? maybe its making furniture? it's been a while since I read it haha): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695]]
