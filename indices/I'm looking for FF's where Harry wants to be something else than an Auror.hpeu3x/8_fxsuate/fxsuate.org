Turn by sarasgirl !! Auror Harry goes to an alternative dimension where he became a wood worker instead. Like he had a fancy workshop where he made things like very expensive and artistic furniture, blew glass and so on

The author made it seem like such a good fit for Harry, like his life improved significantly and he became happier, more social, felt younger than he did as an upright and hardened auror and all that because he took a chance on a creative passion which suited him better after a whole youth of danger and stress.

The fic is great for a lot of things but that's one of the high points if you ask me, I highly recommend
