My personal favorites are "Revenge of the Wizard", "Magic of the Force" and "What's a Gungan?". The latter is very new and I was very happy to see one of my all time favorite crossover writer do a HP/SW crossover.

Lord of Light is part 3 in a series. So you would have to go through part 1 set in the HP universe alone with heavy cliches and not the best writing. Part 2 is set in the Star Trek universe and much, much better. Part 3 in the SW universe is great too. And it has a sequel set in the Worm universe.

Broken Chains has a sequel.
