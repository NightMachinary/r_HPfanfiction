Another one I don't see listed among the other suggestions, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4521407/1/The-Boy-Who-Fell-A-HP-Starwars-Crossover][/The Boy Who Fell/]], which is a SW crossover AU in which the Boy Who LIved died at the hands of the Dursleys, and thus isn't really involved in the story.
