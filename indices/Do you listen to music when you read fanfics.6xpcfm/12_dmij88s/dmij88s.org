Not often, I find it to be too distracting.

When I do, though, I listen to whatever comes up on my iTunes shuffle. 'Course, that leads to songs like 'Aligned With Giants' or 'Rapture Rising' by JT Machinima or 'One by One' by DAGames playing that have literally nothing to do with the fic other than language spoken/read.
