Sometimes I do, if I feel I want more atmosphere to surround the story I'm reading. I have a lot of bands I'd put towards certain emotions in the story, with jangle or math rock/midwest emo for gentle scenes, varying metal genres for charged up scenes (action or emotionally angry) such as thrash, grindcore, black, or varying death metal subgenres.

Mostly instrumental is what I go for, and the metal genres would accordingly need vocals that are more for sound than actually understanding every word.
