Definitely two kids. Otherwise, I'd like to see a "good" Bella with a plausible explanation for her past actions and subsequent reformation (for example, forced to participate by Rodolphus, then driven insane by Azkaban. As for the reformation, I dunno... Narcissa manages to find her a cure somehow?)

EDIT: And please, no time travel
