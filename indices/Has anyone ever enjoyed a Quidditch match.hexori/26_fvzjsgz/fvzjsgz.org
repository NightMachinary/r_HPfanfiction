The rules of quidditch seem flawed, I'm rereading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse) at the moment. The author changes the quidditch rules, I do enjoy reading the matches, they seem a lot more fair. I don't know how important they are for the plot, but I'd say there's definitely some character development. Unfortunately there's no real matches until the sequel, but I highly recommend the entire series.

Apart from that I can't think of any quidditch match I enjoyed reading, mostly I find myself skim reading them
