I've really enjoyed two of them. First was in one of the gamer stories. Harry at a quidditch match he was /attending/, grabbed the snitch and stuffed it into his pocket without anyone noticing. He eventually gets a quest to return the snitch without getting caught. Five miserable days later.

The other was a lemon where Lee Jordan was simultaneously commentating on both the match and the hummer Rose Potter was giving him.
