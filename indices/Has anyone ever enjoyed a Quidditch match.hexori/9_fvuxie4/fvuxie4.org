The in detail Quidditch matches were always some of my favorite parts of the books, because I was so completely immersed. Harry's feelings were my feelings, and although Rowling made a silly sport, she also made compelling characters with compelling motivations.

One of the reasons why Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book is because of the whole Quidditch subplot. The team loses their first match, but they bounce back and overcome spectacular odds in order to win.

Also, skill can outmatch money, as Harry proved in CoS.
