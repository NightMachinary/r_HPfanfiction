Agreed with everything you said. I've also been toying with an alternate scoring system for quidditch that to make it a bit less reliant on who catches the snitch.

Something like points for scoring the quaffel remaining unchanged, but in addition to increasing your own teams score they would decrease the amount the enemy team gets for catching the snitch.

So for example if the score was:

Gryff - 50 Slyth - 80

then Gryffindor could still pull a win by catching the snitch worth 70 points.

But the further along the game gets, the less value that is placed on the snitch, besides ending the game.

In a different scenario, say Gryff with 120 points and Slyth with 140, a snitch capture by Gryff would still result in a loss, since slytherins 140 points would make the snitch worth only 10.

The numbers could be tweaked, but its just something I've been thinking about.
