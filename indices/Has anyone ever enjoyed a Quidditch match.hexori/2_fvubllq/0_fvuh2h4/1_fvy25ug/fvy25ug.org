You really don't need to make the snitch worth less, just make it much harder to catch, or rather establish the background that most matches have much higher scores.

150 is a huge amount if the score ends 200-50. 150 matters a lot less 700-450.

We're told some matches go on for days, if a team can't get a decisive margin of victory in that time then the snitch works as a decider. Test cricket lasts 5 days so it isn't unheard of for sports in Britain to last a long time.

Harry is a very talented seeker, as is Krum, that's why they tend to have low scoring matches, they end it before huge scores can be racked up.
