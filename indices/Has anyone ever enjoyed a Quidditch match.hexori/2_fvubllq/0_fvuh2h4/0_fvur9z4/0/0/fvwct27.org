If you want, why not.

Personally, it doesn't bother me. Most team sports I watch can end up in a tie. (Soccer, Handball, Basket, Rugby). So I don't find it that absurd that a match can end up in a tie. That's what happens in sport. Ut can add to the tension and excitement. Also to strategies. If team think they can't win 5 goals in a row, (or more) then they could decide their seeker can attempt to catch the snitch when they could be tie, and go to tie-break?

Now, we do need a way to break the tie for World Cups and over events like that, when a team needs to lose.

We could go the "five throw" with chaser and goalkeeper. But that's the easy route, Like every muggle sports do that.

We could re release the snitch and have only the seeker playing. But that could get boring very fast, if the snitch isn't seen quickly.

I'd say, just for the fun of it. The game resume, without seeker nor beater...position.

The three chaser and goalkeeper get to finally rest. The two beaters and seeker play as chasers and goalkeeper. So it's 2 chasers and a goalkeeper on each team. First team who score win.

But realistically, yeah the "five throws" are the way to got, even if it's the expected way.
