I think only 50 points, so it has values but not overvalue would be fine. It worths 5 goals instead of 15, which is more reasonable as a difference.

But I would introduce the Seekers at the hour mark.

For the first hour, the other players are scoring as much as they can. The more the better. But since the game won't end suddently for an hour, you can work on more manoeuvre, try more things. It could get more spectacular for the chasers and beaters because you get to try again, so at least for the first 45 minutes, you not as afraid to miss.

AfteR hour, snitch and Seeker are released; as the match continue.

Now, chasers and beaters and goalkeeper continue to play. But the game can end at any time. And all their roles are much more important. Because you either go on the defensive because your score is good even if other team seeker catch the snitch, or your in the offensive because you do need to catch up.
