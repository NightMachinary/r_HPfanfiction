Well, I'm into sports in general, so I'd like to read Quidditch matches, despite the nutty rules and scoring system. Could be fun.

But I rarely come accross well-written sports scenes in general, and Quidditch is not an exception.

Sports scenes, it's not the action that matter, they're just a vessels for the emotions. Suspens, dread, anxiety, excitement, hope, anger and fear, and then utter joy and happiness. Or dispair an disapointment. Sports have them all.

You don't describe the matches for game. You describe them to elicit emotions from your reader. They do have to have some importance, thought. Also a third person POV can help a lot.
