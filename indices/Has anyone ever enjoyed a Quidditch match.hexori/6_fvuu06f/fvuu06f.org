I am currently reading the HP series to my kids (8 and 13) for the first time. We just read, last night in fact, The Quidditch Final chapter of Prisoner of Azkaban. I felt the chapter was action packed and thoroughly enjoyable. The kids did too, which is honestly the target demographic here. In books one and two, the matches may have been a bit lacking, though Chamber of Secrets' rogue bludger match was entertaining, but for reasons other than the actual game. I feel like Rowling's writing got better in the later books and the quidditch matches got better too.

As for fanfiction, quidditch doesn't really come up all that much in what I've read, though the wildly ridiculous Naked Quidditch Match story was a ton of fun. I read it years ago though, so I don't remember if it holds up. linkffn(The Original Naked Quidditch Match)
