The snitch is incredibly difficult to see, let alone catch, so trying to rely on it is unwise. It's the size of a golf ball, zips around like a hummingbird, and zooms around a stadium roughly the size of a football field in 3 dimensions. It counts as 15 goals, not 100.

Just own up to the fact that you don't like metaphors; there's no shame in being unwilling to think about things in a non-literal way.
