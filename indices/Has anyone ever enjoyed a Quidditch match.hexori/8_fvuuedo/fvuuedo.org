IMO quidditch matches are very similar to combat scenes, meaning 99% of the time they're written shittily and I just skim them over for plot elements.

I *have* read good quidditch scenes, just like I've read enjoyable fights, but it's pretty obvious they're hard to write well, so I think most authors should limit themselves to JKR levels of descriptions (or less) instead of play-by-playing them.
