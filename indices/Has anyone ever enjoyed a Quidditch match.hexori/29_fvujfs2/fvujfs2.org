People like sports in general, It a University understandable concept for a story, the energy of the stands , the thrill of a close game, Plus a lot of people that grew up in the Harry Potter mania Are either in college or beyond now and for a lot of universities They have Quidditch teams as a competitive sport so people can relate to the game more, Plus a match is a good backdrop to complement other storylines
