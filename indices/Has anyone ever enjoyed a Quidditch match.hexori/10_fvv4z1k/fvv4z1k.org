As you say, I enjoy the ones that change the rules to make sense. Plenty of stories put interesting spins on the game, allowing for fun strategy and further worldbuilding. The most interesting ones I've seen are one story which made the snitch worth a percentage of the team's score, and so forcing the seeker to switch between chasing and seeking dependent on the score gap - and also one which which kept the seeker out of play until their team reached 100 points.

Plus, the games tend to serve as good backdrop for plot and character when you write from the audience's perspective - Ron especially gets to shine as our standard exposition device. But yeah if you don't do any of the above, the matches basically just pad wordcount.
