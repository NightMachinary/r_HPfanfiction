No I haven't, for two interrelated reasons. One, Quidditch as a sport is fairly boring outcome-wise. Either the game is close, in which case none of the action matters, all that matters is the snitch, or the game is a blowout, in which case nothing matters. Either way, it isn't intriguing to read about. (And I don't buy JKR trying to say she designed it that way on purpose as a "metaphor for life").

The second problem is that when Quidditch is used as a vehicle for another development, i.e. the dementors, it's usually either a rehash or not written well. If writer's are going to use a Quidditch scene, please focus on basically anything except the game itself. The emotions, the tension, the crowd, the political stakes, whatever. But multiple paragraphs of "Katie, Angelina, and Alicia used the Hawkshead formation to break through the Slytherin defense and scored a goal, 20-10 Gryffindor" is a snoozefest.
