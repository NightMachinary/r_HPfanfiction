There has only one story where I actually enjoyed the matches and that was this big fourth year story. There were a lot of different cross-school competitions aside of the 3 big tests, including this big, sponsored quidditch tournament. Pretty sure it was a Harry/Fleur story. The training and matches is a big part of the story and is really detailed which makes it worthwhile to read them.
