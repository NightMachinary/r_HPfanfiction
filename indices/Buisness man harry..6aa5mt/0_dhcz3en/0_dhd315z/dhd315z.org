Read it. Looking more for a harry who isn't raped by a few schoolgirls/boys. Not looking for super strong harry, but at least a harry that can hold off a few magical schoolgirls. Also i believe a lot of the staff was too ooc. I mean i know mcgonnagal at least wouldn't have followed so blindy as to miss and even cause pain to one of her'cubs'.
