That's interesting to know. Perhaps it depends on the family? Or maybe the religion or something?

What I do know about my family personally is that my parents picked their friends for my godparents, and their siblings for my brother. I think in our family, they were just honorary titles more than any indication who they wanted to take us in should they die.
