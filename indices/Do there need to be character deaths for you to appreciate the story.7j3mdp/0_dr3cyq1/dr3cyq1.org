There needs to be agency and urgency. For harry potter, all main characters do survive(harry, hermione, ron). Only secondary and tertiary characters die. Those deaths show the seriousness of the war. If everyone survives, it sounds like it could be a potential mary sue story where harry doesn't fail at all in anything he does.
