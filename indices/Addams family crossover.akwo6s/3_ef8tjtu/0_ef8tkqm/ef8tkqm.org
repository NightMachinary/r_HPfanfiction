  “Oh, Gomez,” Morticia said as she folded her hands under her chin “to be as free as a child, to be able to rage so well” Her eyes clouded over with fond memories of deathly pranks and sunny sisters. Gomez crawled on his knees, glass shards and wood chips tearing at his suit and skin. He wrapped his arms around his beloved's legs and kissed her exposed thigh.“Such rage, such passion,” he agreed breathlessly as the baby's cries got louder and louder. “We must take it with us.” Morticia decided, swathed in black rags and moonlight, “he reeks of death, and darkness. He will be an Addams.” It was time to go home.
