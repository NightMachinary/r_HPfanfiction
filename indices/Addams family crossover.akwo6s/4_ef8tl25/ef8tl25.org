Tenhawk wrote a fic that still updated on occasion called Alexander and the Shadow Council. It has Xander Harris at 11 getting into Hogwarts due to his family history along the way he meets Wednesday Adams who is going to Hogwarts also. It is in the summer of year 5 its a long read but pretty entertaining. He used to have a site but its no longer available but you can still get it off his yahoo group at TH_Presents. It is a VERY long read though. But pretty good overall. The fic features Xander, Wednesday Adams, Padma Patil and Harry Potter as the primary protagonists.
