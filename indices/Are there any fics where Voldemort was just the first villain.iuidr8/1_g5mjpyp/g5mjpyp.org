There are a few I like but I'll have to edit my comment later to include them once I double check their names but the first one that comes to mind is linkffn(learning to breathe). This one starts off after Harry killed Voldemort and the main enemy is smarter and more powerful (in my opinion at least, I'm of sure if it explicitly states this).
