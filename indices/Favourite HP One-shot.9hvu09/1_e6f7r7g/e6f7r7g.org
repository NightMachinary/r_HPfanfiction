For me it's between /The Sniper/ and /Evil Be Thou My Good./ I just love the pacing and the tone of /The Sniper/. It's an angry Harry I can believe. My go-to when I've had a bad day. /Evil Be Thou My Good/ was one of the first fanfics I ever read and it blew my mind. So I love it partly because of nostalgia and partly because I've never seen an HP fic do horror nearly as well. linkffn(3918135) linkffn(2452681)
