If anything, it /un/-bashes Dumbledore (who's firmly in "competent adult" mode here, right down to "Dursleys abuse Harry and I didn't realize it, better do everything I can to make up instead of keeping him there") and Ron just ends up being his normal, friendly-but-occasionally-tactless self.

The only /hint/ at a pairing so far is Harry getting a kiss on the cheek from Tonks, so no harem stuff either.
