Harry talks to snakes more regularly when growing up, they feel protective of him but can't actually do anything to the Dursleys because these are small common garden snakes we're talking about here, so they walk him through the process to hatch a basilisk. The zoo incident goes down a little more severely than in canon and Vernon ends up briefly petrified (only briefly, and not dead, on account of the basilisk still being very young), giving Harry the chance to flee to Mrs. Figg who has the common sense to send for authorities when she sees the state Harry's in.

That's just the executive summary of the first chapter, IDK where it goes from there yet. There's some hand-waving about how the snakes know what they do (basilisk ritual, that Mrs. Figg is magic-adjacent) but otherwise it seems like a good enough fic so far.
