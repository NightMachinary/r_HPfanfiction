Overall this was a good story. I'd warn that it starts out ok, and then moves so slowly for a fairly long stretch (like 10-20% of the file) that I almost stopped reading. After that, though, it picks up. I'd also say that the story's overall direction was different than the setup made me expect at first, but that was fine. I'd have been interested in seeing my imagined version too.
