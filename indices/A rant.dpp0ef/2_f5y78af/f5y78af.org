I avoid reading stories about Harry's abuse in general. I remember trying to read one and gave up because it was too much. In general, authors seem to want to make the abuse so terrifying in their stories that I only leave the story with the distinct impression they like the drama. On the other hand, I'm reading a fix it fic where the Dursleys apparently will be punished in some way. And while that's admirable, I don't find it paticularly interesting to read because it makes me think of news reports on child abuse. Now I really think I'd prefer a fic which just doesn't have the Dursleys in the plot at all. I have also noticed I read less and less fics because now I know what I want and so it's hard to find that ideal fic.
