The thing people forget about the books is that Rowling originally designed Harry's situation as a parallel of "Cinderella." Both families are abusive, but they're not /believably abusive/, if you get what I mean. Its hard to take how the Dursleys behave seriously because...well...they're a fairy tale step-family.

Overweight loudmouth stepdad? Check. Snooty, cleaning-obsessed stepmom? Check. Underworked, ugly bullying stepsibling? Check.

Its hard to see that in the same way as real abuse because thats not a real abusive family. Out of context, most of the behaviors are pretentious to abhorent, but collectively and in-context it reads like what it is - an unreal family situation that is hard to treat as such. Thats why there is such a jarring shift in how the Dursleys are portrayed in GoF begins, as well as Rowling beginning to try and set seeds for walking back all the earlier decade of behavior.
