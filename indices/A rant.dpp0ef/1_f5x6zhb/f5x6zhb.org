  I hate it when a writer tries desperately to incorporate every available character from the DC/Marvel universes. Nobody has successfully done it, it gets messy and miserable fast.

Not really an Avengers problem so much as a problem with most crossovers. A lot of the time the authors really are just saying "how would X story be different if Y character were dumped in the plot?" This almost always ends up being just a repeat of whatever storyline but with Harry Potter in it, which honestly isn't that interesting because Harry himself is not that interesting (more like he is a lightning rod for interesting events).

  Next two rants are fanfiction in general. Ok so in the fictional story Harry is 14 and the author keeps mentioning that "the boy was beautiful " and a lot of complete gibberish that he looked pretty or innocent (usually in fics that mentions abuse). Which makes me feel queasy as fuck. I will assume the author has a thing for little abused boys or that they were a young teen who potentially romanticized violence when they wrote the story. In either case its a instant close down of the fic.

  Third factors in with the second and is heavy abuse of Harry. I started reading a new story the other week or so and the first paragraphs was well written but it soon evolved into a extremely detailed torturous, longwinded and impeccably detailed story on child abuse. Vile and graphic and so wrong. ðŸ¤®

There is a lot that can be said, but really its hard for me to feel bad when Rowling did the same thing in canon. People who don't really understand how abuse occurs/works in real life often write caricatures of it in order to make the character(s) more sympathetic and tragic. Its about sympathy, often as a form of wish-fulfillment. "Oh woe is me, he/she is so brave for bearing it all! Lets adore him for his tragedy" (I'm being hyperbolic, but that is the gist of the matter).

I have come across perhaps ~10 HP fics that on the whole realistically portray abuse of children, either in the more neglectful and more indirect way of canon or in the more visceral, brutal, and direct kind that can occur in real life. And I would know.
