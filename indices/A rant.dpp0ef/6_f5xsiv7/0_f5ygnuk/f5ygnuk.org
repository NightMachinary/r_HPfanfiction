Depends on the fic and what its story is. I'm more talking about fanfiction that has around 10 characters or more from HP and then they to involve all heroes from DC or Marvel. Like Harry needs to fight Dr Doom, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Odin and oh Thanos.

It's a sweet but miserable attempt at trying to build a complete world or universe. I just get a headache.

But everyone is allowed an opinion and it's only fanfiction after all.
