Regarding the second factor, this is how young girls have been written about in all kinds media for ages. Young fic writers who write this kind of thing are getting it from somewhere. So, as inexperienced slash writers who want to portray Harry as an object of romantic interest, particularly male interest, these are the kind of descriptors that come to their mind.

Plus, more fic writers tend to be closer to Harry's age than not, which maybe makes it a bit less problematic? I mean, it's fine that they don't know any better and for the most part I think it's fantastic that fiction writing and publishing has become a way of life for an unprecedented number young people for the first time in history, but the converse is that young people find a lot of problematic ideas attractive and ideas spread like wildfire on the interwebs; and while good ideas stay the same, bad ideas will inevitably get worse.

Just to be clear, I don't think it's OK, and spend inordinate amounts of time looking for fics that are not hinky because I think canon is problematic enough, but I also accept the fact that I'm going have to wade through a lot of shit to get to the good stuff.
