I agree. It is currently on chapter 118 and I gave up around 97 due to way too many characters from the comics/MCU, including Squirrel Girl --- which squicks me out terribly, to be quite honest, IDK why, and other really obscure characters that you probably don't know unless you are a hardcore comics fan. I'm saying it is bad writing, per se, but it is difficult to follow.
