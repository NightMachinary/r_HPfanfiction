  Literally. Every word or sentence that does not contribute to the plot would be struck from a professional novel.

Not really. Just look at A song of Ice and Fire which repeats countless events due to the multi pov style. Jamie's and Brienne's arc is especially bad in that regard. Yet it is still in one of the most successful book series written this millennium.

While I agree that a certain restraint is good, you have to keep in mind that even fluff can add a lot to a fic, be it world building or character development. It might look like another date scene where the relationship between two characters doesn't change, but you still get new information about them and the world.
