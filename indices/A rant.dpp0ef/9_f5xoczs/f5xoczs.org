The inclusion of every possible character is just something we have to live with in fanfiction. The vast majority of fanfiction authors do not understand that less is more. Literally. Every word or sentence that does not contribute to the plot would be struck from a professional novel. That's why we like them so much. Fanfiction authors on the other hand, do not have that supervision. So they tend to inflate their word count with superficial description and meaningless dialogue.

Your second issue is actually with fanfiction authors themselves. Most of them are female and they like pretty boys. It has been said that authors like to self insert a lot into their main characters. Therefore Harry will be considered pretty, because that's how they would like to be addressed to themselves. It's very basic psychology. Compare this with male authors who like to make their main characters into macho man who are great at fighting. It's the same principle.

The heavy abuse is very easily explained. Remember that once the main's character uniqueness and hardship was exemplified by their dead parents. Then it changed to rape (rape is the new dead parents - tv tropes). In HP fandom it's often horrendous abuse. It shows the main character as a unique individual who had gone through hardships unimaginable to the reader.
