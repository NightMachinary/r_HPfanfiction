I didn't like this fic either. I couldn't get through it mainly because the dialogue just wasn't very good. The conversations between Luna and the diary Tom Riddle were just too silly, too simple and not very funny.

The format of fic being written in all dialogue style also really did not help. It's like it was incomplete and lacked substance due to a lack of description and inner dialogue of the characters.

I like stories that do a good job of capturing characters and character voices. Neither Luna or Tom Riddle in the fic matched my idea of how they would sound like or interact with one another. Tom Riddle is a master manipulator. He is charming, clever, very good with words and knowing exactly what to say. It's difficult to go from reading fics where he is written like a brilliant prodigy to ones where his words and actions seem kind of stupid in comparison.

I guess this fic was never meant to be taken seriously, but I just found it super frustrating to attempt reading and couldn't enjoy it at all.
