Lets see here...

- The Lies That Bind linkffn(The Lies That Bind): a U-turn from fluffy H/D romance into dark torture into horrific revenge fic. Two rights don't make a wrong, but three lefts do make a right, apparently.
- Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas): super-Harry war fic thats only just above generic takes the right-heel turn from hell 2/3 of the way through.
- The Hero Trilogy: Harry starts off as a growing challenger to a terrifying villainous Voldemort (hes like Morgoth in here and Harry is sort of like Fingolfin). By the third book, Harry and Voldemort are basically gods, with Harry fighting demons in the sky and having weird centaur drug induced dreams involving a talking plant wielding a semi-automatic. Yeah.
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): the celtic paganism sort of feels like it comes out of nowhere in the second year, and then it goes and becomes the biggest part of the story. It really ramps up though at one point in the story which feels like something of sudden reversal: lets just say it involves Harry attending a Fairy wedding during the full moon with a family of German werewolves. I know what I wrote.
