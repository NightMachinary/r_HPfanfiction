It sounds very familiar - not al the aspects of it, but some.

linkao3(The Post-Burrow World by CeleryThesis) is not a Marriage Law fic, but it does contain the house-elf experiments, the terrible boss, the two endings (actually two entire timelines, I have no idea how CT managed it, she's a fucking genius), and the concerns about wizarding population, as well as contraceptive related shenanigans. Iirc, Hermione and Snape get arrested for teaching a Sex Ed class at Hogwarts, complete with banana.

If someone else comes up with a fic that matches the description, I'd be interested in reading it as well.
