In that case, in a bout of shameless self promotion, I offer you /Harry Potter and the Continuity Crisis/.

It's not actually Drarry, and tbh, not much Weasley bashing... Though there is some Dumble bashing.

There was another one, which I loved (and isn't mine) where Harry was slipped a potion by Fred and George and ended up liking being a girl so stayed.

And another very similar where he took it as part of "a prank".

But alas, I have forgotten the names of those....

There is also /With a little help from my friends/, which has a mostly cis-boy Harry who ends up having to dress as a girl for reasons. He does, by the most recent chapter, end up taking a potion to change his body. Ron ends up trans in that story. Again, no Drarry or Weasley bashing, but it's kinda fun. Sirius ends up a woman.
