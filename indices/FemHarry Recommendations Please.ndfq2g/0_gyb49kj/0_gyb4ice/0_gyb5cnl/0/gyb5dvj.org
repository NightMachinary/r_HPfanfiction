  The summer between her fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been difficult for Harry Potter as she has spent too long being able to mull over her feelings. She's confused, and hurt that her friends haven't spoken to her, and with a slight crisis about her identity she's had nobody to turn to.We join her on her last evening before rejoining her friends.You know the characters, you know the settings, but with a *slight* tweak of fate, her life begins to diverge from canon. I hope you enjoy, and this is my first fanfic, please be nice... It won't be explicit but there may be mature aspects, hence the rating. I'll put a warning on the chapters if it goes above a teen in actual content.As of chapter 31, fifth year is complete and we're back into summer.

  On October 31, 1994 -- The champions for the Triwizard Tournament are announced. From this event, a great chain of events are set into motion that will change some lives, give Harry Potter some new chances, strengthen some friendships, and open doors that had never been opened before.
