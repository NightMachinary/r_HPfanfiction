Hmm. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] fits most of your requirements. Harry isn't the BWL, but his twin brother is, and his twin is effectively Canon!Harry. Note that the author has stopped updating on FFN, and that a lot of updates are on the Darklordpotter WbA section.
