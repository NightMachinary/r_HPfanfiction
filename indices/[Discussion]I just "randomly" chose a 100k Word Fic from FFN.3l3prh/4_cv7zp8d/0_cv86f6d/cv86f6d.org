One thing: Well, congratulation on spending over 400 hours on a completely episodic anime.

Yes, but anime rely on their economic success so their are more likely to cater their respective target group. In fanfiction the relationship is completely different, mostly dependent on the author and --- as other people on reddit pointed out --- more personal about their stories and not accepting critic about the work.

As such one can assume animes to be at least a little bit entertaining while fanfiction is not dependent on the actual entertainment value of the work.
