Setting aside the manipulative Weasleys and every other H/Hr trait I'm embarrassed about sharing a ship with, I've never understood the appeal of the X-Goes-Back genre. Not only are you totally spiking the suspense by giving a character total foreknowledge of your plot, you're forcing me to imagine a fully grown adult with adult feelings and desires /in the body of an 8-year-old./

It's a David Lynch psychological horror plot masquerading as a wish-fulfillment plot.
