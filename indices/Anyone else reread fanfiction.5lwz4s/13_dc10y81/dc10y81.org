I typically don't reread stories very often unless I'm feeling particularly nostalgic or am looking up details for something. Mostly because pretty much all I read are long fanfics, 50+ chapters, hundreds of thousands of words etc.

That and if I read something too many times the story becomes stale to me and I don't really enjoy it any more because I've read it so much.
