HP and the Nightmares of Futures Past, and also Backwards with Purpose. Some of the best time travel 'fic, IMO, they're popular for a reason.

HPMOR (only certain chapters). Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Great examples of competence porn and more, when they're not being pretentious.

To Reach Without (on ff.net). Being Liquid, and Of Historical Figures and Now (both on Ao3). All about gender issues in the Wizarding World.
