Every year around April I reread the Life Cycles trilogy linkffn(Life Agendas) by windseeker2305. The first one is not that great and the whole thing is kinda weird and it's overly slashy and a lot of characters are ooc and overpowered but it's my guilty pleasure and i love it lol. Just wish it would get updated more than once every year or so heh.

On another note, I stopped reading lightning on the wave around halfway through the fourth one because harry is still a whiny little bitch and it annoyed me sooo much. Does it get better? Should I try to push through?
