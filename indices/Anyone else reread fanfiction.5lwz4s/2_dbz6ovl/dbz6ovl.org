I was rather late to this fandom, so Princess of the Blacks and its sequels were the first ones that I read which had the cliches of manipulative Dumbledore(unless HPMOR counts), overly abusive Dursleys etc. I reread it around 3 times, though I probably won't do it again, but I will finish the series.

I like to reread comfy fics like Harry the Hufflepuff, Remus Lupin PI on occasion. Other rereads include Murder Most Horrid and the Arithmancer.

I don't think I could ever reread the lightning on a wave saga, it is far too devoid of humour for me. Finishing it was depressing enough.
