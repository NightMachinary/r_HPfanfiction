I have reread Objects of Desire by azrael (sp?) so many times... it borders on obsessive. My brother and I both love it, since it ends up with both of our favorite pairings, but it is pretty dark and sucks you in. You think you're getting a light hearted ridiculous virginity loss pledge story, instead it gets really dark very fast.

I also reread Mundungus42's stuff (on ff.net) all the time. Really like her writing style and am always psyched to get an email that she posted a new story!
