I've read Pureblood Pretense about 4 times since I first read it in August 2016. It's a problem. I think I've read Draco and Harry's first meeting in HPMOR at least 7 times. This is the opposite of a problem. Others like The Arithmancer, The Merging, and Blurring Reality I've read a couple of times each.

I keep trying to finish Lightning on a Wave, but I can't seem to manage to get past book 4 or so each time I try. It's driving me a bit mad, actually.
