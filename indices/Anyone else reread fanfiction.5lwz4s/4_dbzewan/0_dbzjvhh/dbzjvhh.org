This. I've reread A Black Comedy (nonjon) at least 4 times over the last 5 years. I've read the Denarian saga a few times. The wizard of the Kaleidoscope (gets stranger every reread lol) and countless others.

There is a lack of good humour fics which have plots and that's probably why I keep rereading them
