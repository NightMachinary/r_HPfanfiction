There's some bashing of James/Lily & Harry's twin to start with but it dies out as the characters & plot are developed. The author's basically writing this to twist all the traditional tropes (wbwl, slytherin!Harry) on their head. It can get somewhat overly complex at times, but that's why I love it, just as you think you've figured something out there's another twist. There's also no pairings/romance as of yet, although some minor pairings are hinted at.
