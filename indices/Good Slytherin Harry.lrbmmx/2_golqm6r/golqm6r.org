Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/261823/chapters/409958]]) This is also a great series, sadly abandoned in year 6 but still well worth the read. Pretty sure it ends up as Harry/Draco, but it is very fun to read!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276]]) Similar to cunning and ambition in that it is a series rewrite, it's a WBWL so expect some potter-bashing, but it has a lot of slytherin politics and Gray!Harry. Abandoned during book 5 (sadly) but, again, worth it!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836?view_adult=true]]) This is different but excellent, standalone oneshot. I would also wholeheartedly recommend the rest of the series - all au's written in the same style but with different premises.
