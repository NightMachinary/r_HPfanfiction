Linkao3(A very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree) is a still ongoing huge series. Haven't looked into it for a long time since I'm waiting for it to be finished because I prefer to read stories in one go.

It's a severitus story and IIRC the author said relationships aren't going to happen till the later years and the series starts as Gen and I think goes up to Teen later. But I'm not entirely sure.

I don't remember any bashing but Dumbledore gets criticized for his decision not helping Harry with the abuse.

The series starts pre Hogwarts with linkao3(Amethyst by geoffaree).
