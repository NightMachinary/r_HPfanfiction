I have a Slytherin Harry fic series, though it is also female Harry (just want to let you know up front). It's gen and the primary focus is on friendships with a multi-House friendship group, and on family (it's a Snape adopts Harry fic). They are entirely on the side of the light and with Dumbledore. No bashing.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

Another good Slytherin Harry fic where he's on the side of the light is Leo Inter Serpentes, but that is a Harry/Draco fic series, though the relationship isn't the main focus. He also has a Slytherin friend group.
