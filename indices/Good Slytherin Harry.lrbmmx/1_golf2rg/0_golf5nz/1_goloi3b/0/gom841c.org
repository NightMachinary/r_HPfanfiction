It's thematic (themes including recovery and coming to terms with things) but not explored in graphic detail. The basic gist is that it did happen, but any discussion on it is lacking in details (I don't have the characters describe it in any more detail than a man was there and it was frightening and painful). I totally understand if you don't want to read it, please take care of yourself.
