For all things canon I /highly/ recommend the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wikia]], in this case the article about [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Scourers][Scouers]]. It is the best source of information, they do have almost everything you want.

--------------

Now, let's pretend you don't want to use the wiki for some reason, the let's use google. You can search any website for a specific word with Google. For example, if I wanted to look for helicopters on wikipedia, I can search

#+begin_quote
  helicopter site:en.wikipedia.org
#+end_quote

And I'll only get results from the english wikipedia. For you, the search would look like this:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.google.com/search?q=Scourers+site%3Apottermore.com][Scourers site:pottermore.com]]
#+end_quote

Where the first result is this article:

- [[https://www.pottermore.com/collection-episodic/history-of-magic-in-north-america-en][History of Magic in North America]] - a collection of a few articles
- [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/seventeenth-century-and-beyond-en][17th century and beyond]] - the 17th century subgroup.

The second gives an answer to your question:

  The last, and probably the most dangerous problem encountered by wizards newly arrived in North America were the Scourers. As the wizarding community in America was small, scattered and secretive, it had as yet no law enforcement mechanism of its own. This left a vacuum that was filled by an unscrupulous band of wizarding mercenaries of many foreign nationalities, who formed a much-feared and brutal taskforce committed to hunting down not only known criminals, but anyone who might be worth some gold. As time went on, the Scourers became increasingly corrupt. Far away from the jurisdiction of their native magical governments, many indulged a love of authority and cruelty unjustified by their mission. Such Scourers enjoyed bloodshed and torture, and even went so far as trafficking their fellow wizards. The numbers of Scourers multiplied across America in the late seventeenth century and there is evidence that they were not above passing off innocent No-Majs as wizards, to collect rewards from gullible non-magic members of the community.
