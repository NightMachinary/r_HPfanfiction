I'm personally into mystery books, so if you'd like to check that genre out I recommend Agatha Christie. There's also Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs if you wanna check out the horror genre. If you're into plays and all that, I believe Shakespeare never disappoints. As for sci-fi, I'm not exactly into it, but I read Ender's Game and it was good.
