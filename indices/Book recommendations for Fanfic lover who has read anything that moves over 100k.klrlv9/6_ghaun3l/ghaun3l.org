If you're still interested in books a bit like Harry Potter than you might like the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan and the Septimus Heap series by Agie Sage.

Both series build their own worlds, include fantasy elements, have multiple novels and many well developed characters. I also just find them really good.
