Precisely. Dumbledore is often villanized in fan fiction for being manipulative, instead of being incompetent, the latter which I think is worse. I think this is a direct result of Rowling's own lack of experience in this situation, and her tendency to rely rather heavily on the 'love and kindness' narrative.

Why keep the knowledge of the Horcruxes a secret? Why lie to the Order about Snape? The Order of the Phoenix had already developed a foolproof way of confirming someones identity. Almost no one knew about Voldemorts Horcruxes. So even if they were caught, most Death eaters or even Voldemort himself wouldn't think to look for that information.

And Snape would have been a valuable resource during the second war. By killing Dumbledore, no one questioned his loyalty. Why not capitalize on that?
