Luna might also be a time traveler. I think she would know the fidelius for the horcruxes right? It would make sense because of how she keeps beating Ginny, only using her new moves when Ginny improves. Her mission would be to stay on the down low as much as possible, and correct Harry's mistakes. Harry's would be to make as many changes as possible, and John's was Fate/Death's first go.
