  Or, twist, Alex isn't actually his daughter, but Bellatrix's -- born the summer before she went to Azkaban. He's been trying to raise her right, but...

This is an interesting idea but isn't Alex the heiress? I guess it depends on how patriarchal the Black family is but if she was Bella's child and the oldest /boy/ inherits then Draco would be the heir and therefore Alex couldn't be Bella's daughter.

I guess we need more information on inheritance to have a clear answer. IIRC so far we've only seen families with only daughters and eldest sons, no eldest daughter inheriting before a younger son.

(Also: Her middle name is Patricia. I know this is fairly weak evidence but I feel like Bella would have chosen something more traditional than that.)

As for Dumbledore and Lucius: I doubt the Potters have much say over Harry anymore. Any custody dispute could easily be won due to their negligence and if worst comes to worst Harry can always play the Lord Slytherin card. Granted, he doesn't want that known and it would be a worst case scenario but i doubt the Potters will ever get control over Harry again.

I think it'S kind of funny that Lucius hasn't made the connection between Harry and Lord Slytherin. I guess he assumes that a child simply can't be Lord Slytherin but considering the skills Harry has shown so far it really shouldn't be that much of a leap to make the connection, especially considering Lucius thinks that both of them are likely incarnations of Voldemort.
