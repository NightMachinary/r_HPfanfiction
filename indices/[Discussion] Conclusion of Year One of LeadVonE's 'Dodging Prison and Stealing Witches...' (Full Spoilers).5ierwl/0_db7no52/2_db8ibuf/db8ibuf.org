Luna also participated in Alex's necromancy experiments, which were causing headache for Sirius.

Alex might really be Bellatrix's daughter. She was supposed to have replaced Bellatrix in the first timeline.

I don't think Dumbledore is 100% fucked. He lost some influence and reputation, but now he could operate in the shadows and had more flexibility.

Honestly, I don't think Harry did all that well in Year 1. He expanded his influence a great deal, but also blew his cover, and would be facing two difficult enemies. I'm not sure why he would bother with going to Hogwarts at all. Faking his death and operate completely as Lord Slytherin would give him far more flexibility and greater safety.
