If he goes with that over over used TWT resurrection scheme again, I will be very very unhappy.

The timeline is already destroyed, so I think Voldemort will get his body back at different time. In fact, I think the later Voldemort gets resurrected, the better it's for Harry, unless he wants to set Voldemort after Dumbledore.
