Man, I'm really satisfied with the conclusion to this Season. It really hit the right balance between revealing a lot of stuff and resolving some plotlines while also keeping my interest for the next year.

I'm still a little bit worried that the author is trying to do too much with all the balls he's juggling... I just hope he has it all figured out. It's easy to branch out all the time, open new trapdoors and hint at additional mysteries...
