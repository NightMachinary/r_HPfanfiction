  The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches,

  Born to those who have thrice defied him,

  Born as the seventh month dies,
#+end_quote

We know this already

#+begin_quote
  Born as one half of a greater whole,
#+end_quote

Referring to the brothers Planting the idea that they may have been "supposed" to work together for their full strength.

#+begin_quote
  Born as the brother to the one who was not chosen,

  And the one who was not chosen will know not those who thrice defied him...

  --- Will grow up separate and singled out by all ---

  --- Barring the weight of his fate alone ---
#+end_quote

Saying that Harry was not chosen and that John is the true vanquisher.

#+begin_quote
  ...Or the one who was not chosen will fall to darkness and know not the joy of life,
#+end_quote

He has to be left alone or he will become evil and destroy everything.

#+begin_quote
  But if those who thrice defied him learn these of words spoken,

  Then the one who was not chosen shall vanquish the vanquisher of the dark lord,

  And the world be stripped of magic,
#+end_quote

But now that the Potters have meddled they have ruined everything and Harry will destroy the world.

#+begin_quote
  Only those who thrice defied him can control the one who was not chosen,

  And save the world of magic from a fate most grim.
#+end_quote

The Potters need to listen to Dumbledore or the world will burn.

The only thing that irks me about this is that the prophecy sounds so very fake. I get it, hindsight is 20/20 and it may not be as obvious to the Potters, but it is literally the best outcome for Dumbledore and quite convenient. Aren't there experts on prophecies? Does it even make sense to have a prophecy that depends it's prediction on whether the subjects have heard it or not? Seems kinda pointless to have a prophecy that's not supposed to be heard...
