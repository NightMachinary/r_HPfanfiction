  Aren't there experts on prophecies? Does it even make sense to have a prophecy that depends it's prediction on whether the subjects have heard it or not? Seems kinda pointless to have a prophecy that's not supposed to be heard...

It's a fake, obviously, so Dumbledore worded it as a backup plan to control the potters. If they never heard it it wouldn't matter what it said, but having heard it, suddenly Dumbledore's actions make sense to the Potters. From their perspective it tells them why Dumbledore was behaving the way he was all along, since he heard the prophecy in the beginning.

I'm assuming the ministry experts don't even know about this one, it's probably just been surreptitiously placed by Dumbledore without anyone noticing.
