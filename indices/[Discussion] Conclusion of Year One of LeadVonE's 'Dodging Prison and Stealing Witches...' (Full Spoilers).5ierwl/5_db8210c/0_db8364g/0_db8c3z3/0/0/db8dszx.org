  Dumbledore has already shown himself to be duplicitous, really doesn't make any sense to put all their eggs into one basket again.

Well, duplicitous for good reason, b/c of prophecy. I'm not sure why it would occur to them that DD can plant a fake prophecy, as they went to the place where prophecies are stored and controlled by the ministry and found it. It seems like an independent verification of everything DD has been doing.

So if you think the prophecy is real, it /caused/ DD to act the way he did, not DD acting that way and planting a fake to justify it.
