But that's the thing that can mess you up, especially if you already know it's AU. Fanfic authors know that people reading their stories already know the background, so they can play with what you expect and use those assumptions to blindside you: 'when you assume, you make an ass out of u and me.' For example, in the other big, recent WBWL story, HP and Prince of Slytherin, there was a reference that I thought was to Harry, but turned out to be talking about a completely different character (revealed at the end of his second year).
