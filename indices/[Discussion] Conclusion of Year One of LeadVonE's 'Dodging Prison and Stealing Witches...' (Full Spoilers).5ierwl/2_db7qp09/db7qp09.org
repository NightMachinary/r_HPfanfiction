The Horcux thing seems easily explained as someone (either another time traveller, James or even Harry with a time turner and an obviliate) switched them out.

The real danger is that Voldemort thinks that Harry fooled him, and has the most accurate assessment of Harry's abilities. I have a feeling that by the end of the series Harry will be forced to do that ritual that has been talked about, and most likely, someone will willingly sacrifice themselves for it, probably tracy or someone not as important.

Flamel will play a larger role, because he /knew/ that Harry wanted his stone, before Harry even wanted it! That is terrifyingly smart.
