Good point ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/28/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][ch. 28]]). I don't know the astrological meanings of the planets, just the mythological. Mars implies war, Pluto implies death, and Jupiter would imply ... lordship/rule? That seems promising.
