Both have some interesting plot twists, wrong boy who lived trope, politics, Slytherin Harry:) I am ok with hiatus, I think these are two stories I'll be able to follow after months. And thank you for the suggestion! I feel so bad I didn't read Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches until a couple of days ago, but the author managed to put ALL the main tropes in the premise only (Time travel, Azkaban, WBWL, Harem, am I missing anything?), so I was naturally wary of the story.
