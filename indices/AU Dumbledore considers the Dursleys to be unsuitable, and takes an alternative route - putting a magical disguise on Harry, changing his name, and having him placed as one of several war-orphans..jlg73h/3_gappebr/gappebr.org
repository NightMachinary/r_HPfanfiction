His grandmotherq had said when she had forced him into the stiff new dress robes that they were going to a charitable function for several poor unfortunate orphans that didn't have families children that weren't as lucky as him with no grandparents to raise them never, Neville Had felt kind of funny, Seeing the boys and girls of the orphanage lined up in front of the building to greet the rich guesst that had come To look at them and donate money a few making cruel comments before being backhanded by their significant others and told to keep quiet.

One of the boys in the orphanage had jet black hair and hazel eyes that reminded Neville strangely of a photograph from his father's collection the picture has been labeled on the back as James Frank and Remus , Finalists in the international charms crafting competition, Another has been a photograph of his mother and a woman with red hair that looked about 17 labeled on the back Alice and Lily winner of the international Charms competition, It also said my gorgeous girlfriend some thing that had made Neville blush slightly when he read it Not he understood the feeling. Just that he knew his father had loved his mum.... He had stolen his two photographs, From the collection along with a picture from his parents auoror Graduation both of them grinning at each other smiling and looking deeply in love.

It had made him wonder How different his life would've been if they could've raised him. But that wasn't the matter at hand when they had arrived one of the children in the receiving line of the orphanage the black haired boy with the hazel eyes had Grinned wickedly at him when Nevillehad noticed The chocolate frog hidden in his right hand the boy had nodded at him as he and his grandmother has passed.

Neville Had been told to amuse himself for the next hour by his grandmother to maybe go and speak to the children but most of the orphans had vacated the area retreating back to whatever rooms or hidden amusements that only the residence of the builder k new about. None of the boys and girls concern themselves with the strange possible squib, That had turned up with the snooty adults that would doubtlessly fund their future accommodations not that Neville blamed them. Fundraisers were never fun and he wasn't particularly interesting if you asked him his opinion.

He most likely as he was starting to think subconsciously would never manifest any form of magic so the odds of any of the meeting at Hogwarts were minimal. So Neville couldn't blame them for not giving him a second thought, Before going back to what they wanted to be doing. He Found himself after a few minutes of walking aimlessly at a playground behind Prescott House Neville noticed it was completely empty a ghost town, Most likely the children had heard him coming. He frowned and sighed mentally Before kicking the rock directly in front of him and he heard a shout.

Neville forced his eyes up Searching for the source of the shout. The black haired boy from earlier was walking toward him looking a little bit angry. The boy stomped toward him, Continuing to show as he grew closer nevilest finally understood him, “ Don't kick the rocks you'll agitate the gnomes,in The playground.”

Just as the boy reached garden gnomes began to pour from every possible location the angry creatures running toward them the black haired boy Seized Neville by his shirt sleeve and begin to drag him behind him as he broke out into a one. Half screaming over his shoulder, “ Run mate. if you want to preserve the current state of your buttocks.”

Neville half tripping, Half running Took a few moments to understand the situation before processing it enough to continue running at a faster pace making the boy with the black hair slightly surprised he could keep up. The two children ran through the door never had just walked through minutes before the black haired orphan slamming it behind them but catching one of the gnomes hats in the door jam making the creature screaming profanity at them in a high pitch squeaky tone. As The tiny bloodthirsty creature attempted to free it's bonnet from its doorway prison. The two boys collapsed gasping for breath a few feet into the hallway both of them dropping down heaving from the exertion they looked at each other the black haired orphan and the Longbottom Scion, While the angry gnomes attempted to be on the glass of the doorway.

The two boys did what any children would after surviving a near death experience by the skin of their teeth and with buttocks intact. They began to laugh.

The Two 10-year-olds descended into hysterical cackles. That lasted for a minute until they both were out of breath again but for an entirely different reason. The black haired boy with the Hazel eyes looked at his new companion and said, “ Bloody hell mate, you have a death wish or something, The signs are everywhere don't go into the playground or the gnomes will get you there every 10 feet how do you even get the door open. That was bloody madness.”

Neville just blink at the strange boy in front of him, Before saying ,” Rather morosely, “ The door just opened for me.”

Making the other boy laugh, The black haired boy finally said, “ Well then mate , I guess you've got a knack for magical lock picking then. Those doors are warded because of the infestation, That's what the fundraiser is about to get rid of the gnomeS so we can use the playground again. Do you ever do accidental magic strong enough to unlock wards cast by a curse breaker before,friend.”

Neville just looked at him, Before shaking his head not daring to believe he had somehow unlockEd the door Using magic he was starting to doubt he had.

The boy across from him just smiled wickedly and said,,” Doesn't matter anyway we both made it out all right. Don't think I caught your name. I'm James Potter , Though most call me Jaime most days.”

Neville, Still remotely lost and dazed at the prospect of having performed magic and his near death experience via Nome Legion, Just said on auto pilot, “ Neville Longbottom” And stuck out his hand for a polite introduction as his grandmother had trained him since he was seven.
