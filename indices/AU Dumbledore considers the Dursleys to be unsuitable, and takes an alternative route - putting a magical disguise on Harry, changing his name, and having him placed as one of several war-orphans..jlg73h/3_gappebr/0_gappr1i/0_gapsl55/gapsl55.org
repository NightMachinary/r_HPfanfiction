There are some spelling/grammar/formatting things (as well as a few paragraphs being repeated in the first comment), but I love the world building and characters! In a little over 10K characters, you have dragged me into this world and I don't want to leave! I love how Neville and Harry meet, and I wonder how it will change Harry's Hogwarts days. However, I think that his last name being Potter is a bit obvious, if Dumbledore's goal was to disguise his identity (Potter is a common name, but wizards will probably put two and two together and realize that Jaime Potter is The Boy Who Lived).
