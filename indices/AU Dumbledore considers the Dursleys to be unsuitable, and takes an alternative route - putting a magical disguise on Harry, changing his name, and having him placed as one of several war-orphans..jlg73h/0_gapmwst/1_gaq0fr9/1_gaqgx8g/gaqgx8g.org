  I'd rather have Harry be abused than have him and whoever adopted him murdered.

Why? Dumbledore literally dumped Harry on the doorstep "Welp, sorry for the ten dark years ahead of you my boy!" and walked off. Not even checking on the savior of Magical Britain.

No. You wait until a reasonable hour and knock on the door. Explain what happened. Have someone regularly check up on him. COUGH Remus COUGH COUGH Interact with the kid. If all else fails, you potion/spell/threaten the adults. Not leave a kid to abuse.

No, Dumbledore draws the line at keeping abusive muggles in line to keep a boy from being abused.
