To be /entirely/ fair, I think you're supposed to take negative-evidence for that one - "if the protections hadn't worked, Voldemort would have offed Harry while he was holed up in Privet Drive. Harry's still alive, therefore the protections must have worked".

This would be fine, except that there are myriad other reasons for Death Eaters to not go to Privet Drive. Simple opportunism, wanting the killing to be public, waging a war against all of Wizarding Britain and simply biding one's time for that particular strike...
