After all the crap Harry had to go through there? Negative evidence just makes him putting up with it for the majority of his life feel meaningless.

It's more for validation. For Harry's AND Dumbledore's sake. It would make Harry feel better. And Dumbledore look like less of a... an uncaring so and so.

There's a movie called /Would You Rather(2012)./ The protagonist goes through a torturous (literally tortured) gameshow to get enough money for her brother's medical treatment. I'll twist the plot here a bit for this example (so no spoilers): Imagine winning (with great suffering on your part), heading home and finding out your brother had a miraculous recovery? Yeah, that's how I would feel every time Dumbledore says Harry has to go back and there's no evidence to support Dumbledore's reasoning.

Fanon does have some things right. The magical world is kinda sheep-like. With nobody to point them around, they will just putter about until things boil over again. And everyone falls victim of the "But everyone says-" excuse.

Edit: Holy crap, I submitted by accident and got distracted... ANYWHO~ continuing.

It's just as valid for ALL of the bad guys (Death Eaters, Blood Purists, and even Voldemort himself) to go "Dumbledore has to have put countless protections on Potter. We'll have to strike somewhere else." When in reality, the "protections" are either not worth much (they are charged by him being there ~1-1.5 MONTHS a year), uber serious wards that ONLY work against Voldemort, or they aren't even working because of the Dursley's treatment of him. Then you have someone like Umbridge who sends in a third party: dementors. See? She tried, she got the information very easily.
