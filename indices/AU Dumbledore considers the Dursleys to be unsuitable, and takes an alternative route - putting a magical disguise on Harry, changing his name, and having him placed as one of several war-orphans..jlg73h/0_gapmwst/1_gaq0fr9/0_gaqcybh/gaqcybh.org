What would have helped is if something was actually /shown/ of the protections on Privet Drive. Being unable to be found by Death Eaters is all well and good, but no-one's ever shown as looking particularly hard - at least not until Harry leaves for the last time (which is also, conveniently, the time when Voldemort just regained enough of a foothold to actually prioritize going after Harry).

That makes it seem like the protections weren't really worth it, and thus a lot of "Harry leaves the Dursleys and everything gets better" fics are born.
