I don't think that it was really that crazy to leave Harry with the Dursley's. Voldemort has already proven more than capable of bypassing conventional magical protection, and I'd rather have Harry be abused than have him and whoever adopted him murdered.

That isn't to say that there aren't plenty of other plot holes around why Dumbledore did or didn't do certain things, but I'm just not convinced that this is one of them.
