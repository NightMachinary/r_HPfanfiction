Or Dumbledore could have just thought the Dursley's would be normal people and not abuse their nephew. They were his closest living relatives, if Harry had been a muggle and his parents had in fact died a car crash, the British government also would have tried placing him with them and if they accepted never checked on him after unless someone reported something. Dropping him off without talking to them is sketchy, but it also happened that way to make the scene seem like a fairy tail and be mysterious. Not because Rowling was in depth thinking through what a realistic Dumbledore character would actually do, so I'm fine just give that scene a pass as the author not really considering the implications personally.
