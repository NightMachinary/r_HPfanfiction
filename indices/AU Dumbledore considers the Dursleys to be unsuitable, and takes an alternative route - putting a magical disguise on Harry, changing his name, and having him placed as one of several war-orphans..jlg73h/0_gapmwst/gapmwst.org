I can imagine the introduction that would allow this to happen:

Dumbledore- preoccupied with the war, doesn't notice that Fawkes was due for a burning day. Deciding to take him down with him to the Great Hall for breakfast goes down the stairs. Fawkes initiates his burning day, startling Dumbledore into falling down the staircase to his office, hitting his head.

BOOM! He hits his head. Then he takes a more sensible approach to the Halloween problem.
