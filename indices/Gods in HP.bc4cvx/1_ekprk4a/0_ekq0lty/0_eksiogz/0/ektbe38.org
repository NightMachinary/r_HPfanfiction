Ah, interesting. Although, to keep playing Devil's advocate... it's a point in the theory's favor, yes, but not necessarily a ringing endorsement; could this not simply be another case of witches and wizards naming themselves /after/ deities, much like Minerva McGonagall (who clearly isn't actually the goddess Minerva)?
