Some of the things that make me cringe/get annoyed that I can think of off the top of my head;

Characters rolling their eyes, especially more than once. Seriously, I want them to roll out of your head at this point.

Calling eyes 'Orbs' or any other variance of such. Or going on and on about their color/describing them in a multitude of ways, multiple times. Once or twice is enough, if the story line calls for it.

People Smirking more than once in a short period of time. Or at all. Seriously, no.

People chuckling in general.

Hermione being constantly described as inquisitive/curious/etc. We get it, she's bookish and smart.

People having long, unnecessary conversations with the Sorting Hat.

Saying/Believing that only Slytherins are prejudice. I don't need to remind y'all about how Ron and Hagrid talked about how only evil witches/wizards are Slytherin/All Slytherins are evil/bad/prejudice.

Any others that I think of later, I'll add.
