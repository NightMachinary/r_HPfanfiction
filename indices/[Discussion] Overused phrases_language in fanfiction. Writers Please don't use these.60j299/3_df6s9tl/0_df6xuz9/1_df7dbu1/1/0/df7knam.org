Not really. Basic Psychology says that humans don't change easily when it comes to their baser personality. If you're a creative person, that is always coming up with ingenious things, chances are that ten years down the road, you will still be doing that. If you're the type of person that will drag the rug out from under people's feet to get what you want, chances are that you will still be that person ten years down the road (Example: Most Millionaires). And so on and so forth. I find that we almost never change, we just become ourselves even more, and that is where the hat puts you. A place where you will fit, even ten years down the road. This is why the Hat wanted to place Harry in Slytherin, he never fit in Gryffindor, no matter how much he tried, he just happened to have two friends that didn't fit as much as he did.
