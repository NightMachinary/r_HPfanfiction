I see what you're saying. It's like the Houses are metaphors that everyone who went to Hogwarts "gets." That makes sense. I was thinking more of scenarios where an early 30s W/W character reconnects with, say, Theodore Nott and thinks, "Ah ha, although I didn't know Theodore at all at Hogwarts, since he was in Slytherin he must cunning and ambitious." I see a lot of stories where the characters see each other through the lenses of their House identities way past the age where that seems reasonable. As a plot device it is a short-hand way of developing characters, since the reader will know what it means to be a Slytherin. It is this short-hand that I think fanon has adopted widely in fics.
