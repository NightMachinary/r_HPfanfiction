I see houses as a big part of a wizard's identity. They spend 7 years in them, make most of their friends there, and probably use their contacts to network later in life. That and the clichees the house qualities are means I don't see anything wrong with many people using the houses to classify others - even though it's wrong.

My Sirius, for example, will often think "typically Slytherin" when someone is cowardly, cunning, treacherous, or whatever else he takes issues with, while my Dumbledore doesn't think in those categories, knowing better.
