It makes a lot of sense, especially if you treat it as a cultural thing. Remember that the houses were founded by some of the most famous wizards around. Calling someone a Ravenclaw is like us calling someone an Einstein. Calling someone a Gryffindor is like calling someone a Beowulf. A Hufflepuff would be a MLK, and a Slytherin would be an Augustus. But then the trick is that everyone else adopts them as sort of patrons, so Slytherin for example gets painted with the same brush as Nixon, Rockefeller, and Dick Cheney.
