The houses are somewhat like college fraternities, I think. Membership is often "inherited" from their parents, with the alumni taking an interest in the house - like when Malfoy bought the new brooms for the Slytherin Quidditch Team.

And yes, people tend to form groups very easily - many experiments show that. What's the saying: Me against my brother, us two together against our cousin, all three of us against the world?
