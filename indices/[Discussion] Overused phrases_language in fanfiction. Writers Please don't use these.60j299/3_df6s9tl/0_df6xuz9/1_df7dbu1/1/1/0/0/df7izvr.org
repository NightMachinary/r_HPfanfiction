Very interesting. In the original post I was just trying to open a discussion about banal vocabulary in HP fanfic, and to be honest, the use of the Houses isn't something I mind stylistically. I have a great respect for those of you who write, and I appreciate the effort you put into worldbuilding.

I became interested in this debate about the House identities because of the broader resonances it has across the JKR's magic world. Since basically 99% of W/W in UK go to Hogwarts, every magical person has some connection to a House and knows how that House differs from the other three. The annual House cup competition reinforces the positive and negative aspects of having a non-biological magical "family." In fandom I've never run across any racist wizards per se; instead we see divisions along the lines of pure-blood, half-blood, muggle-born and squib. So we have these two identity frameworks - blood status and House status - that inform the way British W/W relate to the world around them. In fiction, as in life, it is human nature to seek ways to differentiate Self-Other.
