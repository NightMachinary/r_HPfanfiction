Well yes of course they would change even in their seven years, also isn't it canon that those houses are for those personality traits? So I wouldn't say it was fanon that made them that way. I'm just saying when someone thinks of Slytherin they will most likely thing of cunning/ambition because they spend seven years (or less when they are still in school) being told Slytherin is Cunning/Ambitious. I'm not saying that they will only be what their house is. I'm saying that when someone things/talks about a house they will think what that house embodies.
