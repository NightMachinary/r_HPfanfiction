I think it's interesting that fanon has basically codified the idea that Hogwarts houses as a source of identity follow wizards/witches (w/w) for the rest of their adult lives. You would think that by the time w/w are in their 30s, they wouldn't maintain this mental model that say, Susan Bones is hard-working because a hat put her in Hufflepuff over 20 years ago! I guess as a plot device the house-based identities provide a framework for maintaining canon personalities post-Hogwarts. But it's like, get over it.
