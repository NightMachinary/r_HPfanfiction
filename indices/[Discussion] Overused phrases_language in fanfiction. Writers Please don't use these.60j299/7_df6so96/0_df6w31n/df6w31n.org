Hmmm I rather disagree about the last two.

Having read at this point hundreds of novel length fanfictions I'm definitely over the Serious/Sirius joke but when an author is writing their fanfiction I think it would be wrong to take out a joke that has such a strong link to both canon and also Sirius as a character simply so jaded fanfiction readers don't have to read it again.

Is an author really meant to target their work to the few that have read the amount that we have? Shouldn't the author be writing their story as if someone hasn't read something like it before? I think you would agree that if you had never read a story with the Serious / Sirius joke in it, then you would appreciate it.

It's definitely a problem unique to fanfiction as opposed the literacy world as a whole, you have hundreds of authors and stories all of which are based off of the same characters so of course parts of those characters are going to come across as overdone. But should you really gut a part of a character simply because readers might have read it before? I think not.

As for roman numerals as chapters I fail to see how that could frustrate you in the slightest. Is there really any difference to you seeing Chapter VI and Chapter 6? If anything I prefer the VI.
