The first sequel was in game of thrones and was honestly kinda shitty too. Loads of weird messages and somewhat edgy too. But the newest sequel is in WoW and is pretty decent, a lot less obscure political messages and more actual story, it helps that Harry has already been a god so he doesn't re-tread that path.
