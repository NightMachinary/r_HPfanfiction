That abomination has a sequel??? I'll hand it to the author, he writes because he wants to write despite what anyone else thinks and I do find that kind of tenacity admirable. But still, wow! And that's coming from someone who enjoyed HPMOR, My immortal and other things that almost everyone finds awful (although I'm not sure if my immortal counts as proof because my enjoyment of it was marveling at how terrible it was in terms of plot, execution, grammar, and maturity in the authors notes)
