Nope. I read it, I enjoyed it and I don't think there was anything like that in it. In my opinion, it was a well-written fic. Harry was mostly rational, and he's a pseudo-scientist, smart, but cocky and arrogant in the beginning. Later, it bites him in the ass. Hard. It delivers plot twists well. It explores some pretty interesting topics and philosophy. I can see how some might not enjoy that though.
