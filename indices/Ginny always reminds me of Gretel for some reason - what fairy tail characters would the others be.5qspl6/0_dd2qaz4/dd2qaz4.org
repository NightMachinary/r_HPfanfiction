Ginny reminds me of Red Riding Hood, personally- naive girl gets stalked by a predator and when she starts asking questions of her suspiciously acting 'trustworthy' grandmother, the wolf jumps out and eats her. And then the woodcutter/Harry comes along later to cut her out of the wolf's stomach/stab the diary and save her life.
