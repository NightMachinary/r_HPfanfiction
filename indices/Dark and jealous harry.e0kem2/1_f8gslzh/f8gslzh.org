  Everyone writes ron as being overly jealous...Why shouldnt harry be overly jealous
#+end_quote

Because a huge part of Ron's character is defined by his insecurities; Harry is, in large part, defined by his orphan status.

As it was already pointed out, this is prime for an unlikable character the readers hate. You have to make him sympathetic, so you'd have to make his jealousy revolve around his greatest desire: family.

The problem here is that there are a ton of people around to give the BWL a family and a Dumbledore written with the intelligence/wisdom he's said to have would try to give him one.
