How about an AU where it is recognised that Lily stopped voldemort, not harry. In this au, harry is brought up believing he has some "divine right" because he is the savior's son. His jealousy revolves around the fact that most people are aware enough to see he is nothing. He is jealous of everyone being good at something. (Lily and James still die, but lily is hailed "the woman who sacrificed or something")
