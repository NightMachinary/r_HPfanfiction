you can do a lot more with the maze, have the sphinx give them a pop quiz instead of one riddle, or have them collect several words for an incantation that will ultimately do nothing.

going off that last idea, have them collect pieces of a wooden golem throughout the tasks which will give them a spell to unlock a certain part of the maze, but there are 3 locks with different counterspells and the champions will have to duel each other for them
