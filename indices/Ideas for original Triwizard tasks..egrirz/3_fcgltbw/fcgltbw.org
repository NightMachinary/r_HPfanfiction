Well, inspiration-wise, I'd say start with the fact that the tournament is supposed to be both a display and a test. Goblet picks the best of the applicants, they do the tasks to prove it and entertain people. So, every task should be difficult and require them to do something people can watch (something canon failed dismally at). I'd say the next part is just finding a combination of two things - what it tests and how it tests them.

You could make it physical (test of fitness or adroitness), magical (cast a big spell or solve a problem with magic), technical (in a sense of requiring specialist interaction or knowledge, not electrical engineering), logical (riddles or logic-puzzles), intuitive (poker-game type thinking), artistic (maybe poetry writing or interpretive dance as part of a ritual), Chance (playing with probability or games of chance, or some kind of Leap of Faith choice), willpower/stamina (how long you can do a thing), emotional literacy (knowing what you're feeling and dealing with it properly, eg. with Dementors), an arcane test of mind/belief (think the Gate from D&D: Scourge of Worlds or the Grail from Indiana Jones), preparation (like the Golem thing in The Lie I've Lived), intellectual (needing to have read a thing or studied a thing to complete it, eg. Norse Poetry has these metaphor/rhyming-slang things called 'Kennings' that you'd not get without knowledge of the myth they represented, like 'Otters Ransom' meaning Gold after a myth in which a sum of gold was paid after Loki killed an Otter brother of some dwarves), creative (having to make something to impress a judge), morality (doing what's right even when everything is telling you to do something else), etc.

Then think about whether a task should be cooperative, person vs. environment (fight through a place to get somewhere/thing), a gated competition (do this to get to the next bit!), speed-trial/race, person vs. person (duelling), randomised (one person gets a Dragon, the other gets a mermaid, or wind and water, etc), with tools or without, etc.

Find a cross-section of the two and you'll get some inspiration, I think. I'd also recommend looking into puzzle games and such stories. Apologies if that's quite over-detailed or long, I've been running D&D games for a decade now and it tends to seep into near everything I do. :)

One of the main parts of the 'Indy' in Indy!Harry is him distancing himself from the canon world - his authority figures in Dumbledore and McGonagall, his friends in Ron and Hermione, his 'home' (such as it is) in the Dursleys, or his culture/nation in Magical Britain. So, find a way to integrate him. Maybe his power comes with unavoidable responsibilities, or he can only get more by working with a local spellcrafter or ritual-person to boost himself, or he uses his power to teach, etc etc. Anything that socially binds him to the world.

In terms of financial or resource-independence, make him have to do something that needs other people to weigh in on. Like Novocaine, he decides to repair the Wizarding world with his fortunes and mansions and whatnot and brings in other people with specialisms to help him out.
