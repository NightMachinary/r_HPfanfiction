I was actually planning on keeping the canon tasks, just editing them slightly and maybe making it one part of a longer task (though, now that you mention it, I probably should have some kind of visual spell or something so the spectators can see what's going on) and just adding more tasks. Not too many, but again, maybe I could make the tasks longer.

I don't mind the length at all. This'll really help. Thank you.
