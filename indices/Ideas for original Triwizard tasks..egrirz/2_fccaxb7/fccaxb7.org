I've always liked the idea of a task which is more than just a physical feat. For example, one where the champions all have to face their biggest fear or worst memory in front of a crowd.

You could have the first task be purely physical like in canon, the second mental, and the third maybe philosophical? Like the kobayashi maru from Star Trek, which was used to demonstrate leadership in a no win scenario.
