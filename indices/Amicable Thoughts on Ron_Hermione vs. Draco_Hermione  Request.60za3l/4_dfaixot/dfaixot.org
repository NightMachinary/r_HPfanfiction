  Case in point: he still holds a childish grudge against Malfoy 19 years after the war and makes semi-prejudiced comments on how Rose's granddad would never forgive her for marrying a pureblood.

That is a joke making fun of pureblood prejudices. I've made similar jokes making fun of racial prejudices. For example, back when I was in high school, I would cross the street when white people were walking towards me, or locked my car doors as they were walking by my car. Me as a white dude doing that is equivalent to Ron making that joke as a Pureblood. Its just taking prejudiced attitudes and resulting behaviors and directing them back at those who hold them as a joke.

Whether he should have said it to a child is another question. I'm sure Hermione would have been more amused by it had he made a similar joke to her instead of in front of and to their child.

I don't really have anything to add to the main discussion really. I don't like R/Hr as a central pairing (as in, I like them together, but I don't want to read a story that is about the two of them) but I don't like D/Hr as any sort of pairing. I agree its definitely better if it happens after the Battle of Hogwarts, though.
