Cursed Child is essentially a fanfiction, and one I have no interest in reading because it takes the use of time turners from being that of a fixed timeline and then allowed them to be used to change the past. Then they changed the past in stupid ways.

I don't think that joke was childish, if anything it falls into dad joke territory. But I don't think it was wise to say to his daughter.

I don't think there is anything wrong with mocking prejudice. I don't do the same kind of stuff that I mentioned anymore, but I will make jokes making funny of racism. Because I think it is something that deserves to be made fun of. But I keep those jokes generic and only say them with like-minded friends. With those who hold racist views, I confront them. You can present the same absurdities in argument form, and people are more likely to get defensive if you are making fun of them, even as indirectly as a generic joke may be.

Which is why I think that the only problem with Ron's joke was the time and the place.
