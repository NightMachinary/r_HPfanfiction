I'll preface this by noting that Ron is my favorite character, and R/Hr my favorite ship, so you are aware that I am coming at this from what is very likely a biased angle, but I will try to set my prejudices aside.

  Case in point: he still holds a childish grudge against Malfoy 19 years after the war and makes semi-prejudiced comments on how Rose's granddad would never forgive her for marrying a pureblood.

[[/u/iamspambot]] said it very well, to be quite honest. I don't think there was any malice behind that comment at all, and so I'm hesitant to mark it as some sort of deep-seated hatred or grudge.

You mention that we should not judge a character entirely on their childhood, and I absolutely agree. It's for that reason that I believe that Ron would also mature. As Ron grows, we see someone who is deeply flawed, yet deeply loyal. We get a window into his insecurities from the beginning, as he tells Harry about his family on that first train ride. Those are further expanded upon (and often cause some problems) throughout the series, culminating in the famous locket scene.

The reason I believe that Ron would grow is that, because of his participation in the war, I'd wager he'd finally feel like he was cutting his own path. In addition, he was able to overcome his insecurities regarding Harry and Hermione, feeling like he was the ever-insufficient third wheel. I don't think he'd ever truly beat those flaws and those insecurities, but I do think he'd gradually become better at controlling them.

Draco is a really intriguing character. All we get of him in the epilogue is a curt nod and a shot of him, his wife, and his son, Scorpius. Beyond that, nada.

In the 19 years from May 2, 1998, to September 1, 2017, we know nothing of the changes that may have occurred in Draco's life, beyond the evident, and this makes things slightly more difficult.

I would imagine that the Malfoy family would be heavily affected by the result of the war - after all, they hosted what very well may have been the entirety of the evil's commanding force at some point or another, and I cannot imagine that would go unpunished.

I believe that how this was handled by Draco would be the catalyst for his change, or cause him to burrow deeper into the prejudice and hate that Voldemort and co. loved so much. Because of the way he is described, I'm more inclined to agree with you, in the sense that he has come to some sense of maturity and acknowledgement of his prior prejudices.

Draco and Hermione, to me, draw many parallels with Lily Evans and Severus Snape, less the friendship the latter pair had pre-school and during their early years at Hogwarts. I find myself stuck on the moment when Draco calls Hermione a Mudblood. I'll reiterate that I don't think we should judge Draco on this incident, but I also think it's a rather damning moment, in the sense that that's not something someone is wont to forget. In addition, we have the moments in Malfoy Manor and, later, in the Room of Requirement, where Hermione is either tortured heavily (while Draco merely watches), and the battle preceding the Fiendfyre and destruction of the diadem. Both of these, to me, would be pretty hard to move past if I were in Hermione's position.

In addition, we know Hermione is an advocate for the least and the lowest, if SPEW is any indication. As much as Draco could reform, I'd imagine that there would be some long-held prejudices that would be very difficult for him to let go of. We know that Dobby was mistreated rather terribly, and if other house-elfs are any indication, the Malfoys were pretty cruel even by those standards. While this cannot be pinned on Draco, certainly, it does raise some questions, I think.

  A person's sense of self is not inherent though. It's grown and developed by the circumstances surrounding that person and I believe Malfoy's experiences has shaped him into a better person.
#+end_quote

Would it not be that his sense of self is heavily influenced by his parents? By Bellatrix? By the many Death Eaters who passed through that manor?

We can excuse the actions of a child, but that does not mean that what is learned then does not stay with a person.

Ron was raised by very accepting wizards, taught to value people because of who they are as people rather than their blood. He has inherent prejudices, yes - against the Slytherins, most notably, I'd say, but also against house-elves and other "lesser" creatures (though not to the extent of the Malfoy family). Despite this, we also see that he moves past these, and most notably, holds no ill will against people purely on blood status.

Draco was raised in a household that certainly seemed distant every time we interacted with them. We know that he was told things, mostly negative, about families like the Weasleys, given the first interaction between Harry, Ron, and Draco on that first train ride. We're given first-hand accounts of his prejudices in action multiple times.

I'm sorry this got so long-winded - I have a lot of thoughts on this subject, and I do apologize if I ever come off as harsh during this pseudo-rant - not my intent whatsoever, and I do think you've brought up some really intriguing points to consider.

To conclude, rather simply, while I see the merit of what you've been saying, I don't necessarily think that it would be very practical. I think that both men grow post-Hogwarts, but at the end of the day, if we do turn to character examinations, the flaws that rest in Draco Malfoy's persona are far more contradictory than those of Ron Weasley with regard to Hermione Granger and a potential relationship therein.

*/TL;DR/ tbh they're both pretty fucked up, but i think [[/r/hr][r/hr]] is a better catalyst for growth for both characters, and there are some deep-seated issues that make me think d/hr is extremely unlikely - also, i need to get more concise*
