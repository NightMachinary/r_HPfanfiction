I think this discussion brings up all the parallels of their characters, which is what I think JKR meant to show. Both pureblood. Both with their own wizarding prejudices. But one in a more loving family without the ill views on Muggles and so, ended up looking past other prejudices easier. That's why I like Ron with Hermione in the books. I really hope I didn't come off as Ron bashing because as I said, that's something I don't like when talking about Hermione pairings. I like their dynamic in the books and believe it can work. I also initially read his comment on purebloods as a joke until I reread the epilogue after the Cursed Child and thought about how it could run deeper than that. As I mentioned in my other reply, there are consequences to that mentality when raising children. My only point is that these are instances that can show why they may not work out in the very end. But they could also very well work through all of those problems.

And yes, just because Ron and Hermione may not work out, it doesn't mean she would have a better relationship with Draco. I only made the point that she could given his growth and how the fic is written. I'm not shipping her with Draco over Ron. I'm arguing that there is possibility to the pairing. I personally only like reading Dramione more because of the creativity in how the writer can believably construct their relationship. I already know how it can with Ron, so I'm not particularly interested in their pairing beyond the books. (Weirdly, I do like reading Harry and Ginny fics though.)

I also don't think Hermione would be the type to hold Malfoy's past against him. But again, she could be. Malfoy kept using Mudblood because that's what he was taught, but I think seeing his aunt carve that word in Hermione would make him rethink ever using it again. Had he stopped Bellatrix, he would have gotten both her and him killed. Hermione also did not know the impact of that word when she first heard it; Ron had to explain. She was never greatly affected by it but she was still frustrated that Malfoy used a term like that. She was never shown to hold a grudge even prior to his faltering allegiance. While she stuck up for herself around Malfoy, she chastised Harry and Ron for talking down on him. She made sure he got to the hospital after Buckbeak and noticed his failing health during HBP. I don't think she ever hated him as the boys did. Yes, she didn't like him but she never showed resentment. If he demonstrates he has truly grown as a person, she could possibly like him. Slowly.
