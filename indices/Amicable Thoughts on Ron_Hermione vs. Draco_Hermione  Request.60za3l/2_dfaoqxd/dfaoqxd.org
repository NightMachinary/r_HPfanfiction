Hr/D is a joke kept afloat by the fact that the actor is pretty and this weird belief people have that risque, passionate sex can only be had with a 'bad boy' like Malfoy.

That said, a v. good author can still make it work, as long as they don't ignore the profound tensions inherent in the pairing, or handwave the conflict away somehow.

Ron/Hr is canon, but honestly, not that plausible. For me, the ideal post-book 7 (minus epilogue) Ron would be shagging his way through the years. But, unfortunately, ff authors find it difficult to write those sort of relationships without utilizing 'true love' or 'harem' tropes.
