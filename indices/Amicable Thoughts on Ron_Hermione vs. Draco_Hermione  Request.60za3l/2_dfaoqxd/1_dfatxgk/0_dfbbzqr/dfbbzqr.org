No, just no. The interview suggested Ron/Hermione could have issues in their relationships and in some ways Harry and Hermione were more compatible. She never said it should've been Harry/Hermione. Rowling is very clear that H/G and R/Hr make the most sense, and she is right. Just reading the series makes it abundantly clear that H/G is a much better relationship and H/Hr would simply not work because they are not very compatible (in fact, reading through the series, the two don't even come across as people who'd be friends if not for the war and Ron being around).
