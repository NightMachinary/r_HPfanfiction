I like that. Someone who's a combination of the best traits of the two. Everything is postulation. I was trying to present an argument supporting the writers who choose the Draco and Hermione pairing because it seems that people are so against it that they dismiss sometimes truly amazing authorship that addresses their conflicts and make it work. I think that's why I like post-Hogwarts since there's more wiggle room to interpret how they could have grown up that could still be in line with canon. Other than the epilogue that is.
