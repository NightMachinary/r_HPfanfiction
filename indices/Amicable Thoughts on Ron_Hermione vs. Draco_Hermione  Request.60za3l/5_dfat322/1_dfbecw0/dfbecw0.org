  I don't think the complement each other very well because Hermione seems to overwhelm Ron's own growth as a person. He's stunted in that sense when she's around because he's comfortable around her. She's happy to push him around, and he's happy to let her since it often benefits him on the surface level. He's not dependent on her in that he cannot live without her, but she becomes a somewhat convenient crutch for him.

Yes. I think Ron's problem is that he married his mother, in the sense that he gravitated from one pushy woman to another. Don't get me wrong - I quite like Hermione. From having a domineering mother, an easy-going-father, and a bunch of strong-willed siblings, it seems like Ron is accustomed to being subordinate in a relationship.
