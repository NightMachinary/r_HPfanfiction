I think that both Molly and Hermione have strong opinions, excessive energy, big hearts, and the desire to be in charge. In Molly's case these traits manifested as an uber-mother, and she put her energies into family life, raising a brood of children in an economically challenging situation. I think that Hermione channeled these traits into social justice. Both women chose supportive partners who were ok with being subordinate. (Consider the dynamic between Arthur and Molly re: his muggle gadgets, the car, etc.) Yes, Hermione and Ron choose to relate through bickering - though it's this history of carping on each other that always made me question the feasibility of them working out in the long run. In the epilogue as it stands, I always picture Hermione and Molly looking at their respective husbands "fondly," i.e., humoring them, while the women run the show.
