Hmm yes I can see where u come from. It's more that I've always viewed Arthur as the silent power behind the wholee family, smoothing over the little kinks in the family without his wife knowing it. But I guess you're also right in the similarites between Molly and Hermione.

And I don't see the carping on each other as a huge deal. Most couples have arguments, the bickering doesn't even seem to bother them; it certainly bothered Harry, and he even asked them to stop fighting and I think they seemed pretty confused as to what he was even referring to. Bear in mind that we're seeing the whole story in Harry's perspective too, who hasn't had a healthy representation of a normal husband and wife relationship growing up with his aunt and uncle, so these flaws we see in their relationship could also be a byproduct of Harry's own perception towards the way ron and hermione interact.
