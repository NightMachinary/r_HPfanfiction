Hmm just some thoughts on the Ron/Hermione ship. I actually do think Ron helps to ground Hermione like OP said, and he has a more laidback type of personality to counter her more driven one, though he does have leadership qualities he's more of a passive type of character. I do like how in canon, Ron ends up being the one who is more of the nurturing figure at home than Hermione, who is the working parent. But that being said, I don't think the complement each other very well because Hermione seems to overwhelm Ron's own growth as a person. He's stunted in that sense when she's around because he's comfortable around her. She's happy to push him around, and he's happy to let her since it often benefits him on the surface level. He's not dependent on her in that he cannot live without her, but she becomes a somewhat convenient crutch for him.

With regards to Draco, I do think he and Hermione could work in theory; they are both intellectually on par with each other, and would definitely be able to sound off ideas on one another. But in reality, I do think that it's difficult for the two to ever be more than acquaintances or great working partners. They are both insanely competitive and ambitious, stubborn and have a mean streak that would definitely result in spectacular fights.The good thing is that both of them are okay with conflict, similar to RonxHermione (and opposite to Harry's dynamic with her, as he is more conflict avoidant. The bad thing is that meither of them are going to give way easily in an argument about something that really matters to them. It will be a hard road to compromise, something that is key in a relationship.

Romantically, Hermione probably needs someone like Draco AND Ron to be most ideal. It doesn't bode well for a relationship when both parties are as volatile as Hermione and Draco, and it's probably hard to have a home life if both are career minded. He also doesn't ground her, and she'd definitely be less emotionally stable than with Ron, and she could also become overly high strung? All of this is my postulation though.
