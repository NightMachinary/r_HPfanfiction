She was devastated when Ron went out with Lavender. How was that not evidence she had a crush on Ron? During the wedding, she danced with Ron and Krum asked Harry if they were together and he responds "sort of." Harry also made observations of how they fell asleep with hands outstretched towards each other and thought they may have fallen asleep holding hands during their camping throughout DH. And I think she saw the arguments stimulating because when Harry told them to stop, both of them were confused. They didn't see it as arguing. Remember, the books are only from Harry's perspective.
