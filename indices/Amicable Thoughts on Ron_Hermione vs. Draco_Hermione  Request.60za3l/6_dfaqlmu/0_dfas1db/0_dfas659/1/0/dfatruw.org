So Ron defending her automatically means they're meant to be together? I don't understand that rationale.

Also, Ron/Hermione only seems to start being foreshadowed during HPB and so forth. So the whole "it's been in the books since the beginning" point is pretty much moot.

I feel like people use protecting someone like a sister, and calling them smart on occasion, as some kind of calling card for people to automatically get married.

  its Ron (and not so much Harry) who comes to her defence.

When has Harry ever said anything that wasn't convenient to his plot? Also, I seem to recall Harry defending Hermione to Horace quite fiercely.
