I chose to discuss these two pairings since Ron is the canon pairing and Draco is the pairing I like reading. I could have chosen to talk about others.

I make the argument that I don't ship her with Draco over Ron, but that given how the fic is written and the instances of growth he has shown, it is possible that Hermione could slowly like him. Because she would have grown and he would have grown, both possibly to a point that complements each other. A good writer would address all of these issues. My thoughts mainly come from Rowling's writings on Pottermore. Not Cursed Child. But given that I said I like post-Hogwarts fics, there will be a lack of true evidence because there isn't much canon at all for those years. So yes, of course I'd be lacking.

Rowling did develop Ron and Hermione's relationship throughout the books. Hermione had a crush but it was not until Ron came around with his feelings did she act on it. She finally kissed him in that moment, but they were clearly in some sort of relationship during DH. She may have initially like him just because she was young but I do think she found that she enjoyed her banter with him. Hermione could have liked Harry, but I always saw them as siblings. Harry never really showed that he liked her company without Ron around and Hermione didn't have the same push and shove stimulus with Harry than she did with Ron. Harry even blew up at their little bickering. I think she likes the small arguments. I feel like your perception of Harry and Hermione's relationship is distorted by the movies. They don't hug that much. I did think Ron was sometimes callous in making fun of her and why I think it could present problems later on if his insecurities arise. However, I think they would be a good first relationship to learn from one another. You can read more on other threads if you're interested in expanding your outlook on their relationship.
