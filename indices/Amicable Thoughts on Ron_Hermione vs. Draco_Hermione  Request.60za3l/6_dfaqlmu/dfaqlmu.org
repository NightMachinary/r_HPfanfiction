  I love Ron and Hermione as in the books.

Let me stop you right there. Why do you love the pairing? In all honesty, why do you like a half-baked pairing with almost no development? The most common arguments I hear for this pairing is, "Oh, Ron was just being mean because he liked her. It's common knowledge that if a boy picks on you, he likes you." No, that isn't how it works in the real world, people are mean because they're mean, because they are annoyed by a specific person or their actions, that's like saying the common excuse for bullying, "Boys will be boys", when it is simply untrue. Then you get events in the fourth book, that show Ron is a person who enjoys being in control in a relationship, having say, deciding when/what to do. Meanwhile, Hermione is that exact same person, only less lazy, and more willing to be active. So you have two polar opposites, that are somehow supposed to attract from their emotional disagreement and moral disagreement of each other?

  The reason Hermione finally kissed him during the war is because she believed he showed growth past his prejudices (against werewolves, giants, trolls, house-elves throughout the years) when he mentioned saving the Hogwarts elves;

Hmm, if she liked someone based on their lack of prejudices, then why didn't Hermione just go with Harry from the beginning? He literally freed a house-elf, was friends with a half-giant and didn't even care when he found out, his uncle was a werewolf that almost killed him yet he still held no prejudice against werewolves, etc... Not to mention the amount of 'tender' moments they had together, with the "You're a great wizard, you know", to the multiple long hugs whenever they met for the first time.

As for Draco, the argument for him is even thinner. He was essentially an ugly coward that couldn't stand up for himself, he was in the most well-guarded building in Magical Britain, yet didn't think to ask Dumbledore to protect his family by having them all held in Hogwarts. So we are left with what? The fact that he endangered the lives of school children who were too young to understand who the Death Eaters were? The fact that he got the last hope of the wizarding world, killed?

Your evidence for his change is based on the fanfiction that is Cursed Child, and a singular scene from the Epilogue. Also, who says that both of them do hold any liking for each other? Draco has a list of Pureblood girls that he can wed, who are likely ten times better looking than Hermione, with the same temperament as himself. With someone as superficial as Draco, I doubt he would care much about Hermione, nor her views on things.
