I hardly think it's still a childish grudge when you literally went to war against the ideology and person in question. And really, it was a mild jab, not a bone deep personal feud. If anything, Ron shows remarkable restraint. This is the man who's family tortured his wife and friends, who was allies to the man responsible for the death of Ron's loved ones and put him through literal hell. Ron, if anything, is being magnanimous.

I personally don't think Hermione could ever be around a canon Draco and especially could not be in a relationship with him. She was literally tortured in Draco's house, and saw friends and family cut down by Draco's allies. It would be the equivalent of a Jew marrying a Nazi party official after WW II. Sure, the party official may deeply regret his role and may even grow from it and become a better person, but that still doesn't mean that they would ever be comfortable around one another.

I can see a lot of other ships making sense, but shipping any Death Eater or Death Eater family with any of the main trio or their allies just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It wasn't a school feud you can grow up and get over. They tried to kill each other, and in some cases they even succeeded. Any relationships would be at the very least, fraught with tension and mistrust.
