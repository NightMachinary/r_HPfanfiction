Eh, I wouldn't have a problem with coming from a DE family if it is someone who didn't actively help them. Such as if Draco went to Dumbledore in the sixth book instead of help murderous terrorists into a school. So...basically if Draco was like Sirius, and rebelled against the family instead of embraced it.
