Minor spoilers

It's not. I don't think it's as good as Sarcasm & Slytherin, which shares like half of the plot points, but it definitely isn't a pure let's insult all the good guys. They aren't nice to them, but in this world, there is a definite reason for their actions, because there's a different prophecy. Now, I've got my own issues with characters like Dumbledore taking prophecies seriously, but it's not done out of idiocy. They present the characters as actual characters making these decisions. With how much I spoiled above I won't get into it too much, but the point is that Harry is a kid. A talented kid, but still a kid, who very much needs to learn. That's a strong point. If you like good Peter, you won't get it, and no bad Sirius either, as he's still made it to Azkaban. While it has flaws, I still think it's worth reading, and at least earns the title of decent.

For a fic I recommend on the lines of the kind of drawn-out world and Voldemort being a legit character that you want, I'd recommend The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali, which isn't finished, but has a good first 19 chapters. It's an evil Dumbledore, and the author has some annoying writing quirks (in my opinion) but shines in Harry's characterization.

edit: I agree with the guy above about every other point though, and I hate it now. yay

I hope this helped
