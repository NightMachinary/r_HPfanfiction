That's what irritates me the most. I don't hate it totally but, seriously. And it's not just there is no dark magic. It's 'there is no good or evil, only power,' which, if you ever hear anyone say, make a quick exit, they're probably evil. Those who reject the existence of any form of evil, subjective, objective or anything, are 87.345% likely to be a dark lord. Harry's just here, and occasionally being a supervillain, and we're supposed to go, 'yep, I'll root for this guy.' I'm willing to say that there is no light or dark magic if I have to, but no way can I say that a character rejecting all morality for the pursuit of power as an eleven-year-old is reasonable. It's like they read the Voldemort speech in the first book, and didn't understand that good and evil didn't mean light and dark. It's so dumb! I don't get how they wrote that! Are they going for Harry being a hypocrite, as in his own moral system he has a concept of good and evil which he judges those around him with, but at the same time claims a lack of morality in order to prevent guilt from his pursuit of power for an inherently selfish goal of his own assured freedom at the expense of everyone around him. This leading to a conflict with himself which creates tension as he tries to construct a moral system which he can follow in a world where he wasn't allowed any goal beyond his own freedom. And I've put more thought in than the author, who uses it as a throwaway quote without any explanation.
