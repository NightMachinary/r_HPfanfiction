I think it is kind of worse than that. From what I remember, there are mandatory 11-years old children acting like politicians, Harry is of course more powerful than almost everyone else, everyone invites him for social gatherings and so on, and on top of that there is this super powerful OC noble family that takes liking to him, invites him for their parties, and their super powerful daughters take a liking to him as well and tutor him.

Oh, and the story has almost half a million words and it's still in the second year.

And on top of that, if I'm not mistaken, there is the obligatory 'there is no dark magic, there is only intent' speech on the first DADA lesson.

But still, there's no harm in trying out at least a chapter or two
