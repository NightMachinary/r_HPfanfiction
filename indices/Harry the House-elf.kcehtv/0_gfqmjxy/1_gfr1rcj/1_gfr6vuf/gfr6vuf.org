Lucius was discarding the sock as trash. There's a reasonable argument that, implicitly, anyone who caught it was welcome to it. If he'd said, "Dobby, incinerate this," and then thrown it to him, then perhaps it would not have worked the same way.

I tend to agree with turbinicarpus that handing an elf a pile of clothes that clearly remain the property of the master, not for the elf to be allowed to wear, would not qualify.
