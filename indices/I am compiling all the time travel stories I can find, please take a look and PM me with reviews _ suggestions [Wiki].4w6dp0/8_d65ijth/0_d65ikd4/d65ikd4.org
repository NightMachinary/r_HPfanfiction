  ONE-SHOT. Vernon Dursley is not willing to take Harry to King's Cross, so that he has to find another way to get to Hogwarts for the Sorting. However, something is strange about this Sorting - and it will have far reaching consequences, even for Albus Dumbledore :D. Completely AU!

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC
