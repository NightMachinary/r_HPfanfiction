The writing is breathtaking. A lot of confusion and whiplashes. Like I have to reread and reread and reread it, because /the hell is going on./ Hermione's portrayal is pretty great and she takes it well considering the impact of the war and losing everyone and having taken to the past wherein there is a young Oldsnakeface.

Not sure, if it qualifies as time travel? More like time loop, but I think the story is amazing enough that it'd suffice. There's soooo many things I love about this. Draco's characterization is the most perfect and true to canon I've read. He's pretty cowardly, spiteful, and says mean things. But yet I can't help but be sympathetic towards him. The pacing is so gradual, how everyday Draco falls more in love with Harry. The tone fits the mood very well, as each day passes by I can feel the urgency and his frustration. His world doesn't revolve around Harry, though. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the realm of the story is beyond most fanfictions I've read.
