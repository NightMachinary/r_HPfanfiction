[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]]

not an actual Harry/Tom or Voldermort romance story. It's more of a, Harry goes back in time, adopts Tom, and everything else is adorable and Lord Black is a creepy pervert.

edit: Also, the fanfiction that made me want to read the original series to fill in the blanks of the story in my head :')

P.S. I dived in with only the bits and pieces to know the gist of the HP plot and came out of the entire fic loving it and wanting to know more of the wizarding world <3
