Come once again and love me by laventadorn

After Snapes death, he gets sent back in time, as does Lily after her death (to their sixth year Christmas hols). There is no explicit content. It's basically a slow burn romance.

The characters are so on point it's a breath of fresh air. Lily has a personality and isn't just a Hermione+Percy. It's the fic that made Snape/Lily seem plausible to me. linkffn(7670834)

Past's Player by The Fictionist

Harry gets sent back to 1942. No slash.

It's the prequel to Fates Favourite and equally brilliant. Tom is a controlling manipulative bastard. The OC's are pretty good too. linkffn(5736901)

I tried checking if these hadn't been recommended but I'm not 100% certain. Hope I helped.
