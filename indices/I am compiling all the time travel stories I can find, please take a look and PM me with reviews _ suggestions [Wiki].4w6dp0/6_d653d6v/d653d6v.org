Harry Potter - Three to Backstep linkffn(10766595) It's a Reptilia28 challenge fic, but in my opinion, it's one of the better ones, it's a good story, with good pacing, and although the romance is rather lacking, it's a fun ride from start to finish. Harry, Hermione, and Daphne Greengrass all travel back in time. Dumbledore and Weasley (RW/GW/MW) Bashing

Harry Potter and the Last Chance linkffn(11922615) -An in progress fic,but probably one of the best Reptilia challenge fics. Harry goes back alone in this one, with its fair share of changed things, a far better romance than most Reptilia challenges, and Weasley bashing that doesn't drag on until the end of time.
