If they knew on their 11th birthday, that would mean that Hermione had a whole year of knowing about magic as her birthday is the 19th of September (but due to age placement, she would have been in year six, the last year of primary school).

/"... It was ever such a surprise when I got my letter..."/

I don't even know if she ever alludes to when she got her letter, but if we look at the majority of the time, I would assume that most muggleborn (First Gen) Hogwarts Acceptance letters would be sent a week after primary school ends for the school year (Around 18-24 June give or take a few days) to allow them time absorb the information and the fact that they won't be going to a secondary school of their choosing.

/"My name was put down for Eton, you know..."/ Justin Finch-Fletchley.

For children of magical descent, they would have been told about magic all their lives (with the exception of Harry) and aware of Hogwarts for most of their childhood. They would get letters sent out at a more regular notice (two weeks before the 31st of July) to allow owls travelling across the U.K (give or take a few useless defense teachers (/HemHem/)).

By the time second years letters arrive, all first gen would get their letters the same time as those born to magicals.

I have no idea if I'm rambling here but this is my take on it.
