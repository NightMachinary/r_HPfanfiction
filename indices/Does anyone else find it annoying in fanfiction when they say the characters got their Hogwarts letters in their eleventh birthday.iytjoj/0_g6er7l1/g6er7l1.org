I think people make mistakes and forget that Harry's Hogwarts letter was only /successfully/ delivered on his birthday. Hundreds were sent before then that failed to reach their intended recipient.

You know, as funny as that sequence is, you'd think that Dumbledore would have taken a hand in ensuring the letter was properly delivered /sooner/, given just how many letters were sent out to ONE %$#%ING STUDENT.
