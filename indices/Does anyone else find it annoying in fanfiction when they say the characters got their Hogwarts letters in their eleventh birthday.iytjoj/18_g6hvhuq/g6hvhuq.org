Honestly, not really. I think it's because I didn't notice until I sat down to figure out the timeline for... It must've been [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10987173/1/Violet-Elizabeth][Grandad Dudley]], an abandoned fic of mine from some years back? But that doesn't make sense? Because I remember doing this more recently? Maybe it was because I did have the letter arrive on Violet's birthday and when I reread it recently I thought that was strange?

It's more a "ah, that's not right" thing than something that annoys me (e.g. wards).
