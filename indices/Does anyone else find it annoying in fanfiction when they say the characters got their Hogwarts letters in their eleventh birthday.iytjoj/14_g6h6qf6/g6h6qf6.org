It doesn't bother me because honestly I forget, too. lol It's a small thing in the long run, and I don't really think about it, but when an author does go out of their way to either be accurate in this sense or do something different (ex. all letters sent out same time the summer before the year) then it's definitely noticeable and appreciated.
