IIRC in extended canon, there was someone (Minerva possibly) that got the letter on her birthday.

My headcanon is that they /used/ to be delivered on one's birthday, but at some point somewhat recently (earlier than Marauder-era, since we know Lily and Severus got their letter the same day rather than 3 weeks apart) it was changed to be delivered during the summer.
