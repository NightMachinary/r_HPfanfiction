It's the same in Austria. I remember one winter when I was about four or five years old my parents and I built an igloo in which my father (about 1.8m) could stand in. It was more snow than usual but not too far out of the range. My parents did the same when they were kids. My little brother (about 8 years younger) could never do that because there never was enough snow. My mothers godson (he is 13) doesn't even remember that there was ever something like a white christmas. It's a little bit scary.
