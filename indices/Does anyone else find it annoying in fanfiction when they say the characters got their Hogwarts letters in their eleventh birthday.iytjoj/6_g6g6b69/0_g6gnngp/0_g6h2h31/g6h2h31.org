That's actually not true. It depends where you are living. For North America your statement would be true because a warmer climate means more active artic stormes that can reach farther south.\\
For me, in middle europe, it means we don't have as snowy winters as we had when I was a kid about 20 years ago but instead rainy decembers. When I was a kid in the 90ies nearly each christmas we had snow. The last white christmas I remember now was in 2008. Its similar for Great Britain.
