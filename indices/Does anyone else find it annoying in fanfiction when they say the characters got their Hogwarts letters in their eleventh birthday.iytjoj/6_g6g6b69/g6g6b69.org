I find that trope very annoying too.

And it's not only book canon where Harry gets his letter before his birthday. In the movie he also get it at least some days before his birthday - there is the scene where Vernon goes to work, the whole "No letters on Sunday"-scene and then the travel scene before Harrys birthday which started at the moment when Hagrid breaks into the hut.

There is also the scene where Dumbledore visits young Tom Riddle. It's raining. If he would have gotten his letter on his birthday that wouldn't make any sense. Tom was born in December and in the thirties there wasn't such a thing as climate change so there should have been snow and not rain.
