She didn't read them. Harry read them (he found Hedwigs name in the history book). Hermione on the other hand learned them by heart and could quote them on the first day of school. She also understood parts of it so well she could perform simple spells before she even entered the train although there were theories in them which were completly foreign for her and her family. That's the difference between a normal child who is exited for a new school (Harry) and a child prodigy (Hermione). Reading two books per week isn't special for a curious kid - knowing them by heart is.
