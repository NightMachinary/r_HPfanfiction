Is reading 2 books per week supposed to be an achievement? It seems to be something that most 11 years old children should be able to do if they really want to. Not to mention someone like Hermione who is friendless (doesn't have anything else to do), really academically oriented (loves to read and is able to do it for hours everyday) and just discovered that magic exists.
