This trope is stupid. Children like Hermione would pose a threat to the Statute of Secrecy (spends one year surrounded by Muggles child while aware of Magic), and others like Ginny (born in August) wouldn't have time to answer the Owl or just prepare for school.

It's not the worst trope out there, but still a bit annoying.
