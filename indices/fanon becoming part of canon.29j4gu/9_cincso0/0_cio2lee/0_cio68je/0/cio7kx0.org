thanks for sharing your recommendations! The Bonds of Blood seems really interesting. def going to check that one out :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384611/1/Fire-Dragon][this]] is the only soul bonding themed story I've read.\\
Fire Dragon: Their friendship was unlikely, but as time went on, she got to know the real person behind the cold mask. Friendship is golden when the world turns black. Take what you can get, and hold on to those you have. Eventual DHr and nonhuman Draco later on.

The bonding doesn't come until later in the story, but I think it has really good plot and character development overall!
