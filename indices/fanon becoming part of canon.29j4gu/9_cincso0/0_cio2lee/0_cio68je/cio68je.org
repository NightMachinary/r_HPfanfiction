There are very few stories that have a great soul bond and a great plot and character development. I've spent a while digging through the rubbish to get to the great stories. To recommend a few:

One of my personal favorites is /the accidental bond/ by kb0 (Harry/Hermione/Ginny/Gabrielle): Harry finds that his "saving people thing" is a power of its own, capable of bonding single witches to him if their life is in mortal danger, with unusual results.

Another would be /HJ Potter/ by S.M wane (H/HR): Who would expect that sharing a simple kiss with his best friend was all it needed to begin a journey far beyond his greatest imagination? Soul-bond fic *link* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter]]

One more is /The Bonds of Blood/ by Darth Marrs (H/G): YASBF Yet Another Soul Bond Fic starting with the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and Ginny have to learn to live with a bond that steals away their privacy and leaves them dependent on each other and frightened for their future. *link* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood]]
