  Fanon: wards. Canon: protected buildings. Seems like the same thing, but in canon there is no dome of power that goes beyond walls. In fanfiction that's basically a requirement. Also runes and wardstones.

Domes of power were pure fanon, until the freaking movies. But those are best ignored as gaudy spectacles. Need something visible after all. But lots of people take movies as canon, so domes of power are, /technically/, canon.

Wards, rune spells and stones, etc, are all fanon, but protections not linked to buildings is /pure/ canon. Hermione casts them first thing on their forest camps in book seven.
