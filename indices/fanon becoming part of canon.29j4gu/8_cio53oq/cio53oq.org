Hmmm.

Fanon: wards. Canon: protected buildings.

Seems like the same thing, but in canon there is no dome of power that goes beyond walls. In fanfiction that's basically a requirement. Also runes and wardstones.

Runes are, at best, a foreign language.

Fanon: Snape is a mind raper Canon: He's a shitty teacher, but who knows how Occlumency can be taught?

Fanon: The Dursleys broke all the laws, especially the act of where the queen loves all of her children 1985. Canon: It's a made up world and Harry suffered the exact amount he needed to to make a good story.

Fanon: Sometimes September 2 is a Sunday. Sometimes it's a Wednesday. Canon: the year has 364 days.
