I recommend that to anyone who wants to read a proper character study in the HP universe. That story has so many tiny details that fit so perfectly with both British culture (and working class poverty) during the 60s and 70s, and is subtly disturbing at how accurate a description that is of the mindset of how untreated abuse during childhood turns a child farther and farther away from a normative mindset...

It's creepy how by the end of the story Snape's minimal love life, emotional detachment, anger issues, and complete and utter disbelief that life could actually be good just seems normal when reading it. It took me an hour of after finishing it to just sit there and go "wait, that's so... reasonable... I didn't even... how did I accept that?"

... and there is absolutely no character bashing. James is actually a decent bloke in seventh year, Lily wasn't a bitch /at all/, Dumbledore tries to be a good father figure so hard, and has the hands-down BEST HAGRID EVER.

And yes, this is the definitive Snape story. JKR should buy the rights for this, hire the writer for all future projects, and publish it.
