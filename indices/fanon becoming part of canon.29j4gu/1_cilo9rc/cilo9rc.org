For me, the character of Severus Snape feels woefully incomplete in canon, which is why my headcanon of him is almost entirely decided by the amazing fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]].

This fic gives his character (as well as those of Eileen Prince and Tobias Snape) a believable backstory which portrays how magic can tear a family apart. The author describes Severus' mindset and motivations in great detail, down to the little things he does to remain in control of himself despite the horrors he witnesses (incidentally, the description of Occlumency is the one that makes the most sense to me).

Moreover, it covers those years after his graduation and before the arrival of Harry at Hogwarts, which are entirely missing from canon. Finally, it explains just how someone suspected of being a Death Eater can remain at Hogwarts, despite the many incidents (e.g. with Karkaroff, Crouch Jr.) that would result in his imprisonment.

Overall a wonderful fanfiction and highly recommended for /any/ fanfiction reader, since it does not conflict with canon and, in my view complements it quite nicely.
