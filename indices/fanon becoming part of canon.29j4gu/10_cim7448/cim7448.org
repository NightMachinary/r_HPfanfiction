I'm convinced that Draco Malfoy was really intelligent. Even though JKR didn't explicitly state it in the books, Draco was clever enough to fix the vanishing cabinet and get an O in Potions. I guess this is why dramione makes more sense to me than ronmione, since Ron seems seriously incompetent.

also, I agree about Ginny being absolutely crazy!
