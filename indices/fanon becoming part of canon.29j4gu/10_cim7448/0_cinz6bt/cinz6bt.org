I can't help but think Hermione could have both successfully killed Dumbledore and fixed the cabinet much, much faster than that. Draco wasn't working from first principles here and he was given powerful magical items. His plans sucked and it took him forever.

I also don't think an O in potions is really a good sign of his intelligence, given how he was treated by Snape in the few canon scenes we have.

Smart? Sure. Hermione level? Ahh, no. But you're right, just about anything makes more sense than a Ron/Hermione romantic relationship being a happy one between equals.
