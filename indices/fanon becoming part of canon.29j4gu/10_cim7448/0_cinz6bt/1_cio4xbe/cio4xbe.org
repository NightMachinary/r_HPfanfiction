  I can't help but think Hermione could have both successfully killed Dumbledore and fixed the cabinet much, much faster than that. Draco wasn't working from first principles here and he was given powerful magical items. His plans sucked and it took him forever.

Not only that, when Dumbledore and Snape weren't fumbling around, trying to figure out his plan (not very hard, at that), they were, effectively, covering for him, and Heaven forbid anybody harm a hair on his blond head. Because, hey, /next time/ he decides to use an Unforgivable curse on an innocent bystander to smuggle a deadly artifact into Hogwarts, Hermione Granger will /again/ just happen to be nearby and prevent him from becoming a successful, rather than merely attempted, murderer, right?

*Edit:* Also, his job was made significantly easier by Hermione refusing to be involved in Harry's investigation, by what to me, at least, seems to be nothing more than Authorial Fiat, completely inconsistent with her earlier and later characterization.

Honestly, had Dumbledore and Snape simply grabbed him out of bed in the middle of the night and had Dumbledore, in his inimitable grandfatherly way, explain to Draco that he is working for /him/, now, with Snape glowering in the background, I think that Draco would have spilled in record time. Then, Obliviate him and put him back in bed as if nothing happened, in case Draco's vaunted Occlumency (which is a separate Draco-related mess) failed against Voldemort. Repeat biweekly, and subtly make sure that his plans don't actually hurt anyone and don't succeed until it's time for them to succeed.

  I also don't think an O in potions is really a good sign of his intelligence, given how he was treated by Snape in the few canon scenes we have.

This, on the other hand, is not fair, I think. Harry himself noted that the Potions OWL was much easier in front of an impartial evaluator, and I think that Draco would have reported the opposite experience. I don't doubt that Draco received /a lot/ of extra encouragement and tutoring in Potions, and it may well have been the only subject in which he had invested more than the minimum needed to get a decent grade (like Harry and DADA).

So, his O in Potions is, at the very least, an accurate reflection of his capabilities.
