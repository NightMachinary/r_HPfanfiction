  Also, his job was made significantly easier by Hermione refusing to be involved in Harry's investigation, by what to me, at least, seems to be nothing more than Authorial Fiat, completely inconsistent with her earlier and later characterization.

I think a lot of people are unfair about this one. Ever since second year, Harry's been trying to pin something on Draco. And he's been sort of an asshole this year. So Hermione telling him to talk to the hand, because the genius isn't listening seems less like arbitrary author railroading or her being a bitch (like most haters claim), and more like good prioritization on her part. Not turning into a cat or getting infinite detentions seems good motivation not to chase that snipe again.

  Harry himself noted that the Potions OWL was much easier in front of an impartial evaluator, and I think that Draco would have reported the opposite experience.

Fair enough. I still don't think he's all that, and he clearly doesn't ever use it for anything interesting like Hermione does. He wasn't even in the running for Slughorn's prize that Harry won with the help of the Half-Blood Prince, was he?

Speaking of which, Hermione not wanting Harry to use a book containing strange instructions just seems rational after a) learning some of the spells in it are darkish and b) having been paralyzed for months the last time a strange magic book showed up. But it wasn't like she was going to make the mistake of turning in his potentially dangerous property or trying to tell a teacher again. That worked out really shitty the last times she tried those responsible solutions.

Lots of haters points to this as her being jealous and spiteful. I think "frustrated" is a perfectly human emotion at that point, especially after his fuckery with Ron and faking cheating at an athletic competition with the luck potion.
