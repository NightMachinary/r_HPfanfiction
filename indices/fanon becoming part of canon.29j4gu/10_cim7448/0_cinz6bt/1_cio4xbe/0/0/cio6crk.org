  I think a lot of people are unfair about this one. Ever since second year, Harry's been trying to pin something on Draco. And he's been sort of an asshole this year. So Hermione telling him to talk to the hand, because the genius isn't listening seems less like arbitrary author railroading or her being a bitch (like most haters claim), and more like good prioritization on her part. Not turning into a cat or getting infinite detentions seems good motivation not to chase that snipe again.
