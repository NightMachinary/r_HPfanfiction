  I think a lot of people are unfair about this one. Ever since second year, Harry's been trying to pin something on Draco.

Fair enough. I don't think that her actions were particularly hate-worthy, but Harry did have some evidence of Draco being up to /something/ nefarious. It is not, of course, Hermione's job to investigate threats to Hogwarts, but, at the same time, where Harry had a track record of being wrong about Draco, Dumbledore & Co. have a track record of failing to address threats to Hogwarts. That said, she had just gotten burned following Harry into danger, so, I guess I may have overstated the case a bit --- her behavior was at least understandable, especially if one also takes into account Rongst.

  Speaking of which, Hermione not wanting Harry to use a book containing strange instructions just seems rational after a) learning some of the spells in it are darkish and b) having been paralyzed for months the last time a strange magic book showed up. But it wasn't like she was going to make the mistake of turning in his potentially dangerous property or trying to tell a teacher again. That worked out really shitty the last times she tried those responsible solutions.

This is probably getting off-topic, but while (a) makes perfect sense, (b) reasoning is simplistic to the point of superstition. The Potions advice was sound and verifiable, if nothing else. That said, she did investigate the origins of the book, ultimately identifying the Half-Blood Prince, which was, in fact, a rational thing to do.
