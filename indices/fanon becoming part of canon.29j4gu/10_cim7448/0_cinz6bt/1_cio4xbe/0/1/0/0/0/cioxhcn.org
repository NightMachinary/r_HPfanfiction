  (It would have been neat if Hermione's reaction to Harry's revelation and Slughorn's grading rubric had been something like "You know, Harry, Snape would have skinned us alive if we modified potions instructions like that. Since Slughorn seems to be different..."; and then she would start tweaking her own Potions' recipes, ending up about even with Harry+HBP.)

That's a good one. I'm always confused when someone tries to make Hermione into a /stupid/ rules-monger. That almost seems to be fanon sometimes.
