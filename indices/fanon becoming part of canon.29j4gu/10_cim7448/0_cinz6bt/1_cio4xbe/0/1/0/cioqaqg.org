In canon, potions is also the least safe class around, even including Care, and has the most disasters and side-effects of failure mentioned. Hermione experienced one of those first hand, making it a bit of an emotional topic I'd imagine.

  That said, she did investigate the origins of the book, ultimately identifying the Half-Blood Prince, which was, in fact, a rational thing to do.

That was in something like the last or next to last chapter. I think after Dumbledore died, even. I'm not sure how hard she was really trying, so I'm not sure she gets points for that one. But Harry /certainly/ loses points for messing with dark secrets without understanding the source or consequences.
