  In canon, potions is also the least safe class around, even including Care, and has the most disasters and side-effects of failure mentioned. Hermione experienced one of those first hand, making it a bit of an emotional topic I'd imagine.

Well, Slughorn seemed to have expected and rewarded out-of-the-box solutions and experimentation, so I suspect that at NEWT level, students are expected to be competent enough to handle the unexpected.

That said, I do see how Hermione's experiences may have made her rather timid in that regard. That's unfortunate. (It would have been neat if Hermione's reaction to Harry's revelation and Slughorn's grading rubric had been something like "You know, Harry, Snape would have skinned us alive if we modified potions instructions like that. Since Slughorn seems to be different..."; and then she would start tweaking her own Potions' recipes, ending up about even with Harry+HBP.)

To get back on topic for the thread, this is probably the origin of the "Hermione is oh-so-uncreative" fanon.
