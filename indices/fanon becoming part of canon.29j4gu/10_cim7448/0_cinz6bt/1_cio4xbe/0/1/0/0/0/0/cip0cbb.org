  I'm always confused when someone tries to make Hermione into a stupid rules-monger. That almost seems to be fanon sometimes.

Yeah, it's very much fanon. I am past confusion on this matter, and well into profound annoyance. As far as I can tell, the meme comes from people who write powerful!indy!Harry or Dramione fanfics who feel the need to impose an uncanonical degree of passivity on to her character, so they latch on to the "killed --- or worse, expelled" gag, and act as if it's the final word on her character, when, a few weeks later, said character set the scariest teacher in Hogwarts on fire, because it was a matter of life and death, rather than a matter of preadolescent honor. (Funny thing about rules --- most of them are actually a good idea most of the time. For example, "Don't wander around an unfamiliar magic castle after hours" is a good one, because you might, say, run into a hungry cerebrus.)
