Fair enough, I was distracted by fanfiction and the movies. As far as I can tell there are four girls that Harry finds at the very least pretty in canon: Cho, Fleur, Ginny and Hermione. As far as we know he finds Hermione the least interesting of the four, but at the same time he finds her prettier than every other girl in the school. He doesn't think Luna is pretty, he doesn't seem to be interested in Susan Bones, he's certainly not interested in Justin Finch-Flechley.

So...

Hermione might not be as pretty as the woman who portrays her in the movies, but she's still pretty. She's not breathtaking or stunning, or anything else, but as far as we know she is ”pretty“

Which is not nothing.
