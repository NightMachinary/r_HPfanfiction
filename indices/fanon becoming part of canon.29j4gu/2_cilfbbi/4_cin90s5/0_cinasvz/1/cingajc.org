*EDIT You know what? This should just end it, really. The rest of this post saved because of the time it took to write.

Here we go, Book Six, HP:HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his *magical powers* remain intact. It will take uncommon skill *and power* to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes."
#+end_quote

Also, kids have less:

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the *amount of magical power* that crossed his lake."

  ...

  "I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that *your powers* will register compared to mine."
#+end_quote

/Drops the mic./

*/tl;dr: Magical power is canon; several categories of power exist including age and, likely, inborn magical power; respectfully, you are as wrong as can be./*

--------------

This is a little silly, as the point of that original comment was clearly that Powerful Harry floating three feet above the floor during the Sorting because he is just /that powerful/ isn't supported in canon, nor is the basic idea that that could even happen. I don't think that is up for debate.

But that doesn't mean that canon shows a world that is entirely magically equal and egalitarian, and without differing levels of ability that lead directly to some people's spells better than others, as you seem to still be implying. While also stating that innate magi-emotional and mental abilities also matter. It is a confusing argument to counter, but I'll try to refine my position on a few points just to clear up some misconceptions.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, that is true, but it isn't the end of the argument. For one, I'm talking about power levels as they apply to wizards only, and adding in squibs doesn't make sense. While squibs may be more magical than the average human, that simply puts them in a class all their own.
#+end_quote

That is a terrible way to debate. You can't just create categories for phenomenon as edge cases that exclude them from consideration in your thesis. It seems clear you agree they have magic and so do magicals who get Hogwarts letters; they just have less of it, but still more than Muggles.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  We have never seen what would happen to a Muggle led into Hogwarts, but we know that Muggles can get into anti-Muggle areas if they are led in. We know this because we saw Mr and Mrs Granger enter Diagon Alley, a place that is Muggle proofed.
#+end_quote

These are not the same, and one can't draw conclusions like this. There are many times it would have made sense for Muggles to be at Hogwarts, yet it is said not to happen.

Anti-Muggle areas aren't a thing in canon, though there is at least one spell that seems to do something that repels them.

There are strong reasons to believe Muggles can't enter Hogwarts, though. Muggles can't see Hogwarts at all, instead seeing ruins, with no canon exceptions. Hermione's long and parentless hospital stay in CoS is highly suggestive given how fast the Weasleys are gathered when Ginny disappears for less than a day. Alternatives are both cruel and unsupported.

Diagon Alley, however, is not said to be spelled to make it invisible to Muggles or exclude them in some way. It is just said that the entrance (the inn) is uninteresting to Muggles and they ignore it. These are clearly different levels of protection and can't be directly equated, again supporting the squib as a level of magical ability as they aren't said to be unable to see it.

#+begin_quote
  We have never seen a Muggle attempt to use magical device, so we have no idea if they are capable. We have never seen a Muggle try to bond with a magical creature, so we have no idea whether or not they're capable.

  There is nothing we have seen a squib do that we know for certain a Muggle could not.
#+end_quote

Sure, see Hogwarts. But this isn't how burden of evidence works. We know squibs have some things in common with other magicals. Suggesting baseline humans have the same level of abilities means the weight of evidence lies on /you/ to provide magical things that Muggles are shown to be even likely to be able to do, not the opposite.

#+begin_quote
  The only comment I have for the wandless magic thing is that we have next to no knowledge about wandless magic.
#+end_quote

You list several things we do know, all performed by people who are constantly called powerful wizards: Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort. An example of Longbottom or Dean Thomas doing something odd or wandless would be good evidence against things like wandless magic being an indication of magical power. It sown as something they learned to do, and do better. So claiming ignorance or mechanics and then listing examples of famously effective and "powerful" wizards using it is not an impressive argument.

When Dumbledore heard about Tom's early magic use, he immediately thought that Tom Riddle would be a powerful wizard. Not that it meant he'd learn faster or better, though that is certainly implied to have happened. Dumbledore thought Tom's early abilities pointed to his eventual strength as the most powerful dark wizard ever, not the most skilled.

#+begin_quote
  But she isn't stronger at it. If someone casts Wingardium Leviosa, and Hermione, or Dumbledore, or Riddle, does the same thing, they're not doing it stronger than others.
#+end_quote

No proof is given for this, the most essential element of a long argument. Until that is done, this is merely an opinion up against the concrete examples I gave.

The training of students in the DA who were /at least/ two years older than Harry was when he drove off hundreds of Dementors only shows that it is possible, not that they could do the same feat after even greater training time.

Spells like Expelliarmus also /strongly/ suggest that innate ability factors in. Snape was thought to be scary and powerful and we see his spell was stronger than anything someone in the later DA ever produced. That is not truly overwhelming counter-evidence either, but it is quite suggestive.

There is also a confusion of definitions here. Is emotion a primary basis for casting powerful magic? Or at least, some powerful spells that would not work /as well/ without it? If so, then people with better emotional control have more powerful magical abilities than other people do. They can cast better torture curses and a better Patronus. Therefore, their ability to affect the world with that spell is stronger. Their magic, that magic, is stronger than someone else's, regardless of time spent in practice or study.

#+begin_quote
  Magical power is purely fanon. There's no evidence to support it that does not also support the skill theory, and there is no evidence that does not support the skill theory in a better way.
#+end_quote

Given that anything called "skill" is never said to affect quality or quantity of magic, it is at least as equally fan speculation as magical power. People are not said to be the "most skillful dark wizard ever", but the most /powerful/. More so, as no one ever says, "Wow, you defeated the Dark Lord when you were only one year old. I bet you studied really, really had to do that."

As Dumbledore said in HP:PS, "Voldemort had powers I will never have." Not skills. Powers.

Even /wands/ have more magical power than others:

#+begin_quote
  "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration."
#+end_quote

Voldemort's wand:

#+begin_quote
  "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands..."
#+end_quote

It took a "powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts," unlike unicorn blood, the Stone can make something that will bring someone back "to full strength and power". This is literal magical power being referenced, not some mental prowess or learning.

These examples were just from searching through HP:PS. Interestingly, the word "skill" appears nowhere in my copy of that e-book. Which doesn't /necessarily/ mean anything by itself, but I think might points towards what JKR was aiming for in world-building her magic.

--------------

You have only claimed readers being left ignorant of mechanics and unsupported equations of magic to mental abilities in concrete disciplines as support for this theory, not examples of people learning more and getting better spell results until finally they have "mastered" a spell, and it works for them as well as for Dumbledore.

This categorization isn't useful at all, the way presented. If you define "skill" to mean things like inborn ability to perform magical feats, then sure. Regardless of why, Harry is just more "skilled" than most anyone else with the Patronus, and that's why he can drive off hundreds of dementors.

If you look at different people able to use magic without training, like Voldemort as a child and Harry, you have to take into account people literally /saying/ they'll be powerful wizards. The results of their inborn abilities, ones that have no clear educational antecedent like Harry's use of Patronus three years younger than anyone else and Voldemort and Dumbledore's adult results, really speak for themselves. Simply saying that difference is "skill" clearly isn't sufficient explanation, and seems to contradict canon's thematic and dramatic emphasis.
