  I like that capacity to perform various types of magic is associated with traits that are not, themselves, magical, like general intelligence and knowledge, confidence, willpower, focus, as well as capacity for love, unbridled joy, and/or sadism

Keep the "love is power" thing, at least. Dumbledore says, straight up, that having a whole soul is power Voldemort never understood, along with Harry's ability to love. This isn't the "love of his mother" protecting him waffle stuff. He literally says that love and an unblemished soul adds to Harry's power. He isn't being metaphorical there.
