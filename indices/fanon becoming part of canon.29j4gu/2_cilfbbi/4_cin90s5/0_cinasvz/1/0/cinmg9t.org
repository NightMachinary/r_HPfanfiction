I am generally partial to the Seigio's position, in that I like that capacity to perform various types of magic is associated with traits that are not, themselves, magical, like general intelligence and knowledge, confidence, willpower, focus, as well as capacity for love, unbridled joy, and/or sadism. In other words, wizards are, most certainly, not created equal, but the things that make them unequal are not, themselves, magical in nature.

It is thematically fitting, and it integrates nicely with characters' personalities: sure, Bellatrix's sadism lets her cast a very powerful Cruciatus, but it also drives her engage in torture when there are better ways to accomplish a goal. (In particular, if it was, in fact, Bellatrix who had taught Draco Occlumency as Snape thought, Bellatrix must have had at least some skill in Legilimency. Yet, when interrogating Hermione, she didn't make use of it.) Riddle's psychopathic narcissism facilitates his imposing his will on reality via magic, but it also means that he tends to underestimate his enemies.

*However*, the bit quoted form HBP does seem to suggest some meaningful, measurable capacity for magic that does not depend on what one is doing with it. The other usages are ambiguous. Frankly, it's the best argument for a distinct Magical Power Meter (MPM) that I've seen to date, so kudos. I'll have to rethink my position. My beautiful theory may have been killed by an ugly fact.

I do think that a lot of the resistance to the concept is motivated by just how much it is abused and how the fanon notion that Harry's MPM value is oh-so-high has spread from bad (and not so bad) powerful!Harry fics to contaminate fics that don't even involve contests of magical power. It's just taken for granted, and that can be annoying.

Other than that, some reactions to the post --- since it has interesting worldbuilding:

- My impression when reading Harry's trial in OotP was that Figg and Dumbledore simply lied about her being able to see dementors, relying on it being an obscure enough factoid that nobody present would have the confidence to challenge Dumbledore over it.

- My headcanon is that after the Troll Incident, Hermione begged McGonagall (off screen) to not tell her parents about it, because they'd either pull her out of Hogwarts or worry endlessly. Her wishes were respected during CoS as well. Not cruel; just sad.

- I think that people make too much of the Patronus thing:

1. If the Dementors aren't targeting the caster specifically (reducing his or her ability to cast or sustain it in the first place), I don't think it matters how many of them there are, and, IIRC, they were targeting Harry's time-clone at the time. (Interestingly, only Harry and Hermione would know that.)

2. Vast, vast majority of wizards don't bother to even try to learn it in the first place, making it a rare skill, and, given that many DA students were able to make a lot of progress on it very quickly, I like Vera Rozhalsky's supposition that its supposed difficulty is Ministry propaganda, because wider knowledge of the charm reduces the effectiveness of their terror weapon.

3. Patronus Charm does have an unambiguous emotional component. My heacanon is that Harry's ability to cast it was, to a large part, a result of his capacity to Just Believe and Rejoice Freely without reservation --- and it helped very much that he had evidence that he had, in fact, already cast the spell. Someone like Hermione, whose MPM is comparable to Harry's, probably even higher, might nevertheless have more trouble with it, because how can she ever be unreservedly happy in a world in which house-elves are enslaved, political influence matters more than truth and justice, and people never do their homework unless you nag them? Someone like her would need to come up with a happy thought that distracts her from the world's problems.

- On pre-Hogwarts magical training, what's the point? It's too much like work (and wizards are, statistically, as lazy or lazier than Muggles), and they'll be covering the same curriculum at the same pace as everybody else once they get to Hogwarts, anyway. Also, we don't actually know if any of the pure- and half-bloods got any pre-Hogwarts tutoring. Maybe they had, maybe they hadn't. It probably doesn't make that big a difference in the long run, compared to how intelligent and motivated someone is when at Hogwarts.

- Given how characters who are known to have performed wandless magic pre-Hogwarts (Lily, Harry, Tom, Neville) aren't actually shown using it after they get to Hogwarts (that I can recall), I am inclined to view it as something like lactose tolerance in humans whose ancestors did not practice cattle husbandry: it's almost universal early on, then goes away as the child grows. Performing wandless magic afterwards therefore seems to me to be a different skillset from controlling Accidental Magic. However, learning to consciously control it while one has it is a strong indicator of extraordinary ambition, industriousness, capacity for focus, and general intelligence, so a child that does that does, indeed have the makings of a powerful wizard, whether or not MPM is a thing.

- IIRC, Harry's Lumos wasn't wandless as such, since it did, actually, involve a wand. It was cast without physical contact with a wand, but that's a different feat. Harry does seem to have the best of luck with wands, doesn't he? :P
