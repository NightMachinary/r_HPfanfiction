It's become canon to me that there is power in magic, but as written I don't see your evidence as very compelling.

  I think it is easy to show that squibs exist and aren't affected by Muggle repelling stuff (i.e., can work at Hogwarts), can use magical items (though not apparently wands), and can maybe sense magically unnoticeable to Muggle creatures, like Dementors, and might be able to form magical relationships with animals likes cats and Kneazles.

Yes, that is true, but it isn't the end of the argument. For one, I'm talking about power levels as they apply to wizards only, and adding in squibs doesn't make sense. While squibs may be more magical than the average human, that simply puts them in a class all their own.

The issue I have with squibs is that there is little evidence of them doing things Muggles can't do. The only thing in your example that we know Muggles can't do is to see dementors. Squibs, coincidentally, also can't see dementors, as was confirmed by Rowling.

We have never seen what would happen to a Muggle led into Hogwarts, but we know that Muggles can get into anti-Muggle areas if they are led in. We know this because we saw Mr and Mrs Granger enter Diagon Alley, a place that is Muggle proofed.

We have never seen a Muggle attempt to use magical device, so we have no idea if they are capable. We have never seen a Muggle try to bond with a magical creature, so we have no idea whether or not they're capable.

There is nothing we have seen a squib do that we know for certain a Muggle could not.

  can't be taught some apparently safe spells like the Patronus and even the freaking Point Me charm

Now this is just bollocks.

I can't really comment on the Point Me because I'm not too familiar with it (I thought Hermione invented it), but I can on the Patronus. In the DA, we see numerous students completing the Patronus, some just slightly older than Harry was.

The Unforgiveables and the Patronus are both considered difficult magic for children, but we see adults toss around Unforgiveables like candy, and we see teenagers master the Patronus. The thing with these spells is that they are heavily dependent upon emotion. Not power.

When Harry repelled hundreds of dementors, that wasn't some display of magical power, but rather of emotion. When Moody said no one could cast Unforgiveables on him, that wasn't because of power, but because they lack the drive.

But let's say the spells are power dependent. Harry driving off hundreds with his Patronus must indicate rather exceptional power then, right? Considering that many adults can't cast it, and most who can can only do the mist, and that can barely ward off one.

Why then do we see multiple adults, tons even, some of which didn't even graduate, cast the Unforgiveable if they can't manage the Patronus? Obviously Unforgiveables would take more, simply because Harry couldn't manage it, and he could manage the Patronus. If magical power is some linear thing, wouldn't Harry also be able to cast Unforgiveables? Wouldn't every member of the DA who can conjure Patroni?

No, because the magic isn't based on power. It's based on emotion. Harry specifically was told that he simply didn't want to hurt Bellatrix enough. Moody specifically says that no student really wants to kill him, or has the absolute force of being to want him dead.

Ok, so first off I'm going to agree with your point about Voldemort not really doing anything special. He doesn't cast many unique spells, he doesn't /do/ much that we see. In fact, in canon, he's a bit of a joke. The only person we've ever seen him actually duel was Dumbledore, and even then it wasn't particularly impressive.

But I think it's silly to extrapolate that magical power is significant based off of that.

And there is nothing there to suggest that it is anything more than him being a natural prodigy at magic. He's naturally good at it. He is a good duelist, we know this. What's to say that he isn't simply a prodigious duelist?

The question I think is begged is, "How would the average wizard know that Voldemort is powerful?"

Voldemort was a master of fear tactics. He knew how to strike to make people fear him. He would attack vulnerable targets, he would attack dissenters, he made Britain afraid to say his name.

--------------

The only comment I have for the wandless magic thing is that we have next to no knowledge about wandless magic. We know that Harry could do lumos wandlessly. We know Tom Riddle could intentionally create effects. We know accidental magic doesn't require wands. We know occlumency and legilimency doesn't require wands.

That it.

Also, who's to say that what Riddle was doing wasn't a refined form of accidental magic? We know accidental magic is based strictly off of intent and emotion. Harry uses accidental magic when he wants something to happen, and when he is forced into it.

Voldemort, a natural prodigy of occlumency, has stupid good control over his emotions. What is there to say it isn't refined accidental magic? It might not be compelling, but it has the same weight as your argument. There is no evidence that wandless magic is based on power, and there is no evidence wandless magic isn't based on power. You're assuming it is based on power because we have someone whom we are informed is powerful demonstrated to perform it when he was younger.

I never said that hard work and studying could make someone as powerful as Dumbledore. It is clear that Dumbledore is incredibly naturally talented. He didn't just study hard, he had an aptitude towards magic. Dumbledore in canon is strictly a genius.

Riddle in canon is also strictly a genius. He demonstrated feats requiring knowledge and resources, which he attained using his genius.

I'm going to use an analogy here. People will usually agree that Einstein is a genius. Mathematics came easy to him, as did Physics. It is silly to think that anyone who is not on his level of genius could equal him in mathematics, no matter how hard they studied.

Einstein as a child could do math better than other children, and even some adults, before he was ever taught formalized mathematics. He could probably do division and multiplication before any other child could even attempt it. This is the showing of his genius at mathematics.

But Einstein's math is not inherently better than other people's. He is better /at/ math, but the math specifically is not better. His math is not stronger, because math does not work that way.

Magic is seen in much the same way by people against power. It's a skill. People are naturally better at it, able to retain more information, learn it without being formally taught, able to progress faster, able to apply it to other areas.

It is easy to see this in canon. Hermione, naturally skilled at magic, would finish things much faster than other students, learn things quicker, do things better on the first try. But she isn't /stronger/ at it. If someone casts Wingardium Leviosa, and Hermione, or Dumbledore, or Riddle, does the same thing, they're not doing it stronger than others. The charms are identical. But it's far easier for them to do it, to learn it, to remember it.

Magical power is purely fanon. There's no evidence to support it that does not also support the skill theory, and there is no evidence that does not support the skill theory in a better way.

If there is, please show me.
