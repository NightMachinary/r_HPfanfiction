Okay, no. This is clearly canon, no matter what most people who hate magic being explained want to believe. Bad fanfic might abuse the idea, but you can't simply ignore the facts as written.

I think it is easy to show that squibs exist and aren't affected by Muggle repelling stuff (i.e., can work at Hogwarts), can use magical items (though not apparently wands), and can maybe sense magically unnoticeable to Muggle creatures, like Dementors, and might be able to form magical relationships with animals likes cats and Kneazles. So that's *one* level of power above a normal human's when it comes to magic. This could end the argument right there, but let's continue.

--------------

Wizards are a power level higher than squibs and humans, so with squibs that's *two* levels of magical ability, even just sticking to human magicals -- elves and centaurs obviously have their own powers that aren't exactly the same potential as humans, but that could be said to be apples and oranges. Don't suggest they aren't /people/ however, or I'll sic Hermione on you.

--------------

Then it is implied that young kids either aren't for some reason or /can't/ be taught some apparently safe spells like the Patronus and even the freaking Point Me charm. First years not knowing something as useful and safe as the Point Me spell, and Harry managing the Patronus being a big deal, is just odd when there are no obviously difficult components like hard words or complicated motions. In canon such things apparently matter a lot, so why are two spells with minimal castings such a big deal? A spell such as Apparation makes sense -- that is physical dangerous. But that's not the case with those two spells.

That something else would make it difficult to learn or use those very safe spells raises a big question. With the absence of those sorts of difficult standard components, and given Lupin's instructions on the Patronus, those spells being hard for little kids points to it being something linked either to someone's "will" or focus -- which varies from person to person and we can actually physical measure in real life at the neurochemical level right now -- or to some other innate magical quality.

So I argue that since there is /strong/ evidence that little kids physically or magically can't cast apparently simple charms like the Point Me or the Patronus, which is why they aren't usually taught, that's number *three* on my list of of magical ability levels. Even if it is just will-power or emotional control, then /that is just a magical ability with different levels itself/.

This is my weakest level, so feel free to ignore it as it is mostly circumstantial evidence. I'm just saying, there is a reason no one under the age of fifteen ever uses an Unforgivable in canon. Youngest use? Maybe Harry in book five (15), though he sort of muffs it. Bellatrix seemed sort of surprised he even managed that much, though she then quickly mocks him for it. Again, suggesting that he was way too young for it but he was still powerful enough to still get some effect, but not /proving/ anything.

--------------

Now we get to the canon world's fear of Voldemort. He is literally said to be the most powerful dark wizard of all time in canon. That directly implies he is, as a magical person, more powerful than all previous dark wizards. However, we never really see this power manifested, so it is hard to pin down. Not impossible, though.

He isn't enchanted to bounce spells, he doesn't have powerful self-made magical items hanging off him like a D&D character, he doesn't eat lava for breakfast, and he doesn't just stand there and laugh when Dumbledore has stone statues try to pummel him.

But okay, maybe that is a figure of speech about his knowledge and madness in casting irresponsible Unforgivables or something. This seems unlikely, given the fact that he doesn't use any spells in canon that his Death Eaters don't also use.

He doesn't do anything special himself other than the Horcruxes, his cursed potion, and the ring -- all of which no one knows about, remember. We don't actually see how those work or how they might be unique. He wasn't the first ever to use Horcruxes, after all. All this points to his spell knowledge and how he uses it not being the publically scary thing about him.

And that, along with him using some sort of weak mind-controlling "accidental" wandless magic on his classmates even before Hogwarts (that's canon, according to Mrs. Cole), /strongly/ suggests he's more than just ruthless and cruel. He's more magically powerful.

I think it is silly to suggest that someone who could intentionally do wandless magic before age eleven wasn't "more powerful" than other Hogwarts students magically. So that's /at least/ a very strong third level of magical power, if not number *four* for my list.

--------------

So please, don't spread this silly interpretation of canon. It is nice to think that hard work and studying could make anyone as powerful as +Voldemort+ Dumbledore, but that seems to be directly contradicted by canon itself. Some fans hate magic having levels or points or it being explained at all. The fact is, JKR does explain some of it. And some people being "more powerful" in magic is canon in several ways.
