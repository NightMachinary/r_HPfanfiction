Her son is being tasked with killing Dumbledore, and given his abilities (or lack there of) it's possible that he won't get the cabinet done.

So who else can she trust with her son? Bellatrix? Dolohov? The Carrows? Every Death Eater besides Snape Lucius and Narcissa would kill him for failing. Or just because.

He's the safe choice since he's almost always in the school, AND he's the head of Draco's house AND he's obviously a Death Eater (regardless of his actual loyalties).
