Actually, the defensive magic at the Dursley home is a glaring example of such a defensive spell, we see others in the entrance to Diagon Alley and Gringotts, there's Hermione's defensive work around the tent during DH, and of course, Hogwarts' protection. Compared to the total number of settings we have throughout canon that is a massive percentage, so it actually makes a lot of sense.
