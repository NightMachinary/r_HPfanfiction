Oh god, so many things.

Let's see:

- Runes as spells
- Wards
- Masterys after Hogwarts
- McGonagall and Snape think Harry's spoiled at home
- Everything about Daphne
- Hermione is conventionally attractive
- A ton of spells
- Snape is Malfoy's godfather
- People are stronger magically than other people
- Grindelwald and Dumbledore were lovers
- Hermione using Ron's full name, "Ronald Bilius Weasley!"
- The Golden Trio referring to Harry Ron and Hermione
- Harry calling Hermione, Mione.

I'm probably missing a lot, but just from reading so much fanfiction I have this huge list of fanon that I never really bothered to separate from canon. It honestly shocked me a bit when I found out that Snape was never stated to be Malfoy's Godfather.
