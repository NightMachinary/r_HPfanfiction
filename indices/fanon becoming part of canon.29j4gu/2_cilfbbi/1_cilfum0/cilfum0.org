Rowling actually said in an interview that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were lovers. link: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald]] So i guess that means it is canon even though it isn't mentioned in the books.

*Edit*from the link you sent they weren't lovers. i guess that Dumbledore's feeling weren't reciprocated.
