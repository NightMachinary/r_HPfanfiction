  It was revealed by J. K. Rowling during a tour in 2007 that Albus Dumbledore was homosexual, as well as harboured romantic feelings for Grindelwald. Although she did not initially comment on Grindelwald's sexuality, *Rowling later clarified that although Grindelwald was aware of Dumbledore's feelings, he merely used them to manipulate the other boy and did not reciprocate romantically.*

  However, Gellert may have had a genuine platonic love for Albus.
