  McGonagall and Snape think Harry's spoiled at home

Daphne is a girl from Slytherin with at least one sister named Astoria, that is everything revealed about her in canon.

  People are stronger magically than other people
#+end_quote

That's canon. People like Voldemort and Dumbledore didn't just study more spells, they are a lot more powerful magically as well.

#+end_quote

Hermione would curse the balls of anyone that dared say that.
