Nobody died. Yep. I refuse to believe otherwise.

Oh and also there is more than ONE dorm per year and gender for each house. Because, seriously. One dorm a 5 people? Really? Really now? 40 new students a year? LESS THAN 280 STUDENTS IN HOGWARTS? What's this, a school for ants? Nobody can tell me that there are less than 280 students attending Hogwarts, that's ridiculous. There would be 20 students in each class, considering that two houses share a class. That would also mean that there is almost no possibility of building different groups of friends in your year. There are only 4 other people in your year of your gender, who else are you supposed to be friends with? So my canon is that there are several dorms and that 500-1000 people are actually attending Hogwarts.
