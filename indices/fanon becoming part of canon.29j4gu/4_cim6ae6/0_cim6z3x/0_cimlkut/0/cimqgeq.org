Not necessarily... 1k students would be 250/house, about 36 per year per house. So assuming all years were even, that's only about 70 in a first year two-house Charms class.

My average class size from about third grade on was 30 or so students to one teacher. High school moved it closer to forty. Now I'm in college and have dealt plenty with lecture hall type classes. It's not unreasonable for there to possibly be 70 people in one classroom.

These classes are also, iirc, only actually required up through fifth year. So assuming all numbers are constant, there's could be up to almost 300 students not taking a particular class in any given year. Even if everyone took a class, it would only require a professor to have fourteen classes to cover everybody.

Two hours is a reasonable upper time limit for a class, so that's 28 hours. Give it twice a week, and we're looking at 56. Professors live at the school as far as we can tell, take their meals there, and some seem to do patrols at night. We also don't see any weekend classes, though astronomy was I think once a week on Wednesday.

So we have professors working eleven hour days, though that can likely be cut down depending on the individual course, which isn't too far fetched (plenty of Muggles do that!).

The professors for the elective classes would guaranteed have even smaller work loads, since students have to choose to take the course, and only third years and higher can take them. Course loads may even lighten up concerning sixth and seventh years, because we saw how each instructor can set limits on who can advance after fifth year.

So yeah. It is a lot of work. But there could be ways of magically grading homework, and there's technically no canon showing that seventh years can't help out with things like that, since we don't see a typical seventh year in the books. It can be done without time turners! (but of course since we only see our inadequate numbers, this is all guesswork).
