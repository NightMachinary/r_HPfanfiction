Yeah, but it would make the teachers' schedules at a boarding school insane. That's slavery, not employment (24 hours of ~40 people classes a week, double that for homework and prep for classes, chaperoning and generally keeping order, paperwork, etc... would be at least 80 weekly hours for anyone who teaches any of the year 1-7 subjects.

That's 7 days a week of eleven hour work days except for summer and Christmas. More for heads of house, and poor Minerva, deputy headmistress as well (she's in her 70s since book 5, and probably working 12-13 hour days with no vacation except a part of summer)... let alone Snape with both Order/DE duties. Ouch.
