True, but I rather like the interpretation that the magical world is a lot smaller than people think... and it would be physically impossible for there to be much more than 1000 students per year for the reasons I explained.

Time to do the math:

There are 11 schools in the world, and let's assume that there are a maximum of twice that amount whose education / lack of makes them outside of the educational system altogether. Let's assume that there are 1000 people per year at Hogwarts. The entire population of witches/wizards, assuming that they live twice as long as muggles, would therefore be an easy estimate.

Looking at the world's age distribution, in 2000, a tenth of the population was ages 5-9, and accounting to lifespan, that would mean a tenth of the population was ages 10-18, one eighth of which are pre-school age. So, 1000 people are 7/80 of the population of Hogwarts students (past, present, future), which are 1/11 of the 1/3 of the population that goes to school.

Therefore, there are about 377000 witches/wizards in the world (as a maximum) in this case, but let's round it to 400000, which would mean that one out of 15000 people is a witch/wizard according to the data I used (2000 census). Assuming that there are a quarter that population, (280 per year) there are only 100000 people in the wizarding world, which would explain how the small amount of deaths are such a huge deal - 150 people dead in the final battle? HOLY SHIT, that's about one out of 700 people in dead!

That would explain so much: how Harry was such a legend before he first stepped into Hogwarts, the huge percent of purebloods considering that they are only 28 families, why the Order/DE are so small, etc. The Voldermort Wars would have as big an impact as WWI and WWII have on our society.

Dumbledore, Moody and Shacklebolt would be the "big three", Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt. They were the leaders. Harry would be Eisenhower, who struck the blows that ended the war. Snape would be Alan Turing (whose intelligence work was crucial to the allied victory, a brilliant scientific mind... but while he was celebrated after he died, on a personal level was reviled and mistrusted, and only decades later was accepted as belonging in that list).
