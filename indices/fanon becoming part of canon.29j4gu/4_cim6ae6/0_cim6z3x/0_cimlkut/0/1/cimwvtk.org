I agree with [[/u/Teh_Warlus]]; the teachers' schedules would be crazy. Also I don't think a school like Hogwarts would have 30+ students per class. I went to an English boarding school from age 11-16 and we never had more than 25 kids a class. (Overall student numbers were about 550, for ages 11-18.) Hogwarts is /the/ top magical school in Britain (or possibly the only) and they're teaching dangerous subjects. There's no way they would have practical classes with more than 30 kids a class. Also I have attempted repeatedly to create a schoolwide timetable for Hogwarts and have yet to succeed with only one teacher per subject. (I am still working on it, changing various factors that eschew some canon details.) I'm no expert, but as far as I can tell, using the info we have from JKR and the books, the academic running of Hogwarts is ridiculously difficult if not outright impossible. I have a lot to say on improving the general running of Hogwarts' academics. (And by a lot I mean I've written an incomplete essay on the matter.)
