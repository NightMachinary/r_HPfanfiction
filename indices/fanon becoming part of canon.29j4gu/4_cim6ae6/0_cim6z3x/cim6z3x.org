It actually is canon that there's more like a thousand students, according to an interview with Jo. It's just attributed to bad math (the 280).

We also only see things from Harry' point of view, making it "okay" that there's such a seemingly low number of students. There was just a low enrollment rate for a few years due probably to low birth rate during the war. So there very well could have been only ten gryffs new to the school in 1991, but it definitely wasn't normal.
