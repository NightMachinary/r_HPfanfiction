I think Dumbledore thought, because of accumulating evidence and the prophecy, that Harry was /definitely/ doomed to die after learning about Tom Riddle's diary in second year. The Headmaster thought he was looking at a dead boy walking from that point on. Which makes his later actions sort of harsh, but also logical. This is sort of supported in canon.

After Voldemort "stole" Harry's mother's protections, Dumbledore seemed to do some quick planning to make a way out for Harry and actually started trying to help some. But the Ministry almost took away his school, which he had to fight against when he should have been hunting Horcruxes. Then, first time at bat, he got his hand blargled, and that was almost the end of that. It was just a Hail Mary play with Harry for another Horcrux at the end of book six, then hope Harry could get stronger and find the rest.

His book seven plan is pure senile dementia, though. Dumbledore's or JKR's is up for debate.
