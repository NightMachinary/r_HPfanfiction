I don't think he's necessarily darker in the way the term is usually used in the fandom, but he didn't learn anything from his experiences with Grindelwald. He has good intentions but he still thinks he knows what's best for everyone and justifies the things he does as being for their own good. He's also dangerously incompetent and negligent. He hired a teacher that had Voldemort stuck to the back of his head. He put bait for Voldemort in a school full of children behind an obstacle course two eleven year olds and a twelve year old were able to get past but that could have potentially been fatal to children who encountered it. He hired a death eater. Constant vigilance? Seriously, this man is allowed to run a school?
