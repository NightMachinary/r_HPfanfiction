Oh merlin, I couldn't list all of the things that fanfiction has settled into my mind as cannon if I tried! Probably the biggest one though is Dumbledore being evil. Try as I might I simply cannot see him as the benevolent grandfatherly head of a resistance anymore. He seems just as manipulative if not more so than Voldemort.
