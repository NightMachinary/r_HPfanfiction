Best long form story started that year

Best short story completed this year (<40k words)

Best novella story completed this year (40k to 60k words. If I recall correctly, actual publishing uses 70k, but that's not an option in ff.n)

Best long form completed this year (>60k words)

As for rare pair, I'd say it needs to be less than 1-2% of things written or updated this year in the fandom, that has pairings, though I don't know how to sort that.

If that's still too much, maybe add a filter that it's less than x% of the pairings involving the more popular of the two characters. IE (and these are totally made up numbers) but lets say that Hermione/Grayback is 0.5% of the fan fic meta, but it's actually 5% of the fics with Hermione, who is five times as many fics as Greyback, so I'd say that for that character, it's not a rare pair.
