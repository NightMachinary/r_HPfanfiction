I think I wasnt using language english but I was looking at length > 1000

Well tbf I wouldnt use cho/harry as a good metric because basically no one likes her as a character. Theres way more daphne/harry fics even more lavender/harry I think.

I cant really think of any other metric. Maybe using the pairings on AO3? Or if theres not a dedicated fan site for x pairing then likely it's a rare pair.
