Anyways, you get the point. I don't think that FFN is a good metric for the rarity of a ship. There are only 431 H/DG fics around, and I wouldn't call Daphne a rare pair by any stretch of the imagination. And funnily enough, there are only 15 Cho fics around, yet that's a canon pairing. The line for rare pairing is kinda blurry.
