Personally I like:

Best Alternate Universe

Best one-shots (because they don't get as much love)

Best rare pair

Best Alternate Perspective Cannon Re-telling

And probably a wild card category for a theme that was prevalent that year, even if it's a weird/ Crack-y theme

There's probably more.

Also, how would you define those categories.

Like if Best Rare Pair was a category how would you determine if the pairing was rare or not.
