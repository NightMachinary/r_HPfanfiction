Okay guys, I don't have the promised story up. The problem is that it sort of went and ran away from me and now includes a side order of senile!Merlin among other things. Also I'm not even sure if it should be just crack anymore, and Dumbledore is now the main character. Basically I'm confused as hell right now and loving it - if this story wants to be a hundred-chapter epic by God I'm going to write a hundred-chapter epic.

So [[/u/Pfcbales]], [[/u/paperhurts]], [[/u/Chienkaiba]], [[/u/btr154]], [[/u/partisan98]], [[/u/tusing]], [[/u/howtopleaseme]], [[/u/Imborednow]] and [[/u/schumi23]], I'm sorry I didn't deliver on the three-day promise and I swear I'll make up for it with an extra-extra-OOC Harry :(
