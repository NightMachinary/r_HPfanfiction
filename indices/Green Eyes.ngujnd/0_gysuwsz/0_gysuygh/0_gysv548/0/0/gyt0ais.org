Well, I certainly did not know green was so common in the UK! You learn something new every day...

I googled green eyes, and 2 percent seems awfully low. Still, it makes sense, because around 16 percent of those who have green eyes are of either Celtic or Germanic descent.

Brown, bllue and green are the three most common eye colours, with between 55-79 percent of humans born with some variant of brown.

Turns out only around 1% have grey eyes, which make it the rarest eye colour. But like you said, certain shades may stand out.
