I feel that is misleading, as light eye colour is far more common in northern European countries, along with 'brighter' hair colours, hence the 'blond hair, blue eyes' stereotype.

According to a quick Google, green eyes are actually the second most common colour in the UK after blue, although a particular shade of green may still stand out.
