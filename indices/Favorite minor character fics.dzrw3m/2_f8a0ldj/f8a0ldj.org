If you want a Fletcher as a good guy character, he's one of the supporting characters of the Promises Unbroken trilogy. In it, he's an ex-Auror scarred by his experiences in the war against Voldemort (which never stopped, so James/Lily are also alive and main characters), but he's a good man. Bonus points because Peter Pettigrew is involved, I'll avoid spoilers but he's also portrayed as a main-ish character.

In terms of minor characters, the spotlight is firmly on the Marauder generation (James, Lily, Sirius, Remus, Peter, Severus...) and since in canon they're not "main" characters I'm guessing they fit into your wish for good fics on minor characters. Also features a non-Squib Arabella Figg, and an OC sister (Julia) to Lucius Malfoy.

Ngl writing about this fic makes me want to reread the whole thing, so that's what I'll be doing :)
