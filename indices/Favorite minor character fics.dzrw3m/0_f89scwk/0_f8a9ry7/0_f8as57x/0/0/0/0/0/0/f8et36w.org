Okay, firstly: book Hermione isn't a Mary Sue. The films have many flaws and one of them is changing the characters. Secondly: Many people having the same opinion is not "parroting". If anything it gives even more weight to the argument. If a million people tell you the sun rises from the east would that be "parroting"? Would that change the simple truth? Finally: If the series is so badly written then why are you wasting your time on a subreddit about the very series you dislike? It seems like you could be spending your time in a more meaningful manner. Like reading a series you actually enjoy and not being a hater. For example I'm not a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire. But that doesn't mean I waste my precious time by being a hater on their subreddit.
