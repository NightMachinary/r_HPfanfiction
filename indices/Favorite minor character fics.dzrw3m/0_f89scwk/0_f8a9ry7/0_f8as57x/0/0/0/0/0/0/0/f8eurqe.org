Okay, secondly, Rey isn't a Mary Sue.

  Many people having the same opinion is not "parroting". If anything it gives even more weight to the argument. If a million people tell you the sun rises from the east would that be "parroting"? Would that change the simple truth?

Not what I meant. People use it as it's the final argument for the new trilogy being bad, a disney cashgrab, the end of times, or whatever they want.

Stories can have one bad element and still be good stories, or enjoyable ones at the least.

Everyone going "Rey is a mary sue therefore Disney ruined Star Wars" is the problem.

  Finally: If the series is so badly written then why are you wasting your time on a subreddit about the very series you dislike?
#+end_quote

Something being badly written and me not enjoying it aren't the same. I think you are projecting a bit here.

I like eating fast food, it doesn't make it /good/ food, same goes for entertainment.

  Like reading a series you actually enjoy and not being a hater.
#+end_quote

Damn, I said HP is not well written and now i'm just a hater that needs to leave.

I don't think it's even a controversial opinion to have, the series has a lot of problems. Hell, lots fanfics set to fix some of them.

  But that doesn't mean I waste my precious time by being a hater on their subreddit.
