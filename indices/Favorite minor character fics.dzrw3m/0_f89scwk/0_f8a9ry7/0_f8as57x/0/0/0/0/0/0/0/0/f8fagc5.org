  Rey isn't a Mary Sue.
#+end_quote

Any proof? When has she struggled with something or needed training for something? She does everything with little difficulty and succeeds the first time.

  Not what I meant. People use it as it's the final argument for the new trilogy being bad, a disney cashgrab, the end of times, or whatever they want.
#+end_quote

Oh, there are many, /many/ arguments why the new trilogy is bad. Even Mary Sues and agendas aside: Episode VII was basically a remake and not a sequel and they've written themselves in a corner with Episode VIII- most of the Resistance was destroyed- I think they said they were down to something like 300- 400 people. (But magically they have a whole new army and armada in the trailers for Episode IX, because... reasons.) There are quite a few videos on youtube that explain it a lot better than me. MauLer has done several excellent long videos explaining why and how much the new trilogy sucks.

  I like eating fast food, it doesn't make it /good/ food, same goes for entertainment.

Ah, got you fam. So you're just a masochist. Fair enough, to each their own.

  Damn, I said HP is not well written and now i'm just a hater that needs to leave.
#+end_quote

Aww, you don't have to leave. I was just perplexed as to why you would do something you obviously don't like or enjoy.

  Are you even real
#+end_quote

Are you? What test would you propose to establish if someone is real?
