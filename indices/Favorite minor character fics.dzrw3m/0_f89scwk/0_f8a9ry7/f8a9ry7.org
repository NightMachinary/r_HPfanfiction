HP Fanfiction is what the Star Wars Expanded Universe used to be. If there was a character in the movies, then they likely featured prominently in a novel, comic, or short story at the very least.

And it's similar for HP Fanfiction. So many stories about minor characters and minor events. It's truly wonderful.
