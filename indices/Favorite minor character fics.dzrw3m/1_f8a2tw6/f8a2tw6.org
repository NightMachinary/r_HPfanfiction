My favorite fics that center on minor canon characters:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): Obviously Daphne centered, but Astoria also plays a major, sympathetic role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Bellatrix, it's fun to see her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): This Petunia is so amazing and yet so much like her canon version.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore, to fight Voldemort, and to redeem himself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/][The Daring Win]], linkffn(12005755): Umbridge raised Harry,

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363): Gilderoy Lockhart found and raised Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/][Wish Carefully]], linkffn(4356667): Lucius Malfoys describes Voldemort's Pureblood 'utopia'.
