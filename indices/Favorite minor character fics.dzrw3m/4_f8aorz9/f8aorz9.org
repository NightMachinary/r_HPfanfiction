"Saying Yes" linkffn(9336215) which is a post-canon Andromeda/Kingsley fic, "The Matron of Hogwarts" linkffn(11933058 ) which is a series of short stories centering on Pomfrey, It All Started With Quidditch (It Always Does) linkffn(10725540) is a Katie/Oliver story, and "Stronghold" linkffn(11263274) which is a Percy/Audrey post-war story.

One-shot wise, I like this Millicent one-shot, "Run Crooked" linkffn(12436223), "The Crooked Man" linkffn(12110485) is an interesting little piece about Nearly Headless Nick, and "Delight in Whatever Remains" linkffn(11348923 ) which is about Hannah and Neville struggling with her infertility.
