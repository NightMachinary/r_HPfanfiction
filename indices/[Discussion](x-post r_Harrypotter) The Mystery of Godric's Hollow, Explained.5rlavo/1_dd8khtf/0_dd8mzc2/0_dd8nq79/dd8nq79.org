  Furthermore, I have yet to see a consistent theory which explains the absence of pretty much any Potter Estate or heirlooms

And that is pretty much the gist of it, isn't it? Because this whole thing struck me as less of a debate about the Fidelius Charm and more you hanging onto it to have a reason to include “Potter Estate” in canon. I do understand that both theories are really just that, theories, but Taure at least posted only here and we all knew it was a theory whereas your attempt feels like something more ... hmm, let's say “ambitious” than that. There is also the fact that as far as I've seen up to now all the evidence you have that is not tautological relies on far-reaching interpretations and one even on something that simply isn't true. There simply isn't enough information that is canon to have anything more than theories, and as such if you feel like writing it as working in a certain way in your story then feel free to do it, but I think you should really stop for a moment and take a look at what and how you present as evidence if you want what you write to be applicable to more than just your story.
