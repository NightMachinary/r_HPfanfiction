I don't think the property law logic in that post applies here, since we know that Godric's Hollow was not the Potters' primary home, but somewhere they moved to hide from Voldemort, thus the logic about them not being able to give the cottage to another person falls flat.

Also, this is the quote that the other OP cites as evidence for his theory that you must trust another person in order to use the fidelius:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.

  “An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!”

  “So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.

  “Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.”

[[/u/Taure]] claims that this quote 'fairly explicitly' rules out the possibility of being your own secret keeper, but does it? All Flitwick says in his quote is that the information is hidden inside the 'chosen person''s soul and is henceforth impossible to find unless voluntarily divulged. At no point does he actually say anything about trust being required, he merely give's James's justifications for making Black the Secret-Keeper. I think that this quote doesn't actually provide /any/ evidence to indicate that one can't be their own Secret-Keeper, and might even be argued as evidence against it because of Flitwick's choice of wording, since he almost explicitly avoids words like 'another' or referencing multiple people, when it seems like if the distinction between secret-giver and secret-keeper existed, this would be the place to mention it.

Furthermore, the entire post is speculation, just as my post is and is thus nothing but an alternate theory. Not that I have anything against that of course, since the poster is just trying to solve the problem presented by the fidelius. However, he essentially makes the argument that the Weasleys are able to hide at Aunt Muriel's properties, despite also protecting those properties via fidelius, on the basis that they don't technically own the properties. That strikes me as getting off on a technicality (which, as I said earlier, the Potters could also have easily exploited), and seems to me to be at the very least, unsatisfying for readers.

Furthermore, I have yet to see a consistent theory which explains the absence of pretty much any Potter Estate or heirlooms, and while Taure does a good job of offering an explanation for the fidelius plot hole, it's not a particularly strong one, nor does it explain the absence of the Potter Estate. For that, the best explanation we have seems to be that Dumbledore decided to act wildly out of character and steal it from a <11y/o boy.
