The thing is though, your argument doesn't offer better justification. You're assuming a lot more:

- They own another property\\
- That property is also under the Fidelius charm\\
- They moved away from that place to Godric's Hollow (Why would they do that if they were already under a Fidelius charm)\\
- You can't be a secret keeper for two secrets at once

And you'd rather assume all of that instead of just saying you can't be your own secret keeper (which isn't contradicted in the books).
