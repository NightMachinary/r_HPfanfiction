Actually, my theory is based on three primary arguments indirectly supported by the text, and all of them more strongly than the can't keep your own secret argument.

(1) My first argument is that you can't be the secret keeper for more than one secret at once

This argument is supported by the observation that the Weasleys had two secret keepers for their two fideliused locations.

(2) Second, Given the choice between absolute assurance of safety in exchange for isolation, and the near assurance of safety while being able to see James's closest friends, the Potters would choose the second over the first.

This argument, that James and Lily, given the choice, would choose near security and friendship over total security and isolation is supported in that we know that James was immensely loyal to his friends. His loyalty is shown in that he was almost a brother to Sirius (for example, when Sirius was having trouble with his family, the Potters invited him to stay with them). It is further supported in that James befriended Remus despite the latter's lycanthropy, showing that he is willing to experience danger in order to stay close to his friends.

(3) Third, that the Potters own another property is an argument I have already made, it ultimately boils down to the fact that the Potters are an old family who are rich and involved in politics, thus it seems likely to me that they should own more than just the property at Godric's Hollow (henceforth the Cottage).

(4) The observation that there is a lack of heirlooms passed from Harry's parents to their child, and a further lack of Potter family heirlooms is self evident. The only heirlooms passed on were ones not in the possession of the Potters at the time of their deaths, and numbered exactly 2 (the invisibility cloak and the marauders map).

(5) I argue that the lack of heirlooms from (4) is unusual because the Potter family has existed for a long time (which is explicitly stated on Pottermore and heavily implied in the stories) and a family that lasts a long time almost always acquires many items which the latest generation do not use. Given that the Potter family has over eight hundred years of heritage, even if /all/ of these items were in the Cottage at the time of the Potters' deaths, that not a single one of them survived the explosion (which, it is explicitly stated in the books, only damaged the 2nd floor of the house) to be made available to Harry seems unusual.

(6) That the Potter Estate is under a fidelius is a conclusion drawn from the assumption that the Potters own another property (3), and the observation that there is a mysterious lack of heirlooms passed from Harry's parents or extended family to their child (5).

(7) The conclusion that the Potters did not Keep the Secret of the Cottage because they were already Keeping the Secret of the Estate is supported by arguments (1,6)

While I initially argued that the Potters moved away from the Potter Estate to the Cottage due to information on the Harry Potter wiki which has no source, whether or not the Potters moved from the Estate to the Cottage or already lived in the Cottage is immaterial. Instead, I will argue that the Potters had the option of leaving behind their home in Godric's Hollow to escape to an alternate fideliused property, but chose to stay in Godric's Hollow despite that.

(8) We can conclude that given their inability to Keep the Secret of the Cottage (7) and their willingness to trust their friends (canon), James and Lily would then choose to make Peter Pettigrew their Secret Keeper

(9) The conclusion that the Potters had the option of escaping to the Potter Estate is drawn if we accept the argument which I have already made that the Potters own at least one other property and that it is fideliused (3,6).

(10) The conclusion that the Potters would choose to stay at the Cottage despite having the Potter Estate as an option is supported by the argument that James and Lily would choose good security and friendship over absolute security and isolation (2).

Therefore, using arguments 8,9,and 10 we can show that the Potters chose Pettigrew as their Secret Keeper because they could not keep the Secret of the Cottage themselves (8), and stayed at the Cottage in order to be able to see their friends despite the decreased security (10), while having the Potter Estate available as a backup (9).

Thus my theory is based on 3 arguments (1,2,3), all of which are indirectly supported by the text and the observation that Harry has very few heirlooms from his family.

As for my rebuttal: The argument that you can't be your own secret keeper not only has circumstantial evidence against it in the text, it is directly contradicted. The indirect evidence of the argument's incorrectness is shown when Bill and Fleur hide Shell Cottage, where Bill is the secret keeper. The argument is also directly contradicted by the secret of Grimmauld Place, as the exact text of the secret given to Harry is:

#+begin_quote
  The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.
#+end_quote

Given that both Dumbledore (who cast the charm) and Sirius Black (who owns the house) are both members of the Order of the Phoenix, this seems to be a direct contradiction to the argument that you can't keep your own secret, especially given that this secret was sufficient to hide the entire location of 12 Grimmauld Place from observation, exactly like how the cottage in Godric's Hollow is described as being hidden.

Thus I would argue that the Potter Estate theory has a better justification for James making Pettigrew his Secret Keeper because it is indirectly supported by the text, whereas the accepted fanon theory is directly contradicted by the text.
