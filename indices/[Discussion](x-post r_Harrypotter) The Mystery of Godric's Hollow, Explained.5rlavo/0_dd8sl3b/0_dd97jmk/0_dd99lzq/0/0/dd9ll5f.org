Sorry, you're wrong. Shell cottage is not said to be Bill and Fleur's (in the movie it's Muriel's) and Dumbledore is the secret keeper of Grimmauld place which belongs to Sirius.

The very fact that James and Lily weren't their own secret keeper could also be said to be evidence that you can't be your own secret keeper.

The problem I have with your theory is that none of your points have very strong evidence. It's still possible that Bill and Arthur would choose to both be secret keepers even if you can be secret keeper to more than one secret. It's possible that the Potters were an old family and only had one property. It's possible they didn't have very many heirlooms, or they were just left in Godric's Hollow because there was no one to take them.

I would say that it fits with canon rather than actually being supported by it. And it doesn't even do that that well. There are other problems with your theory. There is no reason for them to move to Godric's Hollow if they are already under the Fidelius. (Your point 2 makes no sense. They can still come over, they are not isolated). James and Lily are separate people. If they have two properties and can be their own secret keepers then why not one for each?

It's not a bad theory, and it could definitely have a place in a fanfic. But I don't think it's at all supported by the books. As Occam's razor says, the simpler explanation is usually better. In this case the simpler explanation is just that you can't be your own secret keeper.
