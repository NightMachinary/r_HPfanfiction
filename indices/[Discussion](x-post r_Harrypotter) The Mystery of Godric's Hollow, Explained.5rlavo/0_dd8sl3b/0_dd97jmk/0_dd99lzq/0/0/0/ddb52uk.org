I hate to necro this post, but I just can't let some of these arguments go unopposed.

First off, whether or not Shell Cottage belongs to Bill and Fleur is immaterial, because they are the ones protected by the Fidelius, thus being the ones who keep their own secret. If you could get around the 'you can't keep your own secret' clause you present as being part of the fidelius, *then why did James and Lily not try to get around it by moving to Sirius's flat?*

Second off, Dumbledore is the leader of the order of the phoenix, thus he is keeping his own secret when he makes the location of their headquarters a secret, in order to justify this, your argument must rest on the claim that the fidelius charm cares about property laws. I'm sorry, but that argument is /completely/ unsupported by the text, and sounds pretty damn absurd.

Finally, the evidence that James and Lily were not their own secret keepers supports both of our arguments equally, so it really shouldn't even be brought up as a justification.

For example, I could argue that James and Lily not being their own secret keepers is due to the restriction that the secret keeper of a fidelius charm can't have their first name start with a 'J' or an 'L', but to cite that as evidence for the 'no J or L' argument vs. the 'can't be your own secret keeper' argument is disingenuous.

As to arguing further for my theory, I'm just not going to bother, as it appears that you only skimmed through the theory I posted on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], and I'm not going to re-defend every point without context as you bring it up, then re-re-defend every point as you skim through my defense of each point you bring up.

I also want to point out once more that while my theory has only weak support from the books, the 'can't keep your own secret' theory is /directly contradicted by the text/ unless you start pulling assumptions out of nowhere.

Finally, 'the simpler explanation is usually better' is merely the layman's interpretation of Occam's razor, the actual principle states that, "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."

Where Assumption is a specific technical term which means "an unsupported claim" such as my claim that 'you can't keep two secrets' vs the competing theory's claim that 'you can't keep your own secret'. (Note that to use the conclusion, James and Lily chose Pettigrew as their secret keeper b/c they could not keep their own secret, as evidence for either of these two claims would be circular reasoning)

So, unless you can give me some evidence from the text which is best explained by property law/who owns a house being relevant to the functioning of the fidelius /without using circular logic/, then it appears to me that the 'can't keep your own secret' argument has two unsupported claims/assumptions in comparison to the Missing Estate argument's single unsuported claim/assumption, and Occam's Razor works in favor of my argument as opposed to yours.
