I'm glad you're not going to argue further, because it's obvious you're not listening to what I'm saying. The reason why I've been bringing up your points is because I have evidence against them or they don't make sense. You are not having to redefend your points, you are either coming up with new justification on the spot, or are just repeating the thing that I said doesn't work.

It does matter if Bill and Fleur own Shell Cottage because if they don't then they are not keeping their own secret. Just because the Potters could be secret keeper while living elsewhere doesn't mean they would want to. Dumbledore is not keeping his own secret, since the secret is the “headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix” which belongs to Sirius. You do not have any evidence against the opposing hypothesis, like you keep trying to claim you do.

Furthermore, you have more than one unsupported claim. In fact, most of your points are based on a lack of evidence. We don't see someone who is keeping two secrets, we never hear about the “Potter Estate”, there are no relics.

You also did not address the problems I have found. I don't see how you can claim that Occam's razor works in your favour, since you have multiple unsupported claims and evidence against your theory. There is a reason why the hypothesis currently used is that you can't keep your own secret. It is most likely right.
