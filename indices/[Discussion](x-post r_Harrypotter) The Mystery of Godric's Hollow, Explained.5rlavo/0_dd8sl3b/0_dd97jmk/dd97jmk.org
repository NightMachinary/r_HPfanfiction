My argument for the Potter Estate existing stems from the fact that the Potters from Harry's branch are at the bare minimum well-to-do, and over 800 years old.

The argument against the existence of the Potter Estate assumes that the Potters had no other homes and possessions aside from the one in Godric's Hollow. This despite the family being nearly 800 years old and, in the least charitable interpretation of my argument, at the very least recently rich (Fleamont Potter created the Sleekeazy hair potion and sold the company for 'a vast profit' upon retirement) and in decent standing in the Wizarding World (Henry Potter was a member of the Wizengamot). I find it difficult to believe that such an ancient family would have exactly one home in a quiet suburban town and nothing but a large pile of gold in their vault.

Now, I'm not claiming that the Potter Estate is some mythical castle with unicorns falling from trees and a dragon conservatory, nor am I claiming that they had a bunch of hidden magical knowledge and artifacts squirreled away in the 'Real Potter Vault' which Harry never gets access to.

What I am claiming is that this 800 year old, at least recently rich family, was not limited to a single house's worth of property and furniture, and that the absence of any mention of anything Harry inherited aside from a bunch of gold, seems to be a rather glaring omission.

Furthermore, my argument for the fidelius on this 'Potter Estate' would not only justify this omission, but also offers a better justification than the current accepted fanon for why James and Lily gave their secret to one of their friends, instead of keeping it themselves. I claim that my argument offers better justification for that mystery because the current accepted fanon either relies on equal or lesser circumstantial evidence in comparison to my argument, or boils down to 'Both James and Lily had unconditional trust for the other marauders, so much so that the thought of having either James or Lily keep the secret never crossed their minds'
