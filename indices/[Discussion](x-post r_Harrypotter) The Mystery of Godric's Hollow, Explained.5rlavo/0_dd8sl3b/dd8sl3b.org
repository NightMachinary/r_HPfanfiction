You seem to be trying to find loopholes in canon using fanfiction cliches like the Potter Estate and Harry's trust vault.

In the books it says:

#+begin_quote
  He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.
#+end_quote

It doesn't say that they moved house, and it could be assumed that they lived in Godric's Hollow before going into hiding. (The wiki is very unreliable). Even if they did move house, your theory doesn't really hold up. If they were already using the Fidelius charm on the "Potter Estate" then why would they need to move house? Surely they would be safe enough where they were.

Secondly, there is no evidence that the Potters are as rich as you think they are. They left Harry a vault full of coins. It doesn't say how much it is, and your idea that this was something done for every child has no evidence. The book says:

#+begin_quote
  "Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
#+end_quote

This implies that it was all inherited. And as for the relics (which there is no evidence that they even existed), they could easily been in the house in Godric's Hollow that was destroyed.

It's fine if you want to use your ideas in a fanfiction, but don't try to pretend there's evidence for them in the books.
