not sure there's any evidence that potters would have an estate. the blacks lived in a townhouse, and it was the only black home available to the order. presumably if they can defend one place they could do it too more. chances are wizards have no interest in land, and probably don't have a real economy with how they treat gold. with the information jk released about his family you probably can't even work out if he's in a main branch of their line, or if they kept everything in one line to begin with.
