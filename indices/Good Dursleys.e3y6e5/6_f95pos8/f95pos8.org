*Blindness* by AngelaStarCat. Petunia mourns for her sister and when she discovers that Harry is blind and realizes that the wizards would not want him, decides to not squander this second chance. Both Vernon and Dudley are good (i.e. they aren't child abusive monsters though they have their minor faults) and Dudley is very protective of Harry.
