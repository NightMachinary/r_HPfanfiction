I can tolerate 99.9% of disturbing topics, but I noped out of a fic that had a 16-year-old commenting on a 12-year-old's arse out of the blue. Disgusting.

The most disturbing fic I've ever read, though, had Harry getting possessed by Ignotus Peverell, raping Dumbledore's corpse, and killing Ginny to rape her corpse as well. At least it was written as a horror story, not fucked-up wank material.
