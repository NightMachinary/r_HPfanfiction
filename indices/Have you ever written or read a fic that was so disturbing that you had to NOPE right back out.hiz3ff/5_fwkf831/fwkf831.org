I once read a deeply disturbing fic that was basically about Harry having to become a sexual slave for the Greater Good â„¢. It was horrifying and not at all what I'm normally into, but it was so well-written that I couldn't stop reading. The topic itself was handled very well and the author clearly understood the nuances of what they were writing, but I seriously regret ever finding that fic.
