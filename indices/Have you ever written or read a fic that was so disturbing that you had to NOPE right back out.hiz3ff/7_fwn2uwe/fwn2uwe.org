I see in replies most going for particularly savage torture or rape and things along those lines but for me the most disturbing stories are the ones with angst filled Harry who has PTSD, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, with wild mood swing and all the rest of the depressing thing you can think of. A Harry that depressed to the point that he barely functions.

I try to avoid stories with this kind of Harry but every once in a while one slips thru or I gave one mild looking story a chance and regret it fairly quickly.
