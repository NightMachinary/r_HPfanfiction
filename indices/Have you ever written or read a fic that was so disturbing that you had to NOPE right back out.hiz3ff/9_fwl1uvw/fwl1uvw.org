there've been a couple. there's one fairly popular series with a fem!Harry (the name escapes me), that was engaging enough that I let the poor grammar and squicky storyline slide, but oof. definitely not on my "re-read" list.

then there was a story I legit couldn't finish (which almost never happens). it was definitely a case of dead dove lmao, the author said very clearly, "here's what's in the story" and my dumb butt read it anyway ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜µ (eta, I read about half because the author did a really good job of writing about it, and the plot was legit engaging, but eventually the combination of squick and I couldn't suspend disbelief anymore just made me nope out)
