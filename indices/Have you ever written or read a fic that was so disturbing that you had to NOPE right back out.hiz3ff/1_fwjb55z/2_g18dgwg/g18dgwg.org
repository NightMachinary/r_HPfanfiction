Ao3 is like the most evil website when it comes to fanfiction. Yesterday I was scrolling through it and saw a fic with a description that basically said it was about adult Harry and Draco violently sexually abusing baby Scorpius.

Time and again I'm convinced that they can't sink lower yet I'm proven wrong.

I won't be hypocritical and say I haven't read/enjoyed many high quality smut stories on ao3 but that website has ALWAYS allowed the worst of the worst people to post their shit on it. There's so many truly fucked up minds on that website.

More and more I'm of the opinion that that website should be removed from the internet. Mostly because it's virtually impossible to truly filter out ("creator chose not to use warnings") all the depravity and there's no way to make sure only an 18+ audience uses it. There are very few fics exclusive on ao3 that are actually good and you can't find on ffn.net so it wouldn't that big of a loss.

Also, ffn.net doesn't beg their readers for money every month or so. What they do with said money? Well, they certainly don't pay moderators to filter out pedophilia and rape. Then again, ffn.net makes its income with ads and I doubt any self respecting company would be willing to place ads on a website like ao3.

Perhaps Raid shadow legends might be interested?
