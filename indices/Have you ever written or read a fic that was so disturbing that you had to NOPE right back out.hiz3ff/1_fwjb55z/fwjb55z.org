A year or two ago, I read a few rape fics in the hope that "brutal revenge" would be the endgame, "law-abiding citizen" style. Needless to say, I got disappointed again and again. However, one which stuck out was FemHarry being forced into sexual slavery by the goblins and ending with Stockholm syndrome and FemHarry returning to the goblins after her /term/ was over.

Around the same time, a mate suggested a victorious goblin rebellion prompt. So I fused that with the desire to see the goblins punished from the fic above and then came up with a fic set in the early 70s where Bellatrix is the (anti)hero and basically an IRA-style terrorist against the goblins. I think it says a lot about the first fic when I made terrorist!Bellatrix the hero against the "love interest" from there. Never published it, but it's still on my GDrive.

There's plenty of other disturbing shit on Ao3, but nothing which made me hate a "love interest" that much.
