I mean, you could literally do a "law-abiding citizen" style fic where you are not sure whom to root for, the guy enforcing the law or the vigilante because the vigilante has a point but is also going way too far. But far too many fics end up with Stockholm syndrome, intended or not. And way too many romanticise that kind of shit.
