I tend to outright avoid fics that are intended to be disturbing, and don't really read smutfics so mine might be a bit milder then most. I semi-often nope out of slash fics when they involve obsessive, stalkerish behaviour or someone trying to 'convert' Harry. It seems to be a common trope with those and as someone that was briefly on the receiving end of that sort of attention, it creeps me out a ton.
