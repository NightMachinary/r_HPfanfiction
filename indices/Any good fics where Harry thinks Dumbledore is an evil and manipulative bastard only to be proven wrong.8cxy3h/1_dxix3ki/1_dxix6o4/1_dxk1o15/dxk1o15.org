Canon Dumbles is well-meaning but stupid (because Adults Are Useless and he's not the main character) and very, very much believes that great goods outweigh the small evils that they require---or, "the ends justify the means".

If at any point past, say, the fifth book, a magical switch was flipped from "these are characters/pawns/elements in a story, not real people" to "these are real people in a real universe with real goals and wants and needs" he wouldn't be evil. But, if the entire story was a bit more serious from the start, and he made the same choices, he very much would be.
