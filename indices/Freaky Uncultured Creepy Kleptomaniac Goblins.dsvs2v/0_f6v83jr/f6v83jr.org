took me like 2 rereads to understand this

for the people who are too lazy have a slightly shorter version with good grammar :

Basically goblins are massive assholes and decide to give middle finger to wizarding world by telling Harry they'll remove the horcrux from his scar but remove his soul and put it in a copy of hogwarts a history\\
Theres a Difficult Mode where the hogwarts a history book with harry's soul ends up in hermione's hands and it lead to HPHG\\
Hard Mode : Harry's soul ends up in sausages eaten by ron and ron gets his soul destroyed.\\
God Mode : Difficult + Hard + goblins are secret puppet masters behind pureblood stuff}\\
Bonus Points : Fem!Harry , Manipulative!Dumbledore(working to free wizarding world from goblins) , Snape dies in amusing and disgusting way.
