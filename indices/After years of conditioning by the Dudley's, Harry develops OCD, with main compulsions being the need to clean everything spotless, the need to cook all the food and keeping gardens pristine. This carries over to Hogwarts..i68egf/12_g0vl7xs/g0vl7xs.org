I distinctly remember reading a fic on ff where the whole dorm realised Harry was in a tizzy because he clearly had been cleaning again - just as thorough as the elves, but different. It was a passage I believe, and definitely not part of the main story, and I am sorry to say I can't remember which one it was.
