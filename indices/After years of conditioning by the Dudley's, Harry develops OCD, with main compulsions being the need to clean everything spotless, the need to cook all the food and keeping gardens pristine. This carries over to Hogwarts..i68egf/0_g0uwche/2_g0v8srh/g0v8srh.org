I mean maybe he has OCD and his compulsions have been fueled by the Dursley's treatment of him? From my understanding if a compulsion is encouraged it becomes harder to deal with and I assume they can be created from the world around them so him being made to clean, cook, etc could cause those activities to become compulsions. So his OCD would be more prevalent due to childhood trauma. I know a family friend and his anxiety got really bad (he doesn't leave his house or if anyone other than his parents and brother are at his home he won't even leave his room), his OCD became harder to manage in part due to this (to my understanding that is, he won't even talk to people online) so his environment has affected his OCD.
