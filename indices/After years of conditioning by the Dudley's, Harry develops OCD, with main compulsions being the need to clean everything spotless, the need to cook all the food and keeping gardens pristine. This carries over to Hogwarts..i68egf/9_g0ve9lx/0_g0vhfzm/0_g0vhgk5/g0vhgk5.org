  Hildegarde 'Hilda' Potter learned how to cook at a young age. She's interested but cooking but she ensures the Dursleys never get her best. Then came Hogwarts and its vast kitchens that got her in full-throttle, disregarding society's expectations of her. And her obsession with cooking made her avert disasters in her social life, but when war happened, she has her own way to fight.
