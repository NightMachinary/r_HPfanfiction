So, not quite what you are looking for, and it's also Fem!Harry, but "The-Girl-Who-Cooks" by Tuka Luna Marceau is quite a fun story. It's basically a female harry who goes to Hogwarts but only actually cares about becoming a chef and recognizes the wizarding world as a huge opportunity. I would link it but linking never seems to work for me
