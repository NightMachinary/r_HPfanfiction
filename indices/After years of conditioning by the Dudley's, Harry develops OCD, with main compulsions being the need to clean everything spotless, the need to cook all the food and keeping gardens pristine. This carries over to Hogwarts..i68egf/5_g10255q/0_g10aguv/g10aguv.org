/Continued/

Satisfied with his wish he then proceeded to get his required books easily enough.

Next was his wand and that place had been a mess yesterday. It was by far the dingiest place in the main alley yesterday. With its beat up store front and dusty cramped interior.

He had fixed it all up right away. He wasn't sure why but usually his wishes also made things space out a bit more when cleaning cramped places.

Why his room under the stairs was nearly the size of the rest of the house! He had filled it with many nice and interesting things over the years.

Now the wand shop was much more open and he was looking forward to getting his cover wand.

The old man had tried to draw it out but Harry had simply wished for the whole thing to hurry up and left in short order with the wand he though looked coolest.

It was a white oak with unicorn hair wand. It seemed pretty enough he guessed. Still he just wished for it to do whatever it needed to do and figured it would work out well enough.

He had flipped through the books though wasn't really impressed.

It seemed witches and wizards needed to go through some intensive training to even use simple magic.

Being a free genie was definitely the best choice.

He had only found three books that seemed worth reading. A history of magic book, a supplemental astronomy book a nice wizard had suggested, and the potions text book.

He realized he could wish for the potions, just like he could have wished for his school supplies. However, there was a joy in doing things be hand. To an extent that was, he didn't clean by hand anymore, his wishes did that far better and faster than he ever could.

He spent the next month visiting the Alley, reading his three interesting books and making sure his town was nice and clean.

Which led his to his current problem, he was leaving in a week.

He didn't want to have to wish himself back and forth all the time to keep the city clean.

They had won several awards for being the best maintained town in Britian it seemed.

The tourism was doing wonders for the economy, along with the grants, at least according to his Aunt and Uncle.

He needed someway to keep the town ticking along while he was off to boarding school.

It took him another two days to figure out a solution.

He had made his best wish ever! He had wished for any bound or trapped genies to appear before him!

That wish had nearly caused him to pass out, something no wish had done before.

Still he had an odd collection of several hundred items in his room now. He was sure from the sheer number that he was one of the last free genies.

He had then wished them free and happy as the first one had been angry.

He couldn't blame her, she had been trapped for thousands of years!

Wishing them all to be happy and healthy had been an obvious wish to make.

They had all be excited afterwards and he had explained his story to them. They had all promised to keep an eye out here and there on his city. Ensuring it was kept up while he was gone.

Several of them stayed a few days before he left, teaching him clever word tricks and how to twist the wishes of others.

It was good knowledge to have for sure. His favorite was an Irish genie who had a knack for making wishes into horrible curses after enjoying the wish for some time.

He said his goodbyes to all but Bres, the Irish genie. He took the form of a beautiful white cat, to act as his animal.

Bres had decided the extremely unusual wizard had the raw power to match those of the Kin. That said power had drawn from a pathological desire for order and cleanliness was beyond hilarious to him.

He had volunteered among the kin to watch over and evaluate the wizard child.

Freeing them had well and all, it was him using his magic to soothe their hatreds that had truly drawn the interest of all the Kin.

He would watch over and occasionally test the wizard child. If he succeeded they would likely elevate him to a true Kin. Most likely one of order, cleanliness and wishes, a most unusual combination he found great humor in.

Harry wished them both to the the train and soon found himself disgusted with it all. He had arrived a half hour early and the place was filthy!

He got to work right away cleaning the 9 and 3/4 platform. He had time to spare and set about getting the train up to his standards as well.

He was only on the second train car when it went underway but no matter. Needs must afterall and this train needed a good cleaning!

He spent most of two hours getting the train up to his standard. It was in the last car he found something that shook him to the core.

A fat rat as a pet! Rats were the least clean of animals. That wasn't even allowed as a pet!

Making a firm decision he decided to clean up all the pets as well.

The fat rat turned into a nice sleek brown tabby cat in the red headed child's hands. Nodding at a job well down he bang his journey through the train again.

Spiders, snakes, and slimy toads all quickly became good solid cats in short order.

Cats were a great pet, they kept themselves clean and buried their leavings.

*This has got away from me rather fast. Will have to go back, clean it up and post it to ff later. Hope everyone enjoyed it!*
