Harry looked at the mower in despair. It wasn't even close to full and the petro can was empty.

Aunt Petunia had decided the grass was a few centimeters to high and ordered him to mow it. Sitting down in the garage he let out a cry of despair again wishing the grass would be cut.

He felt that tingly feeling he got when something freakish was about to happen and felt even more despair.

Oh no, something bad was going to happen again and he just wanted the grass to be cut!

Suddenly he felt the tingly feeling leave him and looked on in amazement as the lawn was suddenly pristine!

Had he used his freakish powers to cut the lawn! From his fog of despair he rose like a phoenix in joy as the perfectly cut lawn!

His magic sung as his joyful emotions filled him for the first time with happiness over his use of magic.

Over the next few years he had learned to control his genie powers as he called them. Afterall what other stories did he know where wishes came true?

He wished for a clean house and got a clean house everyday. He wished for his aunt and uncle to feed him more, viola! More food was his at every meal!

He wished for Dudley to ignore him and Dudley couldn't even seem to remember he had a cousin it seemed.

Still he always wished for everything to be clean. He had been forced to make a desperate wish once again though.

His Aunt had taken him antique shopping and he had out of habit wished the dingy place to be clean.

That had almost got him a copping on the ear until he desperately wished that no one would take notice of him making wishes anymore.

Now he made it a point to walk the city, wishing away the dirty. Wishing everything to look newer, to be repaired perfectly, to be clean.

Afterall cleanliness is next to godliness and genies had godlike powers. Best to stay on the right track after all.

When he received his Hogwarts letter he had simply wished that his family would ignore it. He didn't have an owl but wishing for one had worked well enough.

Sending back a letter saying he would like to attend had been another wish.

He had got back another letter with a ticket to something called the Hogwarts Express.

He didn't know where to find the things he needed for his list but another wish solved that.

Finding himself in a dingy alley filled with fantastic things he had set to cleaning it up first thing.

Diagonalley was sparkling and fresh as a daisy within the hour. He saw an especially filthy little alley off to the side.

It seemed like the kind of place people disappeared into and he was leary of heading down it. Still needs must afterall.

Wishing himself to be unnoticed he began the arduous task of cleaning that filthy place to the cobblestone.

That took him the rest of the day as the shops were filthy as well!

Still it was done now, all shiny and clean. He had made a powerful wish that everyone would want to keep it clean as well.

It was late enough he needed to get to cooking soon so he wished himself home.

/Break/

The witches and wizards of Britian were in a stir! Something magical had happened today in both Diagon and Knockturn alley!

They hadn't noticed until the end of the day but the special edition of the Prophet the next morning made sure everyone knew, oh yes!

Both Alleys, and all their shops, had somehow been magically cleaned to perfection last evening.

As the witches and wizards looked at the newly cleaned alleys they wondered why it hadn't ever happened before?

Now that it was so perfect they fully planned to make sure it stayed that way from now on as well. It would be a right shame if they dirtied it back up!

/Break/

Harry finished his chores and wished himself back to the alley.

He realized he didn't have any money though so he performed on of his most feared wishes.

He wished for a fat stack of pounds to spend. He was always careful of making money wishes. In the stories that seldom turned out well. He figured since he was the genie though it would be fine.

He soon realized his pounds were useless until he changed them over to Galleons it seemed. The little gremlins had been helpful at their bank in changing his thousands of pounds into a fat stack of gold.

Thankfully he had brought his satchel and had long ago wished to it hold anything it needed to, while staying light on the weight. The gold, silver, and bronze coins had fit in nice enough.

He purchased everything on his list soon enough, minus his books and wand. Always making sure to wish them as the best and cleanest they could be after he did.

While he wasn't a wizard, they had to use a wand instead of wishing like he did as an unbound genie, he still got a wand none the less.

He had learned from the local library that genies were usually trapped in magic items so people could use their powers.

He did not want to get trapped, no thank you.

So he would pretend to be a wizard for now.

Firstly though he made his way to the bookstore and this time looked at the books. Yesterday he had just popped in and wished it clean real quick.

He froze in his tracks at what he saw.

Pictures of him in glasses, he had wished his eyes better years ago, with his old scar, also wished away. Though that one had brought him to his knees in pain as he cried black tears for some reason.

Worst of all was the messy hair! As if he would let his hair ever be messy!

Still seeing the books about him he knew these witches and wizards must know he was a genie! They wanted to find him!

Wishing harder than ever he wished that no one would ever realize he was actually The Harry Potter, instead they would all think of him as a perfectly normal wizard who happened to be named Harry Potter (no relation).
