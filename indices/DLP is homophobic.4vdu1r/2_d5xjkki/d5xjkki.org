I think this quote from one of the members sums it up. I'd like to preface it by saying that in my opinion, being anti-slash does not mean you are homophobic. I can't stand to read slash, not because I have anything against gay people, but as a straight guy, if I can avoid reading about 2 or more men having sex or being intimate, I will.

"My point is, there has been (for quite some time) a shift in attitudes on DLP, from homophobic Ginny-hating Nazis to appraising fiction for the standard of its literature and not for its position on homosexuals or red-heads.

I'd like to think so anyway."

This was in response to an Administrator writing,

"This site was founded specifically to cater to people who hated slash. There are lines, and this thread crosses it by a lot. It was a huge decision to let slashers even be on DLP without hiding it [Typa was the first]. This isn't a precedent that needs to be set."
