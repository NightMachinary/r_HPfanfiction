Please stop creating drama. This is the second time you've created a DLP-bashing thread in a month. While there are plenty who would rather just [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43ma1p/i_havent_been_on_the_dark_lord_potter_forums_in_a/czli5d9][shitpost insults]], there are also many decent users who have interesting opinions on the HP world, so you won't find much traction for this kind of idiocy.

They have their problems (I wonder if they'd consider sending something like [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=229328&postcount=220][this]] to their employer), but so long as they refrain from telling redditors to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zx0iw/a_very_long_rant_about_stupid_fanfiction_reviewers/cyqk5ch][kill themselves]] they should be welcomed here.
