I should clarify I'm not part of DLP, I made one or two posts over there several years ago and then dropped out of the fandom for a while. I just don't see this as a threat or a genuine suggestion for someone to kill themselves. The OP made an exaggerated claim that he would rather drown (and it's not unreasonable to think that his statement suggests suicide) than go back to DLP, which is an inherently tongue-in-cheek comment. And then the other poster said that they have the right to self-determinate, also said in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It's a joke on both ends, not a serious suggestion for someone to commit suicide.
