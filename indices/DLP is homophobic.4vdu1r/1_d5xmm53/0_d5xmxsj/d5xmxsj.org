People are probably disagreeing with the OP because of their history on this sub. As for being irrationally hostile towards slash, such fics have a reputation (however undue) of being disproportionately bad. Given that DLP is a predominantly Harry-centric forum, and that a large fraction of fics where Harry identifies as gay present him as an effeminate character, well... That's very far from Canon!Harry. Note that they hold almost as much contempt for Gary Stus.
