I have no idea why the comment section here doesn't agree with you, because being irrationally hostile toward slash is a founding principle, but DLP prides itself in being what it is. They aren't going to change and a discussion about them would probably not benefit anyone.

They have an actual sub forum to shame other members.

Treat it like [[/r/watchpeopledie][r/watchpeopledie]], pretend it's not there and you will feel better about the world.

This Quote stems from the slash recommendation thread linked in the OP.

  Slash recommendations? Start with your wrists... (I keed, I keed, but what happened to this forum to allow this post to remain here all day without a single GTFO?)

Ugh.
