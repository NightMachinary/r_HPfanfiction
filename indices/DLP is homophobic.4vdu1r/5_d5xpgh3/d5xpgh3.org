I'm not a fan of DLP by any means, but can we please stop bringing it up all the time? I cancelled my membership there after six days because I realised that I hated it - other people are still there after six years. Some of those people are on this subreddit, and they love DLP, so all threads like this do is promote arguments (not discussion, *arguments*, as in pointless bickering). They don't change anyone's minds about each other or slash fic or anything else, they just create resentment. If you don't like it there, do what I did: leave, and don't look back. Don't spread your bitterness over that group's...existence far and wide, because you can't change them and you can't destroy them.

Hate is a huge problem in the world today. Don't be part of the problem.
