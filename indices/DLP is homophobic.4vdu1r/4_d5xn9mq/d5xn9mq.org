Honestly, I think this all stems from how we define slash. To some, slash means fanwork involving a gay relationship. To others, it entails /poorly written/, distasteful stereotypes of gay relationships. The way I figure it, DLP generally defines it as the latter.

It'd be a shame to generalize such a diverse group of dedicated fans as homophobes. I've seen slash recommendation threads there that were met with good faith suggestions. And if some DLP users wanna avoid slash discussion as a rule, that's their choice and we should respect that.
