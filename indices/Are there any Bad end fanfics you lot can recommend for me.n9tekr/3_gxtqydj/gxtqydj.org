linkao3(whom the gods would destroy)

this one, the bad ending already happened and its a post apocalyptic scenario of momentous destruction. there is a happy ending at the end so it might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it would definitely scratch the itch for a horrifically dire situation for the wizarding world.
