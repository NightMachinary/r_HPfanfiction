My main issue with bashing is that it's /lazy/ writing. For instance, Ron - he's a great character, but a bunch of people want to start halfway through canon and sideline him. So instead of coming up with a believable way of doing so, they caricature him.

I don't mind a negative portrayal of any character - or a positive one. However, it needs to be done in a good/believable way - and bashing almost entirely fails that. That's doubly true when someone is following canon at the start.
