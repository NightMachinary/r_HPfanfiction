I disagree.

Bashing, at its core is rewriting the character in a different way. The bashing author is emphasizing perceived negative traits the characters in an exaggerated manner. Sure, you might disagree with the authors interpretation of the original characters, but that does not mean that it's bad writing.

On the contrary, if you take a step back and consider the fanfiction as it's own work of literature, you'll see that the bashing serves as a very legitimate literary purpose. In many of the bashing works I've seen, the author is trying to portray Harry (or whoever the protagonist is) as having the opposite trait. They use the bashed character as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_%28literature%29?wprov=sfla1][foil]] to emphasize this trait. Telemachus' cowardice highlights Odysseus' bravery. The lazy Ron highlights Harry's diligent work ethic. The greater good Dumbledore highlights Harry's care for the individual. The fangirl Ginny highlights Hermione's dedication and usefulness to Harry.
