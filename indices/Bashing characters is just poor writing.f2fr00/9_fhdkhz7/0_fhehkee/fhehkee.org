Rewriting the character in a different manner is fine. Bashing is going further.

For instance, let's take Ron. We have a canon version of Ron that we can all look at to compare - now, let's imagine someone writing a fanfic involving a change to his character.

Fanfic A starts at the start of 5th year, with the previous 4 years being unchanged in the backstory. Ron gets disposed of in 3 chapters, by having him be a complete lazy slob who is just hanging around Harry to try to get his grubby hands on his gold. Then he's only brought up later to get laughed at. That's bashing.

Fanfic B also decides that it wants Harry to have another best friend. Instead of just making Ron into a full on caricature out of the blue, it starts an earlier divergence - say, Harry sitting next to and befriending Neville on the train and not running into Malfoy. Without the strong desire to stay away from that, Harry gets sorted into Slytherin - and Ron dislikes him due to that. That's not bashing.

Even very negative changes from canon can be done without bashing - a well written evil, scheming Dumbledore one would be a lot of fun to read for instance. But bashing is when it crosses over into being lazy and not making sense, and it just hurts the quality of a fic.
