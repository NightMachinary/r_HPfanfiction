You cannot step back and pretend that canon does not exist /when the premise for the fic is that it starts/ *after* /some part of canon/.

In your Fanfic C, if we see Ron's introduction to Harry from the start, and his characterization is consistent from that point onwards, that's one thing. If instead it starts after a supposedly canon first 3 years, it's another. In addition, for bashing purposes, it does depend on how Ron is presented (IE, if he's a normal student level of laziness like in the books, vs the laziest guy ever.)

Most Ron bashing goes way further than what you seem to be implying. For instance, there's a fic I read recently that had good writing, a fairly unique premise that I was enjoying - and then threw in Ron suddenly saying that he was only hooking up with Hermione because there was no other option until the younger girls 'filled out proper-like', that she was a nightmare, and generally agreeing with someone calling her super ugly - and all, of course, to have Harry end up with Hermione. That's fairly typical for Ron-bashing in my experience.
