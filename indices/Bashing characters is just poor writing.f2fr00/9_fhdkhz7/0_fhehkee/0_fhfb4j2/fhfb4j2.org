  We have a canon version of Ron that we can all look at to compare - now, let's imagine someone writing a fanfic involving a change to his character.

In determining whether or not something in a fanfic is bad writing, you need to take a step back and /pretend that canon does not exist./ You must evaluate the work as its own independent work of literature.

Consider for an example Fanfic C where the author is trying to write a more studious Harry. Throughout the book, Ron is single-mindedly focused on chess is quidditch. He repeatedly tries to convince Harry to procrastinate on his studies by playing a game of chess or quidditch with him, and Harry always declines, choosing to instead work on more important stuff.

Many would consider this to be Ron bashing, and the author might even label it as such. However, when evaluated as its own independent work, it is by no means bad writing. On the contrary, Ron in this story is a textbook example of a foil, his laziness serving to highlight Harry's studiousness. Maybe it's because I tend to stick to the M rated fics, but it seems to me like the fics bashing Ron are more like Fic C.
