*Foil (literature)*

In fiction, a foil is a character who contrasts with another character, usually the protagonist, to highlight qualities of the other character. In some cases, a subplot can be used as a foil to the main plot. This is especially true in the case of metafiction and the "story within a story" motif. The word foil comes from the old practice of backing gems with foil to make them shine more brightly.A foil usually either differs dramatically or is an extreme comparison that is made to contrast a difference between two things.
