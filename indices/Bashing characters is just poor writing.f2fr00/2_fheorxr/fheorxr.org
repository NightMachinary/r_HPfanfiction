I read a story where the main character belittled and insulted Ron from the first meeting. He didn't do this to other characters, just Ron. Keep in mind that this was while Ron was 12 or 13. There was some time travel shenanigans but still. It was cruel and vindictive and put me so strongly in Ron's camp that I can't recover.

there is precedent for this behavior though. Snape is a bonefide gryfindore basher. And Potter basher at that. In fact, throughout most of the story snape seems to delight in being deliberatly cruel and unfair to the majority of the books main characters.

but I wouldn't want to bash Snape.
