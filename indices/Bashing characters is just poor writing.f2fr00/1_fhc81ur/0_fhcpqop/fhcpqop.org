I feel like there's a difference between Ron & Dumbledore having a negative role and Snape or Draco having one though. If you portray Draco or Snape in a lazy antagonistic role, that somewhat goes with how they react to Harry in canon, even if it lacks their canon depth. If Ron, or another "light" character, does the same thing /without explanation/, it's OOC because it's a /major/ jump from their canon protrayal, at least from the perspective we're given (Harry's).

Rather than negative or positive portrayals, I think the complaints about bashing are more about whether their behaviour is justified within the fic universe compared to their behaviour in canon. And character POV matters, obviously.
