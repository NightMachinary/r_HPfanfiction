Bashing, yes. But making a character have a negative role in your story isn't poor writing. Having the ability to write a flawed character or even a villain is great writing.

And really, if we're going to talk about character bashing, how many people just bash on Severus Snape, both in this sub and in fanfiction? I would argue that if you're going to say no bashing Ron/Dumbledore or anyone else, no bashing Severus. He can be redeemed just the same if you don't like how he was canon.

Having negative characters is okay.
