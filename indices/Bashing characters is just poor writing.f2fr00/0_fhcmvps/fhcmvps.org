I also hate bashing and think it's the mark of an immature writer who can't craft a storyline without crutches, but people really gotta stop putting the sole blame on the movies for people not liking Ron. The movie version of Ron was indeed a travesty, but there were people who didn't like him before the movies started coming out.

Yes, I'm old.
