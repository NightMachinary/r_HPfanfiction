I prefer not to bash them but instead have characters act like mature people that everyone loves to portray them as and just ignore the offending characters. All the time Harry is a big mature lord so far above everyone else but he still whines like a bitch because Ron is only attracted to his fame and is jealous now. If he was so mature then he would simply stop being friends with Ron, no need for a big fight or argument to draw attention to it.
