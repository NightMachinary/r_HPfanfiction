I really struggle to write Dumbledore because finding the right balance with him is really hard. Some of his canon lines fit into any bashing fic, like the one where he tells Harry that what he has been through at the Dursleys was alright because he didn't turn out a spoiled brat. Or him doing nothing for Sirius at the end of PoA. Scenes like those are the reason I can't get behind a positive depiction of him. At the same time, I'm not buying the "steal form Harry, trap him in a marriage contract" fanon either.

I think that the best way is a manipulative, well-meaning version of him who is pretty flexible with his plans and cares about results. Rather than the generic "OMG, Harry got his Gringotts key, better confront him ASAP", I prefer a "well, that's an inconsequential change since it doesn't affect my plan to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Let Harry have some fun".
