There's a difference between writing a character that's negative like Snape and Malfoy, and downright bashing a character like Ron or Dumbledore.

You don't have to change Snape and Malfoy's personality, they're already asshats, so you can write them that way. But, if you write Ron into a asshat character, that just feels like you're bashing him. Unless you do it when Ron thinks Harry put his name in the Goblet, or something realistic like that in canon.

And you don't have to make Dumbledore completely competent, you can do it as necessary to fit the plot, but if all you do is write him in a bashing way, you might as well use him as little as possible.
