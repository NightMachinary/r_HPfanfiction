  Don't like how Dumbledore acted in canon? Change it to where he's a more positive role model and tries to help Harry out with different things.

The problem with a competent Dumbledore is that would resolve the plot in 5 minutes, at least for books 1-5. You have to keep him incompetent, otherwise you'll end up writing "Harry Potter does nothing while Dumbledore fixes shit".

  Why do people go straight to bashing instead of either keeping that character's role minor, having that character grow, or not be in the story at all?

Speaking from personal experience, sometimes, there's no good way to resolve a character if you aren't invested into them. I usually avoid writing Ron in important roles because I feel absolutely nothing for his character. Some falling out and then he and Harry are acquaintances rather than best friends.

On the other hand, what should I do with Malfoy? I don't see him changing for the better based on the changes I made in a 4th-year fic. And I don't see him leaving Harry alone either since that would be OOC. So he is stuck in the "toothless antagonist role".
