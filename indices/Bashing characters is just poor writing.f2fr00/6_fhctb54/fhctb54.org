Y'all, I'm sorry Ron gets treated like this so often. I'm terrible at writing him so I use Ron as sparingly as possible. I stan my Slytherins hard but I try to make that clear in the tags. I avoid bashing because I understand why others love those characters so much. I really, really hope I've followed through on that.
