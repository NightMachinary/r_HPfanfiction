Well, bashing can be good, but only if the author really knows what he is doing and only if stuff stays realistic. Most are exaggerating so hard that it just becomes plain silly.

For me, character bashing, is an art. It has to be subtle to truly work, and if it's done well, it can be great. But yeah, most stories that go for character bashing as just plain stupid. The main victims of bashing are mostly Dumbles/Ron and they are always so badly done that it's just too unrealistic to enjoy.\\
Dumbles becomes an evil schemer who gets away with everything he does, no consequences, and people still think of him as the holy leader of light even after he admits what 'evil' he has done in the name of the 'Greater Good!'\\
Ron starts to become a parody of a Griffidor Draco Malfoy. He antagonizes everyone, he becomes violent, he starts to plot his revenge for people ignoring him, etc. etc. the typical stuff.

Anyway, I like bashing if it's done well since the author can criticize the character in a slightly comedic way. However, I hate bashing when the author decides to go crazy because trying too hard to be funny.
