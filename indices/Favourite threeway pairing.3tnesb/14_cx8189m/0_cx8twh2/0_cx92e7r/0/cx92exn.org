      This is a bedtime story/gift written for TarnishedAngel\. Be warned: It is rather \(too\) lengthy \- approximately 426K words \(Part I: Reconciling the Past \(Chapters 1\-20\), Part II: 6 Days To Eternity \(Chapters 21\-31\), Part III: Her Dark's Own Light \(Chapters 32\-50\)\. This fic was written over a 4 year period from 2008\-2012\.  I was fortunate to find many great friends through the writing of this story\. Many of them offered great feedback and a critical eye as betas\. The betas for this story are:  Lady of Clunn \(1\-50\); WeasleyWench \(Ch\. 2\-35\); DynoNugget \(Chapters 20\-34\); Wildcatcdc \(Chapters 35\-40\); LiterarySpell \(Chapters 35\-49\); Dee Michelle \(Chapters 35\-43\); and Kerri240879 \(Chapter 50\)\. Plot Beta: Emily Waters \(from Chapters 18\-50\); Brit Picker: Lady of Clunn Other Contributors: Tarnished Angel for the very detailed challenge; Julian Venere for the concrit and feedback; Sara D\. a\.k\.a\. ForgetfulLove for the wonderful donated artwork \(Ch\.39\), Del Borovic for the amazing commissioned piece \(Ch\. 14\); and TriosPleasure for the awesome banner\.This story is AU in that it ignores some of Book 5 and all of books 6 & 7, unless I thought it served as a nifty plot device\.  And finally, please note that while this story contains BDSM elements, it is a fantasy, and should not be taken as an effort to portray "proper" BDSM relationships :::rolls eyes::: :DDisclaimer: The characters and canon situations in the following story belong solely to JK Rowling\. I am not making any money from the publishing or writing of this story\.
