I do, but only a couple. Despite how popular the pairing combinations are that make up that trio (Drarry, Dramione, Harmony), there is not much for content outside of oneshots when it comes to the three together. I have only found a couple that I liked.

I really liked linkffn(9596920) The Soul of the Wolves. It was based off a writing challenge and the original story for that challenge is linkffn(9237863) Paw Prints in the Sand. I thought Soul was better than Paw Prints by quite a bit but I put it in here in case you wanted to check both out.

Also a much shorter, but good series is [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/37166][Raging Sensations]].

There's a pretty good one with the three of them plus Ron as well, of all people (so 4 instead of 3). Here's the link to that one too if you're curious. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/959572/chapters/4051674][Bound by Duty]] by SoftObsidian74
