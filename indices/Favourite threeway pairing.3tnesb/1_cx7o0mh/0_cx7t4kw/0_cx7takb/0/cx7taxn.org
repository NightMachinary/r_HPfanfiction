  What would happen if a certain pink hair Auror was introduced to Harry a little sooner? What if Voldemort was less concerned about secrecy and had built up his forces while he was without a body? A storm would gather and like always Harry will find himself in the middle. Takes place during Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. HarryxTonksxFleur.
