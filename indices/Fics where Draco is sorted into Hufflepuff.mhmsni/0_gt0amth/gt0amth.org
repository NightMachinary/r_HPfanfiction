There was a fic in which the Weasley Twins either Confounded or potioned the Sorting Hat so that it sorted everyone in Harry's year pretty much at random. It was hilarious, and I think it was posted on LiveJournal by someone whose nick was something including "Corvidae". I can't remember the title either.

Harry and Draco were in Hufflepuff, Hermione and Neville in Slytherin, Pansy and Ron in Ravenclaw, and I forgot who went to Gryffindor.

Does anyone remember?
