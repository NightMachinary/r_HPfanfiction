So, if you're interested in a dark Hermione, I just read what's available of Coven linkao3(15234645) and it's probably one of the better portrayals of a dark character. I think she has a slightly easier time finding additional allies than is realistic, but it's so clear that what she's doing is wrong, and that her friends who are worried about her (the villains in her perspective of the story) actually have some really good points. It's probably not to everyone's taste, and I was put off by the summary at first, but I was really pleasantly surprised.
