Writing a compelling evil character is difficult once you go past "Anakin Skywalker wiping out the tribe who kidnapped and tortured his mother" levels of evil. The list of people you can torture without being properly evil for example is rather short. The Dursleys, the Death Eaters, Umbridge and maybe Marietta (depending on how much you focus it as an anti-Voldemort group and not just a study group) and Lupin (if Harry takes the abandonment personal). As much as the Weasleys bore me, you cannot find a good reason to torture them. Same goes for most other background characters.

So as soon as Harry starts to randomly murder people, he stops being a compelling character. Especially since a lot of the valid targets are usually on Harry's side in those stories.
