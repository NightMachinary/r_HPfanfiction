Tell me about it, in linkffn(A Cadmedian Victory) he starts off as simply a guy who wants to live his life and his first kill is in self-defense, then his second is kinda selfish but understandable then it gets worse and worse until he goes full Indy!Harry, problem is that the rest of the world is not a Indy!Harry one and so instead of a hero who rules over the world eventually he becomes a monster, true, one with a reason behind the madness and actual repeatable goals, but still a monster.
