I'd agree with that, yes. It's hard but, to me that's what makes it so interesting when done right. I just widh more authors would give it a go. I mean, I understand if they try and don't do it perfectly, this is fanfiction and very few fanfic authors are professionals. But I appreciate the attempt.
