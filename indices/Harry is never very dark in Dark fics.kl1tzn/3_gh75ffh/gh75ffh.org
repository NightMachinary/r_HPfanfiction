Have you tried Antithesis ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis]])

super dark and depressing, and the start is somewhat slow, but it is absolutely beautiful.

Not for the weak hearted, the protagonist goes through a lot of negative emotions in this and doesn‘t occupy the moral highground. Thus can be challenging to read.

It‘s the only dark!Harry fic I know where I actually consider him dark, and not merely edgy. Most of the others I‘ve read have him doing crazy fucked up magic (like baiting dumbledore into a fight, killing him and returning him from the dead enslaved with her crazy necromancy), but the protagonist still seems to win at the end and his moral standpoint isn‘t worse than those of his antagonists. Even if he imperiuses the queen, founds a sovereign magical state, and kills all muggles (although that was a grey!Harry fic I believe)
