Yeah, this was a great fic, but definitely a huge bummer. I think the biggest thing for me that made it feel more "real" was that there is no point when what Harry's doing is justified. Even Harry himself doesn't really approve, he just gets in deeper and deeper and can't get himself out, and it costs him a lot. He's never rewarded for his bad actions.
