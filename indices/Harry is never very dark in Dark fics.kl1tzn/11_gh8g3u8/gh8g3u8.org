Harry is never very Dark in those fics because the term is usually Harry using more dark magic that what Dumblydore approves of. That's Dark!Harry. There are some fics that make Harry sadistic as shit and slap on the Dark! tag.

Dark Harry, for me, is someone who uses a lot of the Slytherin and Gryffindor techniques in the best/worst ways. He is self aware, he is cunning and ambitious, he is loyal to an agenda and is brave to the point that he can cross the lines of good and evil without going into a moral panic attack (see OoTP). Dark!Harry is not a total mirror of Tom Riddle, because he himself cannot have the exact same traits as Riddle, his environments are different etc.

I also think that many Dark!Harry fics allow Harry loads of friends, specifically in Slytherin. Even though most people who have been "dark" or "bad"in history, are charming but are usually in their lonesome. Harry should be a bit awkward, growing up without a strong social environment, he hasnt had many friends so he's cold but can turn up false charm to get things.

This may not seem like "dark" traits, but they're traits that can be utilised easily in dark circumstances - Harry is not a carbon copy of Riddle but he's not completely different to him either. I mean the boy has a part of Riddle's soul in him lol.
