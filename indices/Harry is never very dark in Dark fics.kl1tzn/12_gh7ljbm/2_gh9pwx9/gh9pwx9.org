Honestly the tragic backstory rationalization people always try to give Voldemort completely ruins my enjoyment of stories where he's the protagonist. I just want to read about a demented psychopath with zero conventionally redeeming qualities trying to conquer the world just because he wants to! Not because of some oh-so-sympathetic backstory.
