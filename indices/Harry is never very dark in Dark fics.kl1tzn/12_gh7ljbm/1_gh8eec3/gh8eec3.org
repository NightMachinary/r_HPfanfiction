In the same way as Voldemort's backstory you could have a Harry who instead of after being abused by the Dursleys going along with Dumbledore, simply have him be angry at him for placing him there; have Harry hate muggles because of his experience with the Dursleys. Then he has reasoning to go dark, and it's not simply one-dimensional.
