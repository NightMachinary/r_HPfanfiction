I don't know where you got the impression that I think a Dark Harry should be “truly evil” with “no redeeming qualities”.

Just because he does bad things, and perhaps does them for a cause we as the reader don't agree with, or makes decisions he himself sees as immoral for a greater good, does not make him an unsympathetic character.

I'd suggest you take a look at the fics I've given as examples of what I see as a good Dark Harry, if you don't think it's possible to write Harry as sympathetic without flipping the moral axis of the universe on its head simply to justify all of Harry's decisions.
