Word of caution to anyone who's never read this series before: it does not get better (regarding mood/tone- the writing itself is fine). The series starts dark, grows progressively darker, then finally takes you to the soul crushing maw of the center of a black hole from which your ability to enjoy life for the next few weeks will never escape. It does not get better. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is only suffering. You have been warned.
