Yes. I also find this problem when trying to find Snape or Malfoy focused stories which is annoying as they are my preferred characters b/c of their bad qualities, so I don't want them whitewashed or redeemed. If you don't mind not Harry focused, have you read Black Ink,Red Rose? It is Ginny spiralling after the Diary.
