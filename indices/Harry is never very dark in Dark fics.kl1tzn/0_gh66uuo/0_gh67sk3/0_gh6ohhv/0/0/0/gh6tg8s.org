Curious. I mean, maybe you have a harder heart than me, because I probably would have made Draco just give up on his beliefs, face rejection by his parents and be with Colin, but their relationship would be fraught because Draco is still going to hold the feeling that purer blood is better and that muggles (say Colin's parents for example) are lesser.
