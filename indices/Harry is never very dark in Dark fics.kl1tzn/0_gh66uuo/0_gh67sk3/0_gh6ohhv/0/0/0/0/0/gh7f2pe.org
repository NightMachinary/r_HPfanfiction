Yh, something like that. I mean, people are really very good at mental gymnastics and so I think it's very possible that Draco could believe that Colin is a person whom he can love, while still thinking purebloods are better. Hell, he could even decide Colin was an exception to the norm of insufferable mudbloods.

Not that I'm criticising your plot btw, it sounds good also.
