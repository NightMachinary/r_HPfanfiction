What's his motivation there then? To stay with Colin I mean. If he still truly believes that Colin's inferior to him then it can't be a relationship of equals, so how does Draco view their dynamic? Or does it involve him sorta trying to rationalise things away by maybe trying explain how generally purer blood leads to better magic and that sure Colin's parents are people too but they're just not really people he cares about or holds any respect for because he feels there's like an unavoidable divide between them? And then what's Colin's motivations for being with Draco?
