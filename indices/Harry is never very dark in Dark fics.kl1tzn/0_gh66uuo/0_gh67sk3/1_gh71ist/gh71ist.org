I think the big issue is too many people do not consider revenge as Dark.

In canon, Harry use the crucuato curse. You need to really want to hurt someone for it to work.

If in your world and by your own moral compass consider there is no valid reason for torture, then Harry does something pretty dark.

We still sympathize with Harry because we love McGonagall, and the jerk spit on her. But torturing someone is still morally very wrong, no matter what.

A good Dark Harry fanfiction should start from there. Or something like that. But slowly, his reasons are less understable and victims are less and less dark themselves.

And the line of "wrong for the right reason" and "wrong for the wrong reason" becomes less and less clear as more torture and killing are done.

Like killing in self-defense slowly become killing someone we know will commit a crime, than is likely to commit a crime then look like someone that might commit a crime someday etc etc.
