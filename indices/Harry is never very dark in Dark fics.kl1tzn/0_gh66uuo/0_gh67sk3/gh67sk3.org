Yh. I see a lot of those too. I mean, I'd not mind if from Harry and his cohort's perspectives the other houses were the real bullies, so long as the authors establish that things are not so black and white, but in reverse.

I think this stems from the very black and white world of cannon, where JK established that Slytherins are bad and Gruffindors are good.

But just flipping that completely doesn't actually improve anything. It's kind of like going: I want to help all the poor people in the world by taking all the money rich people have and leaving them poor (this isn't any political commentary btw, it just seems like an easy example)
