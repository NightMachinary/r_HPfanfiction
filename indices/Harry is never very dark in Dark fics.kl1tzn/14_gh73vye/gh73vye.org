I have a question about this one-shot I wrote. Where does it fall on your spectrum of dark!Harrys?

more directly relating to your discussion, I find that interesting stories rely on nuance which is why there's a temptation to turn the evil people into good people, disregarding the stories where the evil people are turned into good people for shipping reasons. Misplaced anger at *M*olly and *D*umbledore, on the other hand, seems more and more to me like redirected anger at *M*om and *D*ad.
