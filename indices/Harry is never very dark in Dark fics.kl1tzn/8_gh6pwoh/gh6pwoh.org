It think the problem is that the fandom has two definitions on what "dark" is. There is what you are looking for which is a moral aspect with dark being evil and there is the magic aspect, which is often not moral (or rather it is, but the authors remove the moral implications of necromancy and sacrifices of living beings). Most dark!Harry fics are just stories of him doing cool magic, but they keep his character as is, and as the other canon dark magic practitioners are all death eaters they now need to be nice.

And I think you meant am pedophilic union with Voldi and Snape (and maybe the elder Malfoy)
