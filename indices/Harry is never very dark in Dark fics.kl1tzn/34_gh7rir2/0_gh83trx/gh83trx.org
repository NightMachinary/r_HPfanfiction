I don't think you really understand what I mean. I'm not saying I want a baby-murdering, gratuitously evil Harry, or even an evil Harry, depending on what you consider evil.

If you think that a tragic fall to the Dark makes for an uninteresting protagonist, then you've clearly never read Macbeth, or at least would consider it boring.

What I mean, is a Harry with a fundamentally different view on the world than cannon Harry, that leads him to do some immoral things, that only get worse over time. You might call that fundamentally evil, but I'd not.

And I don't think most Dark Harry fics provide this, because they just completely justify all of Harry's decisions.

Surely you see that there's a difference between a Harry who is fundamentally evil and a Harry who makes decisions that we may view as immoral, or that Harry himself may view as immoral, but see as necessary and become desensitised too?

And I don't appreciate the condescending suggestion that I'll “outgrow” this, thank you.
