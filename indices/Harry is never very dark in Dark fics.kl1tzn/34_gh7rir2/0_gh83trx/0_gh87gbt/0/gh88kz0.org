My proverbial knickers are in a twist because you seemingly either didn't read my post before commenting, or clearly didn't bother to actually absorb what I had to say. I conclude this because few others seemed to think I was looking to make Dark Harry horribly evil, so I don't think my post was particularly misleading.

Nonetheless, I apologise if I'm slightly more annoyed than I really need to be.

But moving on, I think that such tags work well enough, because with so much work out there, it isn't as though you can find what you're looking for without using tags to narrow stuff down.
