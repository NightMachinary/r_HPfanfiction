  But moving on, I think that such tags work well enough, because with so much work out there, it isn't as though you can find what you're looking for without using tags to narrow stuff down.

They could, but a label like Dark!Harry is inherently useless for what you just described to me (a story with a hero's fall from grace, etc.). Do you think "Dark!Boromir" would be applicable or that a serious author would describe their characters in such terms? I don't think anyone who writes with such subtelty would use a one dimensional label for a character that has many (interesting) layers.

I stand by what I said. There's good reason why stories with this label either have the problem that you described (it's merely using 'dark' symbolism, while in actuality it's just a role-reversal) or are just awful "Grr i'm so evil" edgy powerwank fantasies. The Dark!Harry label is good for people who are looking for one of those two types of stories, nothing else.

My advise would be to just read regular gen fics, that don't put Harry into one particular corner, and you'll probably be more likely to find something you'd enjoy. You're making it hard for yourself.

Edit: I'd probably say something similar to someone who's unhappy about the fics they find under the indie!Harry tag. These kind of tags represent a type of hp fanfiction sub-genre and most independent!Harry fics have very little in common with what I'd consider reasonable for a Harry who wants to be independent (in HP fanfiction land it's always lone-wolf Harry who antagonizes everyone and knows best; pretty much a recipe for disaster).
