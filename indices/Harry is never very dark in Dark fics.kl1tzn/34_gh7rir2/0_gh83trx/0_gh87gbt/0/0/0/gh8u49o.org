I agree with you to an extent, most fics under Dark!Harry will continue to be either Symbolic or Powerwanks, but at the end of the day I wish more of such fics were more mature and hope to encourage that. After all, scrolling down gen fics to find something specific is ultimately going to take a really long time. I only do this when I don't have anything specific in mind for what I want to read and am open to anything that catches my eye.

As for Indie!Harry, I wholeheartedly agree. It isn't my thing anyway, but you can find more mature fics tagged under Dark, I've never seen an actually mature independent Harry tagged as Indie
