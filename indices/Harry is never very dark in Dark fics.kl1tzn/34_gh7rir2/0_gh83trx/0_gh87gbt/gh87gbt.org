  And I don't appreciate the condescending suggestion that I'll “outgrow” this, thank you.

Oh don't get your knickers in a twist.

If you are truly looking for stories with mature themes you're not going to find them by authors who label their stories with "Dark!Harry", because they are either edgy/immature themselves or advertise their stories to such an audience. Meanwhile you are surprised that those stories don't turn out as you want them and make a huge reddit rant about it and also have the gall to be upset when someone tells you "gee, why are you surprised?!". Really?

FYI: Shakespeare didn't call his plays "Dark!MacBeth".
