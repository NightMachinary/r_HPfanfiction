It's because fundamentally evil characters don't work as protagonists for actual stories. It's just a fantasy / power wank. Somewhat decent authors realize this (too late) and that's why suddenly the "dark" become the good guys.

  Edgy as it may be, I like villainous characters, and I like a hero's fall to the dark even more.

You'll probably outgrow this when you realize that they don't make for very good or interesting stories (as sole protagonists). I always like to point to Breaking Bad when talking about this: The more evil Walter White became, the more antagonistic (instead of protagonist) they made him and the show focused on other characters, made you root against him. He's the bad guy, you can't be on his side.
