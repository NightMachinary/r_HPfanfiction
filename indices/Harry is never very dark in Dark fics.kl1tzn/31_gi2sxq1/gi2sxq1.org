THANK YOU!

Be it "Dark!Harry" or any other trope, making canonically good people into jerks/evil in order to justify Harry cutting them out of his life (or in order to create tension) is just lazy writing to me.

For example, wouldn't it be much more engaging if Ron and Harry were truly close friends, but their friendship was put under lot of tension because of their clashing values (or misguided choices, third part's manipulation, etc.)? If we saw their relationship deteriorating and both sides are helpless to stop it? Yum and sad at once!

Or if you wanted Harry to pull away from Dumbledore's influence? Instead of making Harry magically see through Dumbledore's "nefarious manipulations" (or Dumbledore being evil in the first place), how about Good Ole Dumbles means well but may be misguided in what he thinks is necessary? And Harry is able to acknowledge the old man's faults without hating the man (which in itself is completely out of Harry's character, but ofc he is allowed to be OOC), so he forges his own path in whatever your given Harry thinks he should do. Take it as Dark or Light as you wish. Or maybe Voldemort appeals to some inner darkness of Harry's and lures him into joining ranks. Harry knows he'd be betraying all his loved ones but for one reason or another believes Voldemort's side is the right one to be on. Make him second-guess everyone and everything around him and spiral from bad to worse, whether emotionally or morally.

(( Also happens often in the romance department; "Hey actually Ginny is a total gold digging cow, better date /insert character name/ instead!!" ))

I'm spitballing with the "examples" here ã…¡ I'm not telling anyone my way is the highway. I simply think there's no tension and payoff in Harry's "fall" from the light if the "light" has no appeal in the first place.
