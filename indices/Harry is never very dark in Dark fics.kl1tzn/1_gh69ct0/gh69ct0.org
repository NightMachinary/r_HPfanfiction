  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

this is my favourite harry-goes-dark fic. (it's a oneshot)

It doesn't have any character-bashing (no dumbledork was actually evil all along, or weasleys only cared about harry's money ,etc.)

This portrays harry as a bad person who kills loads of people, but also a bit sympathetic (?)
