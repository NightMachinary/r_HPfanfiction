When I read the OP, I immediately thought about this fic. Harry is slightly cowardly, learns necromancy (not the one from crack stories, but the real, with grisly corpses), is friends with vampires, hags who are dangerous and support Voldemort... Dark Lord is a sadist, but also a genius. A greatly balanced story, with the dark side being dark.
