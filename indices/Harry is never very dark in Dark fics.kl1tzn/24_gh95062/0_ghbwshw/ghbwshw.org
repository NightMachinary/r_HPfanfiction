I'd definitely agree that it's because authors want Harry to do bad things, but not necessarily for him to disagree with them morally.

However, I think it's more than possible to write a Harry who has views that the author disagrees with.

And well, I think ascribing him villain status is fine so long as he's not cackling madly from day 1.

And I'm confused by you saying it doesn't work for a fallen hero. If somebody was to write a Harry who gradually strays farther and farther from the hero he used to be, then he's going to change over time, but it doesn't mean you can't ascribe tags that tell the audience what kind of character he's going to become over time.
