Shit, you're right. I agree it's possible to write a Harry you disagree with, but the discussion was on why Dark Harry isn't dark. My point about it being a not useful tag is that there is this much variance. Like read this thread, we all have different ideas of what that means. And only in terms of a description, not the actual story tags. My point was about stories that list tags instead of describing themselves. It's not specific enough.
