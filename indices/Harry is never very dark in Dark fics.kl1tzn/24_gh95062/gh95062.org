I always found the issue to stem from those authors focusing on Harry's actions rather than why he takes them. If someone eats babies for breakfast, and it's because he wants to break the substantial oppression against poor people, his actions don't logically follow. They want Harry to be dark, but they don't want him to be evil by conventional standards, they want him to follow their guidelines. If we're being honest, ascribing our main character immediate villain status isn't exactly conducive to engaging writing, because dark is supposed to be evil. Are we saying his actions are evil? Same rabbit hole. It's not very accurate if you want him to be the hero, fallen or otherwise. Also, you could make Harry both a death eater or a complete integrationist, and call him dark both ways, cause morality is subjective! To call him dark, you have to make him in the wrong somewhere. And so I petition for writing better descriptions. Also I'd like a story where Harry fights Voldemort because he thinks Tom's a hack, and he'd make a better dark lord.
