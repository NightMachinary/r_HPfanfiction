I don't want a sociopath? Unless you think that anybody who is selfish or cowardly or bigoted or anything is a sociopath?

I mean, an accurate depiction of Harry as a sociopath might be interesting, but I'm not at all saying that all Dark Harry fics should write a sociopath.

What I'm saying, is that a Dark Harry fic does not need to, and in my opinion should not, lest they make the entire point of a Dark Harry redundant, make the Light side evil and the Dark Side the good guys. It's more than possible to write characters who are human and sympathetic, but also flawed and not necessarily agreeable in their outlook on everything.

I'm literally just sick of: Molly Weasley is evil now and the Malfoys are practically perfect in every way. Because that is what nearly all dark harry fics do?
