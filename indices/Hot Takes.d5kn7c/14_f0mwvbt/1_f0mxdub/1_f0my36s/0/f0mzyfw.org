Once again I feel like critizing him for not planning things out well just kinda misses the point of his character arc.

He grew up in a deeply racist and abusive household and managed to escape it by making a new family out of his friends. James Potter wasn't just a good friend. He was Sirius's brother in all but blood and quite frankly saved his soul by giving him a way to escape his parents. James Potter meant literally everything to Sirius. The same is true of the other Maurders though to a lesser extent.

So now there's a war on. And everything has gone to shit. James, Lilly and Harry need to go into hiding. Everyone knows there is a spy but no one knows who. All Sirius wants is for James and Lilly and Harry to get through this fucking war alive. So when it comes to decide on a secret keeper he volunteers because he knows he's never gonna break. But Sirius is also clever and realizes the best way to keep everyone safe is to make sure no one actually knows who the secret keeper is. It's an extra layer of protection. So turns to one of his best friends in the world. One of two people he would trust, not only with his life, but lives of the people he loves most (it's not super clear why he thought Remus was the spy but I'm pretty it's cannon that he did and that limits his choices even more.)

Then that person turns out to have been the spy. It turns out that his choice got the only family he had left killed. And what happens when he tries to get revenge? He takes the fucking fall. He is, without trial or chance to explain himself, thrown into prison with what are easily the most horrifying creatures in the entire HP universe. He is forced to relive his worst memories over and over and over again for 12 YEARS. Try to think about how long that is real quick. Imagine what you were doing 12 years ago today, think about how much you've changed, how much has happened in your life. Now imagine spending all that time surrounds by creatures that feed off every hint of happiness you experience because someone you loved like family was a traitor, got your best friend killed, and everyone in the world thought it was your fault. Also you're surrounded on all sides by people you just got done fighting a war against. Just for fun.

Then you see a newspaper. And it shows that the man who caused all of this is alive. No scratch that. He's not just alive, he's fine! He's living with a lovely family that you know. That you fought beside and risked everything with.

Now you are so angry that manage to do something that's supposed to be impossible. You escape.

No one is going to make good decisions after all that. The fact that Sirius managed to avoid capture, the fact that managed to get to Peter, is incredibly impressive.

(Also yeah this very long but Sirius is my favorite character and I think about him a lot.)
