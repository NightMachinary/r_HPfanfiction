Okay but remember that Sirius just escaped from literal hell on earth after being wrongfully imprisoned for 12 years. And he only managed to do that in a fit of rage after realizing the man who put him there was alive and apparently doing fine.

Like Sirius is out for revenge. His whole motivation is kill Peter. Not clear his name, not even really to take care of Harry. I doubt Sirius thinks he deserves or is capable of that when he escapes.

Sure none of it was rational or smart. But I honestly don't think it's fair to expect him to be rational or smart in that situation. I know I wouldn't be.
