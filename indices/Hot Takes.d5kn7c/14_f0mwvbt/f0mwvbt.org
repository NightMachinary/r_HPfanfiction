Sirius's behavior in PoA is just straight-up the worst. "Everyone thinks I'm a mass murderer and that I want to kill Harry. Hey, let's stalk him, slash my way into the common room and stand over his bed, and ultimately drag his wounded friend into the terrifying shack with lethal deterrents across the entrance (when at least two people who would gladly kill me know exactly where it is)."

You know what he could have done? Sent an owl to anyone, from Lupin to Dumbledore to Harry himself, that just says 'bring Ron's rat to someone who can reveal Animagi. Protip: Feed it Veritaserum first. Or cast the Imperius, it's not illegal on animals. Cheers, Sirius." And then fucked off to another country to see how it all blew over.

It's not like he wanted to avoid tipping Peter off, considering he stalked Harry in dog form and openly showed himself on the grounds multiple times in that form, and broke into the dorms, etc.

It's not like he was going to keep him safer than an informed Dumbledore would have when he can't even be in the same room as Harry.

Just... don't be stupid.
