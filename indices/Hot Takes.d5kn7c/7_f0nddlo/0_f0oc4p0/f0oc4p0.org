In my opinion, Lucius yes, Draco maybe, Narcissa no.

Lucius had a litany of crimes before and during the war. I think Draco is a bit more iffy. He aided and abetted some Death Eaters to get into the castle but one could argue it was committed under duress. He fought Potter and co for the Diadem but it didn't really belong to either of them so it wasn't really stealing. Narcissa didn't really do anything besides keeping prisoners and opposing Potter and Co inside her own home which I assume wasn't illegal at the time since the Death Eaters took over and probably rewrote some laws. I guess she did consort with her sister and such but then her guilt depends on whether people in Magical Britain have a legal duty to report a crime.
