Honestly this probably isn't a "hot take" but... Remus isn't the mother/wet blanket of the Marauders. He was just as clever and mischievous as James and Sirius. Also, Peter deserves to be in Marauder Era Hogwarts/few years post Hogwarts fics. He's still a Marauder, he's still their friend. I get sad when I see fics that are "James, Sirius, Remus and... Frank? Yeah Frank I guess"
