There is nothing in canon to support the idea that Trelawney sincerely believed that any of those students were about to die. Again, her motivation wasn't to warn or to instruct, but to make herself appear impressive. So your false equivalence with the other subjects really doesn't pan out. A better comparison would be, just off the top of my head, Snape threatening to poison a student's pet if he can't brew the antidote correctly.
