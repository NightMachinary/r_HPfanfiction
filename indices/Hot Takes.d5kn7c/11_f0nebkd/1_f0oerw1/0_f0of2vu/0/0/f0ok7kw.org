I feel like Snape /does/ do that with Neville!

Well, we only hear about this incident second-hand from McGonagall who dislikes Trelawney, so we can't really judge whether or not Trelawney was trying to show off. Minerva thinks so (its implied, iirc), but she's not exactly a neutral party.

Iirc she doesn't predict that the student is /about to die/ anyway. McGonagall tells us that Trelawney predicted deaths, not deaths that were about to happen. Frankly death is one of the most reliable things to predict anyway, no? Given its a world where everybody dies unless they have a philosopher's stone handy.
