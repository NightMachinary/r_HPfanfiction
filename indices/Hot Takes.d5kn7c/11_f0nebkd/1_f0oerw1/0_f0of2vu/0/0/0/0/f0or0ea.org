Well, as I said before, the war comes later and a lot of students are killed, so... that adds up.

The fact that Rowling portrays Trelawney as kooky and unpopular but also takes care to have her predict true things, as well as connecting her with the legend of Cassandra, the seer who was accurate but cursed to not be believed, does suggest deliberation to me. It comes across like you're very invested in your alternate reading though, so I'm not sure continuing this conversation further will go anywhere productive for either of us. I'm not sure my points are being taken on by you.

As said, the facts are this: (as told by McGonagall), each year Trelawney predicts a death of one student. We don't know that she does this in front of the class. We don't know that she does it dramatically. We don't see or come across any older or younger students tramatized by having their death predicted. So my take on that is that they aren't - or at the very least that your read on the situation is a reach.
