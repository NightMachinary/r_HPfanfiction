Dumbledore /is/ often wrong, yes, but not when he's outright stating each story's thesis, because that's just not how writing works. Harry believes he's being stalked by an omen of death throughout Prisoner of Azkaban, only to find out that he had misunderstood the whole thing, that it wasn't a literal omen of anything, and that it was a figurative herald of better things to come. Dumbledore then tells Harry that it's impossible to predict the future. If there's any way of getting across a theme more blunt than that, I can't think what it is.

If you're going to say "actually, Dumbledore was wrong, and Trelawney is really a genius," then you might as well add to it "we should be afraid of death," "our choices are meaningless," "stories aren't real and don't matter," and "our impact on the world ceases when we die." Divination doesn't work and Trelawney is a fraud because these are children's books, meant to impart lessons as much as they are to entertain, and the lesson "you can predict or even control the future if you just try hard enough (or are born with a natural talent for it)" is a dangerous one for impressionable kids.

As for the rest: my reply was the length that it was because I provided evidence for my claims. Most of what you've done is state your position and say that there /is/ evidence. On the wiki. Which is not an official source. There's been a new DADA professor every year for over a decade, and at least as long as Trelawney has been teaching at Hogwarts. This is common knowledge that she in particular has no excuse not to know. It's my own fault if I didn't make that clear, but come on: if you see a guy walk into the same restaurant and order the same meal six days in a row, you aren't psychic because you can guess what he'll have on the seventh.

I've never seen someone repeatedly apply the phrase "has never done anything wrong" to an average, everyday fuckup like the rest of us. In my experience, it's generally used for cinnamon rolls (ie Luna Lovegood), people who have done quite a lot wrong but are clearly trying (Dumbledore), or unrepentant monsters (Voldemort). I'm not saying you're using it incorrectly, but it didn't convey to me what you wanted it to. Honestly, I still don't know what that is.
