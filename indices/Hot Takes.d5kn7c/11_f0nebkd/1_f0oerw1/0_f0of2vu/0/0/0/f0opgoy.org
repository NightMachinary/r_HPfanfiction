When she's predicting students' deaths, she either she literally means, "hey, man, you're mortal; just thought you should know," or she means that they're going to die relatively soon. There's no real middle ground there. She's done it every year since she started teaching, which she started doing after she made the prophecy, which Voldemort acted on in October of 1991, so the /absolute/ latest she could've started was September 1982, and she's kept this up at least until 1993, by which point none of the deaths she's prophecised have come to pass. I see three possibilities here:

1. She truly does mean either that, "someday, somehow, you, yes /you/ personally and specifically, thirteen-year-old that I'm singling out for some reason or another, will die; I don't know when or how, but I'll imply that it'll be soon," or "I've seen, at least roughly, when or how you'll die, but I won't share with you any details of when or how you'll die; instead, I'll heavily imply that it's gonna happen soon (even though it's at least 12 years off)." Either is followed by an implicit, "now I'm gonna leave you to deal with your newfound existential dread and move on with my day." Out of context, that's a shitty thing to do, and potentially downright traumatic, but it's /much/ worse when you consider the fact that Trelawney is in a position of authority in both knowledge and power.

Harry's pretty emotionally tough for a kid his age (then again, he has more reason than most to take her at her word, so maybe it evens out), but even he freaks the fuck out when Trelawney hits him with this, at least until McGonagall reassures him. It's almost like she's a mature adult who is conscious of that fact that she's responsible for the safety and well-being of children.

1. She's making predictions, which she genuinely believes, of (relatively) imminent deaths that never pan out. Fair enough, I guess but a) she could maybe be a bit more delicate about it than not at all, b) not tell the entire fucking class, and /never/ do that at the same time that she tells the subject of the prophecy about said prophecy, and c) after the first 11 years of her being wrong about this, eventually get the memo not to jump the gun on the 12th.

2. She's lying to make an impression, emotional health and safety of her charges be damned.

At /best/ Trelawney is well meaning but incompetent to the point be a legitimate danger to her students. At worst, she's an abusive monster on a power trip, wowing a handful of children each year at the expense of the health and happiness of whichever kid she's chosen to single out and sacrifice. Either way, not a great look for a teacher.
