We see one instance of Trelawney predicting a student's death. We are told that she's done this with each of her previous classes, of which she's had at least 11. Between "she probably handled the other predictions as she did the one we the audience got to see" and "she probably handled all the other predictions differently than the one we the audience got to see," which do you think is a more reasonable extrapolation?

Trelawney connects herself to a seer named Cassandra, one who is highly respected despite the general attitude towards divination being one of dismissal, in order to increase her clout.

Trelawney is wrong about stuff all the time: she guesses that Harry was born in midwinter. He was born in summer. Fanon holds that this refers to the scarcrux, but a) why would she be able to detect information from it without realising that's what she's doing, b) Voldemort also wasn't born in midwinter. She predicts that either Harry or Ron will be the first to die out a group of thirteen which includes Dumbledore, who dies before either. She warns Neville about his grandmother's health, and she's healthy enough to kick an auror's ass without complication four years later.

She also bullshits her way through conversations, refuses to engage with anyone who challenges her any more than sure has to, makes vague, self-fulfilling prophecies, states common knowledge and acts as if she's giving a prediction, and claims to be outright omniscient, but too polite to act on said omniscience.

"'The sixteenth of October! "That thing you're dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of October!" Remember? She was right, she was right!'

The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, 'You - you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?'

'Well, not necessarily by a /fox,/' said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, but I was /obviously/ dreading him dying, wasn't I?'

. . .

'Well, look at it logically, said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. 'I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today -' Lavender wailed loudly. 'and she /can't/ have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock-'"

(Yes, Hermione is obviously being a selfish asshole here, but that doesn't make her any less right.)

"Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.

'Let me see that, my dear, she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.

Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise.

'The falcon . . . my dear, you have a deadly enemy.'

'But everyone knows /that,'/ said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.

'Well, they do,' said Hermione. 'Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who.'

Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak like that to a teacher before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn it."

"'But where is dear Professor Lupin?'

'I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,' said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. 'Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.'

'But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?' said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.

Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.

'Certainly, I knew, Minerva,' she said quietly. 'But one does parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.'

'That explains a great deal,' said Professor McGonagall tartly.

Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.

'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him-'

'Imagine that,' said Professor McGonagall dryly."

"'So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?'

'That's right,' said Professor Trelawney shortly.

Professor Umbridge made another note.

'And you are the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?'

'Yes,' said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.

'But I think - correct me if I am mistaken - that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?'

'These things often skip - er - three generations,' said Professor Trelawney."

But here's the kicker: none of that, and I mean /none of it/ is relevant. Your original claim was that "Trelawney did nothing wrong." I rebutted with, and I'm paraphrasing here, but bear with me "she's likely traumatised multiple children over there course of her career, which is generally agreed upon to be wrong. Also she's constantly both portrayed as and shown to be a fraud."

Then you responded with "yeah, but if you interpret all of these specific things in this one specific way, you can see that Trelawney, not Rowling but Trelawney, is actually a secret genius," like she's Steven fucking Moffat and you're trying to convince me of a secret good episode.

Besides which, you claim that I'm "very invested in your alternate reading," when my reading is of the literal text:

"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise."

"Hasn't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is very difficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that."
