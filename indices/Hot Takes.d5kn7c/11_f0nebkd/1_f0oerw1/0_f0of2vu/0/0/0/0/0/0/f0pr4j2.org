Just because Dumbledore believes something doesn't make it true. (Also a main theme of the books)

Anyway. You've kinda proved me right by going to this length. I have a view which the official wikia and the text supports. Unfortunately you've not brought me around to yours, and your insistence that you are Right and I am Wrong hasn't really helped on that front, if I'm honest. Everyone reading is free to take their own position, of course.

Fwiw, even from your own example, Lupin /does/ leave the school soon after, and is dead within five years of that point.

Furthermore..I'm not sure if this is an English language thing or not, but "X did nothing wrong" is not an exhaustive statement. I didn't mean that Trelawney never did anything sinful or unlawful or wrong in her life. Just like someone saying "leave Britney alone, she did nothing wrong!" isn't saying that Britney never in her life pushed her sister or talked back or stole a cookie. Etc.
