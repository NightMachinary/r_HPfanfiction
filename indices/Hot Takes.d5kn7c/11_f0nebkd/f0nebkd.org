Trelawney did nothing wrong, it's just that all of our POV characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione, and tangentially Fred and George) disrespected the subject and the teacher and so took everything she said at face value to dismiss it.

Another one would be that Hermione (much as I love her) /is/ extremely presumptive that she knows best based on not a lot of checking in advance. You would think that a smart and motivated girl finding herself in a new culture for the first time might ask everyone she knows about the differences and how things are done, but if its not in Hogwarts: A History, she doesn't seem to be interested - and so continues to be blindsided by certain things all the wizard-raised around her know quite late into the chronology.
