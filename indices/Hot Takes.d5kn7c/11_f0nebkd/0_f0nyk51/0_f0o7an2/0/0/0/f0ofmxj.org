This has been circulating around the fandom for years and it's always bothered me because it just doesn't track: winter lasts 90 days, 91 in leap years, Voldemort was born on the eleventh. Calling that "midwinter" is a huge stretch, and it's only done to make Trelawney secretly competent and Rowling a Mega Genius who thought of everything and then some.
