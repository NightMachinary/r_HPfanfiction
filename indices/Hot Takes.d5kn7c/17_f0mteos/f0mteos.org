Harry as a main character is getting stale. Same shit dofferent name. We need more experimental fics, not for viewers or favourites but out of passion for good storytelling. Dobt be afraid to go bats shit crazy.

More OC focs or other characters focused. As long as OC doesn't change the main story, like fuck up HP. Have a fic about the OC watching Harry and gang ti cannin things and comment in it.

Or have a Wizarding Vigilante like Batman and do a Long Halloween type story but with Wizards.

Hell remake Soiderman PS4 with Harry is MC and Tom Riddle as Mentor that becomes villian.

A fucking Dark Knight Trilogy with Harry!
