The "For Enemies" thing is really weird. Like, it makes no sense in universe. Either Snape would've remember that Sectumsempra is the murder spell, or he would've put a reminder in code or something (or just not written it in his fucking Potions textbook; dude, just get a separate magic experimentation notebook).
