I think the bar for danger being way way higher in the wizarding world is actually pretty reasonable. Kids are given handgun-grenadelauncher-laserswords at age 11 as a matter of course. They're taught in their very first charms class a way to lift boulders over their own heads. I don't know how common hippogriffs are but it seems plausible that a well-rounded wizarding education would include instructions for how to survive an encounter with one.
