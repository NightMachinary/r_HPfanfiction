To be fair no one really has that opinion of him during PoA. Maybe for the Monster Book of Monsters, but not for the Hippogriffs or his lessons afterwards, which were extremely tame due to him being overly cautious and depressed/doubting himself. That mainly comes from GoF, when the Blast-Ended Skrewts were introduced (completely justifiable, since they're a Manticore/Fire Crab illegal crossbreed) and Skeeter began writing critical and somewhat slanderous articles about him during that year.

So while your observations are mostly true, it's after the time we're discussing, and I don't think the bar for danger was reached during PoA.
