this is the most compelling argument I've seen. I don't think it's so clear-cut, given this happened at a school for children, but that is likely true. On the other hand we can recall that Malfoy's goal wasn't actually to get Buckbeak put down---it was to get Hagrid fired, which is perfectly reasonable and probably should have happened. Pushing for Buckbeak's execution only came when that was blocked (presumably by Dumbledore, as he controls hiring and has defended Hagrid at other times), and executing Buckbeack could be seen as an attempt to prevent harm coming to more students given Hagrid was going to stay.

(clarifying that I don't think Buckbeak deserved to be executed, just that the decision to execute him was not in any way extraordinary)
