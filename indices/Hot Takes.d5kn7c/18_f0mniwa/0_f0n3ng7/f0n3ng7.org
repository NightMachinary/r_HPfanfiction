In this particular case, Malfoy stupidly ignored a direct instruction, and did the one thing which was assured to hurt him. Rather than insulting a dog, I would see it more like someone jumping into the lion cage in a zoo, probably soaked in blood too.

I understand why they wanted to execute the hyppogrif (even the magical beasts seem a lot more intelligent than normal one, he still hurt a student and proved he could be a danger), and I understand why Hagrid got problems (even if Malfoy was stupid, he proved he was unable to deal with his students, during his first class), but Malfoy should have spent his whole year in detention just for general stupidity.
