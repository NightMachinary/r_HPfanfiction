the same logic is applied to non-pets like zoo animals in the real world. if they've demonstrated themselves to be a a danger to humans they're generally put down. and Malfoy might be a moron (or in this case a cruel moron) but by the standards of most humans he was in the right in this case.

Hagrid is an order of magnitude worse imo, it's not like this is his first time learning the consequences of keeping dangerous beings around children.
