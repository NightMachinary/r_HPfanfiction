He understood when he was being respected or insulted. Dogs can learn commands in different languages, not understanding the actual words but rather knowing what the sounds and tones mean in relation to what they're taught. Likewise, we don't know that Hippogriffs understand language, just that they understand the tone of respect and insulting. It's possible that, if Malfoy had insulted him in a respectful/friendly tone and did everything else properly (bowing, not looking him in the eye, etc) then Buckbeak would have never attacked.

This is all guesswork, since there's no more evidence for one over the other within the books, but it's quite possible his intelligence was around what a dog's was. I don't recall him being that particularly intelligent other than what was shown in the class, as when Harry and Hermione tried to free him they had to convince him to follow them. Though my memory of the movie scene is better than my memory of the book scene, and it's possible he is intelligent and just didn't realize he was about to be executed. Though seeing an executioner with a big axe hanging around Hagrid's hut should have given that away.
