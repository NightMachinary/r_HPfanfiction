Hippogriff's seem pretty inteligent though - you would not order a sapient being dead for attacking someone (unless that person was killed or maimed potentially).

Also Malfoy is very clearly responsible - he was told exactly how to stay safe and ignored it. This Hippogriff is not an unpredictable threat.
