  sapient is not a scientific term or even a term with a concrete definition.
#+end_quote

Sapient has two dictionary definitions. The first, scientific one, is "in relation to the human species." The "sapien" in "homo-sapien" comes from sapient. The second, more general term, just means wise/intelligent or appearing to be wise/intelligent.
