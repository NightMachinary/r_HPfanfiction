I wasn't responding to or refuting your entire comment. But it does contradict the section of what you said, which I quoted.

Original comment:

#+begin_quote
  Hippogriff's seem pretty inteligent though - you would not order a sapient being dead for attacking someone (unless that person was killed or maimed potentially).

Your response:

#+begin_quote
  sapient is not a scientific term or even a term with a concrete definition.
#+end_quote

Sapient being used to describe humans is relevant, because you brought up that it's "not a scientific term" whereas the scientific definition is that it's a relationship with humans. Just because it's not in every dictionary, since it's not the more common useage, doesn't mean the definition doesn't exist.

The second term is definitely concrete however. Something being or appearing to be wise/intelligent. That's not really up for interpretation and can be applied to animals if they're proven to be intelligent or appear to be. Buckbeak seemingly being able to understand what humans are saying around him, at least enough to know if they're being respectful or insulting, is a sign of intelligence.
