the first one you listed is barely used (doesn't even appear in most dictionaries) and is obviously not relevant here as we're not talking about humans. the second is not concrete at all. I'm not sure if you meant this to be a refutation of my comment so sorry if you didn't, but none of that contradicts what I said.
