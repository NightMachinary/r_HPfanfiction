Malfoy had a point that Hagrid was a bad teacher, but on a world where injuries can be magically healed in seconds, death is a far too extreme punishment for the animal.

He wasn't doing it because Buckbeak was a dangerous creature that needed to be put down, he wanted to hurt Hagrid. That is not morally defensible.
