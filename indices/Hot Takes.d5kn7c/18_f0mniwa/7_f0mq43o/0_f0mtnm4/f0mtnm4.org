hippogriffs are not shown to be any more intelligent than common animals, which are more than capable of interpreting tone. sapient is not a scientific term or even a term with a concrete definition.

and malfoy was absolutely maimed. the fact that magical healing means he was faking it later doesn't change that.

the fact that malfoy was responsible doesn't change anything either. there are plenty of real-life examples of children doing stupid things, getting hurt by animals, and the animals paying for it. even in the most egregious cases, the child's caretaker (i.e. Hagrid in this case) receives the most criticism. telling a thirteen-year old boy to be nice is not adequate precaution.
