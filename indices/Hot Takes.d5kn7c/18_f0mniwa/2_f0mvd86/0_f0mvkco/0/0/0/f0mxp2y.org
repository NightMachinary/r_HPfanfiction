Birds can emulate words, but they don't understand them. Dogs understand tone/body language/context more than individual words. They understand commands.

Draco and the rest of the Slytherins had been disparaging Hagrid from the beginning of class - no reaction from Buckbeak. So it's not body language or tone. Draco is facing away from Buckbeak, and had successfully bowed to him when he insults him - it's not context. Draco literally insults Harry right before he insults Buckbeak - all at once, except not specifically insulting /Buckbeak./

It's only reasonable to assume the Buckbeak understood the specific words that insulted him.
