  Draco and the rest of the Slytherins had been disparaging Hagrid from the beginning of class - no reaction from Buckbeak. So it's not body language or tone. Draco is facing away from Buckbeak, and had successfully bowed to him when he insults him - it's not context. Draco literally insults Harry right before he insults Buckbeak - all at once, except not specifically insulting Buckbeak.

this whole sequence is incorrect. Draco was speaking directly to Buckbeak, making interpretation of intent trivial for even an untelligent dog. no knowledge of the English language required.
