I think he should've respected McGonagall's assertion that Harry would have a bad life and tried talking to the Dursleys, bribed them if that failed, threatened them if that failed, given them a live-in babysitter if that failed. He should not have a) ignored the problem or b) decided that this was an ok way for anyone to be raised. I'm not sure which of a or b he did in canon but it was one of those and he deserves a lot of shit for it either way.
