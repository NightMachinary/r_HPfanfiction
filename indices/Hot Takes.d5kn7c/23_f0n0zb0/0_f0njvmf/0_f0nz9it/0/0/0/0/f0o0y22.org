Petunia was aware that Harry would die if he would leave them, thats what remember my last means, meaning they know that they can behave however they want towards Harry and that Dumbledore cant do anything about it, and the Dursleys were already pretty wealthy, so bribing them wouldn't be really a effective solution, and again what the Dursleys did wasn't illegal, laws that limit the amount of punishment a guardian could give their charge have been really bad until recently.
