I guess we could shift the blame to Mrs. Figg if she was lying to Dumbledore about how much she actually knew about Harry's home life.

Harry was being abused and no one did anything about it. Dumbledore should have assigned a live-in nanny or had monthly checks by trusted people but he should not have allowed Harry to grow up the way he did.
