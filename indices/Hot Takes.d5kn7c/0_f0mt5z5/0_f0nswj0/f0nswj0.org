I think that's a problem with how JK Rowling portrayed the Harry Potter world in general. For all its strong female characters, the books actually had a pretty regressive view of femininity. JKR said “Let my girls be Hermiones, rather than Pansy Parkinsons. Let them never be Stupid Girls”, but the only evidence we have of Pansy being stupid is her love of Draco which she expresses in stereotypically feminine ways. Pansy became prefect after all, so it implies she's academically competent in some way. JKR made Draco marry Astoria Greengrass in the end, because she believed Pansy didn't deserve a happy ending (as opposed to Malfoy who put Rosmerta under the Imperius, allowed Death Eaters to storm the school, and was generally a toxic asshole for the 6 books).

Girls who are more overtly feminine (Pansy, Lavender, Fleur) get short shrift in JK's world. It's only girls who are tomboyish e.g Ginny (who Harry likes for not being weepy) or Hermione who's far above traditional femininity, that are worthy of plaudits throughout. If we view Hermione as an author stand in, then her dismissal of Fleur in HBP is more problematic.

Let's not forget how a lot of people in the fandom treat Ginny as some sort of s##t for having the temerity to have three boyfriends.
