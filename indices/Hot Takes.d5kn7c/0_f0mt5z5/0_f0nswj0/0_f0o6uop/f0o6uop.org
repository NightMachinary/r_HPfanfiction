I unfortunately have only one upvote to give,but it's nice to know I'm not the only one bothered by this. I distinctly remember wanting to throw my copy of HBP across the room after reading that the best thing about Ginny was that she rarely cried. It does feel like in HP there's only one 'correct' type of women. And the way Lavander is portrayed of course doesn't leave any room for doubts as to who is right for Ron. It feels a bit like she deliberately overdid Lavander's character to show how cool Hermione is. And it does't matter that she isn't an easy person to get along with. And of course poor Cho Chang is a human hossepipe.
