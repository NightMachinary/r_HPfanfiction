Hermione's roommates (Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown) are not terrible for liking clothes and makeup and not really hanging out with her. Sorcerer's Stone Hermione was rude and unforgiving, and after the Troll incident she spent most of her free time with Harry and Ron or studying. People can have different interests and not get along without one side being bad. Lavender didn't know Hermione liked Ron before they started dating because even Hermione didn't know she liked Ron until he was unavailable. No one is in the wrong or bad here.
