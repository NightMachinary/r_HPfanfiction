On that note, Lavender's reputation in the fandom is way worse than she deserves. She most likely died for Harry and the DA, yet most people remember her for being a clingy girlfriend when Ron strung her along for two months. She came up with a horrible nickname, and that's apparently worse than a bunch of war crimes (Draco Malfoy) or willingly joining the magical Nazis (Snape).
