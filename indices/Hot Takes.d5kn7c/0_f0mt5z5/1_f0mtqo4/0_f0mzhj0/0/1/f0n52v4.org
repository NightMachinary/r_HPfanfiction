I think so too. Even JK Rowling says that HGRW would have marriage issues. Lav likes to spoil him and stroke his ego - something someone insecure like Ron would really appreciate. Hermione has too much of her own stuff going on and I feel may have had to dim her own star in order to appease Ron leading to resentment... or if she didnt, Ron being jealous of her not being home enough or not being the kind of wife and mother Molly is.
