Definitely agree on the Sirius bit. It was a dick move towards Remus, but not towards Snape.

If a premise is onesided, it is better to execute the one-sidedness rather than trying to pull some roadblocks out of your ass. Hermione in Westeros would be transfiguring 20th-century technology left, right and centre, so if she joins the Stark cause you'll see tanks roll down the Kingsroad while she apparates to King's Landing, grabs Eddard and leaves. If Harry comes back from a future where the war lasted two decades, there will be heads rolling for two days and the main plot of the books is resolved.

If you want tension, pick a premise which is not one-sided. If you do, write it as it would play out unless you can come up with a good reason why it wouldn't be a stomp.
