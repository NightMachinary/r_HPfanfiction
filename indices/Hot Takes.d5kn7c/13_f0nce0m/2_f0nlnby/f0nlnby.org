I like that when it's in a slight direction. But having Ron rape kittens, potion Harry and Hermione, endanger UK/France relations is a bit excessive. Also, Ron has been played out.

Now Hermione is an interesting one to bash. She has this end justifies the means attitude which she ignores for other people in canon.
