Bashing doesn't typically bother me. I find alternate character interpretations fascinating and see most "Bashing" to be an extension of that.

For example, Ron Weasley, I find it fascinating how if you just shift the focus on him, he can be an antagonist or a protagonist. Antagonist if you focus on his jealousy and self inadequacy, protagonist if you focus on his feats.
