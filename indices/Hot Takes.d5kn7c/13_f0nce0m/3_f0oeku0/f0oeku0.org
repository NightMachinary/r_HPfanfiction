Well, if that is your taste, there is nothing much left to be said.\\
I for my part read a bunch (too many) fics that included bashing and after a while I tired of them. If you have read one of them, you know all of them. They very very rarely get more interesting than that, because bashing in my experience is an alternate character interpretation, but one that severely limits what kind of story can be told.\\
And while bashing is no complete SI, the bashers speak the mind of the author.
