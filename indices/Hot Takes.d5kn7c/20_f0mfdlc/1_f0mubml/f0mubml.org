I think good Ron-centric fics are harder to come by overall when compared to good Harry-centric fics, but there are a lot more good Ron fics by percentage than Harry fics. Ron is a hard character to write well since he has the most normal and subtle characterization out of the three, and actually has sibling/family dynamics to play with. It's easy to bash him because it plays into people's self insert fantasies and he's one of the only characters to show negative traits that affect Harry (jealousy, mistrust, betrayal). Writing him poorly means making him a slob who never works or does homework, and is jealous of Harry's fame and a terrible friend. Writing him well means writing a flawed character who is growing and trying to do better, which means you need to be a good writer. Not that Harry and Hermione aren't good characters, but people easily just make them perfect and OP without flaws in fanfiction- and since they are more popular, people read-it-up.
