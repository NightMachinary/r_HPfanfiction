  Ron is a better character than Harry
#+end_quote

That sentence has no meaning. How exacly is Ron a "better character". Do you mean in cannon? Do you mean in how people write him? What does "better character" even mean. It's like saying "I'm a better human than you" with no context what so ever. It doesn't mean anything.
