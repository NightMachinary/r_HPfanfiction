Hot take I agree I enjoy Ron centric stories more than Harry and Hermione ones both harry and Hermione centric ones usually have them becoming over powered and kind of annoying. I also relate to Ron more than the other two since I grew up poor and with a lot of siblings and I find him a more compelling character becuase of his obvious flaws. I just like Ron hes like my favorite character. I wouldnt however say I never enjoy Harry centric or Hermione fics becuase I have found some that are very good. I just tend to like Ron centric ones more.
