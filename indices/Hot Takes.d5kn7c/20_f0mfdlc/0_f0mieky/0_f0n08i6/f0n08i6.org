I feel like the meaning hot take is lost if something that's just straight up wrong can be one. Fanfiction, by its very nature, means characters don't have a set personality. And HP has a /million/ stories out there, and the majority of them are Harry-centric. Harry has been every type of character in every type of situation at this point. To say he's boring in all of them is to say every character out there is boring.
