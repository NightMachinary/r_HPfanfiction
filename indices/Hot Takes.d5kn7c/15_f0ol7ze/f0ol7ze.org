[cracks knuckles] /let's mcfuckin' do it/

Malfoy is a garbagetrashchild who does not deserve any sympathy, and shipping him with any of the protagonists, especially pre-character development, such as it is, is Bad and Grossâ„¢. He willingly joined a supremacist terrorist organisation and actively bragged about being able to do so. His realising after the fact that assassination is more emotionally complex than he'd given it credit for absolves him of nothing, and seeing him realise that the inherited power he's bandied about with impunity his entire life won't help him when someone outside of its scope and with no patience for his bullshit comes along isn't tragic so much as cathartic.

Also, Bellatrix's portrayal in the movies is so wildly inaccurate to her canon counterpart as to be unrecognisable as the same character, and! the! protections! around! Privet! Drive! are! Wards!!! A ward is a protective enchantment, a meaning which it has had in fantasy before the Harry Potter series had even been conceived and which it will continue to have long after Rowling has run the franchise into the ground (if she hasn't already; YMMV). The word "ward" not being used in canon doesn't mean that it isn't a word in the English fucking language, and kicking up a fuss about correctly applying it would be like complaining about fanon referring to the wands as such if canon only ever referred to them as "magic sticks," or some such.
