Not the OP, but her dismissing the trio's concern about the Philosopher's Stone in the first book and her doing nothing about Umbridge early in OotP are frequently brought up as reasons Harry shouldn't respect her as much as she does. I've also seen quite a few people bring up the fact that she didn't do anything to help when he was being ostracised in CoS and GoF, but those hold much less water (no pun intended), in my opinion.
