I do see what you're saying about her actions in canon not directly reflecting all those achievements. But I've seen this sentiment a lot and it's always been a little confusing to me.

It's pretty easy in my head to gloss over the arguments by saying “Well, surely people knew that and that's why they respected her.” That coupled with the way she carried herself and the fact that she seemed like a good teacher would warrant the respect, I'd think.

So out of curiosity, what would you have changed about her canon role to make her earn that respect? Also, if you'd like to elaborate more on why else you dislike her, I'd love to hear it.

Edit: grammar
