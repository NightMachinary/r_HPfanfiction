  Without Harry, there'd have been no troll.

Alright, I'm gunna need context for this one. Either:

1) Harry led the troll to the girl's bathroom. The troll was wondering the coridor and they hid in the bathroom. The troll didn't see them, it just so happened to break into the bathroom. Even if it did go in because it noticed them (I'll check my book when I get home) it was already in that corridor, and would have probably heard Hermione crying. So without them she'd be dead anyway.

2) You're saying Quirrell let the troll in because of Harry, which isn't true, it was let in to make a distraction so Quirrell could attempt getting past Fluffy. The Philosopher's Stone he was after was going to be in Hogwarts whether Harry was at school or not.

3) Quirrell only let the troll in because he was being possessed by Voldemort, which only happened because he turned into a wraith when the Killing Curse rebounded off of Harry in '81. Which, no.

I'm guessing 1 is most likely and 3 is least, but I figured I'd cover all bases since that comment confused the hell out of me.
