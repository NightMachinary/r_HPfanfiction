It does, however, fit in nicely with a manipulative Dumbledore narrative. After all, one of the rooms is a specially locked door. Instead of just keeping the key elsewhere... it's enchanted to fly around the room? A chess match? A riddle? These aren't protections - its an obstacle course tailor made for Harry and his friends.
