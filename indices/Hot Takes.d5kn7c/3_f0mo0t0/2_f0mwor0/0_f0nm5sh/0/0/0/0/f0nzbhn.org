I... wasn't blaming Harry. Just saying the sequence of events that brought him to Hogwarts also brought about the Philosopher's Stone. If he wasn't in the sequence of events, it's unlikely that the Philosopher's Stone would have needed to go to Hogwarts. At the very least, it's unlikely it would have also happened in 1991.

Not that it's his fault, just a remark on the Butterfly Effect.
