I was thinking "Without Harry" in a more literal sense. As-in, Harry died when Voldemort tried to kill him. Presumably in such a scenario, Voldemort wouldn't have become a wraith in the first place.

You're writing a hell of a canon rehash if Harry is dead, Voldemort never died, and those events still happen at the exact same time.
