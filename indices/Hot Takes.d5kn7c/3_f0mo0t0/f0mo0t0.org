Hermione needed Ron and Harry just as much if not more than they needed her. Without them, she'd be some horrible mix of Umbridge and Percy Weasley.

Voldemort didn't interact with Ron and Hermione because they're sidekicks. He'd, at most, go through their minds and kill them. Also, he belongs to Harry Potter and Albus. Lastly, if it's absurd that Harry can take him on at 17 and win, it's absurd that your favorite female protagonist can do it, too.
