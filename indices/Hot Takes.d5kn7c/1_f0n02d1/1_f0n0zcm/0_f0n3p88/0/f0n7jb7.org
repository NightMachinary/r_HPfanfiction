Within the context of Hogwarts, it absolutely makes sense why people think Hagrid did nothing wrong. This is a school where sending 11 year olds into a /known acromantula habitat/ is an appropriate detention activity. Roping illegal crossbreeds into your lesson plans is pretty mild in comparison.

The way this all makes sense to me is if the X-ratings for dangerous creatures are thought of as just Ministry overlitigation and the average wizard doesn't really give a hoot about it. Like your average dad goes, "Dragons? XXXXX-forbidden? Posh, I had my fingers nipped by a baby fireball when I was your age and I turned out just fine!"
