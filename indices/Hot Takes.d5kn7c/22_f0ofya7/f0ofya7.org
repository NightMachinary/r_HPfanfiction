Aurors =/= Police!

I don't know how many times this shows up in fanfics, but the Aurors are [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/ministry-of-magic/department-of-magical-law-enforcement/auror-headquarters/aurors/][an elite group of witches and wizards who battle the Dark Arts. They operate in some ways as soldiers but more often as intelligence agents, seeking out Dark wizards and defeating them, often in fierce wizard duels]].

The Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is closer to ordinary police. It's [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Magical_Law_Enforcement_Patrol][comprised of a team of wizards and witches tasked with general law enforcement]].
