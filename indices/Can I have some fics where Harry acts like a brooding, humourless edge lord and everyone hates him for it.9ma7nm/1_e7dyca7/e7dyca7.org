*Also,* a while ago, I wrote this snippet:

​

“Even if Molly tried to use a Love Potion on you, what were you /thinking/, using Dark Magic on Ron?! Do you realise how hard it must have been for Dumbledore to keep you out of Azkaban?”

“That old coot? When did he ever lift a finger to help me? No, I merely claimed my title as Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Black, and invoked the ancient tradition of sippenhaft to permit me to administer a proper chastising to the offender's family. Pray that I do not administer one to you!”

Hermione couldn't help but take a step back. Just in the past week, the world had gone mad. Harry had discovered hitherto unheard-of tools and powers, and she was glad. Molly Weasley tried to potion him into love with Ginny, and she was disgusted. With Molly having fled, Harry cursed Ron in her place and told off Dumbledore, and she was terrified. She took a deep breath.

“What's gotten into you, Harry? You've discovered some ancestors, some money and artefacts, and you're suddenly better than everyone, insulting Dumbledore, cursing Ron, and threatening me.”

“Dumbledore hid my birthright from me! He suppressed my potential!”

“That's ridiculous!” Hermione /did not/ say, instead forcing herself to take another breath. /Someone/ had to be the adult in the situation. She phrased her reply carefully. “He did? How did you discover it? Dumbledore has forgotten more about magic and scheming that either of us have ever known.”

Harry nodded, placated. “I'll show you.”

He took her hand and led her through the hallways of 12 Grimmauld place, past the mounted house-elf heads, down the stairs, and into the small dungeon that made up its basement. Hermione cringed as the already grim ambience of the old Black house was amplified tenfold, but Harry seemed undaunted.

They stopped in front of a door, which Harry opened with a wave of his hand, before pulling Hermione inside. (Casual wandless magic, Hermione noted.)

In the centre of the room floated a sphere about two meters in diameter, in Hermione's estimation. It was perfectly black, yet it pulsated with a colour that Hermione could see but could not name. Web-like tendrils of the same colour spread from the orb to the floor and to the ceiling, running up and down the walls.

“She came to me the night I came back to the Dursleys', and she explained everything. Everything.”

Harry was grasping her arm both both hands, his green eyes wide open in his excitement. She barely kept from recoiling as she noticed that, in his eyes, the same tendrils could be seen pulsating in time with the orb. “And then, she offered to help. And she did.

“I can't believe I used to be so excited about things like Quiddich and the pitiful war between Dumbledore and Voldemort. I am the Chosen One, the heir of every important wizard line, the apex and the nexus of human magic. Dumbledore, Voldemort, the Malfoys, they all pretend to be fighting each other, but really, they are all working together to use me and to suppress my potential...”

Hermione tuned out the rest of his speech, because the orb---it was talking to her---had more important things to say.

/Purebloods get their family's secret knowledge and tutors, even Harry gets a magical cloak, his mother's protection, Patronus lessons, and Occlumency lessons from a master---which he throws away over a petty personality conflict, while/ */you/*, /everything/ */you/* /know, you have to work for. And, in the end, you work harder than anyone else, but all you get is a pat on the head from the teachers, and a solid reputation as the reliable sidekick of the Boy Who Lived./

/You've spent so much time helping others get better at defensive magic, you've gotten an EE on the Defense OWL. An EE! Even now, you are putting yourself into unknown danger, just to help Harry out of his latest mess./

/But, you wouldn't mind helping, as long as people would/ */let themselves be helped/*, /but it never sticks, does it? Merlin forbid they actually exercise some patience and caution, and maybe even crack open a book that they weren't forced to on pain of death. Merlin forbid they do something because it's the right thing to do, like free their slaves, if it makes their lives just a tiny bit harder. And those people are supposedly/ */on your side!/*

/Why can't people be more sensible?! If they were more sensible, they would appreciate all that you had done for them, and they would agree with your ideas and advice./ */Someone/* /needs to make people more sensible, but nobody but you seems to be interested in the project. Together, though,/ */we/* /could do it./
