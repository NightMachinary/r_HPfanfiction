In [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751586/16/Lonely-Moon][Lonely Moon]] Harry raises Teddy and is a professor at Hogwarts. He ends up with an (AU aged up) Scorpius in his class and then starts a romance with Draco.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4872247][Against All Odds]] is a Drarry where Harry has Teddy basically part time. It's really cute if you are a francophile.
