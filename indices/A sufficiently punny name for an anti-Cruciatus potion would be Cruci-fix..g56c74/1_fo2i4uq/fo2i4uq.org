Plus point if the water for the potion have to be from River of Jordan(Jordan river sounds less cool) blessed and a flower of crown-of-thorns. ... ... .. ... Now I'm imagining Harry going "the power of christ compels you" to remove Voldemort possession/ horcrux from him. Just imagine, Remus and Sirius trying this to Harry either to cheer him up from the knowledge of being possessed by V. After a round of drinking, Harry impressively throws up and Sirius jokes about needing exorcism, drags off moony only to show up in a priest garb. They recreate a false exorcism, only for the "werewolf" in Remus to suddenly react and things go out of hand that ends up in kidnapping the pope, surprise baptism via stolen firetruck with "blessed" water and attacking deatheaters in a Spanish inquisition garb(monty python-esque) sowing chaos in the Wizarding world and finally promising not to drink a particular walburga's stash of alcohol.
