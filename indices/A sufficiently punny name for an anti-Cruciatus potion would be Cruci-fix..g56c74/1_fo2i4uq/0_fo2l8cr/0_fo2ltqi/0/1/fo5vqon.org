I used to write stories but it took me years to realize that I just stopped. I'm lurking in fanfictions and writing prompts in hopes I'd get inspired to continue writing or get that feeling I used to have with writing.

I mean, After all, one of my original unfinished story started as an HP fanfic. a different "muggle" magic system vs HP magic, which what caused the wizard to go in hiding. An invocation based magic that muggles can use, in short "borrowed" magic, that wizards called "stealing" magic thus the origin source of hate to muggleborn. A war far greater than just V leading a civil war. It was the schism between world's not just between makes and non magic user but between two different magic system. When I realized I literally made a new magic system and hidden society and history for the new magic system that I realized I can divorce it from HP fanfic by changing most notably HP parts and stick with " fractured society of natural wizards vs scattered 'learned' magic users concept.")
