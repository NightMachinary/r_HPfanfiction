Most of my plot bunnies come from dreams. Since I was a little kid I've dreamed about war and being a spy. I think that's why my favorite character is Snape. I feel like I relate to him best. Having to watch and participate in horrifying behaviour without bring able to do a damn thing or I'd break cover. Once I became interested in HP fanfiction I started writing them down in a HP AU. One set have become a series starting in the 1960s and spanning to HBP so far. Another is a time travel.

Maybe keep track of your wonderful ideas like you posted here, and when you have a chance to focus later you'll bless us all with these lovely crack fics and whatever else you deign to give us.
