Thank you and no, the time travel fic has been rewritten 3 times thanks to something not working and I'm stuck because I brought in some characters from a dream that are too O.P. They're like bringing nukes to a skeet shoot. I was trying to tone them down, or take them out completely, or what. The scenes from my multi decade fic aren't connected to be cohesive yet.
