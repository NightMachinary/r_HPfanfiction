I believe I actually read this pun in a fic before. It was a fic where Harry was studying to be a potions master at Hogwarts. I'm sure it was cruci-fix, 'cause it tripped me up when I read it. Can't recall what the fic was called though... Now I feel the need to go trawling to find it again, otherwise I'll go mad with not-knowing.
