Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that crack was just a really stupid idea the characters pretended to play straight. I mean, I guess /Seventh Horcrux/ wasn't predicated on a horrible idea but the characters /did/ pretend to play it straight. Then again, I suppose there is crack that is more the author trying to communicate their amusement to the audience. That generally ends up with them almost sounding - or feeling, perhaps - like they are talking with or at least at the audience.

I guess the most important part is that it's funny, anyways.
