When I saw the movie, I had the same question. Here is the plot bunny I came up with. If anyone is interested in picking it up, go right ahead, just give me credit.

This would work great as a post-canon fic; perhaps even a post-epilogue fic if you wanted to. I would have the fic start place after Harry's children are born and some/all are attending Hogwarts.

What if it was not Captain Marvel that helps save the day after the Infinity War, but Auror Potter?

Chapter One

All was well.

It starts off at the last day of term, Harry Potter excited to see his children again. With a kiss to his wife Ginny, he heads into work and runs into Hermione.

They have a conversation about what has been happening at the Agents of Shield, where Hermione is a spy. She is in the office to return some information about the Civil War between the Avengers. At this point, you would only be getting a taste of how the Wizarding World has changed. Hermione loves what she is doing, but admits that much of the technology is above her. She does not feel as if she fits in. Worse of all, are the accords, which: "It reminds me of the mudblood records in the war'

Their emergency notice goes off, leaving them a minute before they are whisked away.

“I hate these things.” grumbled Harry.

“I can't imagine why...” She smiles.

“That blasted thing went off in the middle of the night. One moment I was asleep, the next I was standing in the middle of the meeting. I was bloody starkers, Hermione, starkers!”

Once in the meeting, they get told unknown alien vessels are approaching earth, with one landing in New York.

The US Aurors' have been standing guard and watching the Avengers do their thing and reporting to the International Council. At one point they make a comment about Dr. Strange and him being a 'magician' and laugh. The few that know about this branch of magic laugh, as it is old, outdated and practically worthless compared to theirs.

Harry has always been a supporter of getting involved. He dislikes the current wizarding world position of avoidance. Many of the plots the avengers have faced would have hurt the wizarding world as well. Instead, they work with the limitations they have, and make sure those who are protecting the world are guided in a way they will never learn about. Part of this is Harry's job when they are in England.

You learn that at one point the Wizarding World almost went public when a branch of magical creatures and half-breeds announced themselves to the world. It was a turbulent time in the world, but the protests ended up rapidly dying when the Accords were established. For those who believed in a complete separation, this was god send. It showed the wizarding world they would not be safe if they went public, but slaved to the countries governments their land was under.

After two days of absolutely nothing (but sitting around and barely seeing their families), they get a call that some random things are happening in Wakanda. They all grimace. Wakanda is the only nation in the world that does not have a wizarding population. What makes vibranium powerful is it can and has absorbed magic. A small piece can be extremely powerful for wizards, but large concentrations of it are dangerous. If left in an area with lots of vibranium, a wizard would slowly lose their powers and go insane. Any human that may have been born with magic, would be pure muggle by the time they reach 11. The Vibranium would suck all the magic from the person. The whole area of Wakanda is a no-go zone for the wizarding world. Thus, when the attack begins, little is known to what is happening, and there is very little the wizarding world can do.

Thus, Kingsley let's Harry go to the Burrow. It is the annual family dinner where everyone comes and catches up now that all the kids are back from Hogwarts. Kingsley knows that Harry should not miss this, and it is not like anything big is going to happen tonight that they will need him. Plus, if for a crazy reason they do, he is only a flick of a wand away,

At the Burrow, it is great. Lily is talking about her first year, the food is delicious and everyone is having a good time. Even Charlie came by this year. All is well.

As Ginny comes in from the kitchen, helping her mom bring out desert, she mutters that she feels weird. She shakes it off. As she goes to place the cake, it drops and shatters. Her arm is disintegrating in front of them. She screams, and Harry rushes to her aid, just to hear Molly gasp. Both of them disintegrate.

Hermione, Lily, James, Charlie, Bill, Arthur and George all turn to ash. The few that remain are crying, screaming and trying to figure out what happens.

Harry disappears, goes back to the ministry which is in absolute chaos. The MoM tells him there was a major surge of magic in Wakanda and then people started to vanish. They go to the DoM and demand answers. They are told about what seems to be the infinity stones, a myth that turns out to be true.

In rage, Harry and (whomever you want, Ron perhaps) demand to go find their wives and children's killers. They are going to find a way to get them back.

End Chapter One

In the following chapters, in addition to the story moving forward, you could see how the Wizarding World changed and viewed the actions of the years before. Such as:

- Men flying in metal suits

- A man coming back to life after being frozen (with the help of magic of course).

- Aliens

- A branch of magical creatures that dubbed themselves the Inhumans going public. Now that had been a nightmare.

- Then came The Wizard. When the International Councils of Wizards told them about a secret elite group of wizards that protected them from ‘mental and physical threats' and after a large attack, 'only two remained' Harry wanted to slam his head on the table.

- The almost civil war within the wizarding world, and more.

From here you can take this plot in any direction. You can bring HP son or daughter with him to fight, or Teddy. Perhaps its Ron and Harry against the universe. You can do crazy time-travel shenanigans and more. Either way, I suggest having the story begin after the events of the movie, instead of HP saving the day in the middle.
