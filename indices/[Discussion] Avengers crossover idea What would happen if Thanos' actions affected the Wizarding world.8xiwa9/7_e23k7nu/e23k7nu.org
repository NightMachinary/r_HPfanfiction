The Avada would take out the weaker members of the Black Order, or Thanos if he was walking around Stark naked with no armour or Gauntlet on. Actual Immunity would require something on the level of True Magics from Fate, or Saber's Avalon, something of extreme "Nope, you missed" As for helping... Voldemort would probably try to ally with Thanos, waiting for a moment to Backstab him and steal the IG (IG Voldemort would be scary) and the rest don't throw around Avadas.
