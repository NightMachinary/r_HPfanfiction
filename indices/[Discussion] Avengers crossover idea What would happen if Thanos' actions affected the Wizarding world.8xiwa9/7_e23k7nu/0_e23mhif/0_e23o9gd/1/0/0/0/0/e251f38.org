What the Ancient One does though is clearly not science though. She's not using technology, she says she channels esoteric energies from different universes using spells. The comparison to programming was to give an analogy. I think you're also discounting the change in themeing in the Marvel films. They tried to make it that the Asgardians weren't deities (even going so far as to have Odin say they aren't gods), but that definitively changed in the Phase 3 movies, where Thor repeatedly says he is a god and accepts being referred to as anything less. Magic wasn't originally going to be in the MCU, but it was confirmed that they changed that so Doctor Strange and co. are using magic.

  GamesRadar asked this very question of Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson (Sinister) at Comic-Con, in an interview that was only recently posted. For fans of the weird and wild nature of comics, his answer was quite heartening:

  "Magic is magic in this movie. It's not something that's explained away scientifically. It's not something that's easy to define. As magic should be. Magic should be mysterious. There's mystery to magic and there's mystery to the tone of the movie. Mystery is a good thing."
