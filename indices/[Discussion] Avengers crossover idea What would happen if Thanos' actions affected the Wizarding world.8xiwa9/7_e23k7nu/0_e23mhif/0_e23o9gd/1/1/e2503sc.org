It's described as "channelling dimensional energy", at least for the strongest spells. Otherwise they're drawing on some power within themselves, which seems to be how it's described in HP (Ollivander says wizards channel their magic into mediums like wands). But it's definitely not science, depending on how we define that word. I mean, magic in HP appears to be pretty systematized so I don't know.

Otherwise, I recall it being said that originally they weren't going to have magic in the MCU but they changed that when they made the Doctor Strange film.
