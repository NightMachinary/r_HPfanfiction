  It can be blocked by a Gravestone in canon

Because it is a gravestone. Canon somewhat supports my theory on it, as Animagi can turn into animals and back without having to put clothes on or off. So it is possible for magic to consider your clothing as a part of you. And, again, given that wizards don't wear armor in battles, it's possible, if not likely, that the Killing Curse considers armor a part of you.

Remember, magic > mundane. While vibranium and adamantium are incredibly strong, there's no reason "/Reducto/" wouldn't be able to deal with it. Or a simple Transfiguration of the armor. Or a Vanishing spell. I doubt even Thor's armor would withstand a Killing Curse.
