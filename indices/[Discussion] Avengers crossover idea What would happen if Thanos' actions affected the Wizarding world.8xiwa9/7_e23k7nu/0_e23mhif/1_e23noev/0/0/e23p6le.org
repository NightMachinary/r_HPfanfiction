Reducto... not so much. It's never shown the feats of being capable of taking out things like Vibranium or Adamantium, the latter of which can and has hurt 616 IG Thanos, who sees Silver Surfer as a nuisance.

Transfiguration... don't you have to roughly understand what you're transfiguring? that, and they never just transfigured someone else's bodyparts. Human transfiguration on yourself, sure, but actively, in combat, turning someone's arm into a snake and having it bite them... Damn i want to see that in a fic now.

Vanishing... entirely possible. But the sheer density, especially of Iron Man's armour, unless you hit him exactly in the bit in his chest, Avada wouldn't touch him, and i assume, given any slight warning, Strange could dissect Wizard spells and protect against them. Tony would see one of the weak characters like Widow die, and then immediately see "DON'T LET THE LIGHTS TOUCH YOU TAKE THEM DOWN HARD AND FAST" and Wizards well... can't react to people of Supersonic speed or higher, there's no real Body enhancement spells. Kiritsugu Emiya could solo the verse. Wizards actually making any sizable contribution vs either side, Thanos or Avengers, would require ambushses and surprise hits. Can guarantee if Cap still had his shield, he could casually nosell anything short of Fiendfyre.
