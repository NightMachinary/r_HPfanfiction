You overestimate the shit out of Reducto. It's not a "Be all end all" Destruction Spell, It failed to destroy Hagrid's weird Skrewts, and there's a lot of Headcanon in here. I'd rather go for "Armour blocks the Avada, slows you down so much... FIENDFYRE MWAHAHAHA" so that's why we don't see Wizards in Plate. Plus, they're traditional idiots.

Magic > Mundane wouldn't apply when the Mundane can be seen as Magic to Mundanes who don't know; If A Gravestone can block an Avada, a crappy stone statue can when Dumbledore flicks his wand and summons it in the way, then Cap's shield which has blocked FAR Stronger things could block it. You'd assume the Expelliarmus would actually have to hit CAP for him to drop the shield, not hit the shield. Vanishing? Maybe?

Avada can't be blocked by HPverse Magic. Far more in depth Magic could easily. There's no possible way Al Azif/Demonbane couldn't block it (Extreme example to prove a point)
