  If Voldemort used Legilliimens on a Wakandan and knew everything about Vibranium, I'd agree, they'd be fucked.

There's honestly nothing to suggest you need to know everything about what you want to Transfigure to do it.

  What you wear = Part of you removes two of your arguments. Why would you try Vanishing or Transfiguring part of someone in combat when you'd rather just ping destructive spells at them (How literally everyone that isn't McGonagall has been seen fighting)
#+end_quote

Um, those two aren't supporting the other one. They were just other examples of how you could take down someone with armor. So no, it doesn't remove any of my arguments.

  How the fuck would a Shield be considered part of the human body.
#+end_quote

How would a wand be considered a part of the human body? Yet, it's strongly implied that a wand changes with you.

  I'd argue that Itachi Uchiha (Yata No Kagami) or Obito and Kakashi (all 3 from Naruto. Obito and Kakashi using Kamui) could stop the Avada. Feats + Scale + Higher Concept beats "Unblockable" spell that gets blocked by literally stone.
#+end_quote

No evidence, therefore no reason to believe this. And it's entirely irrelevant anyway. MCU magic isn't that powerful.

#+begin_quote
  Why would me holding a Kite shield and deflecting a spell (assume at least as thick as a Gravestone. It's my Benchmark for the Avada as that's the thinnest thing that's blocked it successfully) count as the spell hitting me. That makes no fucking sense at all.
#+end_quote

As I've /repeatedly/ said, it can be considered a part of you.

As you're apparently being purposely obtuse, I'm done arguing with you over this matter.
