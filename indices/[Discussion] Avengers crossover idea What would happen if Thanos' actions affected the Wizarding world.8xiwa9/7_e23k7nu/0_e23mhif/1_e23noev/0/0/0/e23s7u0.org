  Reducto... not so much. It's never shown the feats of being capable of taking out things like Vibranium or Adamantium
#+end_quote

The purpose of the spell is to turn objects into pieces. There's honestly no reason it wouldn't work on those. Again, magic > mundane. Magic doesn't need to work in the same way our world works. You can argue that the Reductor Curse would work on those elements in the same way you could argue that the Shield Charm could protect you from a bullet. Magic in HP can be conceptual, so I don't see why the Reductor Curse can't simply be "Smash!" regardless of what the element is.

  Transfiguration... don't you have to roughly understand what you're transfiguring?
#+end_quote

I highly doubt they're learning advanced anatomy in Transfiguration. If they can Transfigure animals, a metal really shouldn't provide a problem. If 11-13 year olds can Transfigure things into animals, that's probably because you don't necessarily need an understanding of what you're Transfiguring. And animals are much more complex than metals.

  Avada wouldn't touch him

Again, why not? Magic already considers clothing as a part of you, why wouldn't it with his armor? Why wouldn't a Reductor Curse turn his Arc Reactor into dust? Couldn't a bunch of random powerful spells just make his technology not work anymore?

  Strange could dissect Wizard spells and protect against them.

The Killing Curse can not be blocked by magic.

  and then immediately see "DON'T LET THE LIGHTS TOUCH YOU TAKE THEM DOWN HARD AND FAST" and Wizards well
#+end_quote

This isn't about if a wizard can take out all the Avengers at the same time. But rather if a Killing Curse can't kill any of them.

  Can guarantee if Cap still had his shield, he could casually nosell anything short of Fiendfyre.

Expelliarmus. No more shield. Reductor. No more shield. Vanishing. No more shield. Killing Curse would either just kill him or shatter the shield and his arm in the process. Again, magic > mundane. This is something JK Rowling has said.
