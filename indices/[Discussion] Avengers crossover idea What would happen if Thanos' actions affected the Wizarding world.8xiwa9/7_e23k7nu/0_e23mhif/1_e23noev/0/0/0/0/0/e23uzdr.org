  It's not a "Be all end all" Destruction Spell
#+end_quote

I didn't say it was.

#+begin_quote
  It failed to destroy Hagrid's weird Skrewts
#+end_quote

Well, I imagine not, seeing as he never tried using the Reductor Curse on the Skrewts.

#+begin_quote
  there's a lot of Headcanon in here
#+end_quote

You mean like Harry using the Reductor Curse on a Skrewt? :P

There's nothing in canon to suggest Reducto can't destroy powerful metals. And given what we know of other spells, it's not unreasonable to come to the conclusion that it'd be able to destroy the strongest ones, especially if you're a powerful wizard. /Again,/ magic > mundane. If anything, there's more evidence to suggest it /can/ destroy those metals than evidence to suggest they can not.

/"I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature."/

These are JK Rowling's own words.

  I'd rather go for "Armour blocks the Avada, slows you down so much... FIENDFYRE MWAHAHAHA" so that's why we don't see Wizards in Plate.
#+end_quote

That doesn't make any sense. Why would the Killing Curse slow you down? And why would a wizard just summon Fiendfyre so casually? Fiendfyre is more likely to kill you any everyone around you than it is to only kill your opponent.

#+begin_quote
  Plus, they're traditional idiots.
#+end_quote

This is used quite often as an excuse to explain away the gaps JK Rowling left in. Just because something wasn't explained doesn't mean that there isn't a logical reason in there somewhere. It's not a valid argument in this scenario. We have logical conclusions we can come to in this conversation.

#+begin_quote
  Magic > Mundane wouldn't apply when the Mundane can be seen as Magic to Mundanes who don't know
#+end_quote

This doesn't even make sense. The mundane that appears as magic /isn't magic./ It doesn't matter how it appears to muggles. What matters if it's magic or not. It absolutely 100% applies here.

#+begin_quote
  Cap's shield which has blocked FAR Stronger things could block it
#+end_quote

Yet again you seem to miss the fact that magic can consider what you wield or wear as a part of you, /and/ that magic > mundane. I'm not sure how many times I have to repeat it. There is more to support that it would still kill/disarm than there is to support it wouldn't.

#+begin_quote
  You'd assume the Expelliarmus would actually have to hit CAP for him to drop the shield
#+end_quote

Cap's shield hardly ever fails. I'm fairly certain he would try blocking the spell with his shield.

#+begin_quote
  Avada can't be blocked by HPverse Magic. Far more in depth Magic could easily.
#+end_quote

This is so nonsensical that I almost didn't even bother responding to it. There is literally no way we can know this, and no reason you should confidently say that. This kind of thinking can let us just dismiss pretty much every universe's magic when it comes to crossovers. If the Killing Curse is unblockable in a world where magic is so powerful that you can curse /abstract ideas,/ it's downright silly to dismiss the curse's lethality in other universes.
