I didn't mean the Killing Curse slows you down, i meant "I'm wearing fucking heavy thick armour, i can barely move or dodge other spells, but the Avada won't touch me"

Going off pure Logic and Density, It'd take at the very least top tier Magic to get past Fictional Metals, and to vanish or transfigure them, an understanding. If Voldemort used Legilliimens on a Wakandan and knew everything about Vibranium, I'd agree, they'd be fucked. If a Gravestone can block a spell, then a MUCH denser metal could casually Nosell it.

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic was the logic i was going by. There could be some crazy science logic "Wizards manipulate Zero Point energy (a Stargate fic) or something that allows Magic to work.

What you wear = Part of you removes two of your arguments. Why would you try Vanishing or Transfiguring part of someone in combat when you'd rather just ping destructive spells at them (How literally everyone that isn't McGonagall has been seen fighting)

How the fuck would a Shield be considered part of the human body. "Oh i Avada'd your shield. Loludied" makes literally 0 sense in terms of spells hitting you. Why would me holding a Kite shield and deflecting a spell (assume at least as thick as a Gravestone. It's my Benchmark for the Avada as that's the thinnest thing that's blocked it successfully) count as the spell hitting me. That makes no fucking sense at all.

Harry Potter Magic is a LOT lower on the food chain feat wise than Demonbane (my EXTREME example) where instead of cursing words so you know when people say it, You actively fight Eldritch Entities that store thousands of Universes in Jars. Heck... I'd argue that Itachi Uchiha (Yata No Kagami) or Obito and Kakashi (all 3 from Naruto. Obito and Kakashi using Kamui) could stop the Avada. Feats + Scale + Higher Concept beats "Unblockable" spell that gets blocked by literally stone.
