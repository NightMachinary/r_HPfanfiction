The Killing Curse should take them all out, regardless of armor. In my interpretation of the curse, at least. I feel as though anything you wear on you is considered an extension of yourself and therefore unable to protect you from the Killing Curse. Otherwise, why wouldn't wizards just wear armor in war?

I'm struggling to think of anyone in the MCU who couldn't be killed by a HP wizard.
