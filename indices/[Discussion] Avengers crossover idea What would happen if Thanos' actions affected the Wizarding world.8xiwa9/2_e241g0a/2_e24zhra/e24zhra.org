What is there to make sense of? If we're talking about the MCU, people don't know Thor and Loki are magical, they know people with superpowers exist. We know Strange and co. are in fact hidden from the world as well. There's not really much issue here, it just depends on where you time things. Like pre-invasion of New York, no one would have any inkling of magic so the issue is nonexistent.

Also, why wouldn't Thanos be slowed down (if not defeated)? Strange alone clearly held him up with a few tricky (but powerful) spells. Granted, having a few Infinity Stones makes it trickier, but definitely not anything like impossible (Avada Kedvra kills just the same).
