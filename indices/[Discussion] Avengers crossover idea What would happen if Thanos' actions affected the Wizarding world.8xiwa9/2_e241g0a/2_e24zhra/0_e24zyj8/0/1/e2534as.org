And this is why I don't like wildly different franchises mixing together.

We simply don't know how the killing curse works exactly, what its limitations are on non-humans or what defences the black order has against them. The two were never designed to play together, it just doesn't work.

If Harry Potter magic was an actual existing thing in the MCU then Thanos would have at the very least known about it. The statute of secrecy is only a human thing after all, the other planets are far more open about the existence of magic.

If Thanos knows about it, he can counter it or even do it himself. He would at the very least recognise what a curse is and know to dodge it, which he can easily do given his monstrous speed and power.
