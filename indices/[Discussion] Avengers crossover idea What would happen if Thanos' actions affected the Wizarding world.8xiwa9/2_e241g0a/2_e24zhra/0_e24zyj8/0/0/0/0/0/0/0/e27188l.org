No, because that is a complete non sequitur. "Guns are effective" is not equivalent to the nigh perfect record of AK killing any living thing. Simple logic:

AK kills any mortal living being.

Thanos is a mortal living being.

Therefore, AK will kill Thanos.

Thanos never overpowered a magical move which by nature kills. Your comparisons are based on simply effective methods (as opposed to virtually perfect ones), so the reasoning doesn't follow. AK is not simply lethal, if it hits it kills. Without the Infinity Gauntlet he would have to dodge it to stay alive.
