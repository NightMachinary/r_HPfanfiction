Not exactly. In canon, we have one description of the effects of the Killing Curse from someone's perspective. Voldemort says the spell ripped him (that is, his soul) from his body. That's why there's no physical damage from the curse. That's why I said the Soul Stone could defensibly be assumed to block it. Of course he could dodge it, I'm just saying that it would kill him if it hits because, as JKR has said, magic trumps the mundane.

Well, Thanos /did/ already know about magic. He refers to Strange as a wizard in their fight and didn't seem too surprised. That aside, as far as I know, Magic isn't widely known by other races. Aside from the Asgardians, we only ever see one single other alien use magic; it was a one-off shown in the second Guardians of the Galaxy film.
