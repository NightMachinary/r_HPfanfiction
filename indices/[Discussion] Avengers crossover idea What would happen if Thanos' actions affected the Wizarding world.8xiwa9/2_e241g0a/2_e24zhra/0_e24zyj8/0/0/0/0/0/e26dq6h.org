  We know that the power of the killing curse is effective on humans. To take that and state that it therefore also works flawlessly on Titans or Asgardians is not supported by anything.

It's effective on any living thing that isn't immortal (or specifically, phoenixes can sort of cheat the curse), it has worked on animals, humans, goblins and is said to be completely unblockable (with one exception). It has nothing to do with humans. Under any sensible definition, Thanos /is/ mundane, meaning he can't do magic, and even those with magic are killed by the curse. If the crossover retains the facts of how HP magic works, AK will kill Thanos unless he has the Infinity Gauntlet.
