We know that the power of the killing curse is effective on humans. To take that and state that it therefore also works flawlessly on Titans or Asgardians is not supported by anything.

I can create a crossover where the killing curse can be blocked by raw powerhouses like Thanos or Thor. We know that they can survive a lot of things that would kill ordinary humans.

But Thanos isn't mundane, he is a Titan of extraordinary power who is armed with the infinity gauntlet.
