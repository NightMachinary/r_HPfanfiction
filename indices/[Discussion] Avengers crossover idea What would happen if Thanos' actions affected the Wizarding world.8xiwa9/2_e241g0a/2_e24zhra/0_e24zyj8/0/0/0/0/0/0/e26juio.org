Look, let me give you an example on why that logic doesn't work.

#+begin_quote
  In cowboy movies guns are effective at killing anything. If someone is hit with a gun, they die. It works on humans, it works on animals. it's too fast to be dodged and no amount of armour can stop it. Therefore, according to cowboy movie logic guns are perfect killing weapons.

  Therefore I conclude that guns from cowboy movies can easily kill Thanos.

You see why this doesn't work?

It's the same with the AK. An AK can generate a certain amount of "death magic" which can kill most things on Earth. However there is nothing that says a Titan or an Asgardian can't be immune to it, or isn't strong enough to overpower the "weak death magic of a human cast AK".

Look, every franchise has something that *BY THE LOGIC OF THAT FRANCHISE* is undefeatable unless some specific counter is used. When doing a crossover you need to let go of that logic and generalise certain concepts, otherwise the lone ranger with his "perfect gun that kills everything he shoots at" is the most dangerous thing in the universe.

My reasoning

1. The MCU has magic, see Dr. Strange.

2. Thanos can overpower said magic with tricks of his own (that may or may not be amplified by the infinity gauntlet), see Infinity War wen Thanos overpowered Strange's magic.

3. Harry Potter magic is also magic.

4. Therefore Thanos can overpower it as well.
