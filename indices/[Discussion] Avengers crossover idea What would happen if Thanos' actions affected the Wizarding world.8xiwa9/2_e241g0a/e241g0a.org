I hate crossovers that go "lol, these two completely separate worlds were in the same universe the entire time" and expect us to make sense of that.

Wizards keeping secrets make no sense in the same world where Thor and Loki are openly gallivanting around with the Hulk.

Plus wizards like Dr Strange also exist in this universe and even have an entire base of operations in London. Does Strange not know that Diagon Alley exists? Doesn't the ministry not ever visit the Sanctum?

In order for this story to make sense there would need to be an in-universe crossing of dimensions. Like openly saying "this is another dimension where magic manifested itself differently"...

But to answer your question: Wizards would be one-shotted by Thanos. Not even Dumbledore and Voldemort teaming up would so much as slow him down.
