Oh man I'd love to see a well done Avatar crossover. One of my absolute favorite shows.

Here's a bit of a rundown / outline of something I'd love to read based on the above chain of ideas:

- Voldemort + Grindelwald successfully take over the Wizengamot. This probably happens in Harry's 5th or 6th year.

- Politically, they can not kill Dumbledore. It would rally the entire wizarding world and the ICW against them. It would be suicide. They have Death Eaters, not an army.

- They can fake a trial and throw him in Azkaban, however. It would take the ICW weeks / months to complete an investigation and figure out it was fake.

- There's an argument about whether a prison, even one as secure as Azkaban can hold someone such as Dumbledore. He has a Phoenix as a familiar, after all.

- Dumbledore agrees to the punishment and willingly goes to serve his time, but he has a plan. Grindelwald brings most of the evidence of Dumbledore's past into the trial, and manipulates other members to vote with him.

- Dumbledore figures out the plot. He manipulates Harry into dueling him. Engineers a way to turn his pupil against him by spilling his original plan: "I kept you suffering under the thumb of the Dursleys, Harry. It was all me. I've engineered your entire childhood, to keep you just on the verge, that razor's edge between happiness and misery. I made you see that magic was extraordinary and Muggles mundane. I needed you to love this world more than yourself, you see. I foresaw that you would have to die, willingly, in order to defeat Voldemort. I have done all this, and I was wrong."

- So they fight and Harry "wins" the Elder Wand. Dumbledore gets locked away, disgraced, and thought a manipulative betrayer by The Boy Who Lived.

- Harry thinks he has to tackle everything on his own. The Elder Wand makes things a bit easier, though. Before he's imprisoned, Dumbledore sends his notes on Horcruxes to Harry via Hermione in a coded message, so that it is not obvious that Dumbledore is the sender. Hermione thinks it's from the Order, not Dumbledore specifically.

- Azkaban changes the old wizard. A master of wandless magic, Dumbledore has no problem conjuring a Patronus in his cell, but the drain wears on him. After only days, the cell walls are covered in runic script, made by his own magic. After weeks, Dumbledore's appearance changes. After months, he's barely recognizable as the congenial strange old wizard, but appears as a wiry warrior with an aura of blinding light, the Phoenix emblem magically emblazoned on his chest like a fiery tattoo.

- Voldemort and Grindelwand have their political differences. In their victory, Tom wants to rule supreme and his sadistic treatment of wizard-kind sickens Grindelwand. At the apex of their strained relationship, Dumbledore breaks out of prison, rejoins Harry Potter, and the reunited Order of the Phoenix descends upon the Wizengamot to perform a coup.

- Fawks joins them, and like a blazing army of light, the Order takes back their country.
