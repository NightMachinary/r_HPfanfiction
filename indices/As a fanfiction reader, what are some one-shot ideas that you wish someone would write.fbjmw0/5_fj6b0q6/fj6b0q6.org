1. A day in the life of 20 year old Tom Riddle. (40s music vibes, Tom being done with everyone and everything admiring Dumbledore because he defeated Grindelwald a year prior, travelling and Pureblood parties)

2. Charlie Weasley and his friends getting Rons letter about Norbert and how they fly to Scotland to pick up that Dragon

3. Bill Weasley at work as a curse breaker basically Grave robbing (Maybe Tomb Raider style)

4. Sherlock x HP crossover. Percy Weasley works for the Ministry in all Muggle related things. He meets Mycroft Holmes.

5. A fic about Sirius' aunt who wanted to legalize Muggle hunting. (I want this super elegant/proper, rich, entitled pureblood witch with a rather rare Hobby. And I want her to be all casuall about it. Basically a female Hannibal Lecter)
