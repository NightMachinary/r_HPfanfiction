In addition to this, I'd like to see other magic systems explored beyond just "oh mine is better". For example, Harry in Lord of the Rings, but he doesn't use his wand for everything. Maybe it's broken or lost, and he has to relearn magic the hard way, by speaking and studying the subtle magics of the dwarves, the elves, the halflings and humans. Make him tempted by the magic that reminds him of home the most, the dark sorcery of sauron, but ultimately resist it. And in the end, reveal that it was all designed as a test, a journey of discovery and learning, and he is granted a staff, or made an Istari himself or whatever.
