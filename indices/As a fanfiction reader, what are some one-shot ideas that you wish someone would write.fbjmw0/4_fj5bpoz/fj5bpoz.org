Harry and possibly others get Isekaid in another universe and DONT roflstomp everything. I want to see them struggle, perhaps being even weaker than most of the new world inhabitants and need to be cunning and carefull. I'd love to read one in Warcraft universe, but all of them have a godmod Harry and meet every important character of Azeroth; but it would be so much more interesting to see them faced with magic resistance, or just the brutal difference of raw power with most spellcasters of this world who have quite mastered the art of killing things.
