I want a one where a regular student gossips about Harry and troll, Harry vs quirellmort, being heir of slitherin, a possible H/Hr/Rw, or how Malfoy and Harry has UST, Fred and George are totally BL. Gossip about Harry and Cedric (the questionable talk about prefects bathroom), and literally all random incorrect gossips from year one to five being heard by one of the golden trio.

Kinda like that one shot where Remus overheard people gossip that his monthly illness was actually him being a girl and he's doing both James and sirius at the same time that's why they hide he's actually a girl. While another says if Remus wants to 'identify' as a boy and is comfortable with it, it's his choice, that does not mean he's banging his friends.
