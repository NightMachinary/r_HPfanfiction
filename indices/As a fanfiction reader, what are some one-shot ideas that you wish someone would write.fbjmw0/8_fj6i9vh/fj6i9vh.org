Harry was born a squib and only had Magic due to the horcrux. After Harry returns to life, he finds his magic slowly diminishing. Spells become weaker, begin to malfunction, eventually fail to work at all. His wand becomes just a peace of wood in his hand, he is no longer able to perceive Hogwarts - only seeing ruins and the need to get away (Muggle repellent charm).
