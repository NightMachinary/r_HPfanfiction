Harry doing something about the situation with Snape, instead of just putting up with the unfair treatment. As to what he could do... basically, start to channel his Slytherin side, and work with the people and other resources he has to slowly change Snape's opinion of him. (I realise it's not Harry who's in the wrong here, but Snape seems incapable of reassessing Harry on his own). Specifically, Harry needs to make a plan to win Snape over by proving he's not a bully or arrogant etc., but he'd have to come to terms with the fact that it would be a long, hard effort.
