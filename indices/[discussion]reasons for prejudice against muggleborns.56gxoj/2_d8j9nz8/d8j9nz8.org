All reasons are good I think, and also how I had imagined it. I especially like the last one - the Muggle population might not be as powerful but it is larger in number, and could be a potential threat this way, perhaps they are also seen as 'savages' without respect for magical culture. I haven't read a lot of fanfics with this theme, but mostly it's just that Muggles are seen as inferior, and that's it.
