Resentment due to statue of secrecy. These wizards have to hide what they are to the world because muggles used to try and burn them. If that wouldn't lead to some distrust I don't know what would. Also muggleborns are ignorant, as far as we know they get no help settling into the wizarding world and probably cause many social blunders. They probably cost more to monitor than regular wizards meaning they require more tax and as it is unlikely they have sacks of gold to pay then the old families will foot the bill. A case could also be made that wizards children are held back as they learn no magic even runes or astronomy before hogwarts to ensure muggle borns come in at an equal level.
