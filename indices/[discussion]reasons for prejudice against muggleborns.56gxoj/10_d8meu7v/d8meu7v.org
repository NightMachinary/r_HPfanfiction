I'd say all of the above, but most of all #2.

In one fic I made the Death Eaters - or rather the people behind the organisation and the Dark Lord, fight against the anti-tradition dogma that has risen after Grindelwalds war. The short summary is that the Ministry has forbidden traditional fests like Beltane, Samhain, Yule, Ostara,... and destroyed shrines of the gods that were praised there in order to clean up the spots where Grindelwald has recruited his powerbase. Feeling slighted by this, the purebloods lash out against those they think are responsible for this extreme prejudice by the Ministry - the Muggles, Muggleborn and the one pushing this legislation onward, Albus Dumbledore. Voldemort decides that to further his own goals, he could ride this wave, and subsequently gives this movement an even worse name.
