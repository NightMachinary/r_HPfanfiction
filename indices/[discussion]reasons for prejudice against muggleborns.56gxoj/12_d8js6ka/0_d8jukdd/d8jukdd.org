  Wizarding culture is shit, for the most part wizards seem to put themselves above other sentient creatures, enslaved a race of them, took rights away from those with diseases etc.

That that's shit is your perspective and my perspective and probably the perspective of most muggleborns, but you won't find much sympathy from Lucius Malfoy or Dolores Umbridge. To them, equal rights for werewolves would make as much sense as letting dogs vote or promoting the rights of broccoli.

If one person suggested that, you'd laugh. If fifty people suggested it, independently, in all earnestness, and they were also from the same group, you'd start to develop opinions about that group. It would take a fair amount of awareness, patience, and effort to avoid getting biased.
