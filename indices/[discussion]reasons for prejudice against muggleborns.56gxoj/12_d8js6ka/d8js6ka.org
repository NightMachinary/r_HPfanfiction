I hate the culture argument so much. Wizarding culture is shit, for the most part wizards seem to put themselves above other sentient creatures, enslaved a race of them, took rights away from those with diseases etc. That sounds really dramatic but from a purely canon point why would they respect wizarding culture? The fear of pure blood argument is basically an argument that white extremists use to argue against race mixing is that really the best argument to use?

That being said though I will never understand why when trying to write a book that tries to make muggle haters sympathetic that they don't go towards history. Witches and wizards have the ability to kill people with something they're given age 11, muggles created a bomb capable of killing millions and wiping out the earth. The cold war is such a great reason that could be used in fanfics for people being anti muggle but i never see it touched upon at all, just shitty things like 'not respecting wizarding culture' or 'purebloods dying out'.
