I'm not a writer of HP stories, but here's how I see it:

Wizards were being persecuted by non-magicals for a long time before the Statute of Secrecy was first thought of. This appears to go back until the founding of Hogwarts in or around the 10th century. Considering that wizards had wands or other foci /at least/ since the 4th century BC, we are very likely looking at many hundreds of years of a decently if not well-educated portion of the population that had magic living along-side the unwashed and illiterate peasants that had no access to this mystical power. Even without religious fervor being added to the mix, that does not make for the most stable of arrangements. Add in the many small nuggets of supplementary information that were provided on Rowling's official site and the picture we can draw about the creation of the Statute of Secrecy is telling.

Against this backdrop we see the creation of a new magical government that actively encourages and enforces its population to grow increasingly separated from the non-magical world. Any such separation would allow the negative feelings to fester and grow, yet the wizarding world still has to take in the descendants of the very people they have begun hiding from into their own society and even pay for their magical education. Personally, I would liken the behavioral patterns of the wizarding world to the cold-war sentiment in the older generation in the US, where Russians take the place of muggles and muggle-borns. Some of that is alive even today, just as people with Japanese ancestry had their own challenges to overcome in the aftermath of World War II.

This so far has nothing to do with said muggles and muggle-borns as of yet, but I'm sure their intrusion into a foreign society cannot be any help, especially when you consider the widening gap between their cultures. The wizarding world most likely stagnated ever since the separation, if its progress didn't grind to a halt entirely. Muggles on the other hand underwent an industrial revolution and all the social and cultural upheaval that became possible and inevitable because of it. I can imagine only too well how wizards would take the first few muggle-borns entering their society with new ideas and realize how welcome they would be.

In the end it comes down to this: even without the general incompatibility between the wizarding world and the modern-day non-magical society, wizards had many well-deserved reasons for their aversion toward non-magicals. Taking it one small step further and including their descendants is not a big leap. If muggle-borns were given a generation or two to integrate completely into the magical community, the whole resentment would go away on its own, but with a new cadre of children entering their small society every year, that agitation will never go away.
