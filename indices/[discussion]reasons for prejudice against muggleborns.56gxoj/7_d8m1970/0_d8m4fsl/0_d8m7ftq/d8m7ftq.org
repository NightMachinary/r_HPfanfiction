It's difficult to say. I think it can be a positive change, but it would be the work of at least one generation if not more. I don't think we 21st century humans would be happy or even content living in the 16th or 17th century, because so much of what we think as progress would suddenly be reversed. If that's the attitude some muggle-born children enter the wizarding world with, then I'm not very surprised at the frosty reception.

Also, imagine a conversation between two children with vastly different ancestries as they both board the Hogwarts Express for the first time. From the muggle-born you'd hear about football (soccer) and about video-games, while the child growing up in the magical world would only be familiar with quidditch, gobstones, exploding snap and whatever else I don't remember right now. Their lack of common knowledge and interests would immediately set them apart from each other and, as we all know, first impressions are a hard thing to combat later on.

In reply to a question like "/do you like quidditch?/", a muggle-born wouldn't answer "/what's that?/" or "/on brooms! really!?!/" but maybe something like "/oh yes, I got to see a match between Puddlemere United and the Arrows, it was great/". Instead of the social awkwardness due to a lack of common ground, these two children from different ends of the spectrum would at least have the chance of using this common denominator to start a friendship down the line.

While I believe that a muggle-born child growing up with one foot in both worlds might create its own kind of issues, some time spent in preparation would help them not stand out so negatively.
