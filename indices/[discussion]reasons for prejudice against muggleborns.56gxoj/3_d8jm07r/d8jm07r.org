Can I be silly? I'm going to be silly. Here's a quote where Regulus explains his view. It's from one of my stories (not published yet, sorry.)

#+begin_quote
  "Muggle-borns are upstarts that don't know their place in our world," Regulus answered a bit harshly.

  "Did they somehow steal their magic?" Vera asked with stinging sarcasm. As if she'd heard this argument before.

  "No, they didn't steal it," he said, confused by that argument. Who would claim someone stole magic? It was born into people, there's no possible way to steal it. He shook his head once and continued, "But they aren't familiar with our world and then they come into it at the age of eleven and don't try to learn anything they've missed. Our culture.

  "Things like blood magic. Blood magic is just a type of ancient magic, it's not necessarily dark. But Muggle-borns don't understand and just assume it's all dark based on the small amount they're exposed to in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Instead of making an attempt to understand, they just try to change things they see as wrong. Our culture isn't /wrong/, it's just different than theirs."

Basically your #2, xenophobia.
