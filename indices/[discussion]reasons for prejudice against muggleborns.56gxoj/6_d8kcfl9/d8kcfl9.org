Compare the Wizarding World with a developed country that is seeing a large influx of immigrants - Singapore is a good example - and all will become clear:

- The Wizarding World can be seen as a "country" that is a lot smaller but a lot more advanced than the neighbouring "countries" (arguable in the modern world since technology has raised the standard of living, but definitely the case in the past where there was a HUGE disparity in things like sanitation standards and mortality rates between magical and non-magical people)

- It has low birth rate overall (having two or more kids is already rare in the old Pureblood families, the Weasleys are extremely unusual) which means that the population would dwindle and possibly die out without immigrants. The birth rate amongst magicals has most likely always been lower than that of non-magicals, due to several reasons - in the past, this was due to a high mortality rate in non-magical children, thus making it necessary to have many children to ensure at least some would survive. Also, if magicals - especially the old Pureblood families - are considered "upper class" and others middle or lower class, then the trend of developed countries having lower fertility rates than less-developed countries also applies to them. (Studies have shown that after a country becomes sufficiently developed, the birth rate drops.)

- Discrimmination against immigrants despite these immigrants being necessary for the survival of the "country". (This is rather similar to the situation in Singapore, which has a low fertility rate amongst its citizens and a very large number of immigrants to make up for that.)

- Lack of human resources and overall decline in population "quality" - inbreeding and low fertility rates means that the wizarding elite are much less capable than they need to be (see: atrociously incompetent Ministry of Magic). Discrimmination makes it difficult for better qualified people who are looked down on for having "bad blood" or some form of affliction (eg. lycanthropy) to take up positions that would allow them to improve the goverment and society. (Clearly a meritocracy is needed to fix the problem.)

- The top 10% of nonmagical students in Britain, for example, is probably way more intelligent and talented than the top 10% of magical students in Britain, simply because the pools they are selected from have such disparate sizes. (This is also most likely why the rather questionable joke "Roses are red / Violets are blue / There's always an Asian / Who's better than you" exists - eg. if you have freaking 1.4billion people in a country (which is what China has) then the best of the best from these 1.4billion people are, statistically, most likely going to be better than the best of the best from somewhere with only 10% of that population size.)

- Those who have a longer family history within the "country" feel that they and their culture are under threat by the "immigrants", yet also consider the "immigrants" to be somehow inferior. The prejudiced purebloods do not appear to have any problem with non-purebloods holding ordinary jobs, but anything that gives them power or prestige (high positions in the government, mainly) would most likely be met with a lot of opposition.

- Voldemort claims that the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts would encourage purebloods to "breed" with muggles and werewolves, and shows his contempt at the notion. This is because muggles and part-humans are considered "filth" by him and his followers, but it could also be because alliances such as marriage can be a form of social mobility. If a muggle/muggleborn/part-human/etc marries a high-status pureblood, then he/she will have some degree of power within the pureblood society because his/her marriage gives a form of legitimacy to his/her presence. This power or legitimacy can be used for making changes in society, perhaps to try and change the unfairly biased system that is largely perpetuated by the high-status old pureblood families. It is unlikely that an "outsider" who enters this society would not attempt to change it, because changing the system would be highly beneficial to the "outsider".

tl;dr people feel threatened and everything is just an excuse for them to continue being xenophobic.
