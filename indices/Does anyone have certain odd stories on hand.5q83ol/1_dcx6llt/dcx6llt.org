So without being based on humour? Well, I guess linkffn(9911469), "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", and linkffn(7552826), "An Unfound Door", kind of fit. The premises they start off with are, respectively:

[[/spoiler][1. Lily (fem!Harry) accidentally kills herself, finds herself with a MOD!Harry and a disgruntled TMR/Voldemort at a train station. This happens a lot. 2. Ravenclaw Harry deals drugs/illicit potions.]]

Or do you want something entirely or mostly AU?
