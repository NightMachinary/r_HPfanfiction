Through the Veil Strangely and the Inquisitor Carrow series, both by littlewhitecat, are utterly hilarious. Carrow's insanity is infectious.\\
The series '[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]]' by mad_fairy, seemingly starts out your typical misguided!Dumbledore fic and goes completely off the rails into space travel. The author has some brilliant ideas, eg [[/spoiler][The diary horcrux gets transfigured into a real boy, AD throws a fit, the dialogue is hysterical]]
