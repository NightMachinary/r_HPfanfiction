linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) This is likely not what you mean and may not be something you would read since it is a HGSS story that is a little messed up at times, but I have always thought of the undelying storyline for this story to be very absurd and something that belonged to a crackish smut fic rather than a serious story. I was surprised by the quality of the story and characters and how the author eventually manages to explain everything in a way that more or less makes sense.

The premise is that a marriage law that forces people together is passed and Hermione has to marry Snape and have lots of children with him as per Ministry law. While there are some explicit scenes, the plot gets very interesting, intense and well thought out with lots of great action scenes and twists. The characterizations are great and everyone feels more or less in character. Has some great humourous scenes too.

Warnings: it does have explicit smut, dubious consent and occasionally violence so read at your own risk.
