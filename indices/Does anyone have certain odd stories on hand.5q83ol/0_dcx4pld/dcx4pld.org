There was a meandering story on Ficwad that included a piece lasting a few chapters about Charlie Weasley rediscovering a water nymph's sacred pool in the Forbidden Forest. He was granted a vision of how the nymph had negotiated with the Founders to establish this as a protected area near their intended castle. I think it may have even been a primary reason for the location being chosen. Somehow this ends up being a catalyst for his finally abandoning his Quidditch ambitions for creature handling.

It was great stuff- moody, meaningful and sexy without being tawdry (though I may not be the best judge of that).
