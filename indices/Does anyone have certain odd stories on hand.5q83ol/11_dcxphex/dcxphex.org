I'm not sure if it fits the request, but I have “In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life” (linkffn(9118202)).

As for leaving canon behind, unless you've already done it I recommend taking a look at esama's “Island of Fire” (linkao3(3236603)), then its sequels, and then any- and everything she wrote, including non--Harry-Potter things for as long as you know the base story/game/whatever (some of them are really good). Quite many of her stories take some world and then twist it into a wonderful AU pretzel (I think it's most prominent with her FF7 stories, but there are some HP ones that go quite far in this direction too).
