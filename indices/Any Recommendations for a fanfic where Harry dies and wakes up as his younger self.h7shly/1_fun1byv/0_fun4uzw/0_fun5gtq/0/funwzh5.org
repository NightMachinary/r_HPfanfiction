Just finished this myself. It really feels like it could have just been a group of friends , but it went the romance way instead. It felt forced when it happened to me, but it was then pushed into the background for more plot related things and I was ok with that.

I'm not against harem stories, but they need to be thought out- this one felt like a slight â€˜oh yeah side note- we are a harem now- anyway homework?' And it just made me pause and have to just nod and go along with it. Great fic overall though.
