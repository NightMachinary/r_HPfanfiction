I don't have any feelings one way or the other really about harem stories. This isn't really focused on the harem however. It's just kind of a thing that happens. So far it's just the girls are part of a study group and familial unit with Harry and are just kind of there with sparse bits thrown in the middle of the story.

It feels tacked on to be honest.
