Well I'm reading linkffn(Back to the Beginning by burnable) at the moment.

It's kind of tropey and a bit too indie Harry for me but it has just enough interesting storylines I haven't read elsewhere to keep me attached for now after 15 chapters.

This is the author who did that really long Harry/Marvel dimension travel fic where he paired with Black Widow if that into means anything to you.
