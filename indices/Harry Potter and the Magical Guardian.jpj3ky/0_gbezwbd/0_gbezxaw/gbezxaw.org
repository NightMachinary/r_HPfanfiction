  What if Lily and Petunia had been able to reconcile while Lily was still early in school? If the two remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding? What if Harry knew a lot about his mother, and wanted to be like her rather than his famous father? What impact would that have on a certain headmaster's plan to have a young Harry enter the magical world hoping for an escape?
