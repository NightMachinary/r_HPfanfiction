Assuming the native Americans were treated much like they were in real life magical America would probably be a mix of all the people who have settled there over the years. Since it's just a blend of various cultures you can justify pretty much anything. I would imagine it would be more progressive and accepting of muggleborns/non humans since it isn't steeped in history like Europe. Keep in mind America is more spread out than Britain so there will probably be multiple shopping places and having everyone come to school on a single train would be super impractical
