This might be contentious. But if you haven't watched Fantastic Beasts, don't try to follow canon for America; it's pretty flimsy and unsatisfactory, and doesn't really work the way Rowling's Britain does due to her unfamiliarity with the culture. Also, if you're writing an America fic, you are probably not doing it to get a big audience - fervent canon compliance is not going to make a big impact on your readership.

If you're American, you're in a better place than Rowling to try to make sense of this. Try creating your own version of Ilvermorny - how would wizarding culture in America be different than in Britain? How would the schools be different? How would the names of your characters be different? Is Gringotts a global brand or do you want it to purely be a British thing.

Alexandra Quick is a great example of how to construct a really wonderful, original magical America. I really wish more people would take this approach, particularly if they're not locked into a canon-compliant mindset.
