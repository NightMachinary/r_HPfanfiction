Well I like to think American witches and wizards are a lot bigger on integration with muggles or no-majes then Brits. So there are no robes other than for very formal occasions like magical senate meetings. You won't ever find an American wizard wearing a nightgown in public. There are very few pureblood supremacist in USA because they are mostly descendants from British muggleborns who wanted to get away.
