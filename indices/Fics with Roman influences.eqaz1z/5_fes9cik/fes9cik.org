Britain has always been very... blended. Half our culture is brought in by others coming in or stolen when we went to them. Most likely, we'd end up with some people being Druidic, some Wiccan, some Norse, some Roman, some European Variations, etc.

I don't remember any fics taking advantage of Roman Religions, though. Christianity being adopted by the Emperors in the early Hundred-ADs kind of kicked most of the older Religions to the curb and stole their ideas to better integrate their believers. Since magicals would still be mainstream at that point (pre-Statute and all), it'd be quite likely they'd convert from whatever cult, mystery, or school they'd been in before.

It's a shame that it hasn't been used in more fics, really. The Greco-Roman views on Religion were really interesting. Check out the wikipedia article on 'Greco-Roman mysteries', if you're interested in reading more. I've only scanned it briefly, but it seems surprisingly accurate.
