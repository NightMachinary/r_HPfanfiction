Would be a cool concept if there were 4 different types of purebloods that had different beliefs from all the different invasions. Each of them would have 7 families as part of sacred 28.

1) Celtic 2) Nordic/Scandinavian 3) Romans 4) French/Norman

You could expand certain powers or family traits with different families.
