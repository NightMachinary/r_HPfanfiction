If it actually worked (which apparently it doesn't right now :( ), then there is a bot which goes through all new comments on this subreddit and fills in the extensive additional information about the story. See for example [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eppr91/character_goes_to_university/felfjpd/]] If you look at the URL of that story, it is =https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2870133/1/= ... that first number after =/s/= is the story ID on [[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]]. So, if I write here linkffn(2870133), then the bot should find this and the information you see below that comment of mine. =linkao3()= does the same, but for [[https://archiveofourown.org]] (where, =https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862/chapters/32436069= gives the story ID 14078862 and linkao3(14078862) should make the bot to provide additional information).

When it doesn't work (beacuse the bot is broken, it happens too often), the reply to that message of yours with the one which has only =ffnbot!refresh= as a text, and the bot should retry.
