Popping in to say that neither of them are very scary; twisted, sure, but more of an Addams Family-esque twisted than anything.

And it's not very well-written, either. While the explanation for where Dementors came from - as an example - is interesting, and the basic plot is nice, [[#spoiler][Harry suddenly develops a resistance to his only weakness midway through the final few chapters, then proceeds to effortlessly obliterate /Dumbledore./]]
