linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good by Ruskbyte) and sequel would be the a classic recommendations here: a HP/Hellraiser crossover.

linkffn(What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin) is a good mind-screwery sort of fic.

linkffn(Firebird's Son Book I of the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs) and sequels are about as dark and dystopic as HP fanfiction gets, packed with fridge horror.

I wrote a horror novelette as well that might be read in a pinch: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][link]].
