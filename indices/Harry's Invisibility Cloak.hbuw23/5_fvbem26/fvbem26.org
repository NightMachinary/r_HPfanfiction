Because the Deathly Hallows were in my opinion the last moment plotcrutch, and until the sixth volume the Invisibility Cloak was just an Invisibility Cloak, so that for example linkffn(Interwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray by Katinka31) could be perfectly canonical at that time. And it is the great story anyway.
