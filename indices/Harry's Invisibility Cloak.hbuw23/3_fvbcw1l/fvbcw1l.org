Given that "The Tale of the Three Brothers" is found in a children's storybook, it could be possible that version of the story we see is a more child-friendly version of the real story or that the entire tale is just a legend meant to explain the powerful nature of the hallows which are just very powerful enchanted objects.\\
In canon, the elder wand is not unbeatable as Dumbledore did defeat Grindelwald who possessed the wand and the resurrection stone does not truly revive the dead thus the cloak may not be very perfect either. Considering Dumbledore wielded the elder wand, it is likely that he was able to see through the cloak because of it. In the case of Moody's eye, it may be an equally powerful artefact or that Dumbledore himself enchanted the eye using the elder wand.
