The hallows were simply extraordinarily powerful artifacts, not actually created by death (that was the children's book version). This the elder wand was beatable, the cloak wasn't absolute, and the ring didn't actually raise the dead.

We don't know how Dumbledore saw through it, but Moody's Eye was likewise and extra powerful artifact.
