First time commenting on Reddit, but i couldn't ignore your post. Blue magic is probably my all time fanfic on FF.net, and is the fic that got seriously got me into exploring fan fiction. I cant recommend it nearly enough. I think its a shame that it hasn't been updated in a long while, but the author seems to be fairly active and has always responded to my reviews and pm's.

there are several good HP/ME crossovers out there, another one of my favorites (very different in tone to blue magic) is Harry Potter: Geth linkffn( 10784770)

Give it a read if your interested in a humorus, zany adventure!
