  AU Harry pays a high price for booting Voldemort out of his mind at the end of OotP - he is stripped of his magic, but gains something ... other. He starts a new life in the non-magical world, and adapts his skills to join the RAF and later 'The Regiment'. He is assigned to the Atlantis Expedition and, through overcoming adversity, will find a new home and family amongst the stars.
