Dumbledore making being cool again. Fucking perfect. Now all those Dumbledore bashers are too busy trying to validate their existence.

The Casebook of Harry Potter by chris400ad [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373224/1/The-Casebook-of-Harry-Potter]]

This is by far the best calm and cool collected you'll ever find in any fanfiction regarding Harry Potter. He's basically BBC Sherlock-esque, Daphne is his Watson, and they complete cases together as detective consultants. The Aurors don't like him much, but he gets results. Contractual Invalidation's got nothing on this. Or Make a Wish.
