The film version of Hermione stole a few lines from Harry as well. Some people in the fandom claim to this day that Hermione could've defeated Voldemort on her own. That's just completely ludicrous and shows just how bad the films cocked up Hermione's character. In the books she's a complex girl with real human emotions who makes mistakes and needs her friends to be a heroine. In the movies she's perfect and she has everything figured out already to the point where fans disregard the accomplishments of the main character (Harry) in favor of her. Movie! Hermione didn't just ruin Ron, she ruined the trio's entire canon dynamic.
