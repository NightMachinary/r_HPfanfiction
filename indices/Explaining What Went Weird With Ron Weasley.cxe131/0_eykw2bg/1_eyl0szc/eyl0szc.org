What's more, there were two deleted scenes in the movies that I think they were absolutely wrong to delete, and both of them were Ron scenes--only Ron giving exposition, but still. The first is when Ron describes Tom Riddle's award in Chamber of Secrets. Without that, there's no logical reason for Harry to ask the diary about the Chamber. The second is when Ron explains the Taboo in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Without that, the part where Xenophilius says Voldemort's name to summon the Death Eaters makes no sense.
