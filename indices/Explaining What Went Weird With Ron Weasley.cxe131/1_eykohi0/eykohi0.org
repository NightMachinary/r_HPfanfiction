The films cocked up a lot of character development across the board. While he was never as bland as he was in the films the later books did seem to move more towards that side of things, with Ron's development seeming to be more "drama-driven" at times than this character we'd spent years with. His issues with jealousy and being forgotten about that he worked on and finally seemed to have overcome by the end of book four are suddenly brought back in book six with the Quidditch issue (which also has to have Hermione helping rig it to a degree, taking away from his success) while in DH his whole arc feels so contrived into having him come across as a complete arsehole during large segments once again only to have a dramatic turn around when that occurred several books ago (I haven't read Cursed Child but I've heard he has similar placement as "comic relief" in that too)...
