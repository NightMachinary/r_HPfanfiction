The only time which I forgot he was truly jealous is when Krum went out to Hermione. That's it. The rest is just shitty fandom and character assumption that they never bother to check if it's true or not. The boy was an angel till GoF.

Hermione is the same is when Ron date what's her name.

And Harry? Since fucking when?
