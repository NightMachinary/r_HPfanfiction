I think her choice to kill sirius instead of arthur was a poor choice

even if you changed nothing else, it would make book 6 and 7 make much more sense.

Ron would be moody in book six because he is trying to cope with his fathers death and doing it poorly.

ron in book seven would make more sense too he recently lost his father and is now terrifed of losing another family member so soon
