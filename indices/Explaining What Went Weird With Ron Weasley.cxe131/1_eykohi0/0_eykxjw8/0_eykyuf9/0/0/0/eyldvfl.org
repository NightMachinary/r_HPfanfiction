odd that I never got the impression that Harry was closer to Arthur than Sirius. He turns to Sirius in book 4 when he is worried but he talks to Arthur in book 6. Of course that is because Rwoling wanted to establish the fact that Sirius meant a lot to Harry before doing what she did. I personally always imagined that for Harry Arthur's death would be more about guilt than anything else. It's easy to notice that Harry has actually very few interactions with him, but somehow that possiblity of a family is more painful than his friend's father's death.
