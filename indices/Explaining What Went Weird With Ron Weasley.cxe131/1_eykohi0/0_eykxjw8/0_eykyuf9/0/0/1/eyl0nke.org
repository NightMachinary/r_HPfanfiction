I agree with the idea that Arthur's death would've be so much more meaningful, but disagree with the notion that you should therefore not do it. Killing him instead of Sirius would've made more sense and could've really created some friction between Ron and Harry that actually made sense ("How can you act a so depressed, he was /my/ Dad, you selfish git!")
