The problem is you keep Sirius alive and you give Harry too much hope, and if you kill Arthur you bring him too much pain. Harry and Sirius barely knew each other or had a relationship. He was much closer with Arthur (and his family). Sirius' death was about killing possibilities, but there was never anything concrete about them. Arthur would have killed very real parts of Harry's life. Sirius was the possibility of a family, Arthur /was./

Sirius dying was a step along the path in slowly leading Harry to accept the idea that death, really, was just another great adventure. One that you could come to terms with.
