  Ron on the other hand rarely has moments in the books that truly make him shine.

The last true moment where he shined was in the third book where he stood up for Harry with a broken leg against Sirius. There is a good moment in book 5 and several good moments in book 7 such as the final quidditch match or escaping from a group of snatchers on his own. But they all happened off screen so we get informed about them which leaves no impact.

It's obvious that JKR didn't know what to do with the character in book 4-6, and just used him as a source of conflict between the trio.
