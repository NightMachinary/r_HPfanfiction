Good on you for at least admitting that the movies impacted your affinity for Harmony/Hermione and her different persona. A lot of H/Hr shippers won't admit that the movies somewhat influenced their liking for the pairing (I know this isn't true for everyone who likes them as a couple because some ship them on the books alone).

Steve Kloves took it too far in the films and I'm not even talking about the dancing scene in DH Part 1 (which I thought was a sweet and appropriate for movie!Harry and movie!Hermione, even though moody book!Harry would never do it). The films gave H/Hr non-canon intimate talks and touching, Hermione crying on his shoulder, that line about 'growing old together,' Hermione crying and hugging Harry saying she'll 'go with him' when he goes to meet Voldemort in DH Part 2 while Ron just stands and stares in the background, and Dumbledore (of all people. Isn't he supposed to be all-knowing?) suggesting that they might like each other in the HBP film. None of these moments being canon is a major red flag against the ship for me. I would ship H/Hr if I hadn't read the books and only saw the films thanks to the ridiculous hoops the screenwriters jump through to give them moments together.
