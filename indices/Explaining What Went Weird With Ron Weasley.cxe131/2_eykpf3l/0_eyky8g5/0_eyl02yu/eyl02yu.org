I think that people trying to ship them in a strict book sense are just trying to find all sorts of things that aren't really there in the books (at least not to the extent that some people want it to). I also think that there is nothing wrong with going beyond the books. For experienced fanfiction readers, it becomes very hard to keep a strict canon interpretation of any character in the series. It's very easy to see with characters that were minimal in the books (Daphne Greengrass is, of course, the prime example of this), but in my opinion, it happens to every character.
