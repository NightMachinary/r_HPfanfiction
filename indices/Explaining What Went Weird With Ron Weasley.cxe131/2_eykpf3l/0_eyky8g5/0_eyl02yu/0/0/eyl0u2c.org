Not every fanfiction, but you are correct that there are a ton of common personality traits for her. And that's exactly my point, her character was heavily influenced by fanfiction to the point where a lot about her character has basically become canon (or fanon). I think we can see this in a lot of other characters as well, and it shows how much stuff like the movies and fanfiction has influenced our perception and interpretation of certain characters.
