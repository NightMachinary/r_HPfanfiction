Yeah, this is what puts me of from H/Hr.

I used to ship them on 2011 when I only read fanfiction in my local language, the fandom there pushed what made H/Hr great instead of bashing another character. I was surprised that the international H/Hr fandom is really toxic.

At this point, I won't even read H/Hr unless it's a total AU from first year or comes from an Author that I liked.
