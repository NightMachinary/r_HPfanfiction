Some shippers give their ship a bad reputation though with their bad attitudes and bashing other characters. In the case of H/Hr, 90% of the fics are badly written, Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, cliche nonsense and generic crap. It just makes the whole H/Hr fandom look immature because some people feel like they can't write their ship without turning Ron into a literal Death Eater even though it's 100% against his character.
