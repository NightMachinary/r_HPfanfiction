I really don't get the concept of shipping. The whole point of fanfiction is to expand on cannon or present a different universe than the cannon one. A good author can make ANYTHING work. From evil Dumbledoor to "good" Voldemort. Unless yone is in the mood for a certain type of fic, I don't see the point in discriminating fanfiction based on cannon.
