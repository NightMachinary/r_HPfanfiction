Hits a lot of good points. I think the movies have had a major impact on how people view certain characters. Specifically Hermione and Ron. I know that my preference for Harmony is largely inspired by how Hermione's film adaptation changed her book persona.

That being said in my opinion Ron's movie portrayal only highlights some of the less favourable characterisations of his book personality. I'd still call Ron the more goofy one of the bunch, and his actions in GoF and DH leaving Harry (and Hermione) are very much book canon.

I also think that the creator tries to "blame" the movies a lot for the disparity between Harry/Hermione on one side and Ron on the other hand. I think that the books themselves already set up Harry and Hermione as more prominent special characters. Ron on the other hand rarely has moments in the books that truly make him shine. The video tries to make out book Ron as a character that overcomes feelings of inadequacy and coming into his own out of the shadow of his brothers. But in the books he still is very much overcome with jealousy and he rarely has really big accomplishments on his own. The highlights of Ron (solo) that come to mind are the chess game in book 1 and the Quidditch match in book 5. While Hermione and Harry both have a ton more to show.

So while the books certainly allowed for a far more nuanced character it's not as if the movie invented a bunch of stuff out of thin air.
