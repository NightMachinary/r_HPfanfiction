Actually I love fics where Harry says fuck you to the wizards and their traditions and have come to avoid anything that has to do with him becoming a proper pureblood completely forgetting about the muggle world or suddenly thinking they are inferior. I can live with smart girls in a fic as long as that character is not Hermione and she doesn't have a holier than thou, overbearing, forceful attitude.
