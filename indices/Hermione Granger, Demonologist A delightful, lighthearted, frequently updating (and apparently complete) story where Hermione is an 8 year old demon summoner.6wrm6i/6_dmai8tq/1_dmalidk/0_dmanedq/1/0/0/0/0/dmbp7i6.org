How? It's Harry doing what he wants, yes it's forceful but he isn't forcing his views on others. I don't understand what you are trying to get out of me here? We already established that I loathe Hermione enough to exagerate her faults but I can honestly say that I don't remember reading Harry being Hermione-esque or any other OC for that manner.

The simplest and crudest way I see her is an unwanted overbearing mother that thinks she knows best rather than a friend, and that's me being generous and nice.
