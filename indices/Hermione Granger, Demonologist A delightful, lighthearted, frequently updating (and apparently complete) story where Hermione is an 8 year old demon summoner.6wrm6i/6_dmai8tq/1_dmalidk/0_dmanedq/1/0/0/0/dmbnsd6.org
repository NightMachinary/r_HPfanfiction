  If it's a bashing fic then yes, otherwise I don't exactly remember reading any fics where Harry becomes too Hermione-like

  Actually I love fics where Harry says fuck you to the wizards and their traditions and have come to avoid anything that has to do with him becoming a proper pureblood completely forgetting about the muggle world or suddenly thinking they are inferior.

That sounds very "holier than thou, overbearing and forceful" to me.
