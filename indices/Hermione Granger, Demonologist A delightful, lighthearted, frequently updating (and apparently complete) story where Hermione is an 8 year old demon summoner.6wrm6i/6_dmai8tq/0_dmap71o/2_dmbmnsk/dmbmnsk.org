I think that I get triggered easily when it comes to Hermione nowadays. I am simply at a point that I loathe her character and seeing so many good fic idea get ruined FOR ME by her presence is grating on my nerves I guess?

But to reply to your question I was complaining about the idea behind the fic looking good but it getting ruined by Hermione FOR ME. Sorry if I offended you Hermione lovers, it honestly wasn't my intent.
