And I was ranting/whining about the idea behind the fic looking good, getting ruined for me because of Hermione. I get it that I have really no reason to even click on threads with Hermione in the title unless I plan to start a rant war but I guess I was feeling annoyed after I barely read "Daft Morons" because I skipped most of the last few chapters because they were full of pointless Hermione fluff or w/e.
