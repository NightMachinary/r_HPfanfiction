It took saving her from a troll in canon, since Hermione was in Gryffindor, and a tad obnoxious. If she's a poor muggleborn bullied by Slytherins, that might be different. And she and Ron and Harry would have a shared loathing of Malfoy, possibly Snape, and Slytherin.

I just don't really want another "Hermione and the good Slytherins" story.
