Assuming both of them are still Gryffindors, what form do you envision this "support" taking? It took a mountain troll to get them to actually be friends, and even then, they have almost nothing in common. With them being in different Houses, the barrier is even higher. On the other hand, we can't get away from the fact that Hermione will be sleeping in the same room as Slytherins about whom canon is silent or nearly silent. Not interacting with them would just be weird.

For that matter, it's not like Hermione is lacking for "friends" in this particular fic...
