It's a good start, but I am looking forward to Hogwarts with a bit of trepidation. Lots of recent otherwise well-written Hermione-in-Slytherin fics have taken place in a Bizarro Hogwarts where Slytherins are nice and accepting (even of outspoken Muggleborns), Draco is friendly and supportive, and Narcissa sees Hermione as the daughter she never had, whereas Gryffindors (particularly Ron) are throwing "Mudblood" around like no tomorrow, and Dumbledore persecutes the poor Slytherins at every opportunity. (See /Green Girl/ and /Mudsnake/ for recent popular examples. Or don't.)

I hope that this fic portrays Slytherin as something more canon-consistent, and Hermione will actually have to deal with the fact that a good fraction of her house are children of Death Eaters who have no reason to question their parents' views (as in /Applied Cultural Anthropology/).
