Salazar Slytherin: "What's all this about Death Eaters? Blow them! Just because we purebloods are superior doesn't give us the right to mistreat others! ...What? Is that what you lot really thought I stood for? Load of bloody rubbish. No, my house at Hogwarts, and Hogwarts was my idea you know, get all the little ones together, train them to be good leaders...no, my house at Hogwarts is meant to be about /real/ ambition. It is about zany schemes that would never work, because who knows, they might work after all. It is about entrepreneurship, lads, not petty politics and backroom deals. No no, the truth is, /real/ Slytherins are about TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!! Often on a weekly basis, 7 PM every Saturday."
