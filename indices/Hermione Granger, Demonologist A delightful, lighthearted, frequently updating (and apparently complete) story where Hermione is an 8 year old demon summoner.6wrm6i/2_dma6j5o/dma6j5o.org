Will it stay lighthearted? I guess only the author can say. I certainly hope so. I really like the happiness exuded in the initial chapters, and as far as "early access to OP magic" stories go, demon summoning is actually relatively believable, since it's a common fantasy trope to summon demons as a shortcut to greater power.
