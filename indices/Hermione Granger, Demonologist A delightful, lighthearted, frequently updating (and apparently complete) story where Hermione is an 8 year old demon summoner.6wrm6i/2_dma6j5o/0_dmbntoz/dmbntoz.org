According to the author, whom I know on Facebook, it will get "a bit darker as the story progresses but not horror dark".

As an aside, she is just blown away with the response she's getting from this story. She really appreciated OP posting the story here to "drum up" views and visitors.

Feel free to ask me any serious questions about the story and I'll relay them to her.
