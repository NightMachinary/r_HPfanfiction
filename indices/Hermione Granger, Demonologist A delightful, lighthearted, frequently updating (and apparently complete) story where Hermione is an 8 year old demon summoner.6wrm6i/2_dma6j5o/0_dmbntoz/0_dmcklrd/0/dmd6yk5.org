  Hello Reddit mouthpiece minion o' mine! :D Someone asked in the thread about their concerns about "Bizarro Hogwarts". (I wonder what's up with their FFN PMs? I haven't noticed any problems.)

  You can assure them that: I expect my Slytherins will meet with your approval, as they will most certainly not be universally welcoming, and their canonical blood prejudices will for the most part remain intact. Do give the story a little time to develop, however, to fully see what I mean. Rest assured that my story will definitely not contain good!Slytherins. (That can be a fun trope for a fic, but this isn't that kind of story.)

  Dumbledore will be almost entirely absent from the story, and won't pick on Slytherins outside of strictly canonical actions.
