Personally I'm hoping that if it takes a 'serious' turn, then Hermione will accidentally turn the demons she summons good, rather than them turning her evil.

And, like, the good-guy demons start fighting with each other over who's the nicest, getting into oneupmanship over feeding the poor and housing orphans and apprehending Death Eaters and whatnot.
