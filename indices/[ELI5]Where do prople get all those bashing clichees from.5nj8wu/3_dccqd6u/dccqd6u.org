If you read one fic with an idea, it might seem fresh, so you put it in your own story. Meanwhile, you're ignoring five thousand other fics that include that same idea.

For greedy plotting Weasleys, consider that Ginny is briefly shown it the first book, is more prominent in the second (though mostly in the climax), then disappears for a bit. The same book when she reappears, we get love potions involved in two different subplots (Romilda Vane and Amortentia). I think that was also the book where Molly Weasley makes an offhand mention of using a love potion to get involved with Arthur. If it had been revealed that Ginny were using love potions, I'd say the foreshadowing were a bit heavyhanded. And once you get there, what's the motive? Money is an obvious one: Harry has piles of money, and the Weasleys barely have enough to do the school shopping.
