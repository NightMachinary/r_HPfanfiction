Some of it is stuff invented by fans. Some is the result of trying to make sense of the various inconsistencies in canon.

For example, Fumbledore making convoluted and overcomplicated plans that a) a child can see through and b) rely on a chain of coincidences to work is simply the result of people taking canon as an example - Book 4 and 5 show exactly the same kind of plots done by Voldemort.

Dumbledore bashing stems in part from the fact that canon Dumbledore is a plot device as much or more as he is a character. He can't be effective in the first books, or the kids couldn't be heroes, for example. Add in parody elements and charicatures, and any attempt to make sense of all of it without cutting a lot of it out will lead to weird convoluted stuff.
