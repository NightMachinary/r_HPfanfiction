In Year 1, just admit Dumbledore was trying to trap Voldemort in a place with hundreds of defenseless children. But then Harry had to meddle to spoil the plan. On the bright side, it proved Harry's strength and resourcefulness.

In Year 2, Dumbledore was truly stuck. His past talks with Moaning Myrtle yielded nothing over the years, and he couldn't clear Hagrid as a result. Ginny apparently wrote in the Diary against all common sense taught by her parents because there was a compulsion charm on it. Harry, distrusting authorities as usual, didn't think of showing the Diary to any from the staff.

In Year 3, the evil and incompetent Ministry was running the show. Time Turner really adds nothing to the Series and is a highly overpowered and easily abused plot device.

Year 4 Moody impersonation scheme is probably the worst plot device in the entire Series. It would be a lot more credible to have Barty Jr impersonating his dad and avoiding detection that way. He could still have easy access to the Goblet and in addition, important Ministry officials.
