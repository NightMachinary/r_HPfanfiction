That would make a much scarier Year 4-5 story.

If I were to do a canon rewrite, this would be my plot for Year 4. In addition, I would have Barty Jr surviving the year and causing more trouble within the Ministry. It would have explained Fudge's behaviors a lot better and gave Dumbledore a much better excuse to ignore Harry's plight the next year.
