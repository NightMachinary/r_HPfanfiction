As with many conspiracy theories, you take a ton of apparently innocuous coincidences and chain them together into a nefarious plot. Dumbledore sending Hagrid to collect Harry and holding onto the invisibility cloak is evidence that Dumbledore wished to imprint Slytherin bias on Harry, stole from him, and tried to keep him ignorant of his heritage.

Molly's questioning of Ginny, Ginny's relative absence from the story, and Molly mentioning love potions are all evidence of a Weasley plot to trap Harry in a marriage contract and steal his money.
