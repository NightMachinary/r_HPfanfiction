Take 'what if to the nth degree'. Where does any conspiracy theory start? You start with what you think is a plot hole or something that doesn't make sense and you search for an explanation. If you make one up then it has to make some sense, if it doesn't you either admit it or you go deeper down the rabbit hole and warp everything to fit your theory. Does Mrs Weasley potentially breach the Statue of Secrecy to attract Harry's attention of because she's a bit dense at times. Does she ask about the station to get Harry's attention or is she treating Ginny like the child she is and trying to make her feel involved and clever. If you take the worst of every scenario and twist everything to become 'evidence' you end up getting further and further away from sanity so it doesn't seem like a stretch go go even further. If people want Harry to be richer then they have to give him money or he has it and doesn't know about it. Isn't it strange that nobody ever tells Harry about the wizarding world and none of the goblins talk to him about the details of his inheritance? Take that and then suggest who could be to blame, then you need to give them a motive. Then since you're so deep you just keep digging.
