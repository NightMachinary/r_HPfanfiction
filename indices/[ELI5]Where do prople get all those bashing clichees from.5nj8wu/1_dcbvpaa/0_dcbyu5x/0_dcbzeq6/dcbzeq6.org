Sometimes. But often they're about greed. They're often set up around the premise that if Harry had to die what would happen to his stuff and Dumbledore and Molly taking measures to ensure they controlled it. Or at least the ones I tried to wade through. Just because they're dumb motives doesn't mean they're not there. Simplifying the idea that defeating Voldemort is a motive in and of itself and if they believe that Harry dying is the only way then obviously they are going to want him to die. Now how they go about this can lead to basing. If they someone wants him downtrodden and feeling worthless so is willing to die then bashing is easy. If you want Harry to have a good life and hope that he will live then you have almost canon. You want Harry to live and think that the idea of dying for everyone is stupid you have indyHarry.
