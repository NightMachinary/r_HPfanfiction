Something like this happens in [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]] - Dumbledore's had dementia since before Harry graduated, he uses a potion to keep the symptoms at bay (but he gets addicted to it, so Snape basically gets whatever he wants as long as he keeps brewing it).

The story was written before Book 6 came out, which should be obvious by the fact that Dumbledore's alive after Harry's graduation.
