Harry'll die in the forbidden forest during the battle of Hogwarts. That is going to be a really dark fic, though.

But what will RAB's locket be with the note for Voldemort replace? What nasty little trinket has Kreacher been trying to destroy?

If written well, the denouement of that fic might be brutal.

Edit: Plot twist, HP is a self insert and JKR's books were all a lie, only HP's parents were murdered because they were members of the OotP, and Harry got his scar from the house coming down on him that night. While noticing more and more jarring differences with reading JKR's books and actually living in the world, the SI-HP has been trying to listen to Dumbledore about Horcruxes, but Dumbledore's turns out to be senile, and Horcruxes never existed to begin with. At the end the SI-HP ends up in Azkaban, rightfully so.
