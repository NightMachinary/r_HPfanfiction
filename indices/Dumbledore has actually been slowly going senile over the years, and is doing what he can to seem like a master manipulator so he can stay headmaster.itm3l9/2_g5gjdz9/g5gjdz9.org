I remember reading a time travel fic where Harry ends up sometime after Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, and Harry discovers by accident that it left Dumbledore's mind completely in shambles, and only the quick and timely medical intervention keeps it from being permanent. Which explained a lot of Dumbledore's decision making where Harry was concerned. I can't remember for the life of me what that fic was called, though.
