One Hundred and Sixty Nine was amazing and excellent. Hermione goes back in time to 1981.

I rather liked Gelosaþ in Écnesse. Harry goes back in time to the 10th century. The plot doesn't revolve around the slash, and the (two?) explicit scenes can be easily skipped over if that's your preference (it's not my thing, so I skipped them).

If you're not too worried about quality, I can give you a bunch more since they're a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine... but most are average at best.
