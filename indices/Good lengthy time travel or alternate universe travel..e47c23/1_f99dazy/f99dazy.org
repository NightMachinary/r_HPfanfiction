Have you read Amalgum? Someone will probably start criticising it, but whatever. I don't care. So Death makes a deal with Harry to free itself from him and sends him back in time. Like- literally. But young Harry dodges in the last second and old Harry ends up in Gilderoy Lockhart. Chaos ensues when a competent Lockhart comes to Hogwarts. Just read it as a parody or even crackfic and don't look for any deep meaning or life lessons. The second one is older and Harry and his friends accidentally travel to an alternate universe. It's not that long, but it's still good. In the third one, Harry and Hermione travel back to 1980 and befriend Harry's parents while looking for the horcruxes.
