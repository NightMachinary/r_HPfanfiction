Parselmouths are more common than we think, but no one talks about it because of the stigma.

Let's look at what happens when Harry is outed. Everyone /knows/ about them, yet Voldemort is the only living person in England they ever talk about being one. That seems...wrong. Let's see what they can do.

Talk to snakes.

That's it. Wooo, scary. There is no canon evil "Parselmagic", that's all fanon. And usually /bad/ fanon.

There is still something wrong with this picture. Everyone, even little kids, knows what it means to talk to snakes. Maybe because of Voldemort, and other dark wizards, but they still know the exact details. Something is keeping the knowledge alive, enough that kids are taught to be afraid of people who talk to snakes. It is a big. Deal.

Ron freaks out when Harry might have entered a contest without telling him, but he's totally okay with the snake thing. Like, /instantly/ okay with it. Not even a thought. /Literally no one else/ has this reaction. Except for maybe Hermione. She is more taken aback than Ron about the whole thing, even though she likewise says it is nonsense pretty much right away.

Why are Ron and the other Weasleys the only ones who don't buy this "Parselmouth = evil wizard" thing for even a microsecond when everyone else is losing their minds?

Why indeed. Not even the often-stupid gossip follower Molly Weasley ever gives Harry a hard time about it. Odd.

--------------

The plot thickens after reading the whole series. This all centers around the only thing other than talking to a snake that ever matters. The Chamber of Secrets.

Now, not even Dumbledore can open up the CoS -- he didn't remove the dangerous corpse or do any research on it in canon -- yet /Ron/ tries to sound like a snake for a few minutes and opens it up straight away in DH, so they can get a fang?

And there's more. Volde-shade can't, or at least doesn't, open the CoS in the first book when he's possessing a teacher. Instead of a huge-ass snake, he uses a troll to distract everyone. But the diary Horcrux opens it in the second year immediately -- no problem. So why wait? Because he needed a real Parselmouth host, maybe? Because he couldn't speak snake as an undead shade, or as a spirit fragment in a book?

The conclusion is clear.

*Ginny and Ron Weasley are Parselmouths*. Perhaps, /all/ of the Weasleys are. Or maybe the Prewetts and at least some of Molly's kids. It isn't clear.

Might be why Malfoy the Elder targeted Ginny specifically. He knew they were Parselmouths, that /she/ was one. Maybe he tested her somehow, to see her reaction, before planting the diary.

Maybe he even considered this in the first place because he knew the Prewett brothers were -- which is why they were targeted in the war -- and that the diary needed a Parselmouth host to open the CoS. He could have targetted Hermione easily -- after all, she's just a Muggleborn, and a known bookworm.

But he chose a witch who, we are later told, really should have known better, having grown up in a magical family, with a father who handled dangerous enchanted things for a living. For some reason, /she/ was the correct target to sow chaos in advance of a vote for Muggle protection laws, not the Muggleborn friend of Harry Potter.

--------------

This leads to other interesting side theories.

It is nice to think Lily was a Parselmouth and Snape know, or something like that, but it doesn't add up. But there is someone else who fits much, much better.

Look at this group of tight friends, the Marauders. All of the them had a special attribute, a special little secret about them. Sirius was (briefly) secretly the Black family white sheep and was actually a good and responsible person; Remus had his secret furry little problem that was found out; and Peter was secretly a coward who wanted to do better. That secret was revealed all too late.

But what was James, that he fit in so well? He was from an old family, his parents had him very late in life and died soon after he graduated. Tragic, but not that mysterious. Everyone else in the Marauders had a secret. What was James'? And maybe, just maybe, one should ask: what did Lily find out about him that changed her mind so drastically?

*James Potter was a Parselmouth, as was his son.*
