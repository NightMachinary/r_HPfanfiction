Oh, this bit of headcanon is going in my fanfic. Big time.

As you say, some canon is better than other. In my view, it goes (from strongest, most useful canon for fanfic to least): first three books, next three books, written WoG during original publishing timeframe (newsletter stuff and any clarifications), all interview WoGs, extra website stuff, all additional supplementary books or new novels, DH, the stuff added in the movies.

I think an author is in a certain mindset when writing, and stuff they come up with after the fact simply isn't serving the same purpose. See: George Lucas.

This means JKR's latest stuff about Hermione/Ron is less important to me than the original written material -- however much that hurts because of my shipping registry. But I think it keeps things closer to the author's original ideas that way.

That's just for weaving new headcanon. When going AU, of course, go /crazy/.
