I love this theory. I hadn't considered it a possibility. The way, I see it, just based on the facts you presented it might not convince too many people, but if you could weave that into a story, it would be epic.

Also, I'm pretty keen on removing word of god and epilogue from canon. I enjoyed the epilogue and sometimes agree with JKR's sentiments, but it's often too restrictive for Fanfics and boring.
