  *Half-bloods seem to be the most magically powerful. Albus Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, and Harry Potter are good examples of this.

A common justification for this that I have read and rather like is that the purebloods really /are/ concentrating their magic and improving their bloodline by having purely magical lineages, but some other factor, likely inbreeding, is weakening the magic. Therefor, a strong pureblood bloodline, with an influx of new blood from a muggleborn has the potential to produce very powerful children.

One version of it that I recently read (can't remember which fic) is that the inbreeding is deleterious to their physical health, so they have to waste magic just keeping themselves alive, so "weak" purebloods actually have lots of magic, but most of it is not available for active spell casting.
