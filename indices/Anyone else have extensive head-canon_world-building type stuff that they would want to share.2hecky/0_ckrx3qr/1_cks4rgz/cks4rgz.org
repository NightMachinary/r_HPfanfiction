I agree with your idea of Harry inheriting the ability to speak Parseltongue from James. My head-canon is that the Slytherin line mixed with the Peverell line before the Peverells split and eventually became the Gaunts and Potters.

Other head-canons:

*Full veelas are born to a female veela and a male muggle. That is the only way for them to keep up their population in my opinion.

*That the permanent resident of a building cannot be made the secret keeper or said building. This would explain why James or Lily were not the secret keeper themselves.

*Half-bloods seem to be the most magically powerful. Albus Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, and Harry Potter are good examples of this. They also seem to have an easier time using the Dark Arts. Minerva McGonagall using the Imperius Curse on Amycus Carrow despite not being a Dark Witch and Harry Potter using Snape's Sectumsempra curse without even knowing the effects, Using the Imperius Curse without any prior practice, and being able to successfully cast the Cruciatus Curse on his third attempt (Bellatrix in OotP, attempt on Snape in HBP after he killed Dumbledore, Amycus Carrow in DH).

*The Potters were not included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight because either a recent Lord or Lady Potter (I don't necessarily agree with the whole Lordship idea that so many authors use, but it was the easiest way to explain it and I'm strapped for time) were illegitimate with almost definite Pure-blood ancestry, but there was enough doubt for Cantankerus Nott to exclude them from the list. This would explain why they were not included, but Dorea Potter was not blasted off the Black Family Tapestry.

I'll add more later.
