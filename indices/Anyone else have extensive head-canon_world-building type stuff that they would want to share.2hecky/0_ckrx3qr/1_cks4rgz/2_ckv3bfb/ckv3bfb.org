  I agree with your idea of Harry inheriting the ability to speak Parseltongue from James. My head-canon is that the Slytherin line mixed with the Peverell line before the Peverells split and eventually became the Gaunts and Potters.

Except JK has said he lost the ability after the Horcrux left him.
