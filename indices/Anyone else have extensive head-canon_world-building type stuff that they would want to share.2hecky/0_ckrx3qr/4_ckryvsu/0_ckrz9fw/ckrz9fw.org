  you can't make these kind of theories about a finished work, just call them headcanons
#+end_quote

Sure I can. That's what that means. What on Earth do you think it means?

#+begin_quote
  Besides it's canon that Harry loses the ability to speak Parselmouth after he loses the horcrux
#+end_quote

Meh. Word of god, sure, but not an interesting one. And one that is never backed up by ever being a plot point or discussed by anyone in the story.

That's why it is headcanon. It /could/ be true, regardless of what was actually written or not written on the subject. There is a crack in the narrative and it /could/ fit.

I'm not suggesting that Harry was really an alien, or that Voldemort was really a good person who was screwed over by EvilDumbledore, or something completely AU like that.

  ...and he never had the true ability anyway, it seems actual Parselmouths can speak it whenever they want and *not just when looking at snakes*. So he didn't inherit the ability.
#+end_quote

What? Oh, yeah, which is why there were snakes carved on everything activated by Parceltongue passwords in direct contravention of logical security -- because Voldemort and goddamn Salazar fucking Slytherin needed to be reminded how to open those doors, not because it helped them use their abilities.

No, wait. Nevermind. I recognize this fun-killing madness. Go somewhere else and discuss how many positive adjectives were used to describe Ginny, or why JKR saying Hermione/Ron was a mistake isn't /really/ something that changes the context of canon, or something.

*edit to add:

#+begin_quote
  Also if Ron was a parselmouth he would have heard the Basilisk speak through the walls.
#+end_quote

Ron is the most aware person I know. This totally destroys my theory.

#+begin_quote
  And I'm only now realizing your whole post might be a joke, fuck me.
#+end_quote

Strange, that was exactly what I was thinking.
