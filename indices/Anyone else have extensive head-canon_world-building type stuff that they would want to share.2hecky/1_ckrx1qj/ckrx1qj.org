I have many (over 50) files with ruminations on topics of how things work in the Potter world, but most of it is half-written musings rather than presentable complete arguments or stories.

Where is your interest focused for this?

EDIT: an example of something close to presentable

Ruminations - Brooms that fly

As with anything, this is all conjecture.

956 A.D.

It all started with a wizard milliner/thatcher named Orton who wanted his rye stalks to stand up straight and tall. [brief tale about country farmers, jealousy and magic- he couldn't cast magic for the competition, so he mucked with the plant. His rye always looked short and limp compared to his wheat-growing competitors, and they teased him that his bread was just as bitter as he was.]

So, once he had them oriented, the stalks knew to aim their tips to the heavens and their roots straight towards the ground. As a strange by-product, he discovered that harvesting the stalks was easier- as if the plants weighed almost nothing. Inspired, he reapplied himself to their cultivation, eventually developing stalks that would lift off the ground the second they were scythed from their anchors in the dirt.

It was his son, William, who made the next discovery- in the process of binding a particularly lifty bundle of stalks, he found that the collection began to float up towards the rafters. When he jumped to grab onto this bundle, his weight drew them down, but then a curious thing happened- the stalks seemed to draw upon Will's own magic, and the boy and bundle burst up through the thatched roof. The boy clung on for dear life, but that only seemed to accelerate their ascent.

He was bewildered, but still a boy- once the panic passed, he found great fun in lurching about, this way and that, hundreds of feet in the air. After separating several of the stalks, his own weight and the lessened aggregate lifting effect brought him back to the ground.

[add in hijinks around night floating and haunting people and bombing enemies with frogs]

He didn't tell his father about his adventure- not immediately. Instead he carefully collected the bundles into many, much smaller sheafs, in order to prevent the lifting effect from becoming an issue in getting their wares to market.

A few weeks later, the boy had a revelation while staring at his clumsy but attractive cousin Myrtle. As it was raining, they were working closely together in the portion of the barn that still had a roof. Will was separating hot ashes from a young dragon's manure into a brass vase, to later be mixed into their fertilizer. Myrtle was churning butter and teasing William by making all sorts of suggestive and indecent noises while working the dash pole. The girl would often get entangled with just about anything, possibly due to a lingering childhood jinx that caused her hair and ribbons to wrap around nearby objects like a climbing vine. On this occasion...

Myrtle turned in concern when her stern was burned by the wyvern urn, and upturned her churner.

William set aside his moment of poetic inspiration for another sort of revelation. He exclaimed, "If the lift is anchored at the base, I could grasp the handle and the whole thing would tip forward!" (...or something to that effect- he said it in Old Saxon or Welsh or something).

William used the butter churner as a base and drilled holes into it so his toes could interleave with the stalk heads to feed them magic. He anchored the dash pole to the lid with pegs, gaining him a footrest in the bargain. When he first flew the flying churn-top, he found that he would need to rest back to an upright position and step around the base in order to reverse direction. The shaft as well needed to be quite long to afford him more options in changing his pitch, though he couldn't shimmy too far up the pole or his toes would lose their connection to the lifting stalks.

It took months to years of tinkering to work out the selection of stalks for optimal lift quality and find better ways to join and bind them in order to balance the flight, but this was the first example of what became our modern flying broomstick.

Will and his father showed off the invention at market, where it drew much head-scratching from the serious-minded hedge wizards and farmers. Their children were much more enthused, as were a quartet of German merchants. They asked many questions and eventually left with knowledge of Orton's Straight-growth Charm.

Orton's lifting rye had no success as a thatching material though- it all tended to lift up and separate, leaving gaps in the thatch rather than settling in to provide proper shelter. The grain didn't taste any better, either.

Years later, the German merchants had cultivated their own lifting plants, using wand-quality woods for both the shaft and twigs. They had discovered how to make the shaft from a horizontal branch in order to get a lifting body with perpendicular bias and leverage the twigs to control thrust and direction, thus advanced the technology of the flying pole into its more modern broomstick form. Wandlore is a factor here, as it was much easier to control via enchantment than physically adjusting the twigs.

Rumor suggests that Baba Yaga used Orton's Straight-growth Charm on a stalagmite forming in a limestone cave that eventually became the pestle in her flying mortar-&-pestle. Yaga is also known as the first and only witch to permanently change herself into a hag so that she'd always have strong nails and teeth, so we don't discount the looney coming up with such a scheme. Rumor also suggests that her plan to make a narrow shaft of stone self-levitating was not done for the sake of a flying device, but that's a tale for an older and less-scrupled audience.
