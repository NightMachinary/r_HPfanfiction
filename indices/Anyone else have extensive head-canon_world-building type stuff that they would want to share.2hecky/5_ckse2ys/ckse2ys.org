It is not possible for someone under imperious to cast Avada Kedavra, Crucio, Expecto Patronus, or any spell that require a strong emotional component. Under the imperious, you feel "a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness." Casting any of the above spells is simply incompatible with the feelings under the imperio. If the person under the imperio would manage the feelings required for those spells, it would break the control imperio exerts (presumably before the spell is actually cast, but not necessarily). (The patronus does require happy feelings, but of a "positive" type. Not just the mindless happyness that the imperio gives.)

Three or four hundred years after Hogwarts was founded became the beginning of the British Magical world's golden age. This was because of the Hogwarts house system, specifically the Ravenclaw house.

The Ravenclaw house encouraged knowledge. And now there was a new central location for research and scholarships. All which spurred inventions, etc. However, after several hundred years, all of the "low hanging" fruits of research were uncovered.

But it is the way of things that radical new ideas are never easily accepted, and so Ravenclaw house eventual becomes more about grades than amount discovery. The

This is part of why the magical world is stuck in the past. They are trying to hold onto their golden age.
