It's used in fanfiction to make the abuse by the Dursley's appear even more vicious- the idea that Harry didn't know his name was Harry until he went to school at 5, being called 'freak' or 'boy' up until then. This references known real-world abuse scenarios like the one in the biography 'A Boy Called It'.
