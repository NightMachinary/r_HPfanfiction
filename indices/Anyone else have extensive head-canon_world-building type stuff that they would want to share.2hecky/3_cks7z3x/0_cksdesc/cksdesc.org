Book 4 really confounds that sort of argument. The Quidditch World Cup stadium was packed full at a capacity of 100,000, and those are the fans who showed up. Arthur Weasley also mentions that 500 ministry workers- not administration, mind you, but rank and file spellcasters- were involved in building the stadium over 6 months. Over 200 Portkeys had been seeded throughout /Britain/ to accommodate the expected attendance, with the portkey on Stoatshead Hill meant to cover the Weasleys, Diggorys, Lovegoods and Fawcetts.

Essentially, Math is not JKR's strong point, but with a bit of conjecture one should conclude that Hogwarts is not the only school in the UK, merely the best.
