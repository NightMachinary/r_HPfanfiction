I'm working on a theory that most of the Asian magicals have taken the Secrecy imperative a step further; they all are taken from their home countries to live in Shambhala (known in the West as Shangri-La). It's like Hotel California in there- an ever-expanding magical paradise, but with no exit unless you work in 'acquisitions'. The real question then is who the Patils, Changs and Lis insulted to get barred from entry.
