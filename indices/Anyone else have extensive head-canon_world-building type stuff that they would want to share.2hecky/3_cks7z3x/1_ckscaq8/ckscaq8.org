The problem I have with small popultions is the amount of books and spells that exist. Such a small population would not produce such volumous amounts of books we are led to believe exist in the Hogwarts library. Further, we are led to believe that spell crafting is dangerous, so i dont think that there would be such a large number of spells that there appears to be in canon.
