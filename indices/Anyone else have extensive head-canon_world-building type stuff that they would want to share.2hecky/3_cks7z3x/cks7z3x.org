The wizarding world is /tiny/.

There are only thirteen schools, of which the "big three" are Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons... but of those, only eight are for general education. The rest are specialized schools like the Academy of Broom Flying and the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts.

The interpretation where Hogwarts has a student population of over 1000 students falls apart quickly when you think of the working conditions of the professors - you'd end up with 100 hour work weeks for the heads of houses - Minerva and Slughorn are around 70 and 70-110 in canon, I don't think that 10 hours for sleeping, eating, showering with no weekends off is realistic for them. Much more realistic is a 250-300 students at a given time. Considering that we know of about 10 students a house a year, that just about fits.

That means that in the wizarding world there is a maximum of 2400 children between the ages of 11-17. Assuming that the percent of those are half than those for the muggle population (though that is extremely liberal), we can extrapolate that the entire wizard population of the world has a maximum population of around 60000 people - more realistically half that. This explains why such a small group of people (the Death Eaters) could cause such havoc, and why the Battle of Hogwarts with the 150 fatalities was such a huge thing. One out of 400 up to one out of every two hundred wizards /in the world/ died during that battle.

The Voldemort wars were at least as significant to wizards as WWI and WWII are to us.
