i also feel like the other professors would be some how 'aligned' with a house and help with some of the associated 'house duties'. we never see them because no one takes them, but can't you see Professor Babbling helping out with the Ravenclaws? Or Vector with the Gryffindors? Especially Sinistra since she only teaches once a week.
