I just think that if Eileen Prince had left Tobias Snape that Severus would be just as snarky as canon but would look and act a lot more healthy. A lot of what he is today-snarky greasy anti-social git with sallow skin- could have been remedied with a nicer childhood. Granted, it would have meant he would not have met Lily until school but he also could have avoided most of the Marauder's mechinations because he didn't look as poor and weak [this is assuming that Eileen had gone back to her family and they accepted her but she sounds like a competent brewer so really she could have gotten a job as a Potions Mistress or started her own business or something]. This prevents a lot of the plot of canon from happening even going so far as maybe having Snape not joining the Death Eaters and hearing the prophecy. Sure maybe someone else heard it and told Voldemort [and Voldemort kills the Potters and then takes over the world] but it's not Snape.....

whelp I have fanfiction to write.
