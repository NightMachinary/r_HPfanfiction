On the Origin of the Hogwarts Express

"Why do we hafta take this stupid train trip, anyway?"

"Long ago, four magical people of extraordinary skill and vision came together and built the greatest library of magical knowledge since the destruction of Alexandria..."

Before [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=711922&postcount=3668][Pottermore nerfed it]], I had a notion that there used to be a pilgrimage of those young people being collected to receive their magical education. It was done yearly, but the students wouldn't normally return home until they had reached a skill level that could keep their powers in check and enough sense to prevent others from controlling them. So every year after the harvest, the professors would travel to the places where stories of remarkable children were being told, found out who had the gift and 'bought' them from their parents for the next five years (apprenticeships in the muggle world operated the same way).

Later on the walking pilgrimage became a caravan. As it had evolved, people had taken note of the friendships being forged during the often difficult journey, and it grew into a part of the Hogwarts experience just as much as being Sorted or casting your first flawless spell.

Some purebloods might have wanted to skip the arduous journey, but the wiser ones knew that alliances are forged under conditions of shared hardship.

After the Statutes were implemented, the Ministry took note that the pilgrimage/caravan was getting a bit too conspicuous. At first they used a mix of quick travel methods, but the purebloods didn't want to subsidize muggleborns by paying for their Floo powder or portkeys. A ship was contemplated, but the first test voyage was beset by storms (likely induced by the young passengers' discomfort, which shows that accidental magic doesn't always act for the benefit of its creator). Suffice to say, the ship plan sank.

Thus, when the implementation of rail lines came about, the Wizarding world was only too happy to leverage it for their own needs
