I have about 40 pages written on just the backround of a fic that is probably way too ambitious and clich√©d. It's also on the harddrive of a computer that I watched its plug short in the socket and refuse to turn on again. I have so much data (pictures, videos, fics) that is located no where else that I am terrified to even try and fix it for fear that the harddrive is dead and its permanently lost (barring a $500-1500 bit scanning or whatever they call pulling the disk out and running it through an expensive machine).
