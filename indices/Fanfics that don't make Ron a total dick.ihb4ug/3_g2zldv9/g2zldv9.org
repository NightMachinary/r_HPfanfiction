[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650): Harry, Ginny, and Ron time travel from a very dystopian future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the war, a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help. The Trio and Ginny enter the breach one more time. Its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]], linkffn(6884267), depicts the last moments between that dimension's Ron and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): A dark war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group after Year 5 and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long completed story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though. It has my favorite Romione relationship among HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Ultimate takedown of the atrocious marriage law trope. Ron is the true hero in this Harmony fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. This â€˜Harry' initially didn't take Ron seriously, but changed later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy won in 1981 and Dumbledore had to go into exile. Harry was raised by Sirius in France, abnd went to Beauxbaton with the Weasleys. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Betrayed again by the establishment after the war, Harry decides to take things into his own hands. Ron and George, not Hermione, are initially his most resolute followers.
