Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past has an excellent depiction of Ron. Time travel Harry recognized that most of his and Ron's issues stem from Harry not being open with Ron about his life with the Dursley's. It's just a great story all around. Harry gives more trust to Ron and he becomes more secure and disciplined.
