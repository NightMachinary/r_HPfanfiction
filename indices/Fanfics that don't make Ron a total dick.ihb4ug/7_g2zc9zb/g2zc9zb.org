Shameless plug for my own longfic, but we respect Ronald Weasley in this house!!!!

In all seriousness though, he's more secondary than main character in our fic, starts out kind of mean but there's reasons, Harry is one of the mains, and we have good plans for Ron in future. Have a look at our genre/tags though to see if the rest of it's your cup of tea. If not, I won't mind. :)
