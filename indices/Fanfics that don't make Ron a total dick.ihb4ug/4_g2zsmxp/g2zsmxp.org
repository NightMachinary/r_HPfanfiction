A supportive, intelligent (or just non-shitty) Ron is a beautiful thing. I know I have others, my favorite that comes to mind (I just reread it, I love it every time) is:

It's one of the funniest things I've ever read, and there's a serious Draco&Ron "bromance" (Harry/Draco)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][Soup-pocalypse and the Great Curry Cataclysm]] by SquadOfCats - Draco/Harry, super funny story where Draco's Veela gets all over everything. An all-time fave, and my tags are more extensive than the author's. 104k, but worth every word. It's Draco-centric, but I also have it tagged with "competent Ron"?

Ooh! A really good one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/880454][Need to Know]] by saras_girl (6k). It's actually Draco/Harry, with Ron's POV the whole way through--not a combo I usually like, but it's great. Really sweet, and less humor/over-the-top than the other two. There's also a great [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][podfic]] by sisi_rambles that I've listened to as chill background noise more times than I'd like to admit.

ETA that I was thinking of the wrong story. I'm pretty sure this is good, but it's not the one I was thinking of, oops. I just have "Ron" as the tag, and if I remember correctly that's a good "Ron" tag, but I'm not 100% sure. Oops.
