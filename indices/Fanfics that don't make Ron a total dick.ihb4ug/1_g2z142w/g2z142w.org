Linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) - I'm currently reading and enjoying this fic quite a lot.

Linkffn(A Stricken Lament) - okay, Harry's not really the central character, but he's still very prominent, except when he's not.

Linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) - the trio is in Slytherin, I don't really remember much of the story because I wanted to wait for the sequels, but I definitely enjoyed it and I'm pretty sure Ron played a big role.
