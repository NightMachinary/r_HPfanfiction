They're recommended when someone asks for fics because they're in two of the most popular subgenres of fanfiction - shipping/romance, and in Cadmean Victory's case, independent Harry. Most readers (including me) don't read across a super broad assortment of genres, so I find it's helpful to specify what you like when asking for recommendations.

I finished Cadmean Victory, started and DNFed Grow Young With Me. I actually think the writing and execution in GYWM is much better. But it's a straightforward capital R Romance featuring a lot of angst, not what I'm looking for in fanfic. Cadmean Victory was meh, a decent guilty pleasure for me.
