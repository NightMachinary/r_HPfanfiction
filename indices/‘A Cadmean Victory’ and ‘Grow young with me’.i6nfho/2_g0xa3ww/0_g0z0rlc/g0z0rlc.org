That's true, a ‘Good fic' could be anything to anyone- like someone's ‘good fic' could be Lord-Potter-Black-something-something with bashing of Weasleys(Weasels), Grangers and Dumbledore (Dumbles Dumb-as-a-door Old Goat etc), but it's always good to hear another's opinion of a ‘good fic' to try it out yourself, and see if it works for you.
