Oh, on a personal level, very much agreed. But at the end of the day, this is all just entertainment. If a fic isn't entertaining you, then you've no obligation to stick around for it, and if you know you won't be entertained by poor technical writing, then I can understand why you wouldn't bother with the fic. You just have to keep in mind that what entertains people will be different when listening to recommendations. :)

(Btw, I mean the general you, not /you/ specifically :D).
