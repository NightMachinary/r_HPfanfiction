People in this fandom seem to use 'Good Fic' like we all mean the same thing and know exactly what that thing is - even though we absolutely don't. For some, you need excellent technical writing and a tightly structured plot for a fic to be good. For others, it just has to be fun (add in 'and/or interesting' and that's the definition that I use). There's probably a hundred more varying definitions, likely even more than that.

I imagine that your definition of a good fic simply differs from that of the people recommending those two fics. If enough people's definitions overlap and they encounter it often enough, a fic becomes popular. :)
