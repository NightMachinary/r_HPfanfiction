I've read both. HPMOR comes across very cracky and the character feels like a know-it-all. It was a mix of Enders Game, high school (college/university level?) science and Harry Potter. It did it well and told its story but it didn't ever make me connect to it. When I read a story, I want to experience an emotional journey and connect to the characters. In A Cadmean Victory, I related to Harry experiencing heartbreak. I related to the regrets, the striving to prove oneself and the loss of innocence. I didn't relate to the robot-Harry in HPMOR. That's how I rate a story when I look back at them. Sure, there are technical flaws (and annoying bits of plot/character development) in ACV, but it took me on a relatable journey despite that. That's what counts for me.
