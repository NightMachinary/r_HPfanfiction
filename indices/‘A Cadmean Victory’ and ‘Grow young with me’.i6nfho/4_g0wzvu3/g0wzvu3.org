For just Cadmean Victory, it's been awhile since I've read it, but it is probably because:

1. It is a well written story, given fanfiction standards (that's not to say it is perfect)
2. It is completed.
3. The pairing and is one of the fleshed out completed story for the pairing.
4. Decent world building.
5. Okay pacing.
6. Solid consistency for characters that flows, or at least isn't completely out of the norm given their experience in the story.
7. Uniqueish Indy!Harry, Mentored Harry
8. It goes against the grain of a everyone gets a happy ending
9. Not sure if this one is true, but given the time it was posted and completed, it is probably one of the first stories to do what it did. Trope wise.

There's probably more, but I think that's probably why it gets recommended.

I would not say it is an average fic, given the sheer volume of fanfiction out there. it is probably in the top 10% minimum, I would say top 5% personally.
