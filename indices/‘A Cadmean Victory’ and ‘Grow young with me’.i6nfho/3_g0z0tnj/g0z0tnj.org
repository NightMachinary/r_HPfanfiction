For myself, Grow Young With Me tugged at the heartstrings, especially the part about Ginny's death and what it did to Harry and his children. The author really portrayed how that would have crushed them, and it's beautiful to see the family healing. And Abby helps that process along. So that's why I like it.

I didn't enjoy A Cadmean Victory or read very far. Harry became too cold and cruel toward his friends; it's not necessarily bad writing, but I didn't like reading it. Even the finest quality cut glass still doesn't taste good.
