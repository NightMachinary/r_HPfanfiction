I forget stories as soon as I finish them, so I can't offer many specifics about Grow Young With Me, but the main point I liked about the story is that it characterized harry and the others in a very good way. They are damaged by the war, Harry most of all, and that is something that has to be worked on and around. In addition to an excellent mixture of the wizarding and the muggle world, we get to peek into a very real feeling world with realistic emotions and interactions.

But that might be completely wrong, it's been a hot minute.
