Grow Young With Me is a well-written example of one of the most popular genres of fanfic: a fairly boring original character, a thinly-veiled author-insert, comforts a sexy canon character who's been traumatized by canon events, so the canon character falls in love with the author-insert and they live together happily ever after. I'm not fond of this type of story either, but many people are. I don't begrudge them their enjoyment of it. There are different types of fanfics to suit all tastes.
