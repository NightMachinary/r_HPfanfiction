I think Cadmean Victory was more recommended in the past. It's a long, completed fic with a popular, yet not overly common, romantic interest which I think it's why it's so popular.

I personally don't find it objectively good enough to be recommended but some people place more value on subjective interests like the sacrificial magic or the Harry/Fleur angle. Which is fine, by the way.
