Can you recommend more fics that are like Cadmean Victory and Grow Young with me? By fics /like/ them I mean a good story and excellent writing, personally I don't care about pairings and characters being OOC, just as long as it makes for a great story and a good read.

I stumbled upon you're post while looking for posts about Grow Young With Me and I decided to read Cadmean Victory and oh boy was I thankful for this post. Nothing has really ever captivated me as Cadmean Victory (apart from GYWM).
