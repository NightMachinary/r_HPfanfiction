I've had this problem for a few super long stories not just in the Harry Potter fandom. There are many shorter ones that I just dropped (don't ask for names idk) because while they had a lure like a pairing I like (Haphne) or an interesting summary they were just too plain or intolerable writing.

However, the big stories are what hurt the most when you've already invested +100k words then the story drags on and the reader loses interest or just seems to continue on in cycles of shit (everybody has read some story of character conflicts that get resolved but then the same problems keep happening again, usually for just added angst). Honestly there have been times when I'd just start skimming even skipping sections of later sections of monolithic stories because writers couldn't just move forward, for instance I read a story where Harry hadn't even made it to King's Cross or even met another magical child yet after about 50k words in.

Others just get too messy with intricate subplots or even lose interest in the intricate subplots. Sometimes the author loses their hook on the audience making reading tedious.
