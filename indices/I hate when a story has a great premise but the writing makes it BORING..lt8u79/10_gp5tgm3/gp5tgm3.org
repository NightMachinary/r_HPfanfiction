When the author writes this elaborate scene, such as a dream sequence - After being sorted into Gryffindor, Harry has a dream when he hears a voice telling him he should have been in Slytherin, and then Quirrels turban starts coming undone and wrapping itself around Harry, suffocating him - Then the next line in the story... Harry woke up and remembered nothing of the dream.

If he's not going to remember the dream, so it's not going to have any bearing on the story, why include it in the story?
