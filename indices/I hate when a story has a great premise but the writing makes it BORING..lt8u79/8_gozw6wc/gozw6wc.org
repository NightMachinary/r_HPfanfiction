Sure, I've come across such stories. I can slog through almost anything, but if it's riddled with grammatical problems, I just cannot do it.

Watching authors jumping between tenses, almost like watching the windshield wipers on my car, drives me insane.

Also, I just cannot fathom writing a 300k plus story, and by the end, there has been no improvement in their writing. At all. How does that work?

Sure, I understand that a lot of fanfiction is written by people whose native language isn't English, but surely you must improve at least a little, when you write that much.

On a different note. I do not leave reviews, blasting the author, or their work. I assume they are writing because they enjoy it, and who am I to take that from them by acting like an asshole?

Most people have enough problems to deal with, without having to worry about an idiot who cannot act like a decent human being.

Seriously, if you don't have anything constructive to say, just shut the hell up, and go about your business. No need to spread your own misery.
