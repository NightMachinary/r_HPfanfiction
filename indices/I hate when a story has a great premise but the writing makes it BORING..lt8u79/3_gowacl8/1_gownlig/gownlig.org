This is so true. One of Stephen King's rules (that he seems to break himself more and more these days) is "show, don't tell". Don't spend most of your story talking about what happened to the characters at some point, find a way to show it. If most of your story is the characters talking about things, maybe do a re-write and SHOW them going through those events. I agree - this is a bigger problem than it should be in fan fiction. It's made me nope out of a lot of stories. Your characters shouldn't spend most of the story talking and thinking. Show them actually going through situations. Even slice of life needs, you know, some slice.
