Well, for one story, it was that I was all the way on chapter 22 of what was supposed to become a mentoring story, and Snape was only just then starting to think maybe he might change his attitude some time in the future. Harry's just getting more and more depressed and withdrawn in a story that was NOT marked as angst.

One story just didn't seem to have any real emotion to it. For example, they say the character is frustrated but don't show it: no clenching of hands, no brooding or outbursts... just saying that's how they feel. This wasn't helped by the occasional section in first-person POV. (It's not my favorite writing style but I can tolerate it; but if you choose that then you need to stick to it for the whole story.)

Another story that I recently slogged through but didn't really enjoy is my own fault. It was obvious from the beginning that it was written in the form of a "paper," and it was dry, dry, dry. I should have bailed when it started with the table of contents for the paper.

Other things that have made me stop reading a story is when they get "clever" with writing in a back-and-forth-in-time fashion. Flashbacks are fine, but your main story needs to have a linear progression. One story I remember reading had an "epilogue" (to a one-chapter story, that was nearly as long as the original chapter---so, basically, half the story) that did so much time jumping around that my conclusion was that the author just wrote things down as they thought of them. It made the story so disjointed that I stopped reading it and left a review (one of the ones I wish I could take back) that said if the author didn't care enough to put the story in order so it would make sense, I ddn't care enough to do it myself to read it.
