First, thanks for the good answer. :)

Yeah, I have noticed there's a lot of bloated stories around - icebergs-melting level pacing and odd repetition pop up quite often. Editors are a blessing, there's no doubt about it.

Interesting that non-labelling is a thing that switches you off. It's something that's fascinated me for my entire time here - how much tagging is good tagging?

Also interesting how much the 'meta' of writing has an effect for you. Writing style, format, technique, and story structure are a lot more important than some people give 'em credit for, huh?
