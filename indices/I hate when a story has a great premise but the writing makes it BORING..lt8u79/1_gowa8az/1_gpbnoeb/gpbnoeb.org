It can happen in several ways. I've read a few stories that started out well, but degenerated into "tell, don't show" as they went on. In other words, instead of a scene with dialogue, you are presented with narrative such as, "Now Harry goes to the goblins, but he found out his vault was empty." (Poor grammar intended.)

There was another story that had, IIRC, three viewpoint characters, and whenever the viewpoint changed, the story repeated the previous scene from the new character's point of view, without adding anything in the way of different insights from that character. It was merely superfluous repetition, rather than a way of highlighting different things that different characters can get from the same event.
