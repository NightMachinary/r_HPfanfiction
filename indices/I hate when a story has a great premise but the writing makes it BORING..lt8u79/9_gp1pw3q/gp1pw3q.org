That or when there are way too many grammatical errors in the story I feel like I end up editing it in my head instead of actually reading it. I recently came across a story in Ao3 that had over 5k kudos and had a decent premise, but the verb tense shifts and hard to follow sentence structure took me right out of it.

I know these are stories that aren't written by professional, with editors and all that, but you need to read things over before posting. I don't want to sound harsh, and I really want to finish the story; it's definitely got potential, but it was hard to read. I almost want to reach out to the author and ask if they need someone to edit for them.
