I found a sequel written by a different author to one of my favourite fics. The storytelling was just off, first they changed the characterisation, then they started killing people off (tbh people were bound to die in the last part). I'm struggling between should I offer support because the original writer left such big shoes to fill and wanting to shoot it down.
