Master of Life sounds like the title that would grant someone fame, fortune, success, love. Pretty much enables someone to to win at the game of life. Thus...

CLOAK: Draws attention to you in a way that inspires FAME

STONE: keeps you from losing loved ones --> other people never turn on you, abandon you, grow apart from you --> never alone --> always loved --> LOVE

WAND: Win every duel --> spectators always see you as the winner of every battle --> winner of every verbal or physical conflict --> political success/ popularity/ always right ---> king of the world ---> SUCCESS

THUS: MASTER OF LOVE: FAME, LOVE, SUCCESS
