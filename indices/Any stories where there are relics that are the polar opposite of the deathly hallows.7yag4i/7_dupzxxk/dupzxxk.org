But in all seriousness, that could be pretty chill.

Cloak of Invisibility => The Eyeball of Oh God Why. It lets you see everything. At once. Takes a very strong mind to not go insane by sensory overload.

Resurrection Stone => The Shiny Rock of Obliviousness. It lets you not see living people.

Elder Wand => The Stick of Improbably Convenient Failure. It fails every spell in such a spectacular manner that half the time it actually ends up solving the problem anyways.

When you unite the three items, you become the Master of Life. The perks?

Literally Unlimited Lemonade.
