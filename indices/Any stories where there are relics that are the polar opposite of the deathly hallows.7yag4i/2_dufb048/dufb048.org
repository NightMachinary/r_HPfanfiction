/Hero's Cape/, when worn, enables the wearer to gain the attention of anyone who would be able to perceive them by normal means. When they gesture, their gesture /will/ be seen. When they speak, their words /will/ be heard (though not necessarily obeyed). However, the wearer does not get to choose whose attention they attract: the attention of their foes will be drawn to them as well.
