Ohhh the lifestick is a much better idea than what I was thinking. My immediate reaction after reading the title was

- A wand that loses any battle
- A stone that kills people, but not very well
- A cloak that makes you incredibly visible, no matter how much someone tries to ignore you

And I was having a hard time imagining why someone would want to collect these hallows. Maybe someone who likes playing life on hard mode?
