But isn't the Elder Wand the ultimate healer's wand already? I mean, it restores Harry's wand to normal functionality, that's not something normal wands can accomplish. Maybe its opposite would be a seal or restraint of some kind that prevents magical power from being used?

And if the Resurrection Stone has the effect of calling shades from the afterlife, wouldn't its polar opposite work to send shades (ghosts, Dementors, etc), or even living people, to the afterlife instead?

And the cloak...it's a thing of concealment and protection, so I assume its opposite would be some...lantern of exposure? Making a target less safe by revealing them, exposing their secrets, weak points, etc?

...The opposites of the Deathly Hallows actually sound like they'd be Unhallows, come to think of it.

Where the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak, and Resurrection Stone offer power, protection, and recall life from death for its possessor, the...Eye of Truth, Everchain, and Banishing Gem might inflict vulnerability, bondage, and ultimately sentence their living victims to death.

In the right hands, such tools could be used to root out and destroy dark and dangerous creatures, and those witches/wizards turned to cruelty & malice. In the wrong hands, though, they could allow a Dark Lord to overcome any foe...

...Yup, there's definitely story potential there. When Voldemort delves into an alternate universe in order to seek a counter for the Elder Wand & Invisibility Cloak his two greatest foes use, he happens across an alternate universe where their 'evil counterparts' exist instead.
