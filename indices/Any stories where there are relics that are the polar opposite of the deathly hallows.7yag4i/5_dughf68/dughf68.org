Enemies of the Hallows?

The mundane sceptre; able to sap all the magic out of something, rendering it entirely normal.

The fabled fountain of youth - able to cure/restore any person from their suffering, though it often wipes their recent memory in the process (perhaps as a safety precaution)

The watcher's diadem - the wearer becomes insubstantial; a silent ghost who can go anywhere, see anything, but can't do anything to interact with the world.

The more I think on it, the more likely that memory loss is a side-effect of all three of them.
