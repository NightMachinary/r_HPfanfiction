Hrm.....

You could do a crossover with the Lantern corps, or steal from them - have the Hallows aligned with a Nekron expy (maybe chaotic neutral or lawful evil).

Have opposing hallows for the Life Entity.

Possibly incorporate the Emotional Spectrum into the magic system (for example, AK is cast not from the Red of Anger, but the Green of Will, your Will-to-destroy or something).
