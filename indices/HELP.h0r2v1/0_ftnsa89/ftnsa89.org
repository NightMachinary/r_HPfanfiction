The only blind!harry fic I know of is Manifesting Magic, but it's not a Time Travel fic. It is fairly AU, in the sense that harry is blind, but not all that much is different otherwise.

Well, and his magic is alive in the form of a sister that it's insinuated he has had sexual relations with, which is kind of creepy, but it's never actually shown. Discontinued, as far as I know.
