[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227825/1/Telling-Him][Telling Him]] is a cute little R/S vignette; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7850423/1/Five-flavours-Katie-Bell-likes-and-two-she-doesn-t][Five Flavours Katie Bell Likes and Two She Doesn't]] is a wonderful little Alicia/Katie vignette; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]] is a brilliant work exploring exactly what it says in the title (it's 36K words, but I suppose that's not too far over, right?); [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942254/1/Penance][Penance]] is a crazy angsty little piece of Harry/Tonks that's hard to describe; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White][The Assassin Wore White]], which is a fantastic piece featuring Madam Pomfrey, and one of the oldest Katie/Alicia vignettes that's around - it's from 2007 - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3357118/1/Come-Fly-With-Me][Come Fly With Me]], which is wonderfully written.
