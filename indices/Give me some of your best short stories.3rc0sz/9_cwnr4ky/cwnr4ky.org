Just finished reading this last night. It was really good and well-written. Granted, the author could've made it longer but I think its current length is perfect (nice twist at the end). First part can be a bit off-putting (the writing style is a bit unusual) but I really enjoyed it. It's not exactly a Hermione/Lucius story, as they never get together but it's a great character exploration, and it pretty much stays true to cannon as much as possible.
