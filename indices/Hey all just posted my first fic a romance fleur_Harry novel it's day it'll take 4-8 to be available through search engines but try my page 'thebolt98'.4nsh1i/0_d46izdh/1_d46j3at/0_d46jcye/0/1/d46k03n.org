If you read the sidebar (read the damn sidebar), it talks about the fanfiction bot. To link a fic, all you need to do is put in a comment with linkffn (title) with no space between the paranthesis and linkffn. In this case, it would be linkffn(hogwarts love story).

It can be made to be more accurate in case of a duplicate title by adding the author's username, so it would be linkffn (title by author), once again without the space between the linkffn and parenthesis.

EDIT: In this comment, the bot decided to go with a different Hogwarts Love Story, so I would recommend that you use the bot form with your FFN username. It's actually rather convenient this was the case, as examples go.
