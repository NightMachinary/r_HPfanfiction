I never read only the one chapter of something unless I'm desperate to read something new, but from looking at the summary and title, I've got some concerns. Lack of capitalization in the summary and title is a bad sign, and won't endear it to most readers. I did a quick look through it with good ol' ctrl-f, and out of 96 usages, Harry is only capitalized 27 times (28.125%). Unless you are using the verb harry a hell of a lot, that's also a bad sign for long term quality.
