Characterization is horrible. Why the fuck does Harry know about Muhammad Ali? Do you think the Dursleys let him watch TV? How does he know about Moran and Troy? That's something someone growing up with Quidditch might know or like. Harry likes Quidditch because he's good at it but nowhere in the books does it show that he follows or even supports a Quidditch team the way Ron does.

Characterization is subjective though. I like reading manipulative Dumbledore because that's believable to me and it's not for others.

Your main problem is that you don't know how to tell a story or write a story or even come across as literate. You would fail any literacy test outside of Ireland I expect. I know you said you have a language disability so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that. Story wise though there is NOTHING in the chapter that is remotely good at all. Not Sirius, Harry, or Ron, or even Mr Weasley.
