  The first outlines of an old memory emerged in Sirius's mind. Like breath misting on a cold glass. He remembered the strange dream he had, before he woke up in the mud, straight from duelling Bellatrix and fighting in the Death Room, of a place he didn't know but he remembered, he remembered a pub, and a storm in the 1960s, coming to see Alphard when he was about seven, and of some local muggles- what had that man said? Something about a place where the spirit world comes close. How Skye was a thin place.He just never expected to see the Isles again, after Azkaban, never mind his Uncle Alphard or his little brother Regulus... But that's the Other Side, so they say. It was the year 1966 and the Wizarding World he knew was gone. Some things seemed the same- like James and the Potters, they seemed normal, as normal as a six year old James Potter could have really been. But things were different. It was all different, and it terrified him- his mother was dead already, for one. And also, if Sirius could just stop forgetting about the other world and the way things went that time, that'd be just great.(Dimension-Travel AU)

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.
