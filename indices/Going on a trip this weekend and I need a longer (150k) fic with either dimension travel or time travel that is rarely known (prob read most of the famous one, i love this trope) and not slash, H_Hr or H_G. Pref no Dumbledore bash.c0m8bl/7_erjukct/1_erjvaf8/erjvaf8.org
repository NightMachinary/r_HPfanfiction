  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.
