Pretty good story, following Hermione traveling back in time and finding herself in the body of an 11 years old Rosier. The writing is fantastic, if a bit too close to canon is some places. This is technically complete, though the ending is pretty unsatisfactory IMO, but a sequel started recently dealing with all the fallout.
