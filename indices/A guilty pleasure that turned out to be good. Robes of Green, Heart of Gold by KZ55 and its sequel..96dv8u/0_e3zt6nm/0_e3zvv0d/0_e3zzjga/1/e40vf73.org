You can write a Battlerap AU which follows the stations of canon. Following them means that the event itself happens, not that it plays out the same way. If you have an Underground street racing AU and Harry has to race against a resurrected Voldemort around the Graveyard in Little Hangelton, you still have the graveyard scene even if they race in 1993 Honda Civics instead of duelling with magic.
