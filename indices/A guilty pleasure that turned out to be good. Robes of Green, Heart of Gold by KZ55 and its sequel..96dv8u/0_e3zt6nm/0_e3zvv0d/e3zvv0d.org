Divergence... difficult to say, the Sirius confrontation happens but in a totally different way. As far as I remember the second year was almost the same in outcome of course. Harry went down the Chamber, saved Ginny. Third year doesn't go like the canon one like all, though all the major events happen (Hippogrif vs Draco, Sirius Black, Dementors on the Quidditch Pitch etc.) but I would never call this canon rehash.
