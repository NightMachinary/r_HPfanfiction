I did encounter a few ... readable bits, but they were singular chapters of some authors' doodle bins (so to say) rather than being full-length stories, and right now I don't even remember where exactly those are. Also, they were all humour-centred or even crack, rather than anything ... you know, normal.

Also, as far as I remember from what I read, people really aren't keen on writing anything centred on the female characters of “Twilight”. Which kind of makes sense considering that Bella was a bland self-insert and the other characters were for the most part only present to make the readers not ask questions about why there are no females in the world of the story.

So yeah, the thing with “Twilight” that makes your request more difficult is that, no matter how you feel about it, for many people “Twilight” isn't as much a book as it is a bad romance fanfic that somehow got published. Which ... kind of limits the writer base.
