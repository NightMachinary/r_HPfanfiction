  More to the teaser for my next story (still not done) "Harry has left the magical world to seek a place to recuperate from the tough war with Voldemort. Escaping Britain and the magical world as a whole, he finds a place to rest and make new friends though he finds out that some may be as strange as him." -AU after OoTP for HP, set during AU New Moon-Eclipse books. Harry/Alice.
