Thanks for the suggestions. I appreciate it. As for slash... generally I just have no interest in slash, although I dont mind non main characters being involved (like a HP based story that has Remus/Sirius in a relationship), hence why I put no slash. Perhaps I may stumble across one I enjoy, but generally it doesn't fit what I enjoy in a story.
