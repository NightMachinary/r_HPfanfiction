  Alice Lily Potter survived the war, but not unchanged. Pursued by those who regard her new prophetic ability as a valuable resource, and aren't willing to take â€˜no' for an answer, Alice makes a difficult choice which sends her tumbling into the unknown. There, she finds a whole new world to explore... and love just waiting to be found.
