Honestly I can't even think of any "kinda decent" ones that aren't slash. HP/Twilight crossovers were a big thing back when the first Twilight movie came out but, that unfortunately means most of the writers at the time were female teenagers. LOTS of Edward/Harry fics with Bella as the "super mega jealous b*tch that should just back off!!", lol.
