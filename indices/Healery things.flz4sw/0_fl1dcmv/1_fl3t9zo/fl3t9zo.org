Sounds interesting - and eh, so long as the relationship works in the story and isn't just Death Eater and Victim weirdness, I can get into it/get past it. :)

I'm assuming it's a full AU from the summary (and not Britpicked from the 'mom' :D) as Voldemort being a Department Head in a Magical Hospital seems a mite weird. Thanks for the rec!
