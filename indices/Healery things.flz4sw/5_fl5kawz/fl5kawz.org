Linkao3(basilisk eyes by Hegemone) this fic is huge, complicated and emotionally challenging but also the only fic I know that has acknowledged physical and mental disabilities in magical world. It's not only Harry being deaf or mute or blind (as in this case), there are several other young and old people with impairments. Very detailed process of magical therapy etc. Fantastic fic but not an easy one
