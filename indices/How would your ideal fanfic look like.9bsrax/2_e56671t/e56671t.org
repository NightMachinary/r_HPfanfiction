- Pairing: Harry / Bellatrix

- Setting: Timetravel. Early Marauder generation. Harry is as old as Bellatrix (and Bellatrix is 7 years older than Sirius)

- Themes: The rise of Voldemort and the turmoil that creates in the pureblood circles he targets, portrayed by Bellatrix and the Black family as a whole. We delve into why the Black family was / became so fanatic. We see the politics of Britain change gradually. We hear and notice back room deals, intrigue and manipulation. On a personal level, Harry tries to draw Bellatrix away from Voldemort, while Bellatrix tries to draw him to Voldemort.

- Characterisation:

  - 7th year (post-Battle) Harry - slightly disillusioned with the old Dumbledore, but absolutely convinced of the righteousness of the cause. Suffers from both the trauma of the battle and horcrux hunt, as well as from the stress of the timetravel.
  - Bellatrix is canon!Bellatrix, just younger. Extremely interested in dark magic, highly intelligent, incredibly skilled but also quite unstable (not necessarily violent yet).

- Plot: Harry is sent back in time. He hits the early Marauder era and is 7 years older than his father. He is found and brought under protection by Dumbledore who knows of the timetravel. He makes Harry a deal. He helps Dumbledore get a headstart on Voldemorts plans, and in return he offers Harry an identity (as the Potter identity was unthinkable). Harry becomes a myth made flesh. He becomes Geralt Grindelwald - son of Grindelwald, adopted by Dumbledore in secret (papers get forged) and starts his 7th year. The name alone draws Bellatrix to him. Grindelwald. It has a powerful clout still in certain circles. He is invited to the Black family, and many old followers of Grindelwald look with interest to him. Dumbledore and Harry see the opportunity to rally under two flags and Harry is thrown into the politics of rich and pureblood Britain (and Europe). Eventually Harry has a choice. Lucius Malfoy is on a good way to become Elder of the Wizengamot. Arcturus Black guarantees Harry (Geralt) his support if he A) candidates and B) connect with the Black family by marriage. Dumbledore pushes Harry to agree. Harry, biting the sour apple, marries Bellatrix and becomes an Elder of the Wizengamot, delaying and outright destroying Voldemort's plans for Lucius. Harry splits those Elders that would have normally all flocked to Voldemort *but* he lacks substance. What was still a relatively loveless relationship now becomes usefull. He needs Bellatrix to back him and give him credibility. In turn, Bellatrix asks of him certain policy. They try to out-manipulate each other while playing the perfect couple to the outside world. Meanwhile Voldemort prepares for a strike. He attacks Harry and Bellatrix. The assassination attempt fails, but Harry sustains heavy injury while shielding bellatrix from harm. That changes their dynamic. Bellatrix i sopen to the thought of Harry actually caring about her (even if she doesn't even dare think about love. He just /cares/), rather than thinking of her as a (expendable) means to an end. Plus, she is disillusioned about Voldemort. Her focus switches from his ideals to the hybrid ideology she and Harry were creating through their arguments and fights.

I'm not sure about any details. But thats the beginning to a plot I had rummaging around my head for a bit. Especially the relationship of Harry and Bellatrix should be a challenge and chance to grow for both characters. They share goals, but not ideologies. Its important to emphasize that /both/ want "the best for Britain" and have vastly different views on what is best, and how to achieve it.

The ending would be Harry and Bellatrix, in a loving relationship that has developed through much hardship, standing on top of the political game, surpassing even Dumbledore and Malfoy, with Voldemort defeated. Harry should have developed an opportunistic, cunning and ruthless side, while Bellatrix should have found a stability and acceptance of her emotions and love.
