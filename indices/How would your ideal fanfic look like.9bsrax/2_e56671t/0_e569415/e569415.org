That would make quite an interesting political drama if you were to develop that idea further. Harry somehow trying to convert Grindelwald's followers to the guardians who preserve what Voldemort tries to destroy, maybe even reforming the Knights of Walpurgis under his own banner a few years down the road. Him starting as Dumbledore's pawn and eventually becoming his own man, trying to stay under everyone's radar for as long as possible.

The one thing I am not sold on is Bellatrix's support of Voldemort at that early point, but maybe Nymphadora could be used as a living proof that he's wrong about pureblood superiority (and maybe later Lily).
