My explanation for Bellatrix' early infatuation with Voldemort would be her interests and desires. She is interested in dark magic, because she desires power. Power and "the climb" are her endeavors ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4][An apt inspiration would be Littlefinger's worldview]]). She believes Voldemort delivers opportunity for both, if you bring with you the necessary ruthlessness to take your chances.

When I think about it, their relationship could be well described by the question of what would happen if Varys (Harry) and Littlefinger (Bellatrix) from Game of Thrones / SoIaF worked together. Littlefinger is is working for his own gains, while Varys works for the good of the realm. Both are ruthless. Both are smart and cunning. Both do not shy away from extremely underhanded and cruel plans (if necessary, in Varys' case).

The "dynamic change" is essentially the moment Bellatrix realizes Voldemort is a dead end road, and the only way for her to climb is Harry's name, clout and prosperity (mixed with the genuine suprise that somebody gives even a single fuck about her as a person. At the point of the attack, Harry would/should have a much easier time without her constantly interfering and trying to steer).
