A next gen Scorbus fic that's all seven years at Hogwarts. Rose is a good friend to the boys, not a mean girl who dumps her best friend over a school house. The Weasley cousins actually exist and aren't all Gryffindor carbon copies of their parents. No time travel, no Voldemort 2.0, no self insert Mary Sues for James Sirius to fall in love with.

OR

Wolfstar raises Harry fic with most of the same events as canon. Harry is in Slytherin but doesn't become best friends with Draco or a budding dark lord and Snape is still a jerk. Harry has a wider social circle but Ron and Hermione are still his best friends. Dumbledore is a manipulative well-intentioned extremist as per canon and gets called out on his shit. Maybe Harry has an adopted sibling or two. And just because I love him, somehow Teddy Lupin still exists (maybe Tonks was a surrogate to Remus and Sirius' child, or maybe he's a random orphan they adopted, I don't care). Basically what could've happened if Harry had loving guardians.
