Not yet because its a toss up between where I'm deciding to go forward out of several fics:

1. This fic, I was thinking the title would be something Astrologia.
2. A 1979 fic short fic staring Sirius Black in a brief (1-6 chapters I'd say) buddy cop mission to track down a Death Eater who is making waves.
3. A time-travel fic where Harry has only one year to repeat the Triwizard Tournament after getting oneshotted in the Graveyard, but he has some company. Its called The Iridescent.
4. A post-war fic where Harry and Luna are married and are on a journey through the magical communities of East Asia as Magizoologists to follow the trail of a certain species. I was thinking the Fenghuang, since its sort of a phoenix and Harry would feel a connection to it.
5. A partial AU where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, and Harry is in Hufflepuff. The catch is that Harry is actually really talented with magic (he wanted to repair his mum's mind after she was tortured) but Harry from a series of events in his past is afraid of being in the limelight since all it does is isolate you (Lonely at the Top of the World). So he just pretends and tries to get along with everybody while secretly studying with Dumbledore, who helped allow Remus to raise Harry after Sirius fled to chase down Pettigrew. I was thinking 'Scoptaphobic' or 'Salt of the Earth.'

I have complete outlines and several chapters /written/ already, with endings, but I don't want to commit until I know what I want to invest in.
