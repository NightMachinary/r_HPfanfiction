I have one I want to see, but is not everything that I want (some of them contradict).

*A world where wizards didn't decide to hide and instead turned against the muggles*:

- Wizards, instead of casting some sort of mass mind/history alteration over a period of time, used the collective magic of the world's communities and the far superior methods of transport and communication in the 17th century to summon immense natural disasters. In the span of half a decade, the major blood lines of the world were extinct and the the fortresses destroyed. Communication and borders fell apart while the wizards remained unperturbed.
- Finally the magical world came forward to alleviate the trauma, essentially making the remnants of the former countries exceedingly loyal to their saviors. After a short time, and with their almost divine powers and 'beneficence,' they began to take on near god-status in the eyes of the muggles.
- Wizards became the new high class, given a status similar to the Brahmins and Kshatriyas in most of the world, with the non-magicals essentially becoming the equivalent of the labor class.
- Beings, such as goblins or house-elves, were still lesser but were given something equivalent Vaishyas, or the artisans and merchants. Not as powerful or important, but they were still above the non-magicals, who were then known as Shadows (as in a shadow of wizards/witches).
- Fast-forward three-hundred years to the future. Story follows Harry who is a member of a special magical hunter group (for stolen magical knowledge, which is like their prize possessions and often kept exclusively in families). Would begin here showing his life in the British Isles, which have been raised up from the ocean to symbolize the status of Britain in the world.
- Magical Britain is divided into seven rulerships, though there is no king per se so much as a set of magical individuals agreed upon by particular members of the community (but it must always be a prime number). The Weasleys have several members there.
- There is no blood purity. However, what there is is a /control/ of spells and magic. The magical society essentially has its own form of interwoven political machinations. Additionally, magicals have become more competitive and serious about being more talented. This means the average magical skill of wizards/witches is well above what it was in canon. New magics and spells exist, with far more innovation, while certain branches ended up neglected or underused. What Dumbledore and Voldemort were in canon, their are easily a hundred more in Western Europe alone.
- The greater magical-ness with the Shadows has lead to a variety of changes, including their general service to the magical community. They work as laborers, and while they aren't give equal treatment they aren't really abused as a general rule.
- And then their are the mixes. A witch named only Lady Chimaera attempted to find a way to improve her subjects by mixing traits from magical creatures like Dragons and Runespoors with the Shadows over a century before. The results were mixed, but ultimately her work was successful and she began to create an army on Cyprus. Eventually this was beaten down by the pair of Battle Mages Grindelwald and Dumbledore, but her creations survived and the magical communities allowed them to intermingle. People even began to incorporate the techniques further, both in the Shadows and the Wizards, who had a far higher survival rate on the whole. So many people with certain unique abilities exist beyond what can be performed by the average wizard.
- Harry is a mix as well - James Potter was a normal but fairly talented wizard while Lily was a fairly talented magical born from a pair of mixed Shadows. My thought was that he is mixed with a Demiguise, which would be helpful in certain ways but he could hide it easily enough, since people much of the mainstream frowns upon wizards who mix as well (impure and all that), and Harry is only reasonably talented (he is like 19 at the start of the story, educations start at 4 for magicals)

Does this sound interesting? I hope so, cause I've been writing it for a while now. And I haven't given away any of the plot, just some of the world and background.
