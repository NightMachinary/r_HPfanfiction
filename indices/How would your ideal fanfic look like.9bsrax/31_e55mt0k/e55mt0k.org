Ideal: gay pairing (preferably Harry/Draco but Harry/any male is good too), lots of angst and adorable boyfriend caring for Harry. At least slightly graphic abuse. Rape is a bonus. Sick fic is great too. All three is perfect! I do enjoy bad Dumbles, good malfoys. Slytherin Harry. Powerful Harry is great too.

Not ideal: Harry/Ginny pairing. Actually any Ginny at all unless she is being rediculed or severly harmed. Fics in a non magic setting are also boring. Settings other than Harry at Hogwarts is not interesting so no next gen fics or ones set in the past. Thats about it really.
