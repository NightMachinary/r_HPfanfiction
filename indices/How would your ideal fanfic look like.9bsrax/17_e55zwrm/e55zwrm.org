- involve a lot of the Black family history, especially the dynamic between all five of the cousins

- no to minimal bashing

- no glorification or justification either (key: there's a difference between /explaining/ and /excusing/, make sure you don't fall into the trap of the latter)

- if it's Harry/Ginny, please for the love of all that is holy develop her better than canon. That goes for any pairing, of course. No Mary-Sueish, mail-order-brides!

- show Ron maturing

- I love the idea of Teddy Lupin, but after he's born somehow Tonks/Charlie happens

- no Albus Severus Potter
