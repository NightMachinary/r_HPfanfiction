I have a few ideal ones:

- Harry Potter but it's college. Everyone is aged up so that mature subjects can be handled without everyone being 11 yet also sounding like a 40 year old. Basically, the Magicians (TV/book), but with HP magic.

- Harry!Ginny but with Fem!Harry.

- Harry is straight up a Dark Lord/Lady growing up. It's an evil v evil story: the Fanstastical Racists of Voldemort vs the Grindelwaldian Racists of Potter. The Ministry is helpless, and whomever wins, everyone loses.

- Limpieza de Sangre but Voldemort doesn't die and instead the plot goes on. I know there's a sequel, but I'd rather the ending of the first be different.

- Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, a six chapter miniseries detailing their initial friendship, their breaking apart, the duel, the aftermath, and two postwar discussions on life and stuff.

- Tropeverse. All the worst tropes in fanon with all the worst characters in fanon. Picture: multiple Lord Potters running around, lemon drop addicted Dumbledores, and Ron being Voldemort at least 12 times. Basically, the crackiest crack that ever cracked.

- Harry Potter but it's the Mummy. Brendan Fraiser plays Ron Weasley.

- A Long Journey Home but it's actually updated.
