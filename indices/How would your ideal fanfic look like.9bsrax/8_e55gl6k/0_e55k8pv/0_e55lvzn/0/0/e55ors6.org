I don't watch game of thrones.

/You/ won't want to join anyone who isn't reasonably close to your particular tribe, culture, belief. That's why protagonists are usually of that tribe, culture, belief, or do a heel-face-turn or antihero arc. But imagine the book "Lord Voldemort and the Muggle invasion", and suddenly you will want to join with the Order. Unless Dumbledore suddenly eats babies and there are breeding camps full of pure-blood teenagers to feed him, because I'm not quite as good a writer as some suggest and can't use a pen where a giant stencil will do.
