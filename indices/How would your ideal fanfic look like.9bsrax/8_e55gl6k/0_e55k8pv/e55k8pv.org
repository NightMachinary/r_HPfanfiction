How exactly do you write an antagonist who is both, dangerous like first war Voldemort and yet someone you'd follow?

The only thing I can think of would be Harry and Hermione in the Marriage Law revolution where they overthrow an evil Ministry but then take things to far and make the NKWD look like kids in a sandbox.
