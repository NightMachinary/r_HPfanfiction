Several things comes to mind.

1. Make them relatable. Maybe with a tragic backstory, like Loki in the first Thor.
2. Have them be an activist, you know, someone campaigning not for themselves, but for a cause that either you or the characters can get behind. In one of the stories that I'm writing, for example, I'm trying to create a situation where muggles begin to pose a legitimate threat to wizardkind, and so Voldemort, when he arises, positions himself not as a conqueror, but a savior to his species.
3. To piggy off your idea about Harry and Hermione...have the protagonists turn dark. Make them fall down a slippery slope, because if there's anything I love in movies/literature it is corruption and redemption arcs. Think Harvey Dent in Batman. A good character initially, he becomes a villain by the end, and I would love to read a fanfic like that.
