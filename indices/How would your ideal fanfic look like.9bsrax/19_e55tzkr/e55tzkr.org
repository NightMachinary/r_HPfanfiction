Harry/Ginny, first and foremost :P. No but in all seriousness, the ideal fanfic would be so good that it can be used to show people that fanfictions are more than 50 shades of grey esque fantasies. That they can be more than just a story, that they can carry a statement about society, human nature or literature, that they can be open to interpretation, and change the way you think after you've read it. I haven't read a fanfic that powerful, though, so maybe this is just an impossible ideal.
