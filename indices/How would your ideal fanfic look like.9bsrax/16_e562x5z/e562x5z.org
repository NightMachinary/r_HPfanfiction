It would be somewhat like canon, but

-A greater emphasis on character actions and doing a consistent, believable development of said characters. So Harry doesn't go from furious anger followed by despair, only to spend the summer and school year after mostly focused on trivialities like being jealous of a girl he hardly knows. Come on, he just lost his last decent family member, he's fucking alone in a way few could stand.

-More sensible antagonist actions. Replacing Moody for the entire year is stupid, all they needed to do was impersonate him during the Third task if they weren't going to do anything before that.

-More political intrigue between different factions in the Ministry to institute their policies as law. I'm kind of doing this myself. I could see Lucius playing both sides until he was sure one had the edge.

-The pairing would be a realistically developed and portrayed HHR (think 'Definitions of Romance' and 'The Augurey'). For Harry who resembles canon, this makes the most sense to me overall. Having high school type relationships beforehand is reasonable, but I can't see Harry taking those seriously unless there's a real emotional connection and understanding between the two.

-Protagonists aren't useless morons.
