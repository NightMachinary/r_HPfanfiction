A slow burn Harry/Katie fic that traverses their relationship. It starts as teammates that are both new to the Gryffindor Quidditch team and get hazed, then slowly blossoms into a genuine friendship as they find they both love flying just to relax and get away from it all, and later into a loving relationship.
