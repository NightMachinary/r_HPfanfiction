*Pairings*

- Given my own relative inability to write romance, I'd avoid pairings. If I must, I'll stick to canon, because I don't have a problem with any of Rowling's pairings. (Note that not having a problem with WHAT Rowling wrote is not the same as not having a problem with HOW she wrote it)

- Lots of one-on-one scenes between characters, platonic or otherwise

- I tend to prefer the Harry Years at Hogwarts

- Plot--I'm toying with a "Ginny Gets Sorted Into Ravenclaw" story. The idea got into my head a few weeks ago and made itself at home. Percy is condescendingly patronizing towards Ginny in Flourish and Blotts and she's so frustrated with him, she resolves to prove she's smarter than him. This leads to her being sorted into Ravenclaw, because /wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure./

As for the rest of it...It's still making itself at home, but it won't tell me what'll happen.
