  Harry would be depicted as having talent with magic similar to that of his parents

For most people (not me though), this would be making him too "OP". Compared to his parents, canon HP can be summed up in 2 words - wasted potential. James and Sirius became animagi at 15 and created the Marauder's Map in school - and after he ran away from his house and bought his motorbike, Sirius enchanted that thing to fly. They weren't just good with magic, they were prodigious.

And Lily, well, Slughorn mentions her as one of his best students, along with Snape. And Snape, as we know, was inventing spells and modifying potions before he was 16 - since he was friends with Lily for five years, it would be a reasonable assumption to say that they probably worked together on those potion modifications and the spells (not Sectumsempra though). Snape would have made Levicorpus with Lily first, and invented Sectumsempra later after Lily stops seeing him with rose-tinted lenses. Sectumsempra also seems more complicated as a spell, and Snape even made a counter for the curse, probably while he was in school himself.

Compared to his parents in talent, canon HP does /nothing/. There's that one glimmer to his potential when he casts his Patronus, but that is it.

But this is a nice idea, and you're good enough that you'd be able to pull it off too.
