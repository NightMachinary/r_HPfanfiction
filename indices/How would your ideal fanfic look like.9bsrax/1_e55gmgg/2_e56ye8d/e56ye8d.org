I would read this at the drop of a hat. I disliked that the Triwizard occurred when it did in the books, we weren't able to appreciate how skilled the best students of each school are really supposed to be. We know the Marauder's became animagi and made the map in their school years, and Snape was making his own spells. Getting 12 OWLS isn't exceedingly rare (iirc Percy Weasley and Crouch Jr. both managed this), and in terms of magical skill I imagine Triwizard champions would be a cut above even this.

TLDR: Triwizard in 7th year with Fleur romance or friendship development please.
