I like it... suggestions:

Year 2 with Delphini Riddle, in the same year as Ginny, born just months before her father got the reverse AK and her mom went to Azkaban. She is the heir and everyone knows it. Only she's not the one messing with the chamber, its a red herring. She's a contrast to HP, where ppl don't like her because of who her parents were and she's reviled for things she has nothing to do with.

Year 4, instead of the tri-wizard, have a vampire teaching DADA. Include a sub plot involving the rights of magical beings (non human or part-human) or maybe throw in some major magical disaster causing interaction between the muggle and magical worlds. Would like to see Hermione dealing w/ reverse culture shock story and this would be a good time to do it.
