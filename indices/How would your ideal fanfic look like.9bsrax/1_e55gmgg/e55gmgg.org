- A seven year Hogwarts AU where Voldemort didn't have horcruxes and genuinely died on Halloween 1981.

- Each book of the 7 book series would tell a self-contained mystery/adventure within Hogwarts, similar to the first three books of canon.

- There would be significant slice of life/boarding school/coming of age elements and the tone would develop as the children age, going from a children's tone in the early years to young adult after, say, third year.

- Harry would be depicted as having talent with magic similar to that of his parents.

- Harry would still have his scar and it would still have granted him some of Voldemort's powers, but it would not be a horcrux. Exploration of these powers would be a developing theme across all 7 years.

- Another recurring theme would be Harry's fame and how he deals with it.

- Certain canonical events would still occur as they did not rely on Voldemort's continued existence: namely, Lucius' Chamber of Secrets plot (diary would just be an enchanted object, not a horcrux) and Sirius' escape from Azkaban. However these would play out differently, with Sirius successfully clearing his name.

- The Tri-wizard tournament would be shifted to the final book of the series and Harry would compete as Hogwarts' champion.

- Harry would date various girls over the years but the final pairing would be Harry/Fleur. Fleur is the same age as Harry and competes against him in the Tri-wizard tournament, which is where they meet. It would be a bit of an "enemies to lovers" type romance.
