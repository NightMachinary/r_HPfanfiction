First off, Harmony, as I've no memory of being as utterly captivated and obsessed with a pairing as much as I am with this one.

As for story content, I'd love to see a fic a la Stanrick's sort that has a faint Douglas Adams feel to the humor without being overtly comedic. I'd love to see a full run of Hogwarts (years 1-7) that, as in some of Stanrick's stories, has a distinct slice of life quality to it. I think there's enough fics out there dealing with Voldemort and his influence on Harry's life and upbringing, so I'd love to read a long story where he just isn't a factor. I'd still appreciate conflict and adventure, but without any mentions of prophecy or obligations to save the the world. Just a couple of students dealing with a school that has a proclivity towards creating some sort of drama.

I think the best aspect of Harry and Hermione's relationship both in canon and in the hypothetical romantic context is how there's little inherent qualities in either of the characters that would promote their affiliation with one another. They bond through a series of experiences and develop their affinity over time. So I wouldn't be too fond of them becoming lovers and soulmates halfway through their first year, but I like the idea of them becoming friends pretty early on. It'd also be nice to have Ron in there somewhere. I do think he has problems and that Hermione is a better friend than him, but I don't dislike him as a character and I enjoy stories where he's given a chance to mature or where his more comedic aspects are focused on.

I also like stories where the muggleborns have more of a voice and reference things that the rest of the students don't understand (though not to the point where the story becomes Ready Player One) in particular I liked what Stanrick did in his stories when he had Harry and Hermione make jokes would confuse Ron or the teachers.
