Is incest pairings common in first place? Even when I browse completely at random on FFN or AO3, and thus get whatever shit is currently recent, I've only ever seen a single incest story (some Draco/Narcissa thing).

I mean, I guess I could /deliberately/ go and look for them, but that doesn't exactly count. For instance, there is 2 Hily on AO3 out of 175k stories.
