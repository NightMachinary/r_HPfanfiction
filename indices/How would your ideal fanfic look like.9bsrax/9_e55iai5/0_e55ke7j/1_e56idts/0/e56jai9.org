There are quite a couple dozens with Weasley next-gen incest or Harry/Ginny/Lily Luna (you find those when you search for Harry/Ginny on Ao3). And there are some Harry harems where Lily gets included.

Then again, the only next-gen pairing I like is Rose/Lily Luna, but at least that doesn't have the issues usually found when fucking a first cousin, sibling or parent (namely inbreeding).
