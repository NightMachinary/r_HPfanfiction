It really depends on the presentation. If the relationship is shown as genuine and not just "this is so wrong - that's what makes it so hot", I wouldn't mind. Hell, I want to read a decent Harry/Lily time travel story where they meet when they both are around 16/17 and have no real attachments to each other (since she isn't his mum (dimension travel, yada yada) and Harry is like a non-creepy version of James).
