My ideal fanfic is a doozy: Harry/any multi pairing, optionally with transgender Blaise, black Hermione, and 1980!delfy (cuz voldie and Bella are too old to be normal human parents barring edge cases.) must be smutty. Again, throw in as many tropes as possible. Ron gets paired with lavender or padma. Panju can exist. Teddy is a must, and metamorphs change gender at will. I have more to say.
