I have an (only in my head, thus far) series-spanning For Want of A Nail in which Tonks spots Harry and Hagrid going into the the Leaky and ends up tagging along. Basically it would be a 7-year story in which the Tonks would end up being the adults in Harry's life rather than the Weasley's.

Somethings this story would include: 1) Andromeda is not a â€˜Dumbledore knows best' figure, in large part because she wanted the Potions Professor gig after Slughorn and she's angry he chose to protect a Death Eater rather than hire someone who actually wanted to be a teacher (and who, very much at the time could have used the protection of the castle precisely because they weren't Death Eaters.) She is also a lot less understanding of his decision to place Harry with Petunia.

2) Ron & Hermione are both still his best friends, but the Tonks become closer to the Grangers. The Tonks are also a little more encouraging of Harry's social development. In no way would that make him ruthless 12 year old politician, but he does get a little bit better handle on making friends and dealing with people. Tonks is basically his big sister and takes the role very seriously.

3) The pairing would not be Harry/Ginny because Harry doesn't go the Burrow every summer so she doesn't get the canon-exposure therapy to Harry. She's not a bad person, isn't going to potion him, she just never fully got over the crush weirdness and they don't end up getting to know each other well. I keep thinking the pairing would be Harry/Katie, but it could end up only being a school thing.

4) Sirius would survive, but would be more of an uncle figure. Remus & Tonks would not be a thing because Tonks knows how lonely & desperate Harry's childhood was so she's less understanding of Remus' issues.

5) I also have a rough idea of a Potter Place: the home of multi-generations of Potters (because spoiled James Potter didn't grow up in a cottage.) I wouldn't make it a manor house, but there would be more than a few acres. I sort of have actual house in England that I imagine it would be like (although that house is in London rather than near Stinchcombe, as the Potter's would be.) Harry would also be, with the encouragement of the Tonks, more interested in asking questions about his family. (this in all honestly could be a completely different story, as well.)

Mostly this story hasn't been written because I like world-building, but have less talent in story building and also, I'm sort of bored with Voldemort as a villain. If I did write this story, I might consider ending Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire and then switch (back) to a mystery of the year format for 5-7. (And would write GOF as more of a mystery in the vein of 1-3.)
