Well, I'm writing a story where Harry is adopted by Andromeda after the third year with Tonks becoming his big sister (role wise, they don't call each other that). It has many similar themes to what you are describing, even if Remus is not involved with Harry's life, Sirius is getting patched up by a mind healer abroad and Dumbledore isn't an moron like in far too many fics.

I toyed with the idea of starting it first year (and a Katie pairing), but neither really fitted the plot I envisioned.
