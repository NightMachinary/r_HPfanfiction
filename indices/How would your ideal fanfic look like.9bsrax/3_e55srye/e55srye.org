A 60+ chapter epic about Harry Potter the Master of Death who spends immortality getting reincarnated into different famous characters from other fandoms but keeping his magic and access to the Hallows as well as any new powers and abilities from the fandom in question.

Can either be one giant fic or multiple fics spread out by fandom.
