I don't know if it would be my ideal fic but I have an idea that I would totally love to read:

- a canon-compliant First-War fic where we get to see how Voldemort became so feared that nobody dares say his name.
- maybe starting with an ordinary family (OCs or canon dead characters?), getting attached to them, seeing how they lives despite the gradual unease that the War is causing.
- maybe this family was actually the first one to be strike down because of the Taboo...
- and thus the reader will start following other families, seeing their struggles for normalcy, for their safety... seeing how the fear is gradually gaining all Wizarding World... Seeing the Imperius Curse in action in the Minitry and the true horror of it. How people starts to be suprisingly killed/betrayed/tortured by their loved ones... How everyone will become to distrust anyone but themselves...

Well, basically, something that will make us truly understand the horror that Voldemort truly was during the First War (because, tbh, the Second War was not as impressive as what I was imagining for the First based on every adults' reactions when they talked about it in the books...)
