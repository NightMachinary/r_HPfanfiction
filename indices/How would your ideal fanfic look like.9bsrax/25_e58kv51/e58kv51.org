My one that I'm failing to progress with, basically XD

Pairings: The pairing is currently uncertain, but it won't be a harem story :') I think Harry actually deserves a nice few dates with people before meeting his future partner, unlike the complete trainwreck with Cho. I mean, maybe he'll have a trainwreck relationship, but he deserves a nice one too!

Setting: AU with many similarities to Canon. The largest difference involves the depth of magical theory. I have an almost Gaiman-esque view of magic, in a lot of ways. I want that aspect to feel more profound. I'm also aiming for more depth politically, historically and socioeconomically. Surprisingly, this is actually an area I haven't had that much trouble with.

Themes:

- Harry's personal growth. This should be the primary focus. It includes how he grows socially, psychologically and magically.
- Clash of Titans: Voldemort, Dumbledore, heavy hitters on both sides, eventually Harry.
- Magical theory!
- Exploration of history, be it Hogwarts specifically (so much to explore!), specific families or on a larger scale altogether.
- The rights of different groups in society
- A much heavier leaning in style towards British Public Schools, a la Black Luminary by Yakage.

Characterisation: I like most of the Canon characterisation where the protagonists are concerned. Major differences include Harry (coming to terms with his childhood, starting shy and growing into a hero); Dumbledore (a tired old man who is a genius academically but is sick of constantly trying to do the best he can with very limited resources); Malfoy and several of the Slytherins (I actually want them to be cunning and ambitious! Not 11yr old politicians, but people who grow into their strengths); Death Eaters (increased competence); Voldemort (increased competence and an actual agenda)... I also want to give more screen time to underused characters like Hagrid and Dobby. House elves will be nerfed, though!

Plot: the part I find most difficult. I agree with Taure about a 7 year series with heavy mystery elements. I've been using alchemical theory to theme things (I suspect JKR did something similar tbh, especially after I saw notes relating to Basilisks in the 2nd stage of the creation of a Philosopher's Stone) and to throw an alchemical bent on Harry's education. Trying to weave together the different areas I'm interested in into something cohesive is a nightmare, and my biggest hold up.

Ending: I only know this in the vaguest terms so far. And since I'm actually trying to write this, I won't reveal it here anyway! XD

In other news, I would love to see a time travel fic where the time travel has more effects than just a single jump. Like, exploring paradoxes and how magic deals with them. It's hard to pull off but the odd occasions I've seen this touched on, I've been very happy.
