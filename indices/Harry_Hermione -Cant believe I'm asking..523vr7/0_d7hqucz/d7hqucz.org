I second this request, because I agree wholeheartedly with what you are saying:

It's either Hermione being dominant (not in the BDSM sense!) in a Harry/Hermione relationship (she treats Harry quite badly for a girlfriend and implies things like he wouldn't make it without her or that he's stupid etc. etc.) or it ends up bashing her (without ever stopping...)

I mean don't get me wrong I think both would need to change a little to make them really work as a couple, but they can do it and they of course share a rather strong bond already (Harry thought talking to her was more important than his date with Cho for example!)
