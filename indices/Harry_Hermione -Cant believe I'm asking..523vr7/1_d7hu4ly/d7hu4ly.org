Well, canon Hermione is not a nice person. She is well-intentioned and compulsively helpful, but she is not nice or particularly inclined to keep quiet and keep her opinions to herself to spare anybody's feelings; and she does know a lot and likes to show it. So, yes, she's going to be at least somewhat overbearing and a bit of a know-it-all, especially if you want a Hogwarts-era fic. Otherwise, it wouldn't be Hermione.

The good news for you is that there is no shortage of fics featuring an OverPowered!Harry where Hermione is stripped of personality and agency and alternates between acting as arm candy, a cheerleader, a research assistant, and a damsel in distress.
