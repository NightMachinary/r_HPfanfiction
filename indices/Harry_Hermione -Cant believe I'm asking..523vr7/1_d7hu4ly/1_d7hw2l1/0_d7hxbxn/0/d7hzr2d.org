Well, if it helps, I can't think of a single fic that 'ships Harry and Hermione that bashes Hermione. Plenty bash pretty much everyone else, but not the OTP...

I mean, a Ron-centric fic that 'ships Harry and Hermione and bashes them could actually be pretty novel. ;)

I guess there's a more subtle form of bashing that involves Independent!Powerful!Harry condescendingly schooling AuthorityWorshiping!Hermione about Not Believing Everything She Reads or Questioning Authority (but not Harry's authority); I would view that as a form of bashing, even though it usually culminates in the best, most Harmonious marriage ever.
