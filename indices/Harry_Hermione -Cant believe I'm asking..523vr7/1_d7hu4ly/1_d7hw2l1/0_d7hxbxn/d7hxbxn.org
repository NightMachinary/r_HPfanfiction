Do you see me complaining about canon? I am talking about Harry Potter fanfictions.

Honestly I didn't know this was such an issue. Yes, I don't like overbearing Hermione. That is largely due to how writers choose to use it excessively in Hermione bashing. But I am willing to give it a chance as long as it's not unreasonable.
