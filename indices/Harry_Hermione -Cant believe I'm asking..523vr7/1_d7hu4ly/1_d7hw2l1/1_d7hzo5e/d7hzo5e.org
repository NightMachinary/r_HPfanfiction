Perhaps I should have been more clear about the intent behind my post: I actually think that Hermione with her canon flaws is an interesting character to read about, and I think that people underestimate the importance of her flaws.

Hermione's social flaws are a part of a package, one which also contains the associated virtues, particularly her drive and outspokenness. Many writers remove that whole package before 'shipping her with Harry (or Draco), leaving behind the above-mentioned personality-free arm candy / cheerleader / research assistant / damsel in distress.

Other writers remove the social flaws and their consequences, but keep the virtues, ending up in Mary Sue territory, almost as bad.

Very few manage to thread the needle, having her organically grow out of her flaws, while maintaining her virtues.

On the specific canon examples, did I not say that she was helpful? And, you're right, she does develop more empathy later in canon. However, consider that when befriending Luna, she did not withhold her opinions about Luna's zoological musings; or that lying about a troll is not an act of "niceness" at all, but rather one of ruthlessness --- the premeditated sort, of which Hermione has more than Harry, Ron, and Draco combined.
