  Well, canon Hermione is not a nice person.

Yes in every-day cases, mostly in the first few books.

But what about her lying to help her brand-new friends after the troll incident? Or encouraging Harry before he faces Quirrelmort at the end of PS? Or befriending Luna despite their polar opposite personalities? Or conjuring a wreath on the Potters' grave in Godric's Hollow?

She's initially a child like the rest of the main characters; children are still learning societal norms and filters. That being said, I'm glad she's like this instead of the perfect angel like the parent comment bemoans.

Edit: I'm not disagreeing with the statement from an /in-universe/ perspective. If I hadn't read the books and instead went to school with a girl like Hermione, then yeah I would say she isn't very nice. But as a reader, I'm privy to uncommon circumstances (troll, third floor corridor, dumbledore's army, 2^{nd} wizarding war) where we see more of her personality and get a different, out-of-universe perspective on her character.

Edit 2: As I reconsider the statement, I'm realizing my initial reaction was defensive and I suspect others will downvote the parent comment for the same reason. Book-Hermione's complex, dynamic character is a tad overshadowed by Emma Watson movie-Hermione, I think.
