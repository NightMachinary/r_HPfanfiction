Hermione's part of the trio. They solve things together, so waiting for Harry to solve problems on his own requires problems that are out of Hermione's problem-solving range---problems that require strong character---or out of her view, when Harry's alone or isolated or refusing to share the problem. Hermione generally solves the intellectual problems (though for example, she solved the Basilisk too late, allowing Harry to discover it on his own).

Taking away Hermione's character flaws tends to make her a Mary Sue---it makes her a flat character. Too many fictions make her amazing, awesome, intelligent, etc. without flaws to complete her personality. She's resourceful to the point of exhaustion, principled to the point of irritation, and brilliant to the point of unintentional arrogance.
