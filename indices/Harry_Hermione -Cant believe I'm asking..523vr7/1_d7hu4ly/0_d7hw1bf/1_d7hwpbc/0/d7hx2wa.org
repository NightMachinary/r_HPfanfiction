You are correct. It's up to the writer how he portrays her faults. Writers tend to overwhelm the readers with her faults.

In so many fanfictions she comes across as 'annoying'.

Anyways, I'm done. I just want a good fanfiction to read. She can have any qualities or flaws as long as the author doesn't make us despise her.
