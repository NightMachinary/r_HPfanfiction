I am honestly sorry that I wrote my post in the way I had. I don't want to edit it, since it's now anchoring a discussion, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/523vr7/harryhermione_cant_believe_im_asking/d7hzo5e][I've clarified (I hope) my view of such fics in the reply to your sibling post.]] I don't have any excuse except frustration with the "nicified" portrayal of Hermione in the myriad Harmony, Heron^{1} , and Dramione fic.

Thank you for your politeness.

^{1} --- I am reclaiming "Heron" as the tag for the Ron/Hermione pairing because I think it's a good tag, and I am more fond of this pairing than I used to be.
