I had fun reading that. For my sake, let's take another look at what over-bearing means. After a quick Google search: 'unpleasantly or arrogantly domineering'

You are not completely wrong though, in canon Hermione is a little over bearing and also a know-it-all. But what writers do is that they focus on these traits and amplify them unreasonably.

But what I do disagree on is the following. That for Hermione to have a personality she needs to be overbearing and know-it-all?

This is fanfiction. I am sure Hermione can still have a personality without those traits amplified unreasonably or say, even without those traits. And she could still be an amazing person. She could be intelligent without shoving it into people's faces every two minutes. Trying to 'tell' people how intelligent she is.

I came here for something different rather then the generic Hermione in the lamp. Rub it and all your problems are solved. I want to see Harry going about solving his own problems with Hermione's 'help'. I'd define what I mean by help but everyone here is smart enough.

Thank you for your reply. I tried to be as polite as I could be although this did rile me up a bit.
