So, Saving Conner is a WBWL twin fic, but it's very similar to your premise in that Harry believes that his only purpose (even more important than his own happiness or his “friends”) is to protect his twin - much of the story revolves around the development over time of his understanding of how that's problematic.

Some Lily/Dumbledore bashing. Possible James bashing, depending on how you look at it.

Also strongly bends toward Light/Dark magic trope, but in an effective, interesting way.

Overall, I thought it was decent and read the whole way through!
