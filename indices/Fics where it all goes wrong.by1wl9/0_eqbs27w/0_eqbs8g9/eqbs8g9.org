I tried to avoid "Harry gets killed", because that would be a massive enough change that you couldn't really have multiple canon events happening and all going wrong. Not that it isn't fun, but you are basically at a divergence fic at that point.

Depending on the POV character, you could reasonably have it happen in the 5th year plus and still have things pan out mostly the same, but in years 1-4 a Harry death would pretty much preempt later events.
