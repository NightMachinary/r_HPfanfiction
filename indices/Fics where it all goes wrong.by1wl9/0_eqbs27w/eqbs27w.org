1981: Voldemort stunned Lily, killed Harry, and took over Wizarding Britain a few months later. Snape was ecstatic and remained loyal.

Year 1: Hermione was killed by the Troll. Without her distracting Quirrellmort, Harry was thrown off his broom and killed. Later, Voldemort got the Stone and came back much earlier.

Year 7: Death Eaters raided the Wedding, dosed every Weasley with Veritaserum, and found out their complicity with Harry. Voldemort proceeded to torture Ginny publicly. Harry surrendered. GAME OVER.

Year 7: After the Trio was captured, Death Eaters strip searched them and dosed them with Veritaserum after a little Cruciatus. Voldemort was soon called, Ron and Hermione were killed immediately (Horcrux secret must not be leaked!), and Harry was locked behind the most secure vault under the Draught of Living Death.

Year 7: After Harry surrendered himself, Voldemort strip searched and thoroughly interrogated him. Upon identifying Harry as a Horcrux, Voldemort locked him behind the most secure vault under the Draught of Living Death. Voldemort then marches onto Hogwarts, crushed the last bit of resistance, and killed Ron/Hermione on the spot.
