That's funny. I'm actually reading that series (Sacrifices Arc) now. As far as I remember, the Author stated in an A/N that the Drarry stuff wouldn't start until Story 4 so you're safe to read stories 1-3 at least. As of chapter 18 of the third story in the series (where I am right now), there has been zero slash, just Harry and Draco friendship (which isn't even the main focus of the story).
