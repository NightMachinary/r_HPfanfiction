It wasn't how many words got used on pureblood stuff; it was the attitude all the characters had toward it, and the words that were used to describe it. Basically, the subtext gave me vague supremacist vibes. It also felt sometimes like the author was just making up more pureblood stuff as the story went on as an easy-way-out plot device. It definitely added complexity to the world but if half of it were cut out I wouldn't miss it.

Yeah, it's definitely long. It could have used another edit or three. But as far as I'm concerned, if I'm still interested it could be a billion words and not too long.

If you want to, it's pretty easy to rationalize the no lube/pain (they're kids, didn't know what they were doing the first few times, etc).

I mentally retcon stuff that bothers me in fanfic. I'd be interested to know if anyone else does this, it seems like other people probably would. Without the ability to do minor mental gymnastics I don't think I'd be able to enjoy very much fanfic, and it's relatively easy to do this for most of the problems I have with "Sacrifices".
