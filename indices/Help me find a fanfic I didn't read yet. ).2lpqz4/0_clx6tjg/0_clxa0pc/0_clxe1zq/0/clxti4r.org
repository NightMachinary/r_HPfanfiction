  Glamorization of purebloods and their "noble ways"
#+end_quote

I'm not sure it's exactly glamorization, but the books do spend a lot of time on pureblood traditions. That said, it was pretty obvious that the author ignored them unless it was convenient. For instance, clothing color choices and their interpretations came up about four times in the two million word story -- less than I would expect; Harry doesn't bother thinking about what image his clothes project when seeking allies, which is a glaring mistake. And there are a lot of complexities that would take bloody ages to learn; the more intricate of them that are uncommon would naturally be elided.

  LONG AND COMPLETE, Merlin be praised

There's long, and then there's drudgery. Make it through book six and then realize you're barely two thirds of the way through the series, /then/ tell me it's a good thing.

  You can safely skip the sex scenes if you ever get that far, but I read them and I didn't drop dead of horror or anything.

One part made me cringe, actually. Anal sex without lube and without building up to it. These things take time and practice. And lube. Never forget the lube. Unless you want a world of pain.

Pain during sex is not good. Yet story after story claims it's normal for the first time.
