It's a story with very definite strengths and weaknesses. It's been a while since I read it, so the stuff I remember best is the stuff that bothered me about it, such as:

- Harry is a Mary Sue, the further you get the more Sue he is
- General abundance of overpowered Sue characters
- A LOT of internal dialogue about feelings, gets repetitive
- Too much feelings-magic
- Frustrating morality
- Glamorization of purebloods and their "noble ways"
- A lot of canon characters have significantly different personalities
- Plotted before Deathly Hallows was published, so canon stuff revealed in Deathly Hallows never happened

HOWEVER. I am rereading it right now (halfway through second book), so I obviously liked it despite its flaws. A lot of the stuff that bothered me isn't as annoying on a second reread. Some of the positives:

- LONG AND COMPLETE, Merlin be praised
- Good grammar and sentence structure, despite occasional repetitiveness
- Nice, complicated plot (although I didn't examine closely for holes)
- You get very attached to the characters despite their deviations from canon
- You can count on at least one scene with huge emotional impact per book (possibly excluding the first one)
- People die, sometimes people you hate, sometimes people you love
- Justice, for the most part, eventually gets served, and it's incredibly satisfying
- Harry might be OP, but Voldemort is at an appropriately adjusted power level
- Voldemort is more horrific than he ever was in canon
- Complex, flexible magic system (YMMV on whether this is good or bad, I personally liked it)

The Harry/Draco doesn't get much in the way. I don't like canon Draco either, but he starts out with a slightly different personality due to the universe's differences, and continues to diverge more and more from canon. You can safely skip the sex scenes if you ever get that far, but I read them and I didn't drop dead of horror or anything.

Overall, I think it is worth it for you to read at least the first two, then quit if you don't like either of them at all. "Saving Connor", the first one, is widely regarded as the worst of the seven parts, but you have to read it for context for the rest of them, and it's not actually that bad. "No Mouth But Some Serpent's", the second one, is still not the strongest but it is /much/ better, I don't want to spoil too much but there's a one liner in it that still makes me tear up when I remember it.
