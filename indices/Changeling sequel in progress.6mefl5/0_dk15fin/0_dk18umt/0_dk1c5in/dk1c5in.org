Hate to say it since overall the story was great, but I agree. Much like the actual Harry Potter epilogue skipped over some really juicy storylines, so do The Changeling. Bringing it back to Harry and Ginny, it left me really confused as to the nature of their relationship, especially considering she definitively got them together in the chapter before.
