I agree H/G is a relatively small part of the story. I guess the way I read it, annerb was building them up, with the culmination of them actually getting together. I think this is an important development in Ginny's story. Up until then there is this difficult divide between Ginny and her family, as well as the people we as fans of Harry Potter have long identified with in part because the story is so Gryyindor-centric. She is a Slytherin, and perhaps even her efforts in the war don't truly change this dynamic. But being with Harry could have implications beyond just being with him.

As far as the epilogue's references to them fitting/not fitting with the story, you are right that it is just a minor reference and that does fit. My point is simply that it was left ambiguous as to what they are. Considering that Harry is a small but important part to the overall story, and them getting together can be viewed as part of the climax of the story, it was a little too ambiguous.

And just confusing. He goes off with Ron and Hermione to find the Grangers, and Ginny says that she might actually believe he will come back. Is this really expected to be an adventure he wouldn't come back from? It just confused me is all.
