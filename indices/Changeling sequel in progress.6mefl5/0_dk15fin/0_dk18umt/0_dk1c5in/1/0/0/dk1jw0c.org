I guess here's the thing, you see they getting together as part of the culmination/climax of the story, and I see it as an almost irrelevant sidecar to the story.

And please understand I'm a H/G shipper and am not saying that because I'm not interested in that, I'm saying that because I just didn't really feel like any meaningful part of the story was annerb building that relationship up.

Either way, irrelevant quibbles. I agree it's left ambiguous but I actually prefer that know that we know there's a sequel coming. More fertile ground for exploration :)
