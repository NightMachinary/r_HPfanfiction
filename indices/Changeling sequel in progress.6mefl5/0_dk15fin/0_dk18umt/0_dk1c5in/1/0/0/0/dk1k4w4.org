I half agree with you regarding its relevance compared to the bigger themes going on. I do think it is relevant and an important part of her development. Ginny's relationship with the other boy was mostly irrelevant, but I have to imagine her thing with Harry is more important. I always saw the Changeling partly as a re-tell of the original series, but from her POV and with her in Slytherin. Based on this, the relationship with Harry /is/ important. But like the original series, it was brought to light very late in the overall story and took a back seat to the bigger story at hand.

But my big point as it relates to the sequel is I think, now that the war is over, that their relationship would take a much larger role in a potential story. Much like, if Rowling chose to write something set right after the battle, then the relationship would play a much larger role.
