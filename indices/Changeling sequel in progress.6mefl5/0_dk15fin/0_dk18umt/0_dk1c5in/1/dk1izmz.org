I'll argue the other side of this, which Tinyozora is also arguing below. Nothing in the epilogue left me at all confused about the relationship, honestly - fit with the story as far as I'm concerned. It's not a H/G fic at all. Yes, that relationship exists in the story, but it's not just a lesser part; it's really not particularly relevant at all. They haven't really /built/ a relationship yet in the way that H/G fics normally do. Based on the description, feels like that's what this is about - which thrills me because Changeling Ginny's relationship with Harry was barely explored in the fic.

  I could absolutely see Annerb breaking them up in some awful angsty way and just never getting them back together.

Knowing annerb's other writing I would be really surprised if this comes to pass... Always a possibility, I guess.
