As someone who is a fan of both H/G fics and the Changeling, I'm both really excited and nervous for this sequel. The Changeling was fantastic, but the epilogue's brief mention of the pair as a couple left me worried that the sequel would really put them through the ringer. I could absolutely see Annerb breaking them up in some awful angsty way and just never getting them back together.
