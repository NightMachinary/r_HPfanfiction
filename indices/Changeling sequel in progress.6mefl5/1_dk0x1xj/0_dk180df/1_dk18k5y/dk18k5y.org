Sure. So it starts off right at her sorting and she gets popped into Slytherin. And the way it starts out, it's really shorter, a more concise story with little detail. I think the author was just fleshing out this basic idea of Ginny in Slytherin, so there is not a lot of detail for her Year One, which is obviously a huge year because of the Diary. Starting in her second year, it really fleshes out her relationships with her fellow housemates, how being in Slytherin has certainly affected her relationship with her family, especially Ron. As predicted, she's a bit of an outsider to her house because she's a Weasley and to the rest of the school because she's a Slytherin. It keeps going like that and the largest part of the story is her Sixth Year, which is broken out into 5 big chapters.

Don't want to ruin too much but it's just a much different Ginny, and it does a good job highlighting how Ginny would grow up to be different if she had been put into Slytherin, and also how her being in Slytherin would affect the others in the story.

Edit: and I just love the detail it goes into regarding how the Slytherin house operates and its traditions and how its members view themselves.
