It can be tempting to open with dialogue, but the most effective openers involve description & setting the scene - but something must be happening. Think about the tone of your story and establish interest early on. I think a good example is the opening of HBP.

So, you might want to open with a character walking through Harlem at night, or maybe waiting to meet someone? It's a good way to establish the description of the main character without them having to do something trite like looking in a mirror. So (bearing in mind I have no idea what Harlem looks like now, let alone the 80s) you might say something like 'The towering buildings loomed over the darkened streets. Under a flickering street light, a brooding young man smoked a cigarette, lounging against a wall but still glancing suspiciously with cold grey eyes.'
