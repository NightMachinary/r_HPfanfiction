Here are my two tips for the start of stories.

- Read the first chapter of the books you love the most, and see what they do to introduce characters. Then, do the same thing.
- Write chapter 2 or 3 first. Start writing after the beginning of your story, imagining the main character's been introduced in a prior chapter. Then, see what context you need for what you've written, and craft a first chapter to deliver that.

I'd also recommend reading (if you haven't already) /The Thief/ by Meghan Whalen Turner, /The Demon King/ by Cinda Williams Chima, and /Sandry's Book/ by Tamora Pierce, which deliver my three favorite street-rat characters in fiction.

Verrrry excited about your idea. Good luck writing! PM me when it's out if you can :)
