It might help to think about this sideways---what /purpose/ do you want Harlem to serve here, especially since it sounds like the UK is where most of the story will take place?

From what I can tell it sounds like you want it as contrast---here's how my protagonist grew up, as opposed to your average rich British wizard. So build your Harlem as a foil to him. How has it shaped him? What has it prepared him for that his friends in England couldn't possibly understand? And what will /he/ not understand about Wizarding Britain?

You can probably show us how it shaped him in one scene---we don't even need to see Sirius, or know he's a Black. We just need to see a pickpocket with a knack for finding different trouble than the other pickpockets. Every time he behaves differently from a wizard with a different pedigree we'll notice, and it'll build his character up as an individual.
