First- I think this is an intriguing question, so I have no idea why you were downvoted.

What you've given us is a bit vague, so the advice is equally generalized.

The opening is meant to capture the reader's attention. It establishes the starting situation for at least one of the main focus characters. It also can be used to identify major themes in the story. For that reason alone, it's best to start with a scene that fits with where you're taking a story. If the opener is a high-tension moody action sequence, people will expect more of the same and be a bit put out if the next few chapters is ho-hum exposition and sitting in classrooms being passingly funny.

Hope that helps. If you need more specific help, you'll need to be more specific about your concerns.
