You know, I think I've read more fanfics where Harry ended up killed by the Dursley's abuse and neglect than fanfics where he kills the Dursleys. In fact, I don't think I've read /any/ fanfiction where Harry actually kills the Dursley, but then I avoid Dark!Harry fanfics, where that is most likely to happen.

I've seen a few where they wound up dead either through their own actions, or from someone trying to get at Harry, but I've never actually read any where Harry was directly responsible, that I can remember.
