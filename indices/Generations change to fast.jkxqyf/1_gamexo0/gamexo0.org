I think the movies are to blame for a lot of that. A lot of the adult cast were way too old for the character they played (Snape, Sirius, Harry's parents, etc.), and even more so if they were supposed to age better than muggles. Or, for example, Slughorn is a lot closer in age to Dumbledore than, say, McGonagall (at least before the later retcon), but he looks younger than her.

And with the movies came of lot of new canon on the Black family, like the expanded Black family tree, that made little sense. Some of it is JKR being bad at math. And whoever made the props for the movie didn't question the very short lifespans and the inconsistency with the book!canon.

And you're right, with (at least some) wizards marrying young, we should still see a lot more great-great-grandparents around. That's also probably the kind of slow-moving old wise-/ish/ people that should be on the Wizengamot, not some 20-something "Lord"...
