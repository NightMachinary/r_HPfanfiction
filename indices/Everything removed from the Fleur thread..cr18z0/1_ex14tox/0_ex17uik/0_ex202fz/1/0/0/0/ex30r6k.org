I don't see it that way.

Instead, I see what you describe as a way for someone to state things that can't questioned in that thread, and it's unreasonable to question things, not when they arise, but on other occasions.

That kind of treatment is less of a personal attack than making a separate post to discuss the disagreement. Furthermore, the disagreement may be so small that doing so is unreasonable.
