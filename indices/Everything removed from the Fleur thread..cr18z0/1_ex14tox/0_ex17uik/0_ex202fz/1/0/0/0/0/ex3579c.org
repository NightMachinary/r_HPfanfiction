  and it's unreasonable to question things, not when they arise, but on other occasions.

Why do you think that's unreasonable? It's worked well in the past on this sub.

There have been numerous cases where people on this sub disagreed with common plot elements that get brought up in request threads, so they made a discussion thread that turned into a lively back-and-forth conversation. Just as an example, I remember a great discussion post about double standards relating to Hermione. Another discussion post was all about what disgusts people about mpreg. Sometimes people make discussion posts about what's wrong with manipulative!Dumbledore or politician Slytherin kids.

This is why it's strange to complain that the existing system is unreasonable. It works very well (and the whole sub benefits from the lively participation) when people follow it.

Regarding disagreements/questions being too small for a separate post, that point also falls a little flat in the face of the examples we have to look at. Clearly the discussion in the Fluer request post was large enough with enough community interest that it could have been its own post. The anti-mpreg discussion post started on a disagreement as simple/small as "I think mpreg is gross".

The point is, any question or disagreement can be worthy of its own discussion post if you put the effort into expressing your thoughts clearly and persuasively. There's no need to derail someone's request post when you could reach the broader sub of the community with your own post.
