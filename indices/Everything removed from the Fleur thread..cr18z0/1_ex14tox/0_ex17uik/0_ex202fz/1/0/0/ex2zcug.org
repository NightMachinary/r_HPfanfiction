Following common forum etiquette and rule 9 does not prevent anyone from 'questioning'.

Everyone has the freedom to create their own posts to explore the topics that interest them. Thus, the common forum etiquete guideline to not hijack a post is not a restriction on free speech. If anything, such guidelines increase the health of the community by encouraging OPs to post a range of ideas.
