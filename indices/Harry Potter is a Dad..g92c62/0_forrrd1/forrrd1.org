I can't recommend Grow Young With Me more than any other suggestion. It is really an amazing story. Now, this is my favorite trope so I have a few. I wish there was more though

The Little Child to Lead Him - linkffn(3123443) - As a bonus it does go into Haphne but only really at the end.

The Drive in Being Alive - linkffn(13188485) - Is also a Haphne story, but does involve Ginny.

A Baby Wizard and his Cousin - linkffn(1949002) - A Harmony story and pretty decent

Betrayed - linkffn(1291535) - Is another story of Harry/OC, it is a very interesting story and does center on Harry being a father.

Black coffee, with sugar - linkffn(12414949) - Is another Haphne story with Harry being a father.

Harry Potter and the Greatest Gift - linkffn(7969757) - I don't remember the pairing for this one nor does it directly says. But I don't believe its Ginny at least.

An Adoption - linkffn(12823890) - An incomplete Harmony story but was well done until the author left it.

Adopted - linkffn(5813363) - Here is a complete Harmony story that I thought was good.

Found - linkffn(5573547) - By the same author as Adopted, an older story of theirs. Still Harmony.

Delicate - linkffn(2926255) - Another Harmony, and Harry becomes a father a little later on in the story but it does happen.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - My utmost favorite story that has Harry acting becoming a father figure for a young girl. It's short but really well done.

And that is my list of stories that have some focus on Harry being a father. Glad to finally make it a list.
