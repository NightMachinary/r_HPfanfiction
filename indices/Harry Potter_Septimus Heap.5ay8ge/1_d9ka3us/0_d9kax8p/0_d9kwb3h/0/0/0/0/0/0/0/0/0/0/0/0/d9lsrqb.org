Ah, I see. You could just not write it. Start on the second chapter or so and then go back and write it later.

One thing you could do, which I've seen a lot and I think works well enough, is to pick up directly where one of the books left off. So instead of starting a new story, you're just writing a continuation of the books, but obviously everything is AU from there. Then you could slip in changes to the timeline/magic system as recollections of a sort. linkffn(The Never-ending Road), controversial for it's pairing even though in the entire first book there isn't really any romance at all, does this especially well. It starts off second year, but with an alternate timeline, and sort of goes through the changes fairly organically as characters' thoughts and musings. It reads very cleanly.
