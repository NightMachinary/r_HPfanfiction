I was thinking maybe have it a common thing, but have many of the spells "lost".

Like, we can replace conjuring with materializing, replace legilimency with reading... we can even replace Voldemort's flight spell with him uncovering the flight charm.

But, like, have more than half of the spells lost. Harry could uncover them, and that would be how him and Voldy fight it out- testing either others knowledge of the Septimus Heap spells.

The only question now would be how he uncovers the knowledge.
