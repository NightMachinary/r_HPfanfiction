Ah, that would be awesome. Easy sources of knowledge include hidden areas in Hogwarts, or the Black library. One thing that might be cool is maybe Harry helps someone/befriends someone (like an old witch or something along those lines) and in return they teach him a little, and maybe he goes from there. Or maybe she teaches him a trick to creating spells/combining spells into new spells. So that Harry wouldn't be responsible for finding all the old spells, but rediscovering them.
