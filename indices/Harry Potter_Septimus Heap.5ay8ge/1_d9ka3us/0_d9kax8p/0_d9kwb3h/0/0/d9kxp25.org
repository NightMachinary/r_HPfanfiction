Which universe do you want to use as the setting? Although, actually, I think a blending would be cool. Have you read the Pureblood Pretense? One of the things the author did was sort of cast HP characters in the Song of the Lioness roles, which I thought read really well. So it really felt like the Song of the Lioness quartet, while being primarily an HP fan fiction.

Oh, I just realized you were talking about the magic system in particular, whoops. You could make it common in the HP universe, just not in the UK, or maybe uncommon but can be found. So Harry's using old-fashioned magic or something.

I'm probably going to reread the books soon, since the first time I read them I think there were only three or four.
