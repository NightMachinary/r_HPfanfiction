My ranking (and the great majority people here):

7 Books

Pottermore

JKR Tweets

FB Movies

the 8 Movies

Far more people here consider Pottermore canon than the 8 Movies. Remember, Harry fixed his Phoenix wand with the Elder Wand, Voldemort never disintegrated into Confettis, and Ginny would never tie shoes for Harry! Also please remember, Ron vigorously defended Hermione against Snape's insult, Ron stood up to Sirius Black on a broken leg, and it wasn't Ron who panicked in Devil Snare's pit.

Less than 5% people here consider CC canon. I was more lenient toward it until JKR emphasized it was all written by Jack Thorne in an interview.
