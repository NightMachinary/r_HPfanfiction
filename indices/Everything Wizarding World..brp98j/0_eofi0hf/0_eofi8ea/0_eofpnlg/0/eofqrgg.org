I don't care if the movies does things differently from the books. It is the filmmakers interpetation of the source material, no one else. It's nothing worth getting upset over.

My Immortal is the only fanfic that will ever matter. It is a classic like no other. It is the Star Wars Christmas Special of HP. You wouldn't want it to be any different.

I personally don't like the first Fantastic Beasts movie but I wouldn't want it any different. It was to me what The Phantom Menace was to many Star Wars fans. You need weaker parts to appericate the better ones.

Although Crimes of Grindelwald maybe takes some things to far to be acceptable.
