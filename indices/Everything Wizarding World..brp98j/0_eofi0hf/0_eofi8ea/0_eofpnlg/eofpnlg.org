I find it interesting that you list "My Immortal" as part of the franchise. Why?

Shouldn't the general category of fanfics be counted as well?

Shouldn't the many high traffic websites such [[http://www.mugglenet.com/][mugglenet]] and [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/][leaky-cauldron]] be more respected than "My Immortal"?

There are also many great Fan Art sites:

In fact, these Fan Art sites are doing a far better job in depicting Book characters than the 8 movies. For me, Daniel Radcliffe DOES NOT look like Harry Potter, as Dan does not have messy black hairs and his mother's eyes (plot critical!), and is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9j2wmu/harry_with_his_girls/][too short]].

Of course, there are the amusement parks, the merchandises, and sites like [[http://www.sedbona.com/2017/03/london-platform-9-34/][Platform 9 3/4]].
