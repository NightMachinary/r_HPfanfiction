The narrative coddled her in canon (that thread from a few months back said it perfectly).

Fanon flip flops from Hermione is smarter than Dumbledore, is getting PhD's, and is apparently more beautiful than a Veela to she's stealing Harry's money, reporting everything Dumbledore, and doesn't understand Pure-Blood culture.

I actually don't mind her canon personality so much (movie Hermione sucks though). It's just that she doesn't really grow like the other characters and therefore sounds hypocritical and frankly grating.

I would be an acquaintance at best with someone exactly like her in real life. Part of the reason I dislike cursed child (Apart from Rowling not writing it, bad characterization, and awful plot/plotholes. People can hate, but she's a fantastic writer.) was that it made her minister.
