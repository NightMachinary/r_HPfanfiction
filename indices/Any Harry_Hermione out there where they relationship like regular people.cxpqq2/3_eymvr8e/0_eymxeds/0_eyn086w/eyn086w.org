Tbh, I've responded to this question several times, and its tiresome. Its mostly because her personality, both in canon and in most of fanon, really grinds my gears. There's a lot more into it than just that, but that's pretty much it.

Canon, her personality clashes with mine, I dislike how she acts and speaks.

Fanon, I hate both when they bash her and make "stupid mudblood that doesn't know traditions" and when she's Aphrodites incarned. The only fanonHermione's I enjoy or can stomach are when she's a really good friend, and just that. I love fics with trio friendship, but mostly when she's a side character, like in Grow Young with Me or Eclipse of the Sky.
