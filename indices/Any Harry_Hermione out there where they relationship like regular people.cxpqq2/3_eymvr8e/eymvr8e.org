This made me giggle. Sorry I don't have any suggestions, but I hate Hermione with a passion of a thousand suns, and the only few fics I've enjoyed with this pairing, romance wasn't a factor at all. In fact, probably one of the most enjoyable Hermione's I've read that is a main character is from Stages of Hope, but there's no official pairing, even if its alluded to. If you enjoy disaster fics and don't mind crossover(though, you really don't need any knowledge about that fandom) check Invincible by Darth Mars, its a BattleStar Galactica xover and its fantastic, with a side dish of H/Hr.
