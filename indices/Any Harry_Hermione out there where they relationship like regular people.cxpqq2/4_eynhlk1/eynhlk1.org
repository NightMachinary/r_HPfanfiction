Hi, there was a Harmony fanfiction site called portkey that unfortunately closed down a while ago (it was like heaven for a Harmony shipper) but there is an archive site of it in which you can find thousands of well-written Harmony fanfics. Just type portkey archive and use the search segment. My favourite author is Bingblot, it's a good place to start. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/200]]

As a passionate Harmony shipper, I know the struggles of finding a well-written Harmony fanfic nowadays. Hope you can find what you are looking for and enjoy this ship as much as I do!

Ps. I don't know if you'll enjoy them but I also write Harmony stories that focus on their relationship. However I must warn you that how they trust and support each other are mentioned a few times as they are the fundamentals of a strong relationship :D
