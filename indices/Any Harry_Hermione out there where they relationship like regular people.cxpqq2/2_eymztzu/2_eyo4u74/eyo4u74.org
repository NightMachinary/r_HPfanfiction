linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs) is one of the most famous of these, and the first few chapters are actually nice, but then it turns really weird (“Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.” ... yup) and both Harry and Ginny turn into those superhumans, ... whatever. The latter part of the story is sore disappointment.
