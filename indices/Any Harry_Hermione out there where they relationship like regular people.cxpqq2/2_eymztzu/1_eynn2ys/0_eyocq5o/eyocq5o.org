It's a shame because I think Robst has the potential to be a very good writer if he actually steps out of his comfort zone. All his stories have so many things in common (Harmony pairing, goblins are good, overly eager to help Harry and have the answer to almost every single problem, Ron/Ginny/Molly/Albus are bad etc.) that there's really no point in reading more than one. Harry Crow was the first story I actually quit because I got sick of it somewhere around Chapter 30 and there were another 70 to go.
