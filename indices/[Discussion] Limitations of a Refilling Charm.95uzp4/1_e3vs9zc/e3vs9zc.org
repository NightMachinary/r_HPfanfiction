Well that's interesting because what exactly does a filling charm do? If you can't conjure nor transfigure food why does this charm even work in the books? If it works could you duplicate food? Isn't duplication some sort of conjuration?

In my opinion this charm is a nonsense. The best it should be is to temporarily make a fake copy of what was there before as a conjuration before vanishing after a time.

In reality even conjuration is strange. Can you conjure without a time limit or does it depend of the wizard strength? Maybe there is some kind of dimension where a reserve of energy and matter exist and you can conjure things using matter from there and vanishing put it back there?

The way I see it, transfiguration could be hold a long time if using lot of power or maybe using runes or ritual to make it using ambient magic or I don't know what. Conjuration would be even harder if not impossible to sustain without limit. The reason why I think you can't conjure or transfigure food is because it would ultimately disappear or revert to its original form which would be a problem. As for Aguamenti I see it as either a summoning of water somewhere or better, a humidity compressor which makes water, maybe duplicate it if needing a lot of it but maybe a bunch would disappear over time.

In the end the problem with magic is the limitation and logic behind it and the system its author created. JKR didn't seem to think this really thoroughly. Following this idea I usually prefer fanon magical system or in other books, the Inheritance Cycle magical system. As for transmutation, FMA makes sense.
